<text>A pun, also known as a paronomasia in the context of linguistics, is a form of word play that exploits multiple meanings of a term, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language. A pun differs from a malapropism in that a malapropism is an incorrect variation on a correct expression, while a pun involves expressions with multiple (correct or fairly reasonable) interpretations. Puns may be regarded as in-jokes or idiomatic constructions, especially as their usage and meaning are usually specific to a particular language or its culture.

Puns have a long history in writing. For example, the Roman playwright Plautus was famous for his puns and word games.

== Types of puns ==

===Homophonic===
A homophonic pun is one that uses word pairs which sound alike (homophones) but are not synonymous. Walter Redfern summarized this type with his statement, &quot;To pun is to treat homonyms as synonyms.&quot; For example, in George Carlin&#x27;s phrase &quot;atheism is a non-prophet institution&quot;, the word &quot;prophet&quot; is put in place of its homophone &quot;&quot;, altering the common phrase &quot;non-profit institution&quot;. Similarly, the joke &quot;Question: Why do we still have troops in Germany? Answer: To keep the Russians in Czech&quot; relies on the aural ambiguity of the homophones &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Often, puns are not strictly homophonic, but play on words of similar, not identical, sound as in the example from the &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; cartoon film series: &quot;I think so, Brain, but if we give peas a chance, won&#x27;t the lima beans feel left out?&quot; which plays with the similar—but not identical—sound of &quot;peas&quot; and &quot;peace&quot; in the anti-war slogan &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

===Homographic===
A &quot;homographic&quot; pun exploits words that are spelled the same (homographs) but possess different meanings and sounds. Because of their origin, they rely on sight more than hearing, contrary to homophonic puns. They are also known as &quot;heteronymic puns&quot;. Examples in which the punned words typically exist in two different parts of speech often rely on unusual sentence construction, as in the anecdote: &quot;When asked to explain his large number of children, the pig answered simply: &#x27;The wild oats of my sow gave us many piglets. An example that combines homophonic and homographic punning is Douglas Adams&#x27;s line &quot;You can tune a guitar, but you can&#x27;t tuna fish. Unless of course, you play bass.&quot; The phrase uses the homophonic qualities of &quot;tune a&quot; and &quot;tuna&quot;, as well as the homographic pun on &quot;bass&quot;, in which ambiguity is reached through the identical spellings of (a string instrument), and (a kind of fish). Homographic puns do not necessarily need to follow grammatical rules and often do not make sense when interpreted outside the context of the pun.

===Homonymic===
&quot;Homonymic&quot; puns, another common type, arise from the exploitation of words that are both homographs and homophones. The statement &quot;Being in politics is just like playing golf: you are trapped in one bad lie after another&quot; puns on the two meanings of the word &quot;lie&quot; as &quot;a deliberate untruth&quot; and as &quot;the position in which something rests&quot;. An adaptation of a joke repeated by Isaac Asimov gives us &quot;Did you hear about the little moron who strained himself while running into the screen door?&quot; playing on &quot;strained&quot; as &quot;to give much effort&quot; and &quot;to filter&quot;. A homonymic pun may also be polysemic, in which the words must be homonymic and also possess related meanings, a condition that is often subjective. However, lexicographers define polysemes as listed under a single dictionary lemma (a unique numbered meaning) while homonyms are treated in separate lemmata.

===Compounded===
A compound pun is a statement that contains two or more puns. In this case, the wordplay cannot go into effect by utilizing the separate words or phrases of the puns that make up the entire statement. For example, a complex statement by Richard Whately includes four puns: &quot;Why can a man never starve in the Great Desert? Because he can eat the sand which is there. But what brought the sandwiches there? Why, Noah sent Ham, and his descendants mustered and bred.&quot; This pun uses &quot;sand which is there/sandwiches there&quot;, &quot;Ham/ham&quot;, &quot;mustered/mustard&quot;, and &quot;bred/bread&quot;. Similarly, the phrase &quot;piano is not my forte&quot; links two meanings of the words &quot;forte&quot; and &quot;piano&quot;, one for the dynamic markings in music and the second for the literal meaning of the sentence, as well as alluding to &quot;pianoforte&quot;, the older name of the instrument. Compound puns may also combine two phrases that share a word. For example, &quot;Where do mathematicians go on weekends? To a Möbius strip club!&quot; puns on the terms &quot;Möbius strip&quot; and &quot;strip club&quot;.

===Recursive===
A recursive pun is one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first. For example, the statement &quot;π is only half a pie&quot; (π radians is 180 degrees, or half a circle, and a pie is a complete circle). Another example is &quot;Infinity is not in finity&quot;, which means infinity is not in finite range. Another example is &quot;a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother&quot;. The recursive pun &quot;Immanuel doesn&#x27;t pun, he Kant&quot; is attributed to Oscar Wilde.

===Visual===
Visual puns are sometimes used in logos, emblems, insignia, and other graphic symbols, in which one or more of the pun aspects is replaced by a picture. In European heraldry, this technique is called canting arms. Visual and other puns and word games are also common in Dutch gable stones as well as in some cartoons, such as &quot;Lost Consonants&quot; and &quot;The Far Side&quot;. Another type of visual pun exists in languages that use non-phonetic writing. For example, in Chinese, a pun may be based on a similarity in shape of the written character, despite a complete lack of phonetic similarity in the words punned upon. Mark Elvin describes how this &quot;peculiarly Chinese form of visual punning involved comparing written characters to objects.&quot;

Visual puns on the bearer&#x27;s name are used extensively as forms of heraldic expression, they are called canting arms. They have been used for centuries across Europe and have even been used recently by members of the British royal family, such as on the arms of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and of Princess Beatrice of York. The arms of U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower are also canting. In the context of non-phonetic texts, 4 Pics 1 Word, is an example of visual paronomasia where the players are supposed to identify the word in common from the set of four images.

===Paronomastic===
Paronomasia is the formal term for punning, playing with words to create humorous or rhetorical effect. Paronomastic puns often manipulate well-known idioms, proverbs, or phrases to deliver a punned twist. The classic structure of a joke, with a setup leading to a punchline, is a common format for paronomastic puns, where the punchline alters the expected phrase in a way that plays on multiple meanings of a word. For instance, in the sentence, &quot;I used to be a baker, but I couldn&#x27;t make enough dough,&quot; the word &quot;dough&quot; is used paronomastically to refer both to the substance used to make bread and to slang for money.

This type of pun is frequently used in advertisements, comedy, and literature to provide a clever and memorable message. One notable example comes from an advertising slogan for a moving company: &quot;We don&#x27;t charge an arm and a leg. We want your tows.&quot; Here, the familiar phrase &quot;an arm and a leg&quot; is paronomastically punned upon with &quot;tows,&quot; playing on the phonetic similarity to &quot;toes&quot; while referring to the company&#x27;s service of towing belongings.

===Metonymic===
Metonymic puns exploit the metonymic relationship between words – where a word or phrase is used to represent something it&#x27;s closely associated with. In such puns, one term is substituted for another term with which it&#x27;s closely linked by a concept or idea. The humor or wit of the pun often comes from the unexpected yet apt connection made between the two concepts.

For instance, consider a hypothetical news headline: &quot;The White House loses its balance.&quot; In this case, &quot;The White House&quot; is used metonymically to represent the U.S. government, and &quot;balance&quot; could be interpreted both as physical stability (as if the building itself is tipping over) or fiscal balance (as in the budget), thereby creating a pun.

While metonymic puns may not be as widely recognized as a specific category of pun, they represent a sophisticated linguistic tool that can bring an additional layer of nuance to wordplay.

===Sylleptic/heteronymic===
Syllepsis, or heteronymy, is a form of punning where a single word simultaneously affects the rest of the sentence, while it changes the meaning of the idiom it is used in. This form of punning uses the word in its literal and metaphorical senses at once, creating a surprising and often humorous effect.

An example of a sylleptic pun is in the sentence, &quot;She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage, her eyes and his hopes.&quot; In this case, &quot;raising&quot; applies in different ways to each of the items listed, creating a series of linked puns. This type of punning can often be seen in literature, particularly in works that play extensively with language. (She razed his self-esteem in how she raised the children.)

Notable practitioners of the sylleptic pun include authors such as P. G. Wodehouse, who once wrote, &quot;If not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled,&quot; playing on the dichotomy of &quot;disgruntled&quot; and &quot;gruntled,&quot; where the latter is not typically used.

===Antanaclasistic===
Antanaclasis is a type of pun where a single word or phrase is repeated, but the meaning changes each time. The humor or wit derives from the surprising shift in meaning of a familiar word or phrase. This form of punning often relies on homophones, homonyms, or simply the contextual flexibility of a word or phrase.

A classic example is Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s statement, &quot;We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.&quot; In this quote, the word &quot;hang&quot; is first used to mean &quot;stay&quot; or &quot;work together,&quot; but then, it is repeated with the meaning &quot;be executed.&quot;

This punning style is prevalent in both humorous and serious contexts, adding layers of complexity to the language by highlighting the multifaceted nature of words. Such puns are frequently used in literature, speeches, and advertising to deliver memorable and impactful lines.

===Other===
Richard J. Alexander notes two additional forms that puns may take: graphological (sometimes called visual) puns, such as concrete poetry; and morphological puns, such as portmanteaux. Morphological puns may make use of rebracketing, where for instance &quot;distressed&quot; is parsed as &quot;dis-tressed&quot; (having hair cut off), or in the self-referential pun &quot;I entered ten puns in a pun competition hoping one would win, but no pun in ten did&quot; (parsed as &quot;no pun intended&quot;).

== Use ==

===Comedy and jokes===
Puns are a common source of humour in jokes and comedy shows. They are often used in the punch line of a joke, where they typically give a humorous meaning to a rather perplexing story. These are also known as feghoots. The following example comes from the movie &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, though the punchline stems from far older Vaudeville roots. The final line puns on the stock phrase &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;. After Aubrey offers his pun (to the enjoyment of many), Dr. Maturin shows a disdain for the craft with his reply, &quot;One who would pun would pick-a-pocket.&quot;

Not infrequently, puns are used in the titles of comedic parodies. A parody of a popular song, movie, etc., may be given a title that hints at the title of the work being parodied, replacing some of the words with ones that sound or look similar. For example, collegiate a cappella groups are often named after musical puns to attract fans through attempts at humor. Such a title can immediately communicate both that what follows is a parody and also that work is about to be parodied, making any further &quot;setup&quot; (introductory explanation) unnecessary.

====Books never written====

Sometimes called &quot;books never written&quot; or &quot;world&#x27;s greatest books&quot;, these are jokes that consist of fictitious book titles with authors&#x27; names that contain a pun relating to the title. Perhaps the best-known example is: &quot;&quot;Tragedy on the Cliff&quot; by Eileen Dover&quot;, which according to one source was devised by humourist Peter De Vries. It is common for these puns to refer to taboo subject matter, such as &quot;&quot;What Boys Love&quot; by E. Norma Stitts&quot;.

Pun competitions

2014 saw the inaugural UK Pun Championships, at the Leicester Comedy Festival, hosted by Lee Nelson. The winner was Darren Walsh. Walsh went on to take part in the O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Austin, Texas. In 2015 the UK Pun Champion was Leo Kearse. Other pun competitions include Minnesota’s Pundamonium, Orlando Punslingers, the Almost Annual Pun-Off in Eureka, and Brooklyn’s Punderdome, led by Jo Firestone and her father, Fred Firestone. In &quot;Away with Words: An Irreverent Tour Through the World of Pun Competitions,&quot; Joe Berkowitz deems Austin&#x27;s O. Henry Pun-Off the &quot;Olympics&quot; of pun competitions, and Brooklyn&#x27;s Punderdome the &quot;X Games&quot;. GQ described the crowd at Brooklyn&#x27;s Punderdome as &quot;passionate, to a level that feels dangerous&quot;.

===Literature===
Non-humorous puns were and are a standard poetic device in English literature. Puns and other forms of wordplay have been used by many famous writers, such as Alexander Pope, James Joyce, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Bloch, Lewis Carroll, John Donne, and William Shakespeare.

In the poem &quot;A Hymn to God the Father&quot;, John Donne, whose wife&#x27;s name was Anne More, puns repeatedly: &quot;Son/sun&quot; in the second quoted line, and two compound puns on &quot;Done/done&quot; and &quot;More/more&quot;. All three are homophonic, with the puns on &quot;more&quot; being both homographic and capitonymic. The ambiguities introduce several possible meanings into the verses.

Alfred Hitchcock stated, &quot;Puns are the highest form of literature.&quot;

==== Shakespeare ====
Shakespeare is estimated to have used over 3,000 puns in his plays. Even though many of the puns were bawdy, Elizabethan literature considered puns and wordplay to be a &quot;sign of literary refinement&quot; more so than humor. This is evidenced by the deployment of puns in serious or &quot;seemingly inappropriate&quot; scenes, like when a dying Mercutio quips &quot;Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man&quot; in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

Shakespeare was also noted for his frequent play with less serious puns, the &quot;quibbles&quot; of the sort that made Samuel Johnson complain, &quot;A quibble is to Shakespeare what luminous vapours are to the traveller! He follows it to all adventures; it is sure to lead him out of his way, sure to engulf him in the mire. It has some malignant power over his mind, and its fascinations are irresistible.&quot; Elsewhere, Johnson disparagingly referred to punning as the lowest form of humour.

===Rhetoric===

Puns can function as a rhetorical device, where the pun serves as a persuasive instrument for an author or speaker. Although puns are sometimes perceived as trite or silly, if used responsibly a pun &quot;can be an effective communication tool in a variety of situations and forms&quot;. A major difficulty in using puns in this manner is that the meaning of a pun can be interpreted very differently according to the audience&#x27;s background with the possibility of detracting from the intended message.

===Design===

Like other forms of wordplay, paronomasia is occasionally used for its attention-getting or mnemonic qualities, making it common in titles and the names of places, characters, and organizations, and in advertising and slogans.

Many restaurant and shop names use puns: Cane &amp; Able mobility healthcare, Sam &amp; Ella&#x27;s Chicken Palace, Tiecoon tie shop, Planet of the Grapes wine and spirits, Curl Up and Dye hair salon, as do books such as &quot;Pies and Prejudice&quot;, webcomics like (&quot;YU+ME: dream&quot;) and feature films such as (&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;). The Japanese anime &quot;Speed Racer&#x27;s&quot; original Japanese title, &quot;Mach GoGoGo!&quot; refers to the English word itself, the Japanese word for five (the Mach Five&#x27;s car number), and the name of the show&#x27;s main character, Go Mifune. This is also an example of a multilingual pun, full understanding of which requires knowledge of more than one language on the part of the listener.

Names of fictional characters also often carry puns, such as Ash Ketchum, the protagonist of the anime series &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and Goku (&quot;Kakarrot&quot;), the protagonist of the manga series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. Both franchises are known for including second meanings in the names of characters. A recurring motif in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films repeatedly puns on names that suggest male genitalia. In the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;B-4&quot; is used as the name of one of four androids models constructed &quot;before&quot; the android Data, a main character. A librarian in another &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode was named &quot;Mr. Atoz&quot; (A to Z).

The parallel sequel &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; advertised with the phrase &quot;You haven&#x27;t seen the 1/2 of it!&quot;. Wyborowa Vodka employed the slogan &quot;Enjoyed for centuries straight&quot;, while Northern Telecom used &quot;Technology the world calls on.&quot;

On 1 June 2015 the BBC Radio 4 &quot;You and Yours&quot; included a feature on &quot;Puntastic Shop Titles&quot;. Entries included a Chinese Takeaway in Ayr town centre called &quot;Ayr&#x27;s Wok&quot;, a kebab shop in Ireland called &quot;Abra Kebabra&quot; and a tree-surgeon in Dudley called &quot;Special Branch&quot;. The winning entry, selected by Lee Nelson, was a dry cleaner&#x27;s in Fulham and Chelsea called &quot;Starchy and Starchy&quot;, a pun on Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.

==In the media==

Paronomasia has found a strong foothold in the media. William Safire of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggests that &quot;the root of this pace-growing [use of paronomasia] is often a headline-writer&#x27;s need for quick catchiness, and has resulted in a new tolerance for a long-despised form of humor.&quot; It can be argued that paronomasia is common in media headlines, to draw the reader&#x27;s interest. The rhetoric is important because it connects people with the topic. A notable example is the &quot;New York Post&quot; headline &quot;Headless Body in Topless Bar&quot;. &quot;New York Post&quot; headlines for sex scandal articles have included &quot;Cloak and Shag Her&quot; (General Petraeus), &quot;Obama Beats Weiner&quot; (Congressman Weiner), and &quot;Bezos Exposes Pecker&quot;.

Paronomasia is prevalent orally as well. Salvatore Attardo believes that puns are verbal humor. He talks about Pepicello and Weisberg&#x27;s linguistic theory of humor and believes the only form of linguistic humor is limited to puns. This is because a pun is a play on the word itself. Attardo believes that only puns are able to maintain humor and this humor has significance. It is able to help soften a situation and make it less serious, it can help make something more memorable, and using a pun can make the speaker seem witty.

Paronomasia is strong in print media and oral conversation so it can be assumed that paronomasia is strong in broadcast media as well. Examples of paronomasia in media are sound bites. They could be memorable because of the humor and rhetoric associated with paronomasia, thus making the significance of the soundbite stronger.

==Confusion and alternative uses==

There exist subtle differences between paronomasia and other literary techniques, such as the double entendre. While puns are often simple wordplay for comedic or rhetorical effect, a double entendre alludes to a second meaning that is not contained within the statement or phrase itself, often one that purposefully disguises the second meaning. As both exploit the use of intentional double meanings, puns can sometimes be double entendres, and vice versa. Puns also bear similarities with paraprosdokian, syllepsis, and eggcorns. In addition, homographic puns are sometimes compared to the stylistic device antanaclasis, and homophonic puns to polyptoton. Puns can be used as a type of mnemonic device to enhance comprehension in an educational setting. Used discreetly, puns can effectively reinforce content and aid in the retention of material. Some linguists have encouraged the creation of neologisms to decrease the instances of confusion caused by puns.

==History and global usage==
Puns were found in ancient Egypt, where they were heavily used in the development of myths and interpretation of dreams.

In China, Shen Dao (ca. 300 BC) used &quot;shi&quot;, meaning &quot;power&quot;, and &quot;shi&quot;, meaning &quot;position&quot; to say that a king has power because of his position as king.

In ancient Mesopotamia around 2500 BC, punning was used by scribes to represent words in cuneiform.

The Tanakh contains puns.

The Maya are known for having used puns in their hieroglyphic writing, and for using them in their modern languages.

In Japan, &quot;graphomania&quot; was one type of pun. More commonly, wordplay in modern Japan is known as &quot;dajare&quot;.

In Tamil, &quot;Sledai&quot; is the word used to mean pun in which a word with two different meanings. This is also classified as a poetry style in ancient Tamil literature. Similarly, in Telugu, &quot;Slesha&quot; is the equivalent word and is one of several poetry styles in Telugu literature.

<text>Pope Clement XII (; ; 7 April 16526 February 1740), born Lorenzo Corsini, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 12 July 1730 to his death in February 1740.

Clement presided over the growth of a surplus in the papal finances. He thus became known for building the new façade of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, beginning construction of the Trevi Fountain, and the purchase of Cardinal Alessandro Albani&#x27;s collection of antiquities for the papal gallery. In his 1738 bull , he provides the first public papal condemnation of Freemasonry.

== Early life ==
Lorenzo Corsini was born in Florence in 1652 as the son of Bartolomeo Corsini, Marquis of Casigliano, and Elisabetta Strozzi, the sister of the Duke of Bagnuolo. Both of his parents belonged to the old Florentine nobility. He was a nephew of Cardinal Neri Corsini and was a distant relative of Saint Andrew Corsini.

Corsini studied at the Jesuit Roman College in Rome and also at the University of Pisa where he earned a doctorate in both civil law and canon law.

== Career ==
Corsini practised law under the able direction of his uncle, Cardinal Neri Corsini. After the death of his uncle and his father, in 1685, Corsini, now thirty-three, would have become head of the Corsini. Instead, he renounced his right of primogeniture and from Pope Innocent XI (1676–1689) he purchased, according to the custom of the time, for 30,000 scudi, a position of prelatial rank and devoted his wealth and leisure to the enlargement of the library bequeathed to him by his uncle. Corsini&#x27;s home on the Piazza Navona was the centre of Rome&#x27;s scholarly and artistic life.

In 1690 he was made titular Archbishop of Nicomedia and chosen nuncio to Vienna, receiving a dispensation from Pope Alexander VIII since he had not yet been ordained a priest. He did not proceed to the imperial court, because Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, maintained that he had the right to select the nuncio from a list of three names furnished by the pope.

In 1696, Corsini was appointed treasurer-general and governor of the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. His good fortune increased during the pontificate of Pope Clement XI (1700–1721), who employed his talents as a courtier and named him Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Santa Susanna&quot; on 17 May 1706, retaining his services as papal treasurer.

He advanced still further under Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730), who made him Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, a judicial branch of the Roman Curia. He was successively appointed as the Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Vincoli and Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati.

== Pontificate ==
===Papal election===

Under Benedict XIII, the finances of the Papal States had been delivered into the hands of Cardinal Niccolò Coscia and other members of the curia, who had drained the financial resources of the see. Benedict died in 1730, and in the conclave that followed his death, after deliberating for four months, the College of Cardinals selected Corsini, 78 years old and with failing eyesight, who had held all the important offices of the Roman Curia. Since Clement XII, no pope has been elected at an older age than Clement XII when he was elected.

As a Corsini, with his mother a Strozzi, the new pope represented a family at the highest level of Florentine society, with a cardinal in every generation for the previous hundred years.

On 1 May 1730, several of the cardinals initially settled upon electing Cardinal Gianantonio Davia but had been unable to secure the necessary support. To that end, they refocused their efforts on getting Corsini elected, securing him 31 votes. Corsini, however, was not seriously considered as a candidate until about early July when the candidacy of Pietro Marcellino Corradini started to waver. Meanwhile, the French, Spanish, and Germans were perfectly amenable to Corsini&#x27;s election.

Corsini took his papal name in memorial to Pope Clement XI, who created him cardinal.

===Finances===
His first moves as Pope Clement XII were to restore the papal finances. He demanded restitution from the ministers who had abused the confidence of his predecessor. The chief culprit, Cardinal Niccolò Coscia, was heavily fined, excommunicated and sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment. Papal finances were also improved through reviving the public lottery, which had been suppressed by the severe morality of Benedict XIII. Soon money poured into Clement XII&#x27;s treasury, an annual sum amounting to nearly a half million &quot;scudi&quot;, enabling him to undertake the extensive building programs for which he is chiefly remembered, but which he was never able to see.

===Art and architecture===

A competition for the majestic façade of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran was won by architect Alessandro Galilei. The façade he designed is perhaps more palatial than ecclesiastic, and was finished by 1735. Clement XII erected in that ancient basilica a magnificent chapel dedicated to his 14th-century kinsman, St. Andrew Corsini. He restored the Arch of Constantine and built the Palazzo della Consulta on the Quirinal Hill. He purchased from Cardinal Alessandro Albani for 60,000 scudi a famous collection of statues, inscriptions, etc., and opened it to the public as the Capitoline Museums. He paved the streets of Rome and the roads leading from the city and widened the Via del Corso. He began the triumphant Baroque Trevi Fountain, one of the noted ornaments of Rome. Under his reign, a port was built at Ancona, with a highway that gave easy access to the interior. He drained the malarial marshes of the Chiana near Lake Trasimeno.The pope founded in 1732 the Italo-Albanian College Library of San Demetrio Corone in Calabria.

===Foreign policy===
Politically, however, this was not a successful papacy among the secular powers of Europe. When the attempt of Papal forces to take over the ancient independent Republic of San Marino failed, Clement XII disavowed the arbitrary action of his legate, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, in seizing San Marino, and restored its independence. He was also rebuffed in Papal claims over the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza.

In August 1730 he gave permission for Victor Amadeus II of Savoy to carry out a morganatic marriage to Anna Canalis di Cumiana. Victor Amadeus II subsequently abdicated his throne causing great unrest in Savoy.

===Ecclesial activities===

In ecclesiastic affairs he issued &quot;In eminenti apostolatus&quot;, the first papal decree against the Freemasons on 28 April 1738. He canonized Saint Vincent de Paul and proceeded with vigour against the French Jansenists. He campaigned for the reunion of the Roman and Orthodox churches, received the Patriarch of the Coptic Church and persuaded the Armenian Patriarch to remove the anathema against the Council of Chalcedon and Pope Leo I (440–461). He dispatched Joseph Simeon Assemani to the East for the twofold purpose of continuing his search for manuscripts and presiding as legate over a national council of Maronites. He created the youngest Cardinal ever when on 19 December 1735, he named Luis Antonio Jaime de Borbón y Farnesio, Royal Infante of Spain, age 8, to the Sacred College.

Though he was blind and compelled to keep to his bed, from which he gave audiences and transacted affairs of state, he surrounded himself with capable officials, many of them his Corsini relatives, but he did little for his family except to purchase and enlarge the palace built in Trastevere for the Riarii, and now known as the Palazzo Corsini (the seat of the Accademia dei Lincei). In 1754, his nephew, Cardinal Neri Maria Corsini, founded there the famous Corsini Library.

===Consistories===

Clement XII created 35 cardinals in fifteen consistories held throughout his pontificate. The first individual he raised into the cardinalate was his nephew Neri Maria Corsini while he also raised his future successor Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico (Pope Clement XIII) to the cardinalate. He also raised his nephew Giovanni Antonio Guadagni to the cardinalate in 1731.

===Canonizations and beatifications===
The pope named five new saints during his reign, the most notable being Vincent de Paul. He also beatified eight others including, his predecessor Pope Benedict XI.

== Death and burial ==

Clement XII died on 6 February 1740 at 9:30 am due to complications from gout. His remains were transferred to his tomb in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 20 July 1742. Pope Clement XII&#x27;s tomb is in the Capella Corsini of the Basilica of St. John Lateran and was completed by the sculptors Giovanni Battista Maini and Carlo Monaldi. His bust was completed by Filippo della Valle.

<doc id="24147" wikidata="Q12321" url="?curid=24147" title="Palindrome">
<text>A palindrome (/ˈpæl.ɪn.droʊm) is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as &quot;madam&quot; or &quot;racecar&quot;, the date &quot;22/02/2022&quot; and the sentence: &quot;A man, a plan, a canal – Panama&quot;. The 19-letter Finnish word &quot;saippuakivikauppias&quot; (a soapstone vendor) is the longest single-word palindrome in everyday use, while the 12-letter term &quot;tattarrattat&quot; (from James Joyce in &quot;Ulysses&quot;) is the longest in English.

The word &quot;palindrome&quot; was introduced by English poet and writer Henry Peacham in 1638. The concept of a palindrome can be dated to the 3rd-century BCE, although no examples survive. The earliest known examples are the 1st-century CE Latin acrostic word square, the Sator Square (which contains both word and sentence palindromes), and the 4th-century Greek Byzantine sentence palindrome &quot;nipson anomemata me monan opsin.&quot;

Palindromes are also found in music (the table canon and crab canon) and biological structures (most genomes include palindromic gene sequences). In automata theory, the set of all palindromes over an alphabet is a context-free language, but it is not regular.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;palindrome&quot; was introduced by English poet and writer Henry Peacham in 1638. It is derived from the Greek roots &#x27;again&#x27; and &#x27;way, direction&#x27;; a different word is used in Greek, καρκινικός &#x27;carcinic&#x27; (lit. &quot;crab-like&quot;) to refer to letter-by-letter reversible writing.

== Historical development ==

The ancient Greek poet Sotades (3rd-century BC) invented a form of Ionic meter called Sotadic or Sotadean verse, which is sometimes said to have been palindromic, since it is sometimes possible to make a sotadean line by reversing a dactylic hexameter.

A 1st-century Latin palindrome was found as a graffito at Pompeii. This palindrome, known as the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: &quot;sator arepo tenet opera rotas&quot; &#x27;The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels&#x27;. It is also an acrostic where the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. Other palindromes found at Pompeii include &quot;Roma-Olim-Milo-Amor&quot;, which is also written as an acrostic square. Indeed, composing palindromes was &quot;a pastime of Roman landed gentry&quot;.

Byzantine baptismal fonts were often inscribed with the 4th-century Greek palindrome, (or ) (&quot;Nipson anomēmata mē monan opsin&quot;) &#x27;Wash [your] sin(s), not only [your] face&#x27;, attributed to Gregory of Nazianzus; most notably in the basilica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The inscription is found on fonts in many churches in Western Europe: Orléans (St. Menin&#x27;s Abbey); Dulwich College; Nottingham (St. Mary&#x27;s); Worlingworth; Harlow; Knapton; London (St Martin, Ludgate); and Hadleigh (Suffolk).

A 12th-century palindrome with the same square property is the Hebrew palindrome, פרשנו רעבתן שבדבש נתבער ונשרף &quot;perashnu: ra`avtan shebad&#x27;vash nitba`er venisraf&quot; &#x27;We explained the glutton who is in the honey was burned and incinerated&#x27;, credited in 1924 to the medieval Jewish philosopher Abraham ibn Ezra, and referring to the halachic question as to whether a fly landing in honey makes the honey &quot;treif&quot; (non-kosher).

The palindromic Latin riddle &quot;In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni&quot; &#x27;we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire&#x27; describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled &quot;gyrum&quot;.

In English, there are many palindrome &quot;words&quot; such as &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;madam&quot;, and &quot;deified&quot;, but English writers generally cited Latin and Greek palindromic sentences in the early 19th century; though John Taylor had coined one in 1614: &quot;Lewd did I live, &amp; evil I did dwel&quot; (with the ampersand being something of a &quot;fudge&quot;). This is generally considered the first English-language palindrome sentence and was long reputed, notably by the grammarian James &quot;Hermes&quot; Harris, to be the &quot;only&quot; one, despite many efforts to find others. (Taylor had also composed two other, &quot;rather indifferent&quot;, palindromic lines of poetry: &quot;Deer Madam, Reed&quot;, &quot;Deem if I meed&quot;.) Then in 1848, a certain &quot;J.T.R.&quot; coined &quot;Able was I ere I saw Elba&quot;, which became famous after it was (implausibly) attributed to Napoleon (alluding to his exile on Elba). Other well-known English palindromes are: &quot;A man, a plan, a canal – Panama&quot; (1948), &quot;Madam, I&#x27;m Adam&quot; (1861), and &quot;Never odd or even&quot; (1930).

== Types ==

=== Characters, words, or lines ===

The most familiar palindromes in English are character-unit palindromes, where the characters read the same backward as forward. Examples are &quot;civic&quot;, &quot;radar&quot;, &quot;level&quot;, &quot;rotor&quot;, &quot;kayak&quot;, &quot;madam&quot;, and &quot;refer&quot;. The longest common ones are &quot;rotator, deified, racecar&quot;, and &quot;reviver&quot;; longer examples such as &quot;redivider&quot;, &quot;kinnikinnik&quot;, and &quot;tattarrattat&quot; are orders of magnitude rarer.

There are also word-unit palindromes in which the unit of reversal is the word (&quot;Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?&quot;). Word-unit palindromes were made popular in the recreational linguistics community by J. A. Lindon in the 1960s. Occasional examples in English were created in the 19th century. Several in French and Latin date to the Middle Ages.

There are also line-unit palindromes, most often poems. These possess an initial set of lines which, precisely halfway through, is repeated in reverse order, without alteration to word order within each line, and in a way that the second half continues the &quot;story&quot; related in the first half in a way that makes sense, this last being key.

=== Sentences and phrases ===
Palindromes often consist of a sentence or phrase, e.g., &quot;A man, a plan, a canal, Panama&quot;, &quot;Mr. Owl ate my metal worm&quot;, 
&quot;Do geese see God?&quot;, or &quot;Was it a car or a cat I saw?&quot;. Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored. Some, such as &quot;Rats live on no evil star&quot;, &quot;Live on time, emit no evil&quot;, and &quot;Step on no pets&quot;, include the spaces.

=== Names ===
Some names are palindromes, such as the given names Hannah, Ava, Aviva, Anna, Eve, Bob, and Otto, or the surnames Harrah, Renner, Salas, and Nenonen.
Lon Nol (1913–1985) was Prime Minister of Cambodia. Nisio Isin is a Japanese novelist and manga writer, whose pseudonym (西尾 維新, &quot;Nishio Ishin&quot;) is a palindrome when romanized using the Kunrei-shiki or the Nihon-shiki systems, and is often written as NisiOisiN to emphasize this. Some people have changed their name in order to make it palindromic (including as the actor Robert Trebor and rock-vocalist Ola Salo), while others were given a palindromic name at birth (such as the philologist Revilo P. Oliver, the flamenco dancer Sara Baras, the runner Anuța Cătună, the creator of the Eden Project Tim Smit, and the Mexican racing driver Noel León).

There are also palindromic names in fictional media. &quot;Stanley Yelnats&quot; is the name of the main character in &quot;Holes&quot;, a 1998 novel and 2003 film. Five of the fictional &quot;Pokémon&quot; species have palindromic names in English (Eevee, Girafarig, Farigiraf, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola), as does the region Alola.

The 1970s pop band ABBA is a palindrome using the starting letter of the first name of each of the four band members.

=== Numbers ===


The digits of a palindromic number are the same read backwards as forwards, for example, 91019; decimal representation is usually assumed. In recreational mathematics, palindromic numbers with special properties are sought. For example, 191 and 313 are palindromic primes.

Whether Lychrel numbers exist is an unsolved problem in mathematics about whether all numbers become palindromes when they are continuously reversed and added. For example, 56 is not a Lychrel number as 56 + 65 = 121, and 121 is a palindrome. The number 59 becomes a palindrome after three iterations: 59 + 95 = 154; 154 + 451 = 605; 605 + 506 = 1111, so 59 is not a Lychrel number either. Numbers such as 196 are thought to never become palindromes when this reversal process is carried out and are therefore suspected of being Lychrel numbers. If a number is not a Lychrel number, it is called a &quot;delayed palindrome&quot; (56 has a delay of 1 and 59 has a delay of 3). In January 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as , and described as &quot;The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome&quot;, with a delay of 261. Several smaller 261-delay palindromes were published separately as .

Every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.

=== Dates ===
A day or timestamp is a palindrome when its digits are the same when reversed. Only the digits are considered in this determination and the component separators (hyphens, slashes, and dots) are ignored. Short digits may be used as in &quot;11/11/11 11:11&quot; or long digits as in &quot;2 February 2020&quot;.

A notable palindrome day is this century&#x27;s 2 February 2020 because this date is a palindrome regardless of the date format by country (yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, or mm-dd-yyyy) used in various countries. For this reason, this date has also been termed as a &quot;Universal Palindrome Day&quot;. Other universal palindrome days include, almost a millennium previously, &quot;11/11/1111&quot;, the future &quot;12/12/2121&quot;, and in a millennium &quot;03/03/3030&quot;.

=== In speech ===

A phonetic palindrome is a portion of speech that is identical or roughly identical when reversed. It can arise in context where language is played with, for example in slang dialects like &quot;verlan&quot;. In the French language, there is the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;a Slavic woman waltzes naked&quot;), phonemically . John Oswald discussed his experience of phonetic palindromes while working on audio tape versions of the cut-up technique using recorded readings by William S. Burroughs. A list of phonetic palindromes discussed by word puzzle columnist O.V. Michaelsen (Ove Ofteness) include &quot;crew work&quot;/&quot;work crew&quot;, &quot;dry yard&quot;, &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;Funny enough&quot;, &quot;Let Bob tell&quot;, &quot;new moon&quot;, &quot;selfless&quot;, &quot;Sorry, Ross&quot;, &quot;Talk, Scott&quot;, &quot;to boot&quot;, &quot;top spot&quot; (also an orthographic palindrome), &quot;Y&#x27;all lie&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re caught. Talk, Roy&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re damn mad, Roy&quot;.

== Longest palindromes ==
The longest single-word palindrome in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is the 12-letter onomatopoeic word &quot;tattarrattat&quot;, coined by James Joyce in &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) for a knock on the door. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; gives the title to the 11-letter &quot;detartrated&quot;, the preterite and past participle of &quot;detartrate&quot;, a chemical term meaning to remove tartrates. The 9-letter word Rotavator, a trademarked name for an agricultural machine, is listed in dictionaries as being the longest single-word palindrome. The 9-letter term &quot;redivider&quot; is used by some writers, but appears to be an invented or derived term; only &quot;redivide&quot; and &quot;redivision&quot; appear in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; the 9-letter word &quot;Malayalam&quot;, a language of southern India, is also of equal length.

According to Guinness World Records, the Finnish 19-letter word &quot;saippuakivikauppias&quot; (a soapstone vendor), is the world&#x27;s longest palindromic word in everyday use.

English palindrome sentences of notable length include mathematician Peter Hilton&#x27;s &quot;Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod&quot;, and Scottish poet Alastair Reid&#x27;s &quot;T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad; I&#x27;d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.&quot;

In English, two palindromic novels have been published: &quot;Satire: Veritas&quot; by David Stephens (1980, 58,795 letters), and &quot;Dr Awkward &amp; Olson in Oslo&quot; by Lawrence Levine (1986, 31,954 words). Another palindromic English work is a 224-word long poem, &quot;Dammit I&#x27;m Mad&quot;, written by Demetri Martin. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Bob&quot; is composed entirely of palindromes.

=== Classical music ===

Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Symphony No. 47 in G is nicknamed &quot;the Palindrome&quot;. In the third movement, a minuet and trio, the second half of the minuet is the same as the first but backwards, the second half of the ensuing trio similarly reflects the first half, and then the minuet is repeated.

The interlude from Alban Berg&#x27;s opera &quot;Lulu&quot; is a palindrome, as are sections and pieces, in arch form, by many other composers, including James Tenney, and most famously Béla Bartók. George Crumb also used musical palindrome to text paint the Federico García Lorca poem &quot;¿Por qué nací?&quot;, the first movement of three in his fourth book of Madrigals. Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s final composition, &quot;The Owl and the Pussy Cat&quot;, is a palindrome.

The first movement from Constant Lambert&#x27;s ballet &quot;Horoscope&quot; (1938) is entitled &quot;Palindromic Prelude&quot;. Lambert claimed that the theme was dictated to him by the ghost of Bernard van Dieren, who had died in 1936.

British composer Robert Simpson also composed music in the palindrome or based on palindromic themes; the slow movement of his Symphony No. 2 is a palindrome, as is the slow movement of his String Quartet No. 1. His hour-long String Quartet No. 9 consists of thirty-two variations and a fugue on a palindromic theme of Haydn (from the minuet of his Symphony No. 47). All of Simpson&#x27;s thirty-two variations are themselves palindromic.

&quot;Hin und Zurück&quot; (&quot;There and Back&quot;: 1927) is an operatic &#x27;sketch&#x27; (Op. 45a) in one scene by Paul Hindemith, with a German libretto by Marcellus Schiffer. It is essentially a dramatic palindrome. Through the first half, a tragedy unfolds between two lovers, involving jealousy, murder and suicide. Then, in the reversing second half, this is replayed with the lines sung in reverse order to produce a happy ending.

The music of Anton Webern is often palindromic. Webern, who had studied the music of the Renaissance composer Heinrich Isaac, was extremely interested in symmetries in music, be they horizontal or vertical. An example of horizontal or linear symmetry in Webern&#x27;s music is the first phrase in the second movement of the symphony, Op. 21. A striking example of vertical symmetry is the second movement of the Piano Variations, Op. 27, in which Webern arranges every pitch of this dodecaphonic work around the central pitch axis of A4. From this, each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction. For example, a G3—13 half-steps down from A4 is replicated as a B5—13 half-steps above.

Just as the letters of a verbal palindrome are not reversed, so are the elements of a musical palindrome usually presented in the same form in both halves. Although these elements are usually single notes, palindromes may be made using more complex elements. For example, Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s composition &quot;Mixtur&quot;, originally written in 1964, consists of twenty sections, called &quot;moments&quot;, which may be permuted in several different ways, including retrograde presentation, and two versions may be made in a single program. When the composer revised the work in 2003, he prescribed such a palindromic performance, with the twenty moments first played in a &quot;forwards&quot; version, and then &quot;backwards&quot;. Each moment is a complex musical unit and is played in the same direction in each half of the program. By contrast, Karel Goeyvaerts&#x27;s 1953 electronic composition, &quot;Nummer 5 (met zuivere tonen)&quot; is an &quot;exact&quot; palindrome: not only does each event in the second half of the piece occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa. It is a perfect example of Goeyvaerts&#x27;s aesthetics, the perfect example of the imperfection of perfection.

In classical music, a crab canon is a canon in which one line of the melody is reversed in time and pitch from the other.
A large-scale musical palindrome covering more than one movement is called &quot;chiastic&quot;, referring to the cross-shaped Greek letter &quot;χ&quot; (pronounced /ˈkaɪ/.) This is usually a form of reference to the crucifixion; for example, the &quot;&quot; movement of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor. The purpose of such palindromic balancing is to focus the listener on the central movement, much as one would focus on the centre of the cross in the crucifixion. Other examples are found in Bach&#x27;s cantata BWV 4, &quot;Christ lag in Todes Banden&quot;, Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; and Fauré&#x27;s Requiem.

A table canon is a rectangular piece of sheet music intended to be played by two musicians facing each other across a table with the music between them, with one musician viewing the music upside down compared to the other. The result is somewhat like two speakers simultaneously reading the Sator Square from opposite sides, except that it is typically in two-part polyphony rather than in unison.

=== Biological structures ===
Palindromic motifs are found in most genomes or sets of genetic instructions. The meaning of palindrome in the context of genetics is slightly different, from the definition used for words and sentences. Since the DNA is formed by two paired strands of nucleotides, and the nucleotides always pair in the same way (Adenine (A) with Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) with Guanine (G)), a (single-stranded) sequence of DNA is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its complementary sequence read backward. For example, the sequence is palindromic because its complement is , which is equal to the original sequence in reverse complement.

A palindromic DNA sequence may form a hairpin. Palindromic motifs are made by the order of the nucleotides that specify the complex chemicals (proteins) that, as a result of those genetic instructions, the cell is to produce. They have been specially researched in bacterial chromosomes and in the so-called Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Elements (BIMEs) scattered over them. In 2003, a research genome sequencing project discovered that many of the bases on the Y-chromosome are arranged as palindromes. A palindrome structure allows the Y-chromosome to repair itself by bending over at the middle if one side is damaged.

It is believed that palindromes are also found in proteins, but their role in the protein function is not clearly known. It has been suggested in 2008 that the prevalent existence of palindromes in peptides might be related to the prevalence of low-complexity regions in proteins, as palindromes frequently are associated with low-complexity sequences. Their prevalence might also be related to an alpha helical formation propensity of these sequences, or in formation of protein/protein complexes.

=== Computation theory ===
In automata theory, a set of all palindromes in a given alphabet is a typical example of a language that is context-free, but not regular. This means that it is impossible for a finite automaton to reliably test for palindromes.

In addition, the set of palindromes may not be reliably tested by a deterministic pushdown automaton which also means that they are not LR(k)-parsable or LL(k)-parsable. When reading a palindrome from left to right, it is, in essence, impossible to locate the &quot;middle&quot; until the entire word has been read completely.

It is possible to find the longest palindromic substring of a given input string in linear time.

The palindromic density of an infinite word &quot;w&quot; over an alphabet &quot;A&quot; is defined to be zero if only finitely many prefixes are palindromes; otherwise, letting the palindromic prefixes be of lengths &quot;n&quot;&quot;k&quot; for &quot;k&quot;=1,2... we define the density to be

:formula_1

Among aperiodic words, the largest possible palindromic density is achieved by the Fibonacci word, which has density 1/φ, where φ is the Golden ratio.

A palstar is a concatenation of palindromic strings, excluding the trivial one-letter palindromes – otherwise all strings would be palstars.

<text>Pope Clement XIII (; ; 7 March 1693 – 2 February 1769), born Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 6 July 1758 to his death in February 1769. He was installed on 16 July 1758.

His pontificate was overshadowed by the constant pressure to suppress the Society of Jesus but despite this, he championed their order and also proved to be their greatest defender at that time. He was also one of the few early popes who favoured dialogue with Protestants and to this effect hoped to mend the schism with the Catholic Church that existed in England and the Low Countries. These efforts ultimately bore little fruit.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Carlo della Torre di Rezzonico was born on 7 March 1693 to a recently ennobled family of Venice, the second of two children of the man who bought the unfinished palace on the Grand Canal (now Ca&#x27; Rezzonico) and finished its construction. His parents were Giovanni Battista della Torre di Rezzonico and Vittoria Barbarigo.

Carlo received a Jesuit education in Bologna and later studied at the University of Padua where he obtained his doctorate in canon law and civil law. From there, he travelled to Rome where he attended the Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles.

In 1716 Rezzonico became the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura and in 1721 was appointed Governor of Fano. He was ordained to the priesthood on 23 December 1731 in Rome. Pope Clement XII appointed him to the cardinalate in 1737 as the Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere. He also filled various important posts in the Roman Curia.

Rezzonico was chosen as Bishop of Padua in 1743 and he received episcopal consecration in Rome by Pope Benedict XIV himself, in the presence of Giuseppe Accoramboni and Cardinal Antonio Saverio Gentili as co-consecrators. Rezzonico visited his diocese on frequent occasions and reformed the way that the diocese ran, paying attention to the social needs of the diocese. He was the first to do this in five decades. He later opted to become the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in 1747 and later still to become the Cardinal-Priest of San Marco in 1755.

==Pontificate==
===Election to the papacy===

Pope Benedict XIV died of gout in 1758 and the College of Cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in order to elect a successor. Direct negotiations between the rival factions resulted in the proposal for the election of Rezzonico. On the evening of 6 July 1758, Rezzonico received 31 votes out of a possible 44, one more than the required amount. He selected the pontifical name of &quot;Clement XIII&quot; in honor of Pope Clement XII, who had elevated him to the cardinalate. Rezzonico was crowned as pontiff on 16 July 1758 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Alessandro Albani.

===Actions===
Notwithstanding the meekness and affability of his upright and moderate character, he was modest to a fault (he had the classical sculptures in the Vatican provided with mass-produced fig leaves) and generous with his extensive private fortune. He also permitted vernacular translations of the Bible in Catholic countries.

===The Jesuits===
Clement XIII&#x27;s pontificate was repeatedly disturbed by disputes respecting the pressures to suppress the Jesuits coming from the progressive Enlightenment circles of the &quot;philosophes&quot; in France.

Clement XIII placed the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of D&#x27;Alembert and Diderot on the &quot;Index,&quot; but this index was not as effective as it had been in the previous century. More unexpected resistance came from the less progressive courts of Spain, Naples &amp; Sicily, and Portugal. In 1758 the reforming minister of Joseph I of Portugal (1750–77), the Marquis of Pombal, expelled the Jesuits from Portugal, and transported them all to Civitavecchia, as a &quot;gift for the Pope.&quot; In 1760, Pombal sent the papal nuncio home and recalled the Portuguese ambassador from the Vatican. The pamphlet titled the &quot;Brief Relation,&quot; which claimed the Jesuits had created their own sovereign independent kingdom in South America and tyrannised the Native Americans, all in the interest of an insatiable ambition and avarice, did damage to the Jesuit cause as well.

On 8 November 1760, Clement XIII issued a papal bull &quot;Quantum ornamenti&quot;, which approved the request of King Charles III of Spain to invoke the Immaculate Conception as the Patroness of Spain, along with its eastern and western territories, while continuing to recognize Saint James the Greater as co-patron.

In France, the Parlement of Paris, with its strong upper bourgeois background and Jansenist sympathies, began its campaign to expel the Jesuits from France in the spring of 1761, and the published excerpts from Jesuit writings, the &quot;Extrait des assertions&quot;, provided anti-Jesuit ammunition (though, arguably, many of the statements the &quot;Extrait&quot; contained were made to look worse than they were through judicious omission of context). Though a congregation of bishops assembled at Paris in December 1761 recommended no action, Louis XV of France (1715–74) promulgated a royal order permitting the Society to remain in France, with the proviso that certain essentially liberalising changes in their institution satisfy the Parlement with a French Jesuit vicar-general who would be independent of the general in Rome. When the Parlement by the &quot;arrêt&quot; of 2 August 1762 suppressed the Jesuits in France and imposed untenable conditions on any who remained in the country, Clement XIII protested against this invasion of the Church&#x27;s rights and annulled the &quot;arrêts&quot;. Louis XV&#x27;s ministers could not permit such an abrogation of French law, and the King finally expelled the Jesuits in November 1764.

Clement XIII warmly espoused the Jesuit order in a papal bull &quot;Apostolicum pascendi&quot;, 7 January 1765, which dismissed criticisms of the Jesuits as calumnies and praised the order&#x27;s usefulness; it was largely ignored: by 1768 the Jesuits had been expelled from France, Naples &amp; Sicily and Parma. In Spain, they appeared to be safe, but Charles III (1759–88), aware of the drawn-out contentions in Bourbon France, decided on a more peremptory efficiency. During the night of 2–3 April 1767, all the Jesuit houses of Spain were suddenly surrounded, the inhabitants arrested, shipped to the ports in the clothes they were wearing and bundled onto ships for Civitavecchia. The King&#x27;s letter to Clement XIII promised that his allowance of 100 &quot;piastres&quot; each year would be withdrawn for the whole order, should any one of them venture at any time to write anything in self-defence or in criticism of the motives for the expulsion, motives that he refused to discuss, then or in the future.

Much the same fate awaited them in the territories of the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Parma, who was advised by the liberal minister Guillaume du Tillot. In 1768, Clement XIII issued a strong protest (&quot;monitorium&quot;) against the policy of the Parmese government. The question of the investiture of Parma (technically a Papal fief), aggravated the Pope&#x27;s troubles. The Bourbon kings espoused their relative&#x27;s quarrel, seized Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo, and united in a peremptory demand for the total suppression of the Jesuits (January 1769).

Driven to extremes, Clement XIII consented to call a consistory to consider the step, but on the very eve of the day set for its meeting he died, not without suspicion of poison, of which, however, there appears to be no conclusive evidence.

===Ecumenism===

Clement XIII made attempts at engaging with Protestants. This made little progress since Clement refused to compromise on doctrine with Protestants.

In support of this policy, he recognised the Hanoverians as Kings of Great Britain despite the long-term residence in Rome of the Catholic House of Stuart. When James Francis Edward Stuart aka James III died in 1766, Clement refused to recognise his son Charles Edward Stuart as Charles III, despite the objections of his brother Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart.

===Other activities===
Clement XIII created 52 new cardinals in seven consistories in his pontificate. The pope created his nephew Carlo as a cardinal in his first consistory and later created Antonio Ganganelli—who would succeed him as Pope Clement XIV—as a cardinal.

The pope approved the cultus for several individuals: Andrew of Montereale and Vincent Kadlubek on 18 February 1764, Angelus Agostini Mazzinghi on 7 March 1761, Anthony Neyrot on 22 February 1767, Agostino Novello in 1759, Elizabeth of Reute on 19 July 1766, James Bertoni in 1766, Francesco Marinoni on 5 December 1764, Mattia de Nazarei on 27 July 1765, Sebastian Maggi on 15 April 1760 and Angela Merici on 30 April 1768. He formally beatified Beatrix of Este the Elder on 19 November 1763, Bernard of Corleone on 15 May 1768, and Gregorio Barbarigo on 6 July 1761.

Clement XIII canonized four saints in his pontificate: Jerome Emiliani, Joseph Calasanz, Joseph of Cupertino, and Seraphin of Montegranaro on 16 July 1767.

===Death===

Clement XIII died during the night of 2 February 1769 in Rome. He had participated in the solemnities to mark the Feast of the Purification of Mary, and was noted to have participated with much fervor that would indicate good health. After lunch, he had a series of audiences, though did not leave the palace due to the exceptionally cold weather that had marred that week. He later received his nephew in an audience and then met with the Cardinal Secretary of State before he would dine with his nephew, Abondio Rezzonico, the senator of Rome. However, as the pope was getting ready for bed after reciting the evening prayers with his aide drawing off his stockings, he suddenly collapsed on his bed, exclaiming, &quot;O God, O God, what pain!&quot; The doctor, immediately summoned, tried blood-letting, but Clement XIII died quickly with blood gurgling in his mouth at around 5:15pm. It is generally believed that the pope experienced an aneurysm of a blood vessel near the heart. 

He was laid to rest on 8 February 1769 in the Vatican but his remains were transferred on 27 September 1774 to a monument in the Vatican that had been sculpted by Antonio Canova at the request of Senator Abbondio Rezzonico, the nephew of the late pontiff.

He was described in the &quot;Annual Register&quot; for 1758 as &quot;the honestest man in the world; a most exemplary ecclesiastic; of the purest morals; devout, steady, learned, diligent...&quot;

<text>Pope Clement XIV (; ; 31 October 1705 – 22 September 1774), born Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 19 May 1769 to his death in September 1774. At the time of his election, he was the only Franciscan friar in the College of Cardinals, having been a member of OFM Conventual. He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name of &quot;Clement&quot; upon his election.

During his pontificate, Clement decreed the suppression of the Society of Jesus.

==Early life==
Ganganelli was born in Santarcangelo di Romagna in 1705 as the second child of Lorenzo Ganganelli, born in 1647, a physician originary from Borgo Pace in the Duchy of Urbino, and Angela Serafina Maria Mazzi (or Macci), a noblewoman from Pesaro, and paternal grandson of Alessandro Ganganelli and wife Porzia Franceschi. He received the sacrament of baptism on 2 November 1705 at the parish church of Sant&#x27;Agata.

Ganganelli initially studied at Verucchio but later received his education from the Society of Jesus at Rimini from 1717. He also studied with the Piarists of Urbino. Ganganelli entered the Order of Friars Minor Conventual on 15 May 1723 in Forlì, taking the name Lorenzo Francesco. He did his novitiate in Urbino where his cousin Vincenzo was a friar. He was professed as a full member of that order on 18 May 1724. He was sent to the convents of Pesaro, Fano, and Recanati from 1724 to 1728 where he did his theological studies. He continued his studies in Rome under Antonio Lucci and obtained his doctorate in theology in 1731.

==Priesthood and cardinalate==
Ganganelli was ordained around this time after he received his doctorate and he taught philosophy and theology for almost a decade in Ascoli, Bologna, and Milan. He later returned to Rome as the regent of the college that he studied at and was later elected as the Definitor General of the order in 1741. In the general chapters of his order in 1753 and 1756, he declined the generalship of his order and some rumored it was due to his desire of a higher office.

Ganganelli became a friend of Pope Benedict XIV, who in 1758 appointed him to investigate the issue of the traditional blood libel regarding the Jews, which Ganganelli found to be untrue.
Pope Clement XIII elevated Ganganelli to the cardinalate on 24 September 1759 and appointed him as the Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. His elevation came at the insistence of Lorenzo Ricci, who was the Superior-General of the Society of Jesus.

Ganganelli opted to become the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Apostoli in 1762. In 1768 he was named the &quot;ponens&quot; of the cause of beatification of Juan de Palafox y Mendoza.

==Election to the papacy==
===Political pressures===
The papal conclave in 1769 was almost completely dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. During the previous pontificate, the Jesuits had been expelled from Portugal and from all the courts of the House of Bourbon, which included France, Spain, Naples &amp; Sicily, and Parma. In January, 1769, these powers made a formal demand for the dissolution of the Society. Clement XIII had planned a consistory to discuss the matter, but died on 2 February, the night before it was to be held.

Now the general suppression of the order was urged by the faction called the &quot;court cardinals&quot;, who were opposed by the diminished pro-Jesuit faction, the &quot;Zelanti&quot; (&quot;zealous&quot;), who were generally opposed to the encroaching secularism of the Enlightenment. Much of the early activity was &quot;pro forma&quot; as the members waited for the arrival of those cardinals who had indicated that they would attend. The conclave had been sitting since 15 February 1769, heavily influenced by the political maneuvers of the ambassadors of Catholic sovereigns who were opposed to the Jesuits.

Some of the pressure was subtle. On 15 March, Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1765–90) visited Rome to join his brother Leopold, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had arrived on 6 March. The next day, after touring St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, they took advantage of the conclave doors being opened to admit Cardinal Girolamo Spinola to enter as well. They were shown, upon the Emperor&#x27;s request, the ballots, the chalice into which they would be placed, and where they would later be burned. That evening Gaetano Duca Cesarini hosted a party. It was the middle of Passion Week.

The minister of King Louis XV of France (1715–74), the duc de Choiseul, had extensive experience dealing with the church as the French ambassador to the Holy See and was Europe&#x27;s most skilled diplomat. &quot;When one has a favour to ask of a Pope&quot;, he wrote, &quot;and one is determined to obtain it, one must ask for two&quot;. Choiseul&#x27;s suggestion was advanced to the other ambassadors and it was that they should press, in addition to the Jesuit issue, territorial claims upon the Patrimony of Saint Peter, including the return of Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin to France, the duchies of Benevento and Pontecorvo to Spain, an extension of territory adjoining the Papal States to Naples, and an immediate and final settlement of the vexed question of Parma and Piacenza that had occasioned a diplomatic rift between Austria and Pope Clement XIII.

===Election===

By 18 May, the court coalition appeared to be unravelling as the respective representatives began to negotiate separately with different cardinals. The French ambassador had earlier suggested that any acceptable candidate be required to put in writing that he would abolish the Jesuits. The idea was largely dismissed as a violation of canon law. Spain still insisted that a firm commitment should be given, though not necessarily in writing. However, such concessions could be immediately nullified by the pope upon election. On 19 May 1769, Cardinal Ganganelli was elected as a compromise candidate largely due to support of the Bourbon courts, which had expected that he would suppress the Society of Jesus. Ganganelli, who had been educated by Jesuits, gave no commitment, but indicated that he thought the dissolution was possible. He took the pontifical name of &quot;Clement XIV&quot;. Ganganelli first received episcopal consecration in the Vatican on 28 May 1769 by Cardinal Federico Marcello Lante and was crowned as pope on 4 June 1769 by the cardinal protodeacon Alessandro Albani.
He was replaced as Cardinal-Priest by Buenaventura Fernández de Córdoba Spínola.

He took possession of the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran on 26 November 1769.

==Pontificate==
Clement XIV&#x27;s policies were calculated from the outset to smooth the breaches with the Catholic crowns that had developed during the previous pontificate. The dispute between the temporal and the spiritual Catholic authorities was perceived as a threat by Church authority, and Clement XIV worked towards reconciliation with the European sovereigns. By yielding the papal claims to Parma, Clement XIV obtained the restitution of Avignon and Benevento and in general he succeeded in placing the relations of the spiritual and the temporal authorities on a friendlier footing. The pontiff went on to suppress the Jesuits, writing the decree to this effect in November 1772 and signing it on 21 July 1773.

===Relations with the Jews===
His accession was welcomed by the Jewish community who trusted that the man who, as councilor of the Holy Office, declared them, in a memorandum issued 21 March 1758, innocent of the slanderous blood accusation, would be no less just and humane toward them on the throne of Catholicism. Assigned by Pope Benedict XIV to investigate a charge against the Jews of Yanopol, Poland, Ganganelli not only refuted the claim, but showed that most of the similar claims since the thirteenth century were groundless. He deferred somewhat on the already beatified Simon of Trent, in 1475, and Andreas of Rinn, but took the length of time before their beatifications as indicative that the veracity of the accusations raised significant doubts.

===Suppression of the Jesuits===
The Jesuits had been expelled from Brazil (1754), Portugal (1759), France (1764), Spain and its colonies (1767), and Parma (1768). With the accession of a new pope, the Bourbon monarchs pressed for the Society&#x27;s total suppression. Clement XIV tried to placate their enemies by apparent unfriendly treatment of the Jesuits: he refused to meet the superior general, Lorenzo Ricci, removed it from the administration of the Irish and Roman Colleges, and ordered them not to receive novices, etc.

The pressure kept building up to the point that Catholic countries were threatening to break away from the Church. Clement XIV ultimately yielded &quot;in the name of peace of the Church and to avoid a secession in Europe&quot; and suppressed the Society of Jesus by the brief &quot;Dominus ac Redemptor&quot; of 21 July 1773. However, in non-Catholic nations, particularly in Prussia and Russia, where papal authority was not recognized, the order was ignored. It was a result of a series of political moves rather than a theological controversy.

===Mozart===
Pope Clement XIV and the customs of the Catholic Church in Rome are described in letters of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and of his father Leopold Mozart, written from Rome in April and May 1770 during their tour of Italy. Leopold found the upper clergy offensively haughty, but was received, with his son, by the pope, where Wolfgang demonstrated an amazing feat of musical memory. The papal chapel was famous for performing a &quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot; by the 17th-century composer Gregorio Allegri, whose music was not to be copied outside of the chapel on pain of excommunication. The 14-year-old Wolfgang was able to transcribe the composition in its entirety after a single hearing. Clement made the young Mozart a knight of the Order of the Golden Spur.

Similarly, in 1774 German composer, Georg Joseph Vogler was also made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Spur.

===Activities===

Clement XIV elevated sixteen new cardinals into the cardinalate in twelve consistories including Giovanni Angelo Braschi, who succeeded him as Pope Pius VI.

The pope held no canonizations in his pontificate but he beatified a number of individuals.
* 4 June 1769: Francis Caracciolo
* 16 September 1769: Giuliana Puricelli from Busto Arsizio, Bernard of Baden &amp; Catherine of Pallanza
* 1771: Tommaso Bellacci
* 14 December 1771: Martyrs of Otranto
* 8 June 1772: Paul Burali d&#x27;Arezzo
* 29 August 1772: John dal Bastone
* 1773: Pope Benedict XI (formal beatification after Pope Clement XII confirmed the cultus)
* 1774: Beatrix of Este the Younger

==Death and burial==

The last months of Clement XIV&#x27;s life were embittered by his failures and he seemed always to be in sorrow because of this. His work was hardly accomplished before Clement XIV, whose usual constitution was quite vigorous, fell into a languishing sickness, generally attributed to poison. No conclusive evidence of poisoning was ever produced. The claims that the Pope was poisoned were denied by those closest to him, and as &quot;The Annual Register&quot; for 1774 stated, he was over 70 and had been in ill health for some time.

On 10 September 1774, he was bedridden and received Extreme Unction on 21 September 1774. It is said that St. Alphonsus Liguori assisted Clement XIV in his last hours by the gift of bilocation and was during two days in extasis in his bishopric in Arienzo.

Clement XIV died on 22 September 1774, execrated by the Ultramontane party but widely mourned by his subjects for his popular administration of the Papal States. When his body was opened for the autopsy, the doctors ascribed his death to scorbutic and hemorrhoidal dispositions of long standing that were aggravated by excessive labour and the habit of provoking artificial perspiration even in the greatest heat. His Neoclassical style tomb was designed and sculpted by Antonio Canova, and it is found in the church of Santi Apostoli, Rome. To this day, he is best remembered for his suppression of the Jesuits.

The &quot;Monthly Review&quot; spoke highly of Ganganelli. In a review of a &quot;Sketch of the Life and Government of Pope Clement XIV&quot;, the 1786 &quot;English Review&quot; said it was clearly written by an ex-Jesuit and noted the malignant characterization of a man it described as &quot;...a liberal, affable, ingenious man; …a politician enlarged in his views, and equally bold and dexterous in the means, by which he executed his designs.&quot;

The 1876 Encyclopædia Britannica says that:

Jacques Cretineau-Joly, however, wrote a critical history of the Pope&#x27;s administration.

<doc id="24150" wikidata="Q14211" url="?curid=24150" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">
<text>The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government of the United Kingdom. The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.

The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is &quot;ex officio&quot; also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security, and Minister for the Union. The prime minister&#x27;s official residence and office, by virtue of being the First Lord of the Treasury, is 10 Downing Street in London.

Early conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the &quot;Primus inter pares&quot; or &quot;first among equals&quot;, however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister&#x27;s power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decide on key policies that fit their agenda which is then passed by an act of parliament.

The power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power itself evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher, prime ministerial power expanded substantially and their leadership in the office were described as &quot;presidential&quot; due to their personal yielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world&#x27;s sixth largest economy, the prime minister hold significant domestic and international leadership alongside being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.

58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. The current prime minister is Keir Starmer, who succeeded Rishi Sunak on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.

==History==
=== Origins: 1689–1742 ===
The position of prime minister was not created but evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. Therefore, the office is rarely found in any statute and according to the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in 2014: &quot;It is impossible to point to a single point in history when the post was created or even a decision to create it.”

The 17th century saw a transformative period in British history. The English Civil War saw the final conflict between the Monarchy and Parliament over governance, culminating in the end of absolute monarchy with the execution of Charles I in 1649. In 1660, the Monarchy was restored with the ascension of Charles II signalling a return to royal rule but with growing limitations. The Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 led to the deposition of the Catholic James II and the establishment of William III and Mary II as constitutional monarchs. After a series of bills passed by the House of Commons, such as the Bill of Rights in 1689, the powers of the monarch were reduced, being replaced by the powers of parliament. The Bill of Rights established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown and set up certain civil rights. During this period, Parliament was dominated by two political factions: the Whigs and the Tories. The Whigs supported parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional monarchy whilst the Tories favoured the divine right of kings and the deposed James II. These two groups were considered by some to be &quot;embryonic political parties.&quot;

The resulting constitution established in 1689 gave Parliament the power over the &quot;purse&quot; or the Treasury. The monarch who now could commit to and follow agreed policy allowed Parliament to pursue and fund its own policies without any fear of diversion of the funds. By this point, the Monarch was forced by incentive to cede power to Parliament under the credible threat of removal of any who ignored the Constitution. The head of Treasury, as Lord Treasurer, was give the power in 1706 following Standing Order Number 66 to draft money bills (budgets) instead of MPs outside of government. The informal term of &#x27;Prime Minister&#x27; was first recorded around that time, which since 1721 had mostly also been the office holder for the First Lord of the Treasury. The First Lord of the Treasury is one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. This role is usually held by the Prime Minister. The role of Prime Minister grew more distinct as the head of government and often more recognisable within the public than other members of the cabinet, which demonstrates the increasing power of the Prime Minister in modern times than that originally created.

Following death of Queen Anne in 1714, Parliament invited George Louis, Prince Elector of Hanover, to become King. During his reign, he was unpopular partly due to his limited English proficiency and lack of interest in governing, a role he largely left to his ministers. In 1720, the South Sea Bubble, a financial crisis stemming from speculative investments, led to economic turmoil. The collapse implicated many government officials. With schisms within the Whigs Party led to the fall of Stanhope–Sunderland ministry. Subsequently, Sir Robert Walpole, who was serving as Paymaster General, was appointed First Lord of the Treasury in 1721. Sir Robert Walpole was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, though his predecessors as First Lord of the Treasury also held a similar position. Walpole is considered the first &quot;de facto prime minister&quot; due to his influence over policy and control of government affairs. He was not, in the modern sense, “prime minister”. This was due to the position being not formally recognised by any legal fixture and also due to the position originally being used as a term of abuse.

Walpole served as prime minister from 1721 to 1742. The time during his premiership was dubbed by historians as the &quot;Robinocracy&quot;. His financial abilities in handling the repercussions in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble earned him the support of commercial and landed interests, pursued a largely peaceful foreign policy, lowered taxes and reduced national debt while his skilful management of Commons affairs solidified his dominance in Parliament by operating as a &quot;Screen-Master General&quot;, pulling strings and sullying favour whenever necessary. Walpole’s policy was to maintain the status quo and despite not passing any major reforms, Walpole provided the country with much-needed stability after a century of turmoil. His time in office was crucial in shifting political power to the House of Commons and laying the foundations for the modern Cabinet system. Despite being able to successfully hold power for 20 years, Walpole faced fierce opposition over alleged bribery and corruption in Parliament and following a disastrous war with Spain, he resigned in 1742 and was succeeded by the Earl of Wilmington.

=== Development: 1742–1945 ===
Following the resignation of Walpole, a swift string of ministries followed and between 1742 and 1760 there were five separate governments. Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington was made prime minister. However, Wilmington served for a brief time and was head of government by name only. The government continued to be dominated by internal struggles over Britain&#x27;s participation in the War of the Austrian Succession and royal intervention in policy making. In 1743, Henry Pelham became prime minister and sought to expel ministers, particularly Lord Carteret, who sought undermine the authority of the new ministry.

==Powers and authority==
=== Executive powers ===
The prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government. As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation. John Morley described the office of prime minister as the &quot;keystone of the Cabinet arch&quot; that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (Government).

Ministerial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister&#x27;s executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House in order to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.
The prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the &quot;unity of powers&quot; that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch &quot;reigns but does not rule&quot;. According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.

The prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch&#x27;s royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister&#x27;s prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.

=== Legislative powers ===
In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public &quot;face&quot; and &quot;voice&quot; of His Majesty&#x27;s Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.

Bagehot identifies the prime minister as the head of the &quot;efficient&quot; part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister&#x27;s ability to operate the &quot;machinery of government&quot; that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party&#x27;s political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.

The prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister&#x27;s influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister&#x27;s approval is needed in order to initiate the legislative agenda. King&#x27;s analysis of contemporary politics showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.

=== Parliamentary powers ===

The prime minister&#x27;s influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister&#x27;s power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government&#x27;s priorities.

Another essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet. According to Professor Robert Hazell, the prime minister not only chooses cabinet members but also dictates the collective decision-making process of members as well. The prime minister most often would chair cabinet meetings and may determine their frequency, thereby controlling the agenda for policy and steering decisions in their preferred direction. Additionally, the prime minister can exercise considerable control over parliamentary time. Authors Alexander Horne and Gavin Drewry state that the prime minister uses this power through the Leader of the House of Commons, by which they are able to allocate time for government bills and often ensuring access to this time over private members&#x27; bills.

The prime minister&#x27;s parliamentary powers also extend to foreign relations. Contemporary historian Anthony Seldon says that the prime minister acts as the main representative of the government in the international sphere, including in parliament, where treaties are ratified and international commitments are debated.

=== Prerogative powers ===

The most significant powers given to the prime minister are &quot;prerogative powers&quot;. These are a set of constitutional privileges deriving from monarchial authority that have gradually evolved into tools of executive power managed by the prime minister and the government. Bagehot famously called the British system as one where &quot;the executive power is now yielded by the prime minister&quot; rather than the monarch, a shift from personal to political power. Prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act without the immediate or direct consent of parliament especially in circumstances such as declaring war, deployment of troops and the granting of honours.

Brazier argues that prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act within the &quot;authority of the crown&quot; in situations where neither convention nor statutory law applies. As noted by both Bagehot and Brazier, areas in which the prime minister authorises their given prerogative powers are matters of foreign affairs. In recent occasions, the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw Prime Minister Tony Blair deploying British troops to Saudi Arabia without the immediate consent or approval of parliament. Brazier says the rise of parliamentary and public scrutiny has led to calls for reform and checks on the use of prerogative powers. The only prime minister who did not seek parliamentary or legal consent for military action was Anthony Eden during the Suez Crisis in 1956.

Professors Mark Elliot and Robert Thomas argue that prerogative powers present a constitutional anomaly in the 21st century. Both contend that such powers lack direct democratic legitimacy due to not being regulated by parliamentary statutes and raise concerns over accountability. Elliot and Thomas have pointed out that judicial intervention in cases such as Miller I and Miller II, where the Supreme Court exercised scrutiny over the use of prerogative powers by the government to prorogue parliament during the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union, was successful in keeping check over the authority of both the prime minister and the government. The evolving usage of prerogative powers also has signalled tension between tradition and accountability. Authors Paul Craig and Adam Tomkins state that the absence of a written constitution gives a prime minister greater leeway in employing their given prerogative powers without limits that in turn would create uncertainty although the use of such powers by the prime minister is often constrained by political convention than by law.

==Constitutional background==
The British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document. The British constitution consists of many documents, and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:In this country we live ... under an unwritten Constitution. It is true that we have on the Statute-book great instruments like Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights which define and secure many of our rights and privileges; but the great bulk of our constitutional liberties and ... our constitutional practices do not derive their validity and sanction from any Bill which has received the formal assent of the King, Lords and Commons. They rest on usage, custom, convention, often of slow growth in their early stages, not always uniform, but which in the course of time received universal observance and respect.
The relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister&#x27;s executive and legislative powers are actually royal prerogatives which are still formally vested in the sovereign, who remains the head of state. Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the legal fiction was maintained that the sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the Chequers Estate Act. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of prime minister featured in statute law and official documents; however, the prime minister&#x27;s powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of First Lord of the Treasury and, since November 1968, that of Minister for the Civil Service, the latter giving them authority over the civil service.

Under this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of &quot;the Crown&quot; resolves this paradox. The Crown symbolises the state&#x27;s authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.

Although many of the sovereign&#x27;s prerogative powers are still legally intact, constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.

==Modern premiership==
===Appointment===
In modern times, much of the process involving prime ministerial appointments is informally governed by constitutional conventions and with the rules and processes described by authoritative sources such as The Cabinet Manual.

The prime minister is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative. In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1834), but it is now the convention that the monarch should not be drawn into party politics. Bogdanor states that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the monarch often appointed the prime minister based on their personal preference, regardless of whether they have great or little public support.

If a prime minister (incumbent or otherwise) leads their party to victory in a general election and gains an overall majority in the House of Commons they will be invited by the monarch to form a new government. Following the invitation, the prime minister will be driven to Buckingham Palace to meet the monarch. The meeting between the monarch and the incoming prime minister is a moment for the latter to pledge their loyalty to the monarch and seek permission to form a new government. The prime minister is expected to bow before the monarch in a ceremony known as &quot;kissing hands&quot;. Following this, the prime minister is officially appointed the head of His Majesty&#x27;s government.

The prime minister &quot;...holds that position by virtue of his or her ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, which in turn commands the confidence of the electorate, as expressed through a general election.&quot; By convention, the prime minister is also an MP and is normally the leader of the political party that commands a majority in the House of Commons.

===Prime Minister&#x27;s Office===
The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office helps the prime minister to &#x27;establish and deliver the government&#x27;s overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate the government&#x27;s policies to Parliament, the public and international audiences&#x27;. The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office is formally part of the Cabinet Office, but the boundary between its work and that of the wider Cabinet Office can be unclear; the wider Cabinet Office might carry out very similar work. Peter Hennessy has claimed that this overall arrangement means there is in fact effectively a Prime Minister&#x27;s Department, though it is not called this.

The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office was officially created in 1916 by David Lloyd George during the World War I, which marked the first formal recognition of the office of prime minister and established it as an independent institution from other entities within government, with staff to support the coordination of government policy. This development came as a response to the demands of wartime governance, as Lloyd George&#x27;s leadership needed a more centred and efficient executive function.

===Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions===
Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions is a constitutional convention, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, in which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs). The leader of the opposition usually asks the prime minister six questions, and the leader of the third-largest parliamentary party can ask two questions. It is an occasion when the prime minister appears regularly on live television and radio.

Before the 1880s, oral questions were mainly directed towards cabinet ministers and therefore such questions were regarded as the same even when addressed to the Prime Minister. The session in its modern form was first introduced on Tuesday 24 October in 1961 when the then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan answered questions for between 15 minutes from 3.15pm to 3.30pm as an experiment. Since 1997 PMQs were held every Wednesdays at 3pm until 3.30pm. In 1989, the first PMQs were broadcast and in 1990 were broadcast live to the public as a step towards transparency and accountability.

The timing of PMQs has often changed depending on the varied schedules of prime ministers. In 1881, questions addressed to the prime minister were placed at the end of question time so that the then 72-year old Prime Minister William Gladstone could arrive late. In 1904, questions were answered only when they reached No 51 and in 1940 they were expanded to No 45. The procedure was in practice until 1953 when PMQs were restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays only to assist Winston Churchill who was 78-years old.

The prime minister also appears before the Liaison Committee to answer questions about public policy.

===Security and transport===

The personal protection of the prime minister and former prime ministers is the responsibility of Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police Service. When the prime minister resides in 10 Downing Street, they are constantly surrounded by armed police units with &quot;airport-style&quot; security checkpoints, large metal gates, street patrols and heavy vetting for staff and non-ministerial individuals. Such installations were introduced due to fears of IRA bomb threats and attacks which were persistent during The Troubles. When travelling, the prime minister will be accompanied by a select group of police officers joined by a wider team of security personnel. On the road, the prime ministerial entourage will be followed by police outriders on motorbikes to clear a path in the traffic and to stop them from being a sitting target. The fleet of Prime Ministerial Cars provides the prime minister with a number of security features as well as transport. The vehicles are driven by officers from this unit. These vehicles are often custom made and always British manufactured with in-built gun ports, an independent oxygen supply and the ability to release tear gas to subdue angry crowds. Air transport for the prime minister is provided by a variety of military and civilian operators.

===International role===

One of the roles of the prime minister is to represent the UK at home and abroad, for example at the annual G7 Summit. The prime minister makes many international trips. According to Gus O&#x27;Donnell, the number of overseas visits for the prime minister has gone up.

=== Deputy ===

Prime ministers have had various deputies, sometimes as an official deputy prime minister, first secretary of state or &quot;de facto&quot; deputy. Some prime ministers have not chosen a deputy at all, preferring &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangements.

Historically, the position of deputy prime minister has been created out of political necessity rather than being established by statutory law or convention with the title not being defined in the constitution. The position was first created (unofficially) for Clement Attlee in Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s ministry during World War II, in order to manage administrative duties, domestic affairs and welfare, while Churchill focused on military strategy. In recent times, after the 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament, the leaders of the Conservative and the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, formed a coalition government in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. In that capacity, Clegg chaired cabinet meetings, key committees and led negotiations on major reforms. As such, the office saw an unusual level of formalisation and recognition during Clegg&#x27;s tenure.

==== Succession ====
Nobody has the right of automatic succession to the prime ministership. It is generally considered that in the event of the death of the prime minister, it would be appropriate to appoint an interim prime minister, though there is some debate as to how to decide who this should be.

According to Rodney Brazier, there are no procedures within government to cope with the sudden death of the prime minister. There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom. Despite refusing &quot;...to discuss a hypothetical situation&quot; with BBC News in 2011, the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:Additionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.

On 6 April 2020, when Boris Johnson was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, when suffering from COVID-19, he asked Dominic Raab &quot;to deputise for him where necessary&quot;.

===Resignation===

A prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch. This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons, or for other reasons such as ill-health. If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours. No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election. Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.

==Privileges ==
On taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called &quot;kissing hands&quot;). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:

=== Precedence and form of address ===
Ministerial listings are printed in the official records of parliament known as &quot;Hansard&quot;, and 1885 was the first known instance of official use of the title of Prime Minister. The minutes of the first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1902 saw the first internal reference to the title as well. The 1904 edition of the Imperial Calendar referred to the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, as &#x27;Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury&#x27;; in the previous edition he was merely &#x27;First Lord of the Treasury and Lord Privy Seal&#x27;.

Throughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures. The prime minister was officially granted a place in the order of precedence in December 1905, and the first statutory reference to the Prime Minister was present in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, which specified Chequers as a prime-ministerial residence. Public recognition of the existence of a &#x27;Prime Minister&#x27;s Office&#x27; in the Civil Service Yearbook came as recently as the 1977 edition.

The prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;. Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as prime minister.

According to the now-defunct Department for Constitutional Affairs, the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and not by a personal name. Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As &quot;prime minister&quot; is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as &quot;the prime minister&quot;, although the title &quot;Prime Minister&quot; (e.g. &quot;Prime Minister Keir Starmer&quot;) has become commonplace within current political reporting. Within the UK, the expression &quot;Prime Minister Starmer&quot; is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.

=== Compensation ===
In 2010, the prime minister received £14,500 in addition to a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament. Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor&#x27;s position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor&#x27;s judicial functions and also reduced the office&#x27;s salary to below that of the prime minister. During the premiership of Gordon Brown, the prime minister received a salary of £193,885 on 1 April 2009 which was higher than the salary of £166,786 as of 2024. The reasons for such reductions are Brown&#x27;s cuts to voluntary pay at around £150,000 during pre-election in the May 2010 election, and when David Cameron became prime minister the cuts were extended to 5%, amounting at around £142,500. Subsequent prime ministers have kept the restraint on ministerial pay and have not taken any further pay outside of what they are entitled. According to journalist Simon Kelner, the salary of the prime minister must be increased and that further expansion of a salary or hospitality received by a prime minister is disavowed under the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 which only criminalised voter bribery and introduced standards for election expenses, and &quot;created a more level playing field for parliamentary candidates&quot;. Kelner said that it is a inadequate way of holding a prime minister into account. This was in respone to the 2024 Labour Party freebies controversy, in which the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, having reportedly failed to disclose the amount of gifts and &quot;freebies&quot; received by him, members of his family and cabinet.

=== Official residences ===
10 Downing Street, in London, has been the official place of residence of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices. The building was originally given by King George I to Robert Walpole, widely regarded as the nation&#x27;s first prime minister, as a personal gift. However, Walpole insisted that he would accept it in his capacity as first lord of the Treasury and requested that his subsequent successors be entitled to reside in and use the property as they wish. The complex incorporates the flats of No.11 and No.12 Downing Street, which have been reconstructed through to connect them to No.10. Altogether, the three buildings contain over 100 rooms.

Chequers, a country house in Buckinghamshire, gifted to the government in 1917, may be used as a country retreat for the prime minister. The estate was previously owned by the Conservative minister and First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Arthur Lee, before being donated to the British government under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. It was to give the incumbent prime minister the time to &quot;spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods&quot; and on the condition that incumbent should not own any residential country estate of their own.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, many prime ministers were members of the British nobility and therefore held the office whilst serving in the House of Lords. Through lineage and inheritance, these prime ministers acquired large estates, though they still owned properties in London for political affairs and many used country houses as a retreat. Until the mid-20th Century, parliamentary sessions did not begin until the New Year after ending in August, which would give the prime minister long periods in respite.

== Post-premiership ==

=== Retirement honours ===

Upon retirement, it is customary for the sovereign to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK&#x27;s most senior order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid-nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of Knight of the Thistle (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.

Historically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom. The last such creation was for Harold Macmillan, who resigned in 1963. Unusually, he became Earl of Stockton only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.

Macmillan&#x27;s successors Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, David Cameron, and Theresa May all accepted life peerages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home and Cameron received a peerage after reentering Government as Foreign Secretary, not for services as a former Prime Minister). Edward Heath did not accept a peerage of any kind; neither have any of the prime ministers who have retired since 1990 other than Cameron (having done so to re-join the Cabinet, rather than as an honour per se) and May. Edward Heath (in 1992), John Major (in 2005) and Tony Blair (in 2022) were appointed as Knights Companion of the Garter. Major (in 1998) and Gordon Brown (in 2024) were appointed members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, although Blair had previously disclosed that he did not want honours bestowed on himself or future prime ministers.

The most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remained the case until David Cameron was appointed to the House in November 2023.

=== Activities ===
There are currently no established roles or job positions for former prime ministers following their resignations or after leaving office unexpectedly. It depends on their personal choice and reasons surrounding the need to take on such positions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many former prime ministers, who were wealthy members of the nobility, would often simply retire to their country estates. The first prime minister, Robert Walpole, accumulated large personal wealth while serving in office and from previous investments made in the 1710s. Prime Ministers Lord Bute and Lord Rosebery were among the wealthiest men in the country during their retirements and are often touted as some of the wealthiest to serve as in office. However some prime ministers, such as William Pitt the Elder and his son William Pitt the Younger, amassed large public debts that were later paid off by parliament. In 1937, an official pension for former prime ministers was given at the sum of £2000 per annum.

In their retirements, a majority of former prime ministers have written memoirs and autobiographies. Some prime ministers have also written non-political books as well, including Winston Churchill&#x27;s histories of World War II and of the English language, Edward Heath&#x27;s books on his wider interests in sailing, music and travel, Major&#x27;s history of cricket and Arthur Balfour&#x27;s philosophical writings. Some prime ministers such as William Gladstone mainly wrote tracts and tomes on theology and religion and Benjamin Disraeli wrote many best-selling novels in addition to memoirs and history.

In the 21st century, many former prime ministers have set up their own foundations and charities to be used as a platform to continue involvement in political and public issues after they leave office. In 1991, Margaret Thatcher became the first prime minister to set up her own foundation to try to secure her legacy and propagate her ideology known as Thatcherism, but it closed down in 2005. Tony Blair has set up a sports foundation, an inter-faith foundation and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in 2016. In his post-premiership, Blair is also the first prime minister to take on a major international role, as an official envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East. Gordon Brown was actively involved in politics long after he left office, most notably during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which he campaigned for the no vote that advocated Scotland to remain in the union.

However, some former prime ministers have returned to serve in the governments of their successors, and a few have had &#x27;retreads&#x27; that saw them serve short tenures due to their successors unexpectedly resigning or passing away. Notable cases include the Duke of Wellington who, after serving two brief terms in office, was able to command significant influence as a senior member of the Tory party and returned to serve in two governments of his successor, Sir Robert Peel, as Foreign Secretary and Minister without portfolio. He later retired to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Army from 1842 until his death in 1852. Arthur Balfour served as prime minister for three years of his term after he was defeated in the 1906 general election and later went on to serve as the Foreign Secretary for eleven years in the imperial war cabinet during and after World War I under three prime ministers. After Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister in May 1940, he returned to serve under Winston Churchill in his subsequent war cabinet. Alec Douglas-Home, who resigned after losing the 1964 general election, later came to serve in the cabinet of Edward Heath in 1970.

=== Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA) ===

All former prime ministers are entitled to claim for salary or office expenses incurred in fulfilling public duties in that role. The allowance may not be used to pay for private or parliamentary duties. It is administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.

The maximum amount which may be claimed per year is £115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the current prime minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downwards if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other public appointments. Downing Street confirmed in November 2023 that former prime minister David Cameron would not claim from the PDCA while he acted as Foreign Secretary.

<text>Platyhelminthes (from the Greek πλατύ, &quot;platy&quot;, meaning &quot;flat&quot; and ἕλμινς (root: ἑλμινθ-), &quot;helminth-&quot;, meaning &quot;worm&quot;) is a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates commonly called flatworms or flat worms. Being acoelomates (having no body cavity), and having no specialised circulatory and respiratory organs, they are restricted to having flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food can not be processed continuously.

In traditional medicinal texts, Platyhelminthes are divided into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated. Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments, such as leaf litter. Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts. The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids that detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs. Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.

Because they do not have internal body cavities, Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians – closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined Platyhelminthes is part of the Spiralia, one of the two main groups of Protostomia. These analyses had concluded the redefined Platyhelminthes, excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup &quot;Turbellaria&quot; is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of &quot;turbellarians&quot;.

Two planarian species have been used successfully in the Philippines, Indonesia, Hawaii, New Guinea, and Guam to control populations of the imported giant African snail &quot;Achatina fulica&quot;, which was displacing native snails. However, these planarians are themselves a serious threat to native snails and should not be used for biological control. In northwest Europe, there are concerns about the spread of the New Zealand planarian &quot;Arthurdendyus triangulatus&quot;, which preys on earthworms.

==Description==

===Distinguishing features===

Platyhelminthes are bilaterally symmetrical animals: their left and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct top and bottom surfaces and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers. Beyond that, they are &quot;defined more by what they do not have than by any particular series of specializations.&quot; Unlike most other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. Although the absence of a coelom also occurs in other bilaterians: gnathostomulids, gastrotrichs, xenacoelomorphs, cycliophorans, entoproctans and the parastic mesozoans. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm&#x27;s anatomy. Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.

===Features common to all subgroups===

The lack of circulatory and respiratory organs limits platyhelminths to sizes and shapes that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave all parts of their bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic, and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. Because there is no circulatory system which can transport nutrients around, the guts of large species have many branches, allowing the nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.

The space between the skin and gut is filled with mesenchyme, also known as parenchyma, a connective tissue made of cells and reinforced by collagen fibers that act as a type of skeleton, providing attachment points for muscles. The mesenchyme contains all the internal organs and allows the passage of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. It consists of two main types of cell: fixed cells, some of which have fluid-filled vacuoles; and stem cells, which can transform into any other type of cell, and are used in regenerating tissues after injury or asexual reproduction.

Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested material through the mouth. The genus &quot;Paracatenula&quot;, whose members include tiny flatworms living in symbiosis with bacteria, is even missing a mouth and a gut. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts have more than one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).

All animals need to keep the concentration of dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of dissolved material, and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use the same system to control the concentration of their body fluids. Flame cells, so called because the beating of their flagella looks like a flickering candle flame, extract from the mesenchyme water that contains wastes and some reusable material, and drive it into networks of tube cells which are lined with flagella and microvilli. The tube cells&#x27; flagella drive the water towards exits called nephridiopores, while their microvilli reabsorb reusable materials and as much water as is needed to keep the body fluids at the right concentration. These combinations of flame cells and tube cells are called protonephridia.

In all platyhelminths, the nervous system is concentrated at the head end. Other platyhelminths have rings of ganglia in the head and main nerve trunks running along their bodies.

==Major subgroups==

Early classification divided the flatworms in four groups: Turbellaria, Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda. This classification had long been recognized to be artificial, and in 1985, Ehlers proposed a phylogenetically more correct classification, where the massively polyphyletic &quot;Turbellaria&quot; was split into a dozen orders, and Trematoda, Monogenea and Cestoda were joined in the new order Neodermata. However, the classification presented here is the early, traditional, classification, as it still is the one used everywhere except in scientific articles.

===Turbellaria===



These have about 4,500 species, are mostly free-living, and range from to in length. Most are predators or scavengers, and terrestrial species are mostly nocturnal and live in shaded, humid locations, such as leaf litter or rotting wood. However, some are symbiotes of other animals, such as crustaceans, and some are parasites. Free-living turbellarians are mostly black, brown or gray, but some larger ones are brightly colored. The Acoela and Nemertodermatida were traditionally regarded as turbellarians, but are now regarded as members of a separate phylum, the Acoelomorpha, or as two separate phyla. &quot;Xenoturbella&quot;, a genus of very simple animals, has also been reclassified as a separate phylum.

Some turbellarians have a simple pharynx lined with cilia and generally feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually in the middle of their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species &quot;Microstomum caudatum&quot; can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself. Predatory species in suborder Kalyptorhynchia often have a muscular pharynx equipped with hooks or teeth used for seizing prey.

Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli (&quot;little eyes&quot;); one pair in most species, but two or even three pairs in others. A few large species have many eyes in clusters over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly around the edge of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming to enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts - fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to function as balance and acceleration sensors, as they perform the same way in cnidarian medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, so the way they sense the movements and positions of solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are most likely smell sensors.

Planarians, a subgroup of seriates, are famous for their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that (in fragments that do not already have a head) a new head grows most quickly on those fragments which were originally located closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes throughout the organism, from head to tail. Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, whilst others, reproduce by budding.

The vast majority of turbellarians are hermaphrodites (they have both female and male reproductive cells) which fertilize eggs internally by copulation. Some of the larger aquatic species mate by penis fencing – a duel in which each tries to impregnate the other, and the loser adopts the female role of developing the eggs. In most species, &quot;miniature adults&quot; emerge when the eggs hatch, but a few large species produce plankton-like larvae.
===Trematoda===

These parasites&#x27; name refers to the cavities in their holdfasts (Greek τρῆμα, hole), which resemble suckers and anchor them within their hosts. The skin of all species is a syncitium, which is a layer of cells that shares a single external membrane. Trematodes are divided into two groups, Digenea and Aspidogastrea (also known as Aspodibothrea).

====Digenea====


These are often called flukes, as most have flat rhomboid shapes like that of a flounder (Old English ). There are about 11,000 species, more than all other platyhelminthes combined, and second only to roundworms among parasites on metazoans. Adults usually have two holdfasts: a ring around the mouth and a larger sucker midway along what would be the underside in a free-living flatworm.
Although the name &quot;Digeneans&quot; means &quot;two generations&quot;, most have very complex life cycles with up to seven stages, depending on what combinations of environments the early stages encounter – the most important factor being whether the eggs are deposited on land or in water. The intermediate stages transfer the parasites from one host to another. The definitive host in which adults develop is a land vertebrate; the earliest host of juvenile stages is usually a snail that may live on land or in water, whilst in many cases, a fish or arthropod is the second host. For example, the adjoining illustration shows the life cycle of the intestinal fluke &quot;metagonimus&quot;, which hatches in the intestine of a snail, then moves to a fish where it penetrates the body and encysts in the flesh, then migrating to the small intestine of a land animal that eats the fish raw, finally generating eggs that are excreted and ingested by snails, thereby completing the cycle. A similar life cycle occurs with &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot;, which is found in South East Asia and can infect the liver of humans, causing Cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). Schistosomes, which cause the devastating tropical disease bilharzia, also belong to this group.

Adults range between and in length. Individual adult digeneans are of a single sex, and in some species slender females live in enclosed grooves that run along the bodies of the males, partially emerging to lay eggs. In all species the adults have complex reproductive systems, capable of producing between 10,000 and 100,000 times as many eggs as a free-living flatworm. In addition, the intermediate stages that live in snails reproduce asexually.

Adults of different species infest different parts of the definitive host - for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adult and snail-inhabiting stages, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.

====Aspidogastrea====

Members of this small group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or cartilaginous fish, turtles, or the body cavities of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.

===Cercomeromorpha===

Cercomeromorpha contains parasites attach themselves to their hosts by means of disks that bear crescent-shaped hooks. They are divided into the Monogenea and Cestoda groupings.

====Monogenea====

Of about 1,100 species of monogeneans, most are external parasites that require particular host species - mainly fish, but in some cases amphibians or aquatic reptiles. However, a few are internal parasites. Adult monogeneans have large attachment organs at the rear, known as haptors (Greek ἅπτειν, &quot;haptein&quot;, means &quot;catch&quot;), which have suckers, clamps, and hooks. They often have flattened bodies. In some species, the pharynx secretes enzymes to digest the host&#x27;s skin, allowing the parasite to feed on blood and cellular debris. Others graze externally on mucus and flakes of the hosts&#x27; skins. The name &quot;Monogenea&quot; is based on the fact that these parasites have only one nonlarval generation.

====Cestoda====

These are often called tapeworms because of their flat, slender but very long bodies – the name &quot;cestode&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;cestus&quot;, which means &quot;tape&quot;. The adults of all 3,400 cestode species are internal parasites. Cestodes have no mouths or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs nutrients – mainly carbohydrates and amino acids – from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host&#x27;s immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host&#x27;s diet stunts the growth of parasites and may even kill them. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, compensating for this inefficiency by consuming large amounts of food relative to their physical size.

In the majority of species, known as eucestodes (&quot;true tapeworms&quot;), the neck produces a chain of segments called proglottids via a process known as strobilation. As a result, the most mature proglottids are furthest from the scolex. Adults of &quot;Taenia saginata&quot;, which infests humans, can form proglottid chains over long, although is more typical. Each proglottid has both male and female reproductive organs. If the host&#x27;s gut contains two or more adults of the same cestode species they generally fertilize each other, however, proglottids of the same worm can fertilize each other and even themselves. When the eggs are fully developed, the proglottids separate and are excreted by the host. The eucestode life cycle is less complex than that of digeneans, but varies depending on the species. For example:
* Adults of &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod crustaceans as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids release their eggs into the water where the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia and the skin becomes a syncitium; the larva then makes its way into the copepod&#x27;s hemocoel (an internal cavity which is the central part of the circulatory system) where it attaches itself using three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and grows into an adult.
* Various species of &quot;Taenia&quot; infest the guts of humans, cats and dogs. The juveniles use herbivores – such as pigs, cattle and rabbits – as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids release eggs that stick to grass leaves and hatch after being swallowed by a herbivore. The larva then makes its way to the herbivore&#x27;s muscle tissue, where it metamorphoses into an oval worm about long, with a scolex that is kept internally. When the definitive host eats infested raw or undercooked meat from an intermediate host, the worm&#x27;s scolex pops out and attaches itself to the gut, when the adult tapeworm develops.

Members of the smaller group known as Cestodaria have no scolex, do not produce proglottids, and have body shapes similar to those of diageneans. Cestodarians parasitize fish and turtles.
==Classification and evolutionary relationships==

The relationships of Platyhelminthes to other Bilateria are shown in the phylogenetic tree:

The internal relationships of Platyhelminthes are shown below. The tree is not fully resolved.

The oldest confidently identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs found in a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber and placed in the monotypic species &quot;Micropalaeosoma balticus&quot;, whilst the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies - distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes (but no other animals) exhibit. This makes it difficult to work out their relationships with other groups of animals, as well as the relationships between different groups that are described as members of the Platyhelminthes.

The &quot;traditional&quot; view before the 1990s was that Platyhelminthes formed the sister group to all the other bilaterians, which include, for instance, arthropods, molluscs, annelids and chordates. Since then, molecular phylogenetics, which aims to work out evolutionary &quot;family trees&quot; by comparing different organisms&#x27; biochemicals such as DNA, RNA and proteins, has radically changed scientists&#x27; view of evolutionary relationships between animals. Flatworms are now recognized as secondarily simplified bilaterians.

Detailed morphological analyses of anatomical features in the mid-1980s, as well as molecular phylogenetics analyses since 2000 using different sections of DNA, agree that Acoelomorpha, consisting of Acoela (traditionally regarded as very simple &quot;turbellarians&quot;) and Nemertodermatida (another small group previously classified as &quot;turbellarians&quot;) are the sister group to all other bilaterians. However, a 2007 study concluded that Acoela and Nemertodermatida were two distinct groups of bilaterians.

&quot;Xenoturbella&quot;, a bilaterian whose only well-defined organ is a statocyst, was originally classified as a &quot;primitive turbellarian&quot;. Later studies suggested it may instead be a deuterostome, but more detailed molecular phylogenetics have led to its classification as sister-group to the Acoelomorpha.

The Platyhelminthes excluding Acoelomorpha contain two main groups - Catenulida and Rhabditophora - both of which are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of an ancestor that is a member of the same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group; a study in 2008 concluded that they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.

Other molecular phylogenetics analyses agree the redefined Platyhelminthes are most closely related to Gastrotricha, and both are part of a grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority of researchers regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.

It has been agreed since 1985 that each of the wholly parasitic platyhelminth groups (Cestoda, Monogenea and Trematoda) is monophyletic, and that together these form a larger monophyletic grouping, the Neodermata, in which the adults of all members have syncytial skins. However, there is debate about whether the Cestoda and Monogenea can be combined as an intermediate monophyletic group, the Cercomeromorpha, within the Neodermata. It is generally agreed that the Neodermata are a sub-group a few levels down in the &quot;family tree&quot; of the Rhabditophora. Hence the traditional sub-phylum &quot;Turbellaria&quot; is paraphyletic, since it does not include the Neodermata although these are descendants of a sub-group of &quot;turbellarians&quot;.

==Evolution==

An outline of the origins of the parasitic lifestyle has been proposed; epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.

In several members of the order Rhabdocoela an endosymbiotic relationship with microalgae has evolved. Some species in the same order has also evolved kleptoplasty.

The earliest known fossils confidently classified as tapeworms have been dated to , after being found in coprolites (fossilised faeces) from an elasmobranch. Putative older fossils include a ribbon-shaped, bilaterally symmetrical organism named &quot;Rugosusivitta orthogonia&quot; from the Early Cambrian of China, brownish bodies on the bedding planes reported from the Late Ordovician (Katian) Vauréal Formation (Canada) by Knaust &amp; Desrochers (2019), tentatively interpreted as turbellarians (though the authors cautioned that they might ultimately turn out to be fossils of acoelomorphs or nemerteans) and circlets of fossil hooks preserved with placoderm and acanthodian fossils from the Devonian of Latvia, at least some of which might represent parasitic monogeneans.

==Interaction with humans==

===Parasitism===

Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause diseases in humans and their livestock, whilst monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200 million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but usually presents as a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, increasing the risk of bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus &quot;Schistosoma&quot;, which can bore through human skin; those most at risk use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.

In 2000, an estimated 45 million people were infected with the beef tapeworm &quot;Taenia saginata&quot; and 3 million with the pork tapeworm &quot;Taenia solium&quot;. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that, whilst unpleasant, are seldom disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of &quot;T. solium&quot; larvae into the central nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm &quot;Diphyllobothrium latum&quot; occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.

The threat to humans in developed countries is rising as a result of social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of human feces (night soil) as fertilizer or to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, whilst poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries usually cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters who are desperate for rapid weight-loss.

===Pests===

There is concern in northwest Europe (including the British Isles) regarding the possible proliferation of the New Zealand planarian &quot;Arthurdendyus triangulatus&quot; and the Australian flatworm &quot;Australoplana sanguinea&quot;, both of which prey on earthworms. &quot;A. triangulatus&quot; is thought to have reached Europe in containers of plants imported by botanical gardens.

===Benefits===

In Hawaii, the planarian &quot;Endeavouria septemlineata&quot; has been used to control the imported giant African snail &quot;Achatina fulica&quot;, which was displacing native snails; &quot;Platydemus manokwari&quot;, another planarian, has been used for the same purpose in Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea and Guam. Although &quot;A. fulica&quot; has declined sharply in Hawaii, there are doubts about how much &quot;E. septemlineata&quot; contributed to this decline. However, &quot;P. manokwari&quot; is given credit for severely reducing, and in places exterminating, &quot;A. fulica&quot; – achieving much greater success than most biological pest control programs, which generally aim for a low, stable population of the pest species. The ability of planarians to take different kinds of prey and to resist starvation may account for their ability to decimate &quot;A. fulica&quot;. However, these planarians are a serious threat to native snails and should never be used for biological control.

A study in Argentina shows the potential for planarians such as &quot;Girardia anceps&quot;, &quot;Mesostoma ehrenbergii&quot;, and &quot;Bothromesostoma evelinae&quot; to reduce populations of the mosquito species &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; and &quot;Culex pipiens&quot;. The experiment showed that &quot;G. anceps&quot; can prey on all instars of both mosquito species, yet maintain a steady predation rate over time. The ability of these flatworms to live in artificial containers demonstrated the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which might reduce the amount of mosquito-borne disease.

<text>Pope Celestine I () (c. 376 – 1 August 432) was the bishop of Rome from 10 September 422 to his death on 1 August 432. Celestine&#x27;s pontificate was largely spent combatting various teachings deemed heretical. He was instrumental for the condemnation of Nestorius in the Council of Ephesus when 
Cyril of Alexandria appealed him to make a decision, which in response, Celestine delegated Cyril the job of condemning Nestorius if he did not recant his teachings. He supported the mission of the Gallic bishops that sent Germanus of Auxerre in 429, to Britain to address Pelagianism, and later commissioned Palladius as bishop to the Scots of Ireland and northern Britain.

==Early life and family==
Celestine I was a Roman from the region of Campania. Nothing is known of his early history except that his father&#x27;s name was Priscus. According to John Gilmary Shea, Celestine was a relative of the emperor Valentinian. He is said to have lived for a time at Milan with St. Ambrose. The first known record of him is in a document of Pope Innocent I from the year 416, where he is spoken of as &quot;Celestine the Deacon&quot;.

==Pontificate==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, the start of his papacy was 3 November. However, Tillemont places the date at 10 September. The Vatican also gives his pontificate as starting on 10 September 422.

Various portions of the liturgy are attributed to Celestine I, but without any certainty on the subject. In 430, he held a synod in Rome, at which the teachings of Nestorius were condemned. The following year, he sent delegates to the First Council of Ephesus, which addressed the same issue. Four letters written by him on that occasion, all dated 15 March 431, together with a few others, to the African bishops, to those of Illyria, of Thessalonica, and of Narbonne, are extant in re-translations from the Greek; the Latin originals having been lost.

Celestine actively condemned the Pelagians and was zealous for Roman orthodoxy. To this end he was involved in the initiative of the Gallic bishops to send Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of Troyes travelling to Britain in 429 to confront bishops reportedly holding Pelagian views.

He sent Palladius to Ireland to serve as a bishop in 431. Celestine strongly opposed the Novatians in Rome; as Socrates Scholasticus writes, &quot;this Celestinus took away the churches from the Novatians at Rome also, and obliged Rusticulus their bishop to hold his meetings secretly in private houses.&quot; The Novationists refused absolution to the lapsi, but Celestine argued that reconciliation should never be refused to any dying sinner who sincerely asked for it. He was zealous in refusing to tolerate the smallest innovation on the constitutions of his predecessors. As St. Vincent of Lerins reported in 434:

:Holy Pope Celestine also expresses himself in like manner and to the same effect. For in the Epistle which he wrote to the priests of Gaul, charging them with connivance with error, in that by their silence they failed in their duty to the ancient faith, and allowed profane novelties to spring up, he says: &quot;We are deservedly to blame if we encourage error by silence. Therefore rebuke these people. Restrain their liberty of preaching.&quot;

In a letter to certain bishops of Gaul, dated 428, Celestine rebukes the adoption of special clerical garb by the clergy. He wrote: &quot;We [the bishops and clergy] should be distinguished from the common people [plebe] by our learning, not by our clothes; by our conduct, not by our dress; by cleanness of mind, not by the care we spend upon our person&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

Celestine died on 26 July 432. He was buried in the cemetery of St. Priscilla in the Via Salaria, but his body, subsequently moved, now lies in the Basilica di Santa Prassede. In art, Celestine is portrayed as a pope with a dove, dragon, and flame, and is recognized by the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, and Catholic Churches as a saint.

<text>Pope Celestine II (; died 8 March 1144), born Guido di Castello, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 26 September 1143 to his death in 1144.

==Early life==
Guido di Castello, possibly the son of a local noble, Niccolo di Castello, was born either in Città di Castello, situated in Paterna Santa Felicità upon the Apennines, or at Macerata in the March of Ancona.

Guido had studied under Pierre Abélard, and eventually became a distinguished master in the schools. Eventually Guido began his career in Rome as a subdeacon and a &quot;scriptor apostolicus&quot; under Pope Callixtus II. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pope Honorius II in 1127; as such, he signed the papal bulls issued between 3 April 1130 and 21 December 1133. In the double papal election of 1130 he joined the obedience of Pope Innocent II. In December 1133 Innocent promoted him to the rank of Cardinal-Priest of San Marco. He signed the papal bulls as &quot;S.R.E. indignus sacerdos&quot; between 11 January 1134 and 16 May 1143. As the cardinal of San Marco&#x27;s, he supported Innocent&#x27;s claims with regards to Monte Cassino, and as a mark of his confidence in him, Innocent made Guido the rector of Benevento. Afterwards, he made him a papal legate to France in 1140.

He participated in the papal election of 1143, the first undisturbed papal election that Rome had seen for eighty-two years, and was elected pope two days after the death of Innocent II, on 25 September 1143, taking the name of Celestine.

==Papacy==
Celestine II governed the Catholic Church for only five months and thirteen days from his election until his death on 8 March 1144. Upon his accession he wrote to Peter the Venerable and the monks of Cluny, asking them to pray for him, while he was congratulated by Arnulf of Lisieux. Regardless of the brevity of his reign, he was prepared to chart a very different course from that of his predecessor. He was opposed to Innocent II&#x27;s concessions to King Roger II of Sicily and refused to ratify the Treaty of Mignano (&quot;a foolish policy, which he survived – just – long enough to regret&quot;). He was in favor of the Plantagenets&#x27; claim to the English throne, and was therefore opposed to King Stephen of England. To emphasise this shift, he refused to renew the legatine authority that Innocent II had granted to King Stephen&#x27;s brother, Henry of Blois. Celestine also favored the Templars, ordering a general collection for them, as well as the Hospitallers, giving them control of the hospital of Saint Mary Teutonicorum in Jerusalem.

The principal act of his papacy was the absolution of Louis VII of France. King Louis had refused to accept the nomination of Pierre de la Chatre as the archbishop of Bourges, who went to see Innocent II to have his nomination confirmed. When Pierre returned to France in 1142, Louis refused him permission to enter his episcopal city, causing Pierre to flee to the court of Count Theobald II of Champagne. Innocent responded by placing France under an interdict. For two years, the various parties remained at loggerheads while Bernard of Clairvaux attempted to mediate the dispute. With the election of Celestine, both Bernard and Theobald appealed to the pope, while Louis sent ambassadors to have the interdict lifted. Louis agreed to accept Pierre as the legitimate archbishop of Bourges, and in return, Celestine removed the sentence of interdict.

Celestine died on 8 March 1144 in the monastery of Saint Sebastian on the Palatine hill and was buried in the south transept of the Lateran. Celestine&#x27;s heraldic badge was a lozengy shield of argent and gules.

Celestine II is the first pope listed in the Prophecies of St Malachy.

<text>Pope Celestine III (; c. 1105 – 8 January 1198), was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 30 March or 10 April 1191 to his death in 1198. He had a tense relationship with several monarchs, including Emperor Henry VI, King Tancred of Sicily, and King Alfonso IX of León.

==Early career==
Giacinto Bobone was born into the noble Orsini family in Rome. He was appointed as cardinal-deacon in 1144 by Celestine II or Lucius II. Considered by the Roman Curia as an expert on Spain, Bobone conducted two legatine missions to Spain in (1154–55) and (1172–75) as the Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.

==Pontificate==
Celestine was elected on 29/30 March 1191 and ordained a priest 13 April 1191. He crowned Emperor Henry VI a day or two after his ordination. In 1192, Celestine recognized Tancred as king of Sicily, despite Henry VI&#x27;s wife&#x27;s claim. He threatened to excommunicate Henry VI for wrongfully keeping King Richard I of England imprisoned, but he could do little else since the college of cardinals were against it. 
He placed Pisa under an interdict, which was lifted by his successor, Innocent III in 1198.

Celestine, in 1192, sent a cardinal-priest of St. Lorenzo, Cinthius, to Denmark to address the discord between the Danish princes. Upon Cinthius&#x27; return to Rome, Celestine issued three papal bulls;&quot;Cum Romana ecclesia&quot;, &quot;Etsi sedes debeat&quot;, &quot;Quanto magnitudinem tuam&quot;. These bulls advised the archbishop Absalon of Lund to instruct the King of Denmark to release the bishop of Schleswig. The bulls also threatened to excommunicate the offending Duke Valdemar, who had imprisoned the bishop of Schleswig, and place the kingdom of Denmark under interdict. The bishop would stay imprisoned until Pope Innocent III restarted the process in 1203.

Celestine condemned King Alfonso IX of León for his marriage to Theresa of Portugal on the grounds of consanguinity. Portugal and León were placed under interdict. Then, in 1196, he excommunicated Alfonso IX for allying with the Almohad Caliphate while making war on Castile. Following his marriage with Berengaria of Castile, Celestine excommunicated Alfonso and placed an interdict over León.

In December 1196, Celestine issued a bull acknowledging the possessions of the Teutonic Knights.

==Death==
Celestine would have resigned the papacy and recommended a successor (Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo, O.S.B.) shortly before his death, but was not allowed to do so by the cardinals.

<text>Pope Celestine IV (; c. 1180/1187 − 10 November 1241), born Goffredo da Castiglione, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States for only a few days from 25 October 1241 to his death on 10 November 1241.

== History ==
Born in Milan, Goffredo or Godfrey is often referred to as son of a sister of Pope Urban III, but this claim is without foundation. Nothing is known of his early life until he became chancellor of the church of Milan (perhaps as early as 1219, certainly in 1223–27). Pope Gregory IX made him a cardinal on 18 September 1227 with the diocese and of San Marco, and in 1228–29 sent him as legate in Lombardy and Tuscany, where the cities and communes had generally remained true to the Hohenstaufen emperor, Frederick II. He was dispatched in an attempt to bring these territories around to the papal side, but without success. In 1238, he was made cardinal bishop of Sabina.

The papal election of 1241, which elevated Celestine to the papal throne, was held under stringent conditions that hastened his death. The papal curia was disunited over the violent struggle to bring the Emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II to heel. One group of cardinals favored the ambitious schemes of the Gregorian Reform and aimed to humble Frederick as a papal vassal. Frederick, however, controlled as his unwilling guests in Tivoli two cardinals whom he had captured at sea, and in Rome Cardinal Giovanni Colonna was his ally, largely because the curia was in the hands of the archenemy of the Colonna family, the senator Matteo Rosso Orsini. The latter held the consistory captive under the control of his guards in the ramshackle palace of the Septizodium, where rain leaked through the roof of their chamber, mingled with the urine of Orsini&#x27;s guards on the rooftiles. One of the cardinals, the Englishman Robert of Somercotes, fell ill and died.

One group of cardinals, which included Sinibaldo de&#x27; Fieschi (soon to be Pope Innocent IV) supported a candidate from the inner circle of Pope Gregory IX, who could be expected to pursue a hard line with Frederick II. Another group advocated a moderate middle course, not as allies of the Hohenstaufen, but desirous to achieve an end to the war in Italy. Overtures to Frederick II, however, were met with the impossible demand that if they wished the cardinals in his hands to return to Rome, they must elect as pope Otto of St. Nicholas, an amenable compromise figure. Matteo Rosso Orsini&#x27;s candidate, Romano da Porto, who had persecuted scholars at the University of Paris, was considered unacceptable.

Only on 25 October 1241 was the cardinal bishop of Sabina finally elected by the required two-thirds majority, seven cardinals out of ten. He took the name Pope Celestine IV but occupied the throne for only seventeen days. It is said that this was nevertheless long enough for him to proceed, as his only significant act, with the excommunication of Matteo Rosso Orsini. This assertion is disputed, it being said that in fact, Orsini continued as Senator of Rome in 1242 and was Senator when Innocent IV (Fieschi) was elected; and that his son (the future Nicholas III) was made a cardinal in 1244. In any event, Celestine IV died before he could be crowned, on 10 November 1241, of fatigue and old age, and was entombed in St Peter&#x27;s.

<text>Pope Celestine V (; 1209/1210 or 1215 – 19 May 1296), born Pietro Angelerio (according to some sources &quot;Angelario&quot;, &quot;Angelieri&quot;, &quot;Angelliero&quot;, or &quot;Angeleri&quot;), also known as Pietro da Morrone, Peter of Morrone, and Peter Celestine, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States for five months from 5 July to 13 December 1294, when he resigned. He was also a monk and hermit who founded the order of the Celestines as a branch of the Benedictine order.

He was elected pope in the Catholic Church&#x27;s last non-conclave papal election, ending a two-year impasse. Among the few edicts of his to remain in force is the confirmation of the right of the pope to resign; nearly all of his other official acts were annulled by his successor, Boniface VIII. On 13 December 1294, a week after issuing the decree, Celestine resigned, stating his desire to return to his humble, pre-papal life. He was subsequently imprisoned by Boniface in the castle of Fumone in the Lazio region, in order to prevent his potential installation as antipope. He died in prison on 19 May 1296.

Celestine was canonized on 5 May 1313 by Pope Clement V. No subsequent pope has taken the name Celestine.

==Early life==
Pietro Angelerio was born to Angelo Angelerio and Maria Leone in the rural region of Molise, in the Kingdom of Sicily. The exact village is believed to be Sant&#x27;Angelo Limosano, now part of the province of Campobasso in Italy. His father died when Pietro was five or six, leaving him the second-youngest of seven sons to have survived infancy, of twelve total born to Maria.

Maria was particularly fond of Pietro and encouraged his spiritual development, imagining a different future for her son than becoming just a farmer or shepherd as were the local occupations. She sold some family property to hire a tutor for him, which engendered resentment and hostility from his brothers. Despite this, Pietro took to education well and quickly learned to read the psalter.

He became a Benedictine monk at the in the Diocese of Benevento when he was 17. He showed an extraordinary disposition toward asceticism and solitude, and in the early 1230s retired to a solitary cavern on the Montagne del Morrone, hence his name (Peter of Morrone). He began attracting followers of his eremitic lifestyle, and gained a reputation as a miracle worker. In 1244, after a brief visit to Rome for his ordination, he left this retreat, and went with two companions to a similar cave on the even more remote Maiella mountain in the Abruzzi region of central Italy, where he continued to live as a strict ascetic according to the example of John the Baptist.

==Founding of the Celestines==
While living like this in 1244, he founded the order subsequently named after him, the Celestines. A new religious community was formed, and in 1254 Pietro formally issued a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices, influenced by the writings of Peter Damian, a renowned reformist monk. While fundamentally Benedictine, the order also had ties to radical Franciscans, who were dismayed by the Church&#x27;s increasing worldliness and political entanglements. A church was built at the foot of Morrone in 1259, and in June 1263 the new institution was formally approved by Pope Urban IV.

Having heard that it was probable that Pope Gregory X, then holding a council at Lyon, would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the Lateran Council had commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, Pietro went to Lyon. There, in 1274, he succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the Rule of Saint Benedict, but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Pietro lived to see himself as &quot;superior-general&quot; to thirty-six monasteries and more than six hundred monks.

In a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery at Maiella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the Abbey of the Holy Spirit in the plains near Sulmona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the general-superior, as it continued to be until the order was extinguished in the 19th century. Pietro took up residence in a cliffside hermitage overlooking the new monastery, but he would not remain undisturbed there for long.

==Election as pope==

The cardinals assembled at Perugia after the death of Pope Nicholas IV in April 1292. After more than two years, a consensus had still not been reached. Pietro, well known to the cardinals as a Benedictine hermit, sent the cardinals a letter warning them that divine vengeance would fall upon them if they did not quickly elect a pope. Latino Malabranca, the aged and ill Dean of the College of Cardinals cried out, &quot;In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I elect brother Pietro di Morrone!&quot; The cardinals promptly ratified Malabranca&#x27;s desperate decision. When sent for, Pietro obstinately refused to accept the papacy, and even, as Petrarch says, tried to flee, until he was finally persuaded by a deputation of cardinals accompanied by the king of Naples and the pretender to the throne of Hungary. Elected on 5 July 1294, he was crowned at Santa Maria di Collemaggio in the city of Aquila in the Abruzzo on 29 August, taking the name Celestine V.

==Papacy==
Shortly after assuming office, Celestine issued a papal bull granting a rare plenary indulgence to all pilgrims visiting Santa Maria di Collemaggio through its holy door on the anniversary of his papal coronation. The Celestinian forgiveness (&quot;Perdonanza Celestiniana&quot;) festival is celebrated in L&#x27;Aquila every 28–29 August in commemoration of this event.

With no political experience, Celestine proved to be an especially weak and ineffectual pope. He held his office in the Kingdom of Naples, out of contact with the Roman Curia and under the complete power of King Charles II. He appointed the king&#x27;s favorites to Church offices, sometimes several to the same office. One of these was Louis of Toulouse, whom Celestine ordered given clerical tonsure and minor orders, although this was not carried out. He renewed a decree of Pope Gregory X that had established stringent rules for papal conclaves after a similarly prolonged election. In one decree, he appointed three cardinals to govern the Church during Advent while he fasted, which was again refused.

Realizing his lack of authority and personal incompatibility with papal duties, he consulted with Cardinal Benedetto Caetani (his eventual successor) about the possibility of resignation. This resulted in one final decree declaring the right of resignation. He promptly exercised this right, resigning on 13 December 1294, after five months and eight days as pope. In the formal instrument of renunciation, he cited as the causes moving him to the step: &quot;The desire for humility, for a purer life, for a stainless conscience, the deficiencies of his own physical strength, his ignorance, the perverseness of the people, his longing for the tranquility of his former life&quot;. Having divested himself of every outward symbol of papal dignity, he slipped away from Naples and attempted to retire to his old life of solitude.

The next pope to resign of his own accord was Gregory XII in 1415 (to help end the Western Schism), followed by Benedict XVI in 2013, 719 years later.

==Retirement, death, and canonization==

The former Celestine, now reverted to Pietro Angelerio, was not allowed to become a hermit once again. Various parties had opposed his resignation and the new Pope Boniface VIII had reason to worry that one of them might install him as an antipope. To prevent this, he ordered Pietro to accompany him to Rome. Pietro escaped and hid in the woods before attempting to return to Sulmona to resume monastic life. This proved impossible, and Pietro was captured after an attempt to flee to Dalmatia was thwarted when a tempest forced his ship to return to port. Boniface imprisoned him in the castle of Fumone near Ferentino in Lazio, attended by two monks of his order, where Pietro died after 10 months at about the age of 81. His supporters spread the allegation that Boniface had treated him harshly and ultimately executed Pietro, but there is no clear historical evidence of this. Pietro was buried at Ferentino, but his body was subsequently moved to the Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio in L&#x27;Aquila.

Philip IV of France, who had supported Celestine and bitterly opposed Boniface, nominated Celestine for sainthood following the election of Pope Clement V. The latter signed a decree of dispensation on 13 May 1306 to investigate the nomination. He was canonized on 5 May 1313 after a consistory in which Boniface&#x27;s Caetani family was outvoted by members of the rival Colonna family.

==Legacy==
Most modern interest in Celestine V has focused on his resignation. He was the first pope to formalize the resignation process and is often said to have been the first to resign; in fact he was preceded in this by Pontian (235), John XVIII (1009), Benedict IX (1045), and Gregory VI (1046). As noted above, Celestine&#x27;s own decision was brought about by mild pressure from the Church establishment. His reinstitution of Gregory X&#x27;s conclave system established by the papal bull &quot;Ubi periculum&quot; has been respected ever since.

A 1966 visit by Pope Paul VI to Celestine&#x27;s place of death in Ferentino along with his speech in homage of Celestine prompted speculation that the Pontiff was considering retirement.

Celestine&#x27;s remains survived the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila earthquake with one Italian spokesman saying it was &quot;another great miracle by the pope&quot;. They were then recovered from the basilica shortly after the earthquake. While inspecting the earthquake damage during a 28 April 2009 visit to the Aquila, Pope Benedict XVI visited Celestine&#x27;s remains in the badly damaged Santa Maria di Collemaggio and left the woolen pallium he wore during his papal inauguration in April 2005 on his glass casket as a gift. Benedict XVI would go on to become the first pope since Celestine to voluntarily resign of his own initiative.

To mark the 800th anniversary of Celestine&#x27;s birth, Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed the Celestine year from 28 August 2009 through 29 August 2010. Benedict XVI visited the Sulmona Cathedral, near Aquila, on 4 July 2010 as part of his observance of the Celestine year and prayed before the altar consecrated by Celestine containing his relics on 10 October 1294.

His entry in the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot; for 19 May reads as follows:

==In literature==
A persistent tradition identifies Celestine V as the nameless figure Dante Alighieri sees among those in the antechamber of Hell, in the enigmatic verses:

The first commentators to make this identification included Dante&#x27;s son Jacopo Alighieri, followed by Graziolo Bambaglioli in 1324. The identification is also considered probable by recent scholars (e.g., Hollander, Barbara Reynolds, Simonelli, Padoan). Petrarch was moved to defend Celestine vigorously against the accusation of cowardice and some modern scholars (e.g., Mark Musa) have suggested Dante may have meant someone else (Esau, Diocletian and Pontius Pilate have been variously suggested).

In 1346, Petrarch declared in his &quot;De vita solitaria&quot; that Celestine&#x27;s refusal was a virtuous example of solitary life.

Pope Celestine V is referenced in Chapter 88 of Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot;, where he is controversially referenced as an example of a murdered pope. Brown writes that an X-ray of his tomb &quot;revealed a ten-inch nail driven into the Pope&#x27;s skull.&quot; While the reference to the X-ray is fictitious (no X-ray has ever been conducted on Celestine&#x27;s tomb), it has been indeed alleged that Celestine was murdered, possibly by order of his successor, Pope Boniface VIII; however, there is no historical evidence of this. A 2013 examination of the half-inch hole in Celestine&#x27;s skull found it to have occurred post-mortem, when the remains were already skeletonized, likely during a reburial.

The life of Pope Celestine V is dramatised in the plays (&quot;Story of a Humble Christian&quot;) by Ignazio Silone in 1968 and &quot;Sunsets and Glories&quot; by Peter Barnes in 1990.

His life is the subject of the short story &quot;Brother of the Holy Ghost&quot; in Brendan Connell&#x27;s short story collection &quot;The Life of Polycrates and Other Stories for Antiquated Children&quot;.

He is the subject of a popular history by author Jon M. Sweeney, &quot;The Pope Who Quit: A True Medieval Tale of Mystery, Death, and Salvation&quot;, published by Image Books/Random House in 2012. In 2013, HBO optioned the film rights.

Celestine V is the subject of the poem by the modern Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy.

<text>Pueblo ( ) is a home rule municipality that is the county seat and the most populous municipality of Pueblo County, Colorado, United States. The city population was 111,876 at the 2020 United States census, making Pueblo the ninth most populous city in Colorado. Pueblo is the principal city of the Pueblo, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor.

Pueblo is situated at the confluence of the Arkansas River and Fountain Creek, south of the Colorado State Capitol in Denver. The area is considered semi-arid desert land, with approximately of precipitation annually. With its location in the &quot;Banana Belt&quot;, Pueblo tends to get less snow than the other major cities in Colorado.

Pueblo is one of the largest steel-producing cities in the United States, for which reason Pueblo is referred to as the &quot;Steel City&quot;. The Historic Arkansas River Project (HARP) is a riverwalk in the Union Avenue Historic Commercial District, and shows the history of the devastating Pueblo Flood of 1921.

==History==
===El Pueblo===

James Beckwourth, George Simpson, and other trappers such as Mathew Kinkead and John Brown, claimed to have helped construct the plaza that became known as El Pueblo around 1842. According to accounts of residents who traded at the plaza (including that of George Simpson), the Fort Pueblo Massacre happened sometime between December 23 and 25, 1854, by a war party of Utes and Jicarilla Apaches under the leadership of Tierra Blanca, a Ute chief. They allegedly killed between fifteen and nineteen men, as well as captured two children and one woman. The trading post was abandoned after the raid, but it became important again between 1858 and 1859 during the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859.

=== Early development: railroads, steel, expansion, and orphanages ===

The current city of Pueblo represents the consolidation of four towns: Pueblo (incorporated 1870), South Pueblo (incorporated 1873), Central Pueblo (incorporated 1882), and Bessemer (incorporated 1886). Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6, 1886. Bessemer joined Pueblo in 1894.

The consolidated city became a major economic and social center of Colorado, and was home to important early Colorado families such as the Thatchers, the Ormans, and the Adams. By the early 1870s the city was being hailed as a beacon of development, with newspapers like the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; boasting of how the region&#x27;s lawless reputation was giving way to orderly agriculture with triumphalist rhetoric. One author crowed of Pueblo that &quot;the necessity exists no longer for Sharp&#x27;s rifles and revolvers. These have been [supplanted] by the plow and the mowing-machine.&quot;

Pueblo&#x27;s development stretched beyond agriculture. Steel emerged as a key industry very early, and in 1909 the city was considered the only steel town west of the Mississippi River.

Until a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the &#x27;Saddle-Making capital of the World&#x27;. Roughly one-third of Pueblo&#x27;s downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo struggled with this significant loss, but has had a resurgence in growth.

Historically, many people were influenced by the orphanages of Pueblo, and the homes are now all historical sites. The three orphanages in Pueblo were known as Sacred Heart, Lincoln, and McClelland. Lincoln was the first historically black orphanage in Colorado, and one of only seven in the country. Sacred Heart was run by the Catholic Welfare Bureau, while McClelland was run by the Lutheran Church. Several children from Cuba were placed at Sacred Heart as part of &quot;Operation Pedro Pan&quot;. Though the orphanages in Pueblo are no longer in service, the buildings still exist and have transformed with the times. According to the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, in 1988 the Sacred Heart Orphanage was bought by the Pueblo Housing Authority and turned into 40 small-family housing units.

===Steel mill===

The main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&amp;I) Steel Mill on the south side of town. For nearly a century the CF&amp;I was the largest employer in the state of Colorado. The steel-market crash of 1982 led to the decline of the company. After several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by Oregon Steel Mills and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. The buyout, as well as the end of the union contract in 1997 led to a union strike over pension liabilities, as well as working conditions, wherein the union argued the new owners still needed to pay the pension liabilities provided by the previous owners. With the conclusion of the strike on December 30, 1997, CF&amp;I had replaced several hundred union workers with local employees.

In September 2004, both United Steelworkers locals 2102 and 3267 won the strike and the unfair labor practice charges. All of the striking steel workers returned to their jobs, and the company paid them the back pay owed for the seven years they were on strike. In 2007, shortly after Oregon Steel made amends with the union and its workers, Evraz Group, one of Russia&#x27;s biggest steel producers, agreed to buy the company for $2.3 billion.

Of the many production and fabrication mills that once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF&amp;I brand name. The facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the steel market collapsed. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content, many of the adjacent stoves still remain. The stoves and foundations for some of the furnaces can be seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant&#x27;s west boundary.

Several of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the Bessemer Historical Society. In 2006, they underwent renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&amp;I Archives, they also house the Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture.

===&quot;Melting Pot of the West&quot;===
Due to the growth of the CF&amp;I steel mill and the employment that it offered, Pueblo in the early twentieth century attracted a large number of immigrant laborers. The groups represented led to Pueblo becoming the most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Colorado and the West. At one point, more than 40 languages were spoken in the steel mill and more than two-dozen foreign language newspapers were published in the city. Irish, Italian, German, Slovenian, Greek, Jewish, Lithuanian, Russian, Hungarian, Japanese, and African-American groups arrived in the area at the turn of the century and remain to the present time. The convergence of cultures led to a cosmopolitan character to the city that resulted in a number of ethnically rooted neighborhoods that are typically not seen west of the Mississippi. Respective cultural groups maintain cultural festivals to the present, with the city being home to locations of the Order Sons of Italy, American Slovenian Catholic Union, and I.O.O.F., among others.

===Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo===
Another major employer in Pueblo is Colorado State Hospital. The hospital is the preeminent mental health facility in the Rocky Mountain region. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum, it was renamed as the Colorado State Hospital in 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). The Robert L. Hawkins High Security Forensic Institute opened in June 2009 and is a 200-bed, high-security facility.

===Home of Heroes===
Pueblo is the hometown of four Medal of Honor recipients (tied only with Holland, Michigan, also with four, each having more than any other municipality in the United States): William J. Crawford, Carl L. Sitter, Raymond G. Murphy, and Drew D. Dix. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, upon presenting Raymond G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Murphy with his medal in 1953, commented, &quot;What is it... something in the water out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!&quot;

In 1993, Pueblo City Council adopted the tagline &quot;Home of Heroes&quot; for the city due to the fact that Pueblo can claim more recipients of the Medal per capita than any other city in the United States. On July 1, 1993, the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; recognized Pueblo as the &quot;Home of Heroes.&quot; A memorial to the recipients of the medal is at the Pueblo Convention Center.

From 1846 to 1847 three detachments of the Mormon Battalion wintered in Pueblo during the Mexican–American War.

In recent times GSA has incorporated Pueblo into FCIC&#x27;s toll-free telephone number.

Vestas Wind Systems constructed the largest (nearly 700,000 square feet) wind turbine tower manufacturing plant in the world at Pueblo&#x27;s industrial park. It sold the facility to CS Wind in 2021.

Renewable Energy Systems Americas broke ground on the Comanche Solar Project seven miles south of Pueblo in 2015. When complete, it will be the largest solar energy farm east of the Rocky Mountains, and its backers say the project will produce electricity more cheaply than natural gas. The project will cover 1,000 acres with 500,000 solar panels, providing a capacity of 156 megawatts of power—enough to supply 31,000 homes. The project will be run by SunEdison, with a power purchase agreement signed by Xcel Energy. A number of scientific studies now list Pueblo as the state&#x27;s primary locale for solar energy development and the premier setting for solar companies to locate, placing it ahead of regional rivals such as Boulder, Colorado and Taos, New Mexico.

In February 2017, Pueblo City Council voted to commit the city to 100% renewable energy (&quot;Ready for 100%&quot;) by 2035, with the city&#x27;s electric franchisee, Black Hills Energy, expected to ramp up its renewable energy portfolio from 29% to 65%. Pueblo County commissioners joined the renewable commitment in April 2018. For several years, Pueblo&#x27;s Energy Future has been pushing the city to become a municipal electric provider. Among the claimed advantages for the move toward independence: lower cost to the consumer, increased reliability and the opportunity to move more aggressively toward renewable energy development. At one time, an August 2020 &quot;divorce&quot; seemed possible.

<doc id="24159" wikidata="Q332471" url="?curid=24159" title="Paul Desmond">
<text>Paul Desmond (born Paul Emil Breitenfeld; November 25, 1924 – May 30, 1977) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer and proponent of cool jazz. He was a member of the Dave Brubeck Quartet and composed the group&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Take Five&quot;. The song remains the best-selling jazz song of all time.

In addition to his work with Brubeck, he led several groups and collaborated with Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Jim Hall, and Ed Bickert. After years of chain smoking and poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 after a tour with Brubeck.

==Early life==
Desmond was born Paul Emil Breitenfeld in San Francisco, California, in 1924, the son of Shirley (née King) and Emil Aron Breitenfeld. His grandfather Sigmund Breitenfeld, a medical doctor, was born on 17 November 1857, in Česká Kamenice in Bohemia in 1857; he emigrated to the US in 1885. and on 2 May 1886, in New York, married Hermina Lewy. They had four children (including Emil, father of Paul Emil). Paul Desmond and members of his father&#x27;s family &quot;frequently speculated as to whether Sigmund or Hermine Breitenfeld had Jewish backgrounds&quot;, but they did not identify as Jewish, or observe Jewish traditions. However, Fred Barton, songwriter/arranger and Desmond&#x27;s cousin, found extensive genealogical proof that both the Breitenfeld and Löwy families were Bohemian Jews. The Breitenfeld family in Bohemia and Vienna featured musicians in every generation throughout the 1800s, 1900s, and to the present day. Desmond&#x27;s mother, born Shirley King, was of an Irish Catholic family.

Desmond&#x27;s father Emil Breitenfeld was a pianist, organist, arranger, and composer who accompanied silent films in movie theaters and produced musical arrangements for printed publication and for live theatrical productions. During World War I, while training with the 17th New York Regiment in Plattsburgh, New York, he composed &quot;The Last Long Mile&quot;, one of the best-known soldiers&#x27; songs of that war.

Desmond&#x27;s mother Shirley was emotionally unstable throughout his upbringing, and appears to have suffered from obsessive–compulsive disorder and other mental illnesses. Starting in 1933, Desmond spent nearly five years living with relatives in New Rochelle, New York due to his mother&#x27;s mental health problems.

Desmond began playing the
clarinet at age twelve, and continued throughout his time at San Francisco Polytechnic High School. While in high school, Desmond wanted to study the violin, but his father dissuaded him, saying that violin players were &quot;a dime a dozen...with the violin, you&#x27;ll starve.&quot; Desmond developed a talent for writing during high school as well, becoming co-editor of his high school newspaper. In that capacity, he interviewed comedian Bob Hope for his school newspaper during one of Hope&#x27;s visits to San Francisco. After high school, Desmond enrolled at San Francisco State College where he majored in English. While in college, Desmond began playing the alto saxophone, after being influenced by the likes of Lester Young and Charlie Parker. In his first year of college, Desmond was drafted into the United States Army and joined the Army band while stationed in San Francisco. He spent three years in the military, but his unit was not called to combat.

Following his military discharge, Paul Emil Breitenfeld legally changed his last name from Breitenfeld to Desmond in 1946. He told many stories over the years regarding how he chose the name Desmond, but his biographer Doug Ramsey offers an account from Desmond&#x27;s friend Hal Strack that the two were listening to the Glenn Miller band singer Johnny Desmond in 1942, and Desmond told Strack &quot;that&#x27;s such a great name. It&#x27;s so smooth and yet it&#x27;s uncommon...If I ever decide I need another name, it&#x27;s going to be Desmond.&quot;

Desmond was married from 1947 to 1949 to Duane Reeves Lamon. He never remarried.

==Career==
After World War II, Desmond started working in the San Francisco Bay Area, working as a backing musician. He worked occasionally for Dave Brubeck at the Geary Cellar in San Francisco. For several weeks, he led a small jazz combo at the Band Box in Redwood City that included Dave Brubeck. Desmond had a falling out with Brubeck when he resigned from the Band Box and prevented Brubeck from taking over the residency. In 1950, Desmond joined the band of Jack Fina and toured with Fina for several months, but he returned to California after hearing Brubeck&#x27;s trio on the radio and deciding that he should repair his relationship with Brubeck and attempt to join Brubeck&#x27;s increasingly successful band.

At the time, Brubeck and his wife Iola had three small children, and Brubeck had instructed Iola not to let Desmond set foot in the family home. Desmond appeared at Brubeck&#x27;s San Francisco apartment one day while Dave was in the back yard hanging diapers on a laundry line, and Iola, defying Brubeck&#x27;s wishes, let Desmond in and took him to Dave. Desmond offered to perform arranging and administrative work for Brubeck&#x27;s band, and to babysit Brubeck&#x27;s children, and Brubeck finally relented and agreed to try working with Desmond again.

===Dave Brubeck Quartet===

Desmond met Dave Brubeck in 1944 in the military. Brubeck was trying out for the 253rd Army band, to which Desmond belonged. After making the cut he—unlike Desmond—was sent overseas in 1944, to Europe. Desmond once told Marian McPartland of National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; that he was taken aback by the chord changes which Brubeck introduced during that 1944 audition. After Desmond convinced Brubeck to hire him following his stint with Jack Fina, the two had a contract drafted (of which Brubeck was the sole signatory); the language forbade Brubeck from firing him, ensured Brubeck&#x27;s status as group leader, and gave Desmond twenty percent of all profits generated from the quartet. That is how the Dave Brubeck Quartet had its start, a group that began in 1951 and ended in December 1967.

The quartet became especially popular with college-age audiences, often performing in college settings, including their ground-breaking 1953 album &quot;Jazz at Oberlin&quot; at Oberlin College and at the campuses of Ohio University and the University of Michigan. The success of the quartet led to a &quot;Time&quot; magazine piece on them in 1954, with the famous cover featuring Brubeck&#x27;s face.

After drummer Joe Dodge decided to leave the group, Joe Morello joined in late 1956 with Desmond&#x27;s recommendation. Yet with different musical aspiration and taste, their relationship was full of tension. Desmond hoped for a &quot;tinky-boom&quot; background-type drummer while Morello wanted to be recognized and featured. During Morello&#x27;s first performance with the group, he was featured by Brubeck and received an ovation from the audience for his solo. Desmond resented this, and threatened to leave the group. Brubeck managed to keep both Desmond and Morello in the group but with frictions between them for years. Desmond&#x27;s grudge against Morello could also be heard during their performance. In their &#x27;Take The ‘A’ Train&#x27; performance in Hanover, Germany in 1958, for example, Desmond&#x27;s playing sounded lack-luster and uninterested. After Morello&#x27;s complex rhythm, Desmond would play even quieter and even dropped for a few bars. In their later years they reconciled and became close friends.

The Dave Brubeck Quartet played until 1967, when Brubeck switched his musical focus from performance to composition and dissolved the group. During the 1970s Desmond joined Brubeck for several reunion tours, including &quot;Two Generations of Brubeck&quot;. Accompanying them were Brubeck&#x27;s sons Chris Brubeck, Dan Brubeck and Darius Brubeck. In 1976 Desmond played 25 shows in 25 nights with Brubeck, touring the United States by bus.

===Other collaborations===

Desmond worked several times during his career with baritone saxophonist and band leader Gerry Mulligan. They made two studio albums together (&quot;Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet&quot; (1957), and &quot;Two of a Mind&quot; (1962)). In June 1969 Desmond appeared at the New Orleans Jazz Festival with Gerry Mulligan, with favorable reactions from critics and audience members. During Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Two Generations&quot; tours, Desmond and Mulligan shared the stage in 1974. Unlike Brubeck, Mulligan shared much in common with Desmond, such as similar interests and humor, and both men had no shortage of addictions in their lives.

Desmond had a celebrated studio partnership with guitarist Jim Hall. Hall played on several albums recorded by Desmond between 1959 and 1963 for Warner Bros. and RCA Victor. After some time spent inactive, Desmond was asked to play the Half Note in New York City in 1971 by Hall. With his special brand of humor, Desmond said that he took the job only because he was nearby and could tumble out of bed to work. The two continued to play at the club to jam-packed audiences. Desmond also joined the Modern Jazz Quartet for a Christmas concert in 1971 at the New York Town Hall.

Desmond was a guest artist on five tracks by Chet Baker recorded between 1975 and 1977. These were released on the albums &quot;She Was Too Good to Me&quot; (CTI, 1974), &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;, and &quot;The Best Thing for You&quot;. Baker and Desmond also appeared together on two tracks included on Jim Hall&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Concierto&quot; album.

Desmond met Canadian guitarist Ed Bickert through a recommendation by Jim Hall, and Desmond performed with Bickert at several clubs in the Toronto area during 1974–1975. Desmond featured Bickert on his 1975 studio album &quot;Pure Desmond&quot;, and the two played together at the 1976 Edmonton Jazz Festival. Live recordings of that concert and club dates with Bickert performed during 1974-1975 were released during and after Desmond&#x27;s lifetime.

==Personal life==
In their private lives Dave Brubeck and his family were very close to Paul Desmond, though the two men possessed very different personalities. Darius Brubeck recalls thinking that Desmond was his uncle almost into adolescence. Desmond grew especially close to Dave&#x27;s son Michael, to whom he left his saxophone upon his death. Desmond was also described as a womanizer who was unable to form (and was uninterested in maintaining) steady relationships with women, though he had no shortage of female companions throughout his life. Desmond is reported to have quipped, upon seeing a former girlfriend on the street, &quot;There she goes, not with a whim but a banker&quot; (a semi-Spoonerism reference to T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper&quot;). In contrast, Brubeck was deeply religious and a stalwart family man.
Desmond enjoyed reading works by the thinkers of his generation like Timothy Leary and Jack Kerouac, also dabbling in some LSD usage. He was known to have several addictions, including Dewar&#x27;s Scotch whisky and Pall Mall cigarettes. In the 1940s and 1950s, Desmond frequently took amphetamines, and in the 1970s, he was known to use cocaine. His chemical-dependency problems would sometimes drain him of his energy on the road. Clarinetist Perry Robinson recalls in his autobiography that Desmond would sometimes need a vitamin B12 shot just to go on playing during his later career.
Desmond died on May 30, 1977, not of his heavy alcohol habit but of lung cancer, the result of his longtime heavy smoking. He was 52. Never without his humor, after he was diagnosed with cancer he expressed pleasure at the health of his liver. His last concert was with Brubeck in February 1977, in New York City. His fans were unaware of his rapidly declining health. Desmond specified in his will that all proceeds from &quot;Take Five&quot; would go to the Red Cross following his death. Desmond reportedly owned a Baldwin grand piano, which he lent to Bradley Cunningham, owner of Bradley&#x27;s piano bar in Greenwich Village, provided that Cunningham move the large piano back to Desmond&#x27;s Upper West Side apartment to become part of Desmond&#x27;s estate. After this long and expensive process, Desmond willed the piano to Cunningham, a characteristic and final prank. The Paul Desmond Papers (and other Brubeck adjacent archival collections) are held at the Holt-Atherton Special Collections and Archives in the University of the Pacific Library.

Desmond was cremated and his ashes were scattered.

==Style==
Desmond produced a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, trying to sound, he said, &quot;like a dry martini.&quot; With a style that was similar to that of Lee Konitz, one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the West Coast&#x27;s cool school of jazz. Much of the success of the classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck&#x27;s sometimes relatively heavy, polytonal piano work.

Desmond&#x27;s improvisation is praised for its logical structure and lyricism. His gift for improvised counterpoint is perhaps most evident on his two albums with baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan (&quot;Mulligan-Desmond Quartet&quot; and &quot;Two of a Mind&quot;). In his playing Desmond was also notable for his ability to produce extremely high notes, the altissimo register, on his saxophone.

Desmond played a Selmer &quot;Super Balanced Action&quot; model alto saxophone with an M. C. Gregory model 4A-18M hard rubber mouthpiece, both dating from circa 1951, with a moderately stiff Rico 3 ½ reed.

== Legacy ==
In 2024, his song “Samba de Orfeu” which he made in 1965 was mentioned in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;.

<text>Piper, the pepper plants or pepper vines, is an economically and ecologically important genus in the family Piperaceae.

It contains about 1,000–2,000 species of shrubs, herbs, and lianas, many of which are dominant species in their native habitat. The diversification of this taxon is of interest to understanding the evolution of plants.

Pepper plants belong to the magnoliids, which are angiosperms but neither monocots nor eudicots. Their family, Piperaceae, is most closely related to the lizardtail family (Saururaceae), which in fact generally look like smaller, more delicate and pepper plants. Both families have characteristic tail-shaped inflorescences covered in tiny flowers. A somewhat less close relative is the pipevine family (Aristolochiaceae). A well-known and very close relative – being also part of the Piperaceae – are the radiator plants of the genus &quot;Peperomia&quot;.

The scientific name &quot;Piper&quot; and the common name &quot;pepper&quot; are derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;pippali&quot;, denoting the long pepper (&quot;P. longum&quot;).

== Evolution ==
The earliest fossil of &quot;Piper&quot; is of †&quot;Piper margaritae&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Colombia. &quot;P. margaritae&quot; appears to be nested within the clade &quot;Schilleria&quot;, indicating extensive Cretaceous diversification of &quot;Piper&quot; into the multiple extant clades, coinciding with the final breakup of Gondwana. This contrasts with previous theories assuming a younger radiation of the genus. An earlier potential record is of †&quot;Piper arcuatile&quot; from the Cenomanian to Santonian Kaltag Formation of Yukon, although this affinity to &quot;Piper&quot; is not entirely reliable.

==Distribution and ecology==
&quot;Piper&quot; species have a pantropical distribution, and are most commonly found in the understory of lowland tropical forests, but can also occur in clearings and in higher elevation life zones such as cloud forests; one species – the Japanese Pepper (&quot;P. kadsura&quot;) from southern Japan and southernmost Korea – is subtropical and can tolerate light winter frost. Peppers are often dominant species where they are found.

Most &quot;Piper&quot; species are either herbaceous or vines; some grow as shrubs or almost as small trees. A few species, commonly called &quot;ant pipers&quot; (e.g. &quot;Piper cenocladum&quot;), live in a mutualism with ants. The fruit of the &quot;Piper&quot; plant, called a peppercorn when it is round and pea-sized, as is usual, is distributed in the wild mainly by birds, but small fruit-eating mammals – e.g. bats of the genus &quot;Carollia&quot; – are also important. Despite the high content of chemicals that are noxious to herbivores, some have evolved the ability to withstand the chemical defences of pepper plants, for example the sematurine moth &quot;Homidiana subpicta&quot; or some flea beetles of the genus &quot;Lanka&quot;. The latter can be significant pests to pepper growers.

==Usages==
Many pepper plants make good ornamentals for gardens in subtropical or warmer regions. Pepper vines can be used much as ivy in temperate climates, while other species, like lacquered pepper (&quot;P. magnificum&quot;) grow as sizeable, compact and attractive shrubs with tough and shiny leaves. Smaller species, like Celebes pepper (&quot;P. ornatum&quot;) with its finely patterned leaves, are also suitable as indoor pot plants.

Unsustainable logging of tropical primary forests is threatening a number of peppers. The extent of the effect of such wholesale habitat destruction on the genus is unknown, but in the forests of Ecuador – the only larger region for which comprehensive data exists – more than a dozen species are known to be on the brink of extinction. On the other hand, other &quot;Piper&quot; species (e.g. spiked pepper, &quot;P. aduncum&quot;) have been widely distributed as a result of human activity and are a major invasive species in certain areas.

The most significant human use of &quot;Piper&quot; is not for its looks however, but ultimately for the wide range of powerful secondary compounds found particularly in the fruits.

===As spice and vegetable===
Culinary use of pepper plants is attested perhaps as early as 9,000 years ago. Peppercorn remains were found among the food refuse left by Hoabinhian artisans at Spirit Cave, Thailand. It is likely that these plants were collected from the wild rather than deliberately grown.
Use of peppercorns as pungent spice is significant on an international scale. By classical antiquity, there was a vigorous trade of spices including black pepper (&quot;P. nigrum&quot;) from South Asia to Europe. The &quot;Apicius&quot;, a recipe collection complied about 400 AD, mentions &quot;pepper&quot; as a spice for most main dishes. In the late Roman Empire, black pepper was expensive, but was available readily enough to be used more frequently than salt or sugar.

As Europe moved into the Early Middle Ages, trade routes deteriorated and the use of pepper declined somewhat, but peppercorns, storing easily and having a high mass per volume, never ceased to be a profitable trade item. In the Middle Ages, international traders were nicknamed &quot;Pfeffersäcke&quot; (&quot;pepper-sacks&quot;) in German towns of the Hanseatic League and elsewhere. Later, wars were fought by European powers, between themselves and in complex alliances and enmities with Indian Ocean states, in part about control of the supply of spices, perhaps the most archetypal being black pepper fruit. Today, peppercorns of the three preparations (green, white and black) are one of the most widely used spices of plant origin worldwide.

Due to the wide distribution of &quot;Piper&quot;, the fruit of other species are also important spices, many of them internationally. Long pepper (&quot;P. longum&quot;), is possibly the second-most popular &quot;Piper&quot; spice internationally; it has a rather chili-like &quot;heat&quot; and the whole inflorescence is used as the fruits are tiny. Cubeb (&quot;P. cubeba&quot;), also known as tailed pepper, played a major role in the spice trade. Reputedly Philip IV of Spain suppressed trade in cubeb peppercorns at the end of the 1630s to capitalize on his share of the black pepper trade. It remains a significant spice around the Indian Ocean region today, however. West African pepper (&quot;P. guineense&quot;), is commonly used in West African cuisine, and is sometimes used in the East African &quot;berbere&quot; spice mix. This species, despite being traded more extensively in earlier times, is less common outside Africa today.

Not only the seeds of &quot;Piper&quot; are used in cooking. West African Pepper leaves, known locally as &quot;uziza&quot;, are used as a flavoring vegetable in Nigerian stews. In Mexican-influenced cooking, &quot;hoja santa&quot; or Mexican pepperleaf (&quot;P. auritum&quot;) has a variety of uses. In Southeast Asia, leaves of two species of &quot;Piper&quot; have major importance in cooking: lolot (&quot;P. lolot&quot;) is used to wrap meat for grilling in the Indochina region, while wild betel (&quot;P. sarmentosum&quot;) is used raw or cooked as a vegetable in Malay and Thai cuisine; The stems and roots of &quot;Piper chaba&quot; are used as a spice in Bangladeshi cuisine.

===As medicine===

Cubeb (&quot;P. cubeba&quot;) has been used in folk medicine and herbalism as well as, particularly in the early 20th century, as a cigarette flavoring. &quot;P. darienense&quot; is used medically by the Kuna people of the Panama-Colombia border region, and elsewhere it is used to intoxicate fish which then can be easily caught. Spiked pepper, often called &quot;matico&quot; appears to have strong disinfectant and antibiotic properties. Black pepper (&quot;P. nigrum&quot;) essential oil is sometimes used in herbalism, and long pepper (&quot;P. longum&quot;) is similarly employed in Ayurveda, where it was an ingredient of &quot;Triphala Guggulu&quot; and (together with black pepper) of &quot;Trikatu&quot; pills, used for &quot;rasayana&quot; (rejuvenating and detoxifying) purposes.

One &quot;Piper&quot; species has gained large-scale use as a stimulant. Betel (&quot;P. betle&quot;) leaves are used to wrap betel palm nut slices; its sap helps release the stimulating effect of these &quot;cookies&quot; which are widely known as &quot;pan&quot; in India.

Conversely, another &quot;Piper&quot; species, kava (&quot;P. methysticum&quot;), is used for its depressant and euphoriant effects. In the Pacific region, where it has been widely spread as a canoe plant, kava is used to produce a calming and socializing drink somewhat similar to alcohol and benzodiazepines but without many of the negative side effects and less of an addiction risk. It has also become popular elsewhere in recent decades, and is used as a medical plant. However, pills that contain parts of the whole plant have occasionally shown a strong hepatotoxic effect, which has led to the banning of kava in many countries. On the other hand, the traditional preparation of the root as a calming drink appears to pose little, if any, such hazard.

===In science===
The genus contains species suitable for studying natural history, molecular biology, natural products chemistry, community ecology, and evolutionary biology.
&quot;Piper&quot; is a model genus for research in ecology and evolutionary biology. The diversity and ecological importance of the genus makes it a strong candidate for ecological and evolutionary studies. Most research has focused on the economically important species &quot;P. nigrum&quot; (black pepper), &quot;P. methysticum&quot; (kava), and &quot;P. betle&quot; (betel). A recent study based on DNA sequence analysis suggest that &quot;P. nigrum&quot; originated in the Western Ghats hot spot in India.

The obligate and facultative ant mutualists found in some &quot;Piper&quot; species have a strong influence on their biology, making them ideal systems for research on the evolution of symbioses and the effect of mutualisms on biotic communities.

Important secondary metabolites found in pepper plants are piperine and chavicine, which were first isolated from Black Pepper, and reported to have antibiotic activities. Preliminary research reports has shown that piperine has an antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as &quot;S. aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, and gastric cancer pathogen &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; and decreased &quot;H. pylori&quot; toxin entry to gastric epithelial cells. The piperidine functional group is named after the former, and piperazine (which is not found in &quot;P. nigrum&quot; in noticeable quantities) was in turn named after piperidine.

The significant secondary metabolites of kava are kavalactones and flavokawains. Pipermethystine is suspected to be the main hepatotoxic compound in this plant&#x27;s stems and leaves.

===Repelling insects===
Studies have been done to determine the effectiveness of piper leaves to repel different types of insects.

Capuchin monkeys have been recorded by BBC Earth rubbing the piper leaves on them to repel insects.

==Species==

The largest number of &quot;Piper&quot; species are found in the Americas (about 700 species), with about 300 species from Southern Asia. There are smaller groups of species from the South Pacific (about 40 species) and Africa (about 15 species). The American, Asian, and South Pacific groups each appear to be monophyletic; the affinity of the African species is unclear.

Some species are sometimes segregated into the genera &quot;Pothomorphe&quot;, &quot;Macropiper&quot;, &quot;Ottonia&quot;, &quot;Arctottonia&quot;, &quot;Sarcorhachis&quot;, &quot;Trianaeopiper&quot;, and &quot;Zippelia&quot;, but other sources keep them in &quot;Piper&quot;.

The species called &quot;&quot;Piper aggregatum&quot; and &quot;P. fasciculatum&quot;&quot; are actually &quot;Lacistema aggregatum&quot;, a plant from the family Lacistemataceae.

<text>Pride and Prejudice is the second novel by English author Jane Austen, published in 1813. A novel of manners, it follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness.

Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a primary motivation driving the plot.

&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has consistently appeared near the top of lists of &quot;most-loved books&quot; among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature. For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.

==Plot summary==

In the early 19th century, the Bennet family lives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton in Hertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet&#x27;s greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.

The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;.

At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, his dearest friend. Mr. Bingley&#x27;s friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is &quot;not handsome enough&quot;. Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.

Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy&#x27;s aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officer George Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence about Mr. Darcy&#x27;s unpleasant treatment of him in the past. Elizabeth, blinded by her prejudice toward Mr. Darcy, believes him.

Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball, where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins&#x27; marriage proposal, to her mother&#x27;s fury and her father&#x27;s relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth, and is accepted.

Having heard Mrs. Bennet&#x27;s words at the ball and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth&#x27;s hatred for Mr. Darcy grows as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley&#x27;s departure.

In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine&#x27;s home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane.

Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy&#x27;s interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it.

The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father&#x27;s steward, had refused the &quot;living&quot; his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy&#x27;s 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family&#x27;s behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.

Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of Derbyshire. They visit Pemberley, Darcy&#x27;s estate. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy&#x27;s behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy, then departs in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn, where Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.

Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley&#x27;s proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy&#x27;s proposal, as she and Darcy&#x27;s late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt&#x27;s indignant relaying of Elizabeth&#x27;s response, again proposes to her and is accepted.

== Characters ==

* Elizabeth Bennet – the second-eldest of the Bennet daughters, she is attractive, witty and intelligent – but with a tendency to form tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story progresses, so does her tumultuous relationship with Mr. Darcy. The course of Elizabeth and Darcy&#x27;s relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading them both to surrender to their love for each other.
* Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy – Mr. Bingley&#x27;s friend and the wealthy owner of the estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, said to be worth at least £10,000 a year. Although he is handsome, tall, and intelligent, Darcy lacks ease and social graces, so others frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof of excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the novel, he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet&#x27;s love interest. Though he appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.
* Mr. Bennet – A logical and reasonable late-middle-aged landed gentleman of a more modest income of £2,000 per annum, and the dryly sarcastic patriarch of the Bennet family, with five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, is entailed to the male line. His affection for his wife wore off early in their marriage and is now reduced to mere toleration. He is often described as &#x27;indolent&#x27; in the novel.
* Mrs. Bennet () – the middle-aged wife of Mr. Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet is a hypochondriac who imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations (her &quot;poor nerves&quot;) whenever things are not going her way. She is silly, frivolous, and tactless, and is given to embarrassing her husband and older daughters. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her. She was settled a dowry of £4,000 from her father.
* Jane Bennet – the eldest Bennet sister. She is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is inclined to see only the good in others (but can be persuaded otherwise on sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a rich young man recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close friend of Mr. Darcy.
* Mary Bennet – the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of her siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and plays music, although she is often impatient to display her accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh&#x27;s &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot;, Mary ended up marrying one of her Uncle Philips&#x27; law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.
* Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Bennet – the fourth Bennet daughter. Though older than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia and is described as a &quot;silly&quot; young woman. However, it is said that she improved when removed from Lydia&#x27;s influence. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh&#x27;s &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot;, Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.
* Lydia Bennet – the youngest Bennet sister. She is frivolous, headstrong, irresponsible, and spoiled, and is her mother&#x27;s favorite. Her main activity in life is socialising, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to her running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention of marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she &quot;feels without reasoning&quot;.

* Charles Bingley – a handsome, amiable, and wealthy young man who leases Netherfield Park with hopes of purchasing it. Though genial and well-mannered, he is easily influenced by his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters&#x27; opinion, which leads to the disruption of his romance with Jane Bennet. He inherited a fortune of £100,000.

* Caroline Bingley – the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley, with a fortune of £20,000. She harbours designs on Mr. Darcy and is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth. She also disapproves of her brother&#x27;s admiration for Jane Bennet and is disdainful of Meryton society, driven by her vanity and desire for social elevation.
* George Wickham – Wickham is a charming but reprehensible cad. He has been acquainted with Mr. Darcy since infancy, being the son of Mr. Darcy&#x27;s father&#x27;s steward. An officer in the militia, he is superficially charming and rapidly forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with Lydia with no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in her and her family&#x27;s complete disgrace, but for Darcy&#x27;s intervention to bribe Wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts.
* Mr. William Collins – Mr. Collins is Mr. Bennet&#x27;s distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man, prone to making long and tedious speeches, who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
* Lady Catherine de Bourgh – the overbearing aunt of Mr. Darcy. Lady Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she resides with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr. Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy to &#x27;unite their two great estates&#x27;, claiming it to be the dearest wish of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (née Fitzwilliam).
* Mr. Edward Gardiner and Mrs. Gardiner – Edward Gardiner is Mrs. Bennet&#x27;s brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant and is close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are the parents of four children. They are instrumental in bringing about the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.

* Georgiana Darcy – Georgiana is Mr. Darcy&#x27;s quiet, amiable and shy younger sister, with a dowry of £30,000, and is 16 when the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr. Wickham but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to years of tutelage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano, singing, playing the harp, drawing, and modern languages and is therefore described as Caroline Bingley&#x27;s idea of an &quot;accomplished woman&quot;.

* Charlotte Lucas – Elizabeth&#x27;s 27-year-old friend. She marries Mr. Collins for financial security, fearing becoming a burden to her family. Austen uses Charlotte&#x27;s decision to illustrate how women of the time often married out of convenience rather than love, without condemning her choice. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.

* Colonel Fitzwilliam – Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at the beginning of the novel. He is the coguardian of Miss Georgiana Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr. Darcy. According to Colonel Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to his prospective bride&#x27;s dowry.


==Major themes==
Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; but Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initially &quot;First Impressions&quot;), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. &quot;After the success of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.&quot;

The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.&quot; The phrase &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; had been used over the preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson. Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage in Fanny Burney&#x27;s &quot;Cecilia&quot; (1782), a novel she is known to have admired:

A theme in much of Austen&#x27;s work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people&#x27;s character and morality. Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen&#x27;s work is ineffectual parents. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia&#x27;s lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing. Kitty, rescued from Lydia&#x27;s bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.

The American novelist Anna Quindlen observed in an introduction to an edition of Austen&#x27;s novel in 1995:

===Marriage===

The opening line of the novel announces: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.&quot; This sets marriage as a motif and a central idea in the novel. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the &quot;neighbourhood&quot; families and their daughters who require a &quot;good fortune&quot;. According to American Book Review the opening line of Pride and Prejudice is considered second on their list of top 100 greatest opening lines in English literature behind only &quot;Call me Ishmael:&quot; from Moby Dick.

Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political and financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological).

The Bennets&#x27; marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other&#x27;s point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.

When Elizabeth rejects Darcy&#x27;s first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy&#x27;s proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated. Austen&#x27;s complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, or companionate attraction.

===Wealth===
Money plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.

Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley&#x27;s sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she declares &quot;I am thinking of his marrying one of them&quot;.

Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted by entailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet&#x27;s death in the absence of any closer male heirs, and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer.

Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have. The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.

===Class===
Austen might be known now for her &quot;romances&quot; but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is hardly the exception.

When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage to Darcy will become, &quot;Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?&quot; Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine&#x27;s accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman&#x27;s daughter and gentleman, are &quot;equals&quot;), Lady Catherine refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth. However, as the novel closes, &quot;...through curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself&quot;, Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at Pemberley.

The Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall – it is, after all, &quot;to let&quot; – distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father&#x27;s family and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of an earl. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen&#x27;s radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.

An undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class is hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; &quot;Fitzwilliam&quot;, &quot;D&#x27;Arcy&quot;, &quot;de Bourgh&quot; (&quot;Burke&quot;), and even &quot;Bennet&quot;, are traditional Norman surnames.

===Self-knowledge===
Through their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:

Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.

Tanner writes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, &quot;has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects&quot;. Mrs Bennet&#x27;s behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. &quot;The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.&quot; This shows that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of &quot;material objects&quot; and not of her feelings and emotions.

A notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet&#x27;s close friend and confidant. She accepts Mr. Collins&#x27;s proposal of marriage once Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her circumstances as &quot;one of a large family&quot;. Charlotte&#x27;s decision is reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.

==Style==
&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, like most of Austen&#x27;s works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as &quot;the free representation of a character&#x27;s speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character&#x27;s thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke&quot;.

Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different. By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth&#x27;s viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. &quot;The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth&#x27;s point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth&#x27;s misprisions.&quot;

The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character&#x27;s feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy&#x27;s first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham&#x27;s true character.

Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the &quot;oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.&quot; Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.

==Development of the novel==
Austen began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796. It was originally titled &quot;First Impressions&quot;, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797. On 1 November 1797 Austen&#x27;s father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post.

The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times. The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.

Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript for &quot;First Impressions&quot; between 1811 and 1812. As nothing remains of the original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that &quot;First Impressions&quot; was an epistolary novel.

She later renamed the story &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; around 1811/1812, when she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for £110 (). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the &quot;sufferings and oppositions&quot; summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney&#x27;s &quot;Cecilia&quot;, called &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.

It is possible that the novel&#x27;s original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of &quot;First Impressions&quot; and its revision into &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.

==Publication history==

Austen sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked for £150). This proved a costly decision. Austen had published &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher&#x27;s commission. Unaware that &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; would sell out its edition, making her £140, she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.

Egerton published the first edition of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in three hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813. It was advertised in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, priced at 18s. Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year. A third edition was published in 1817.

Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was first published in the United States in August 1832 as &quot;Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The novel was also included in Richard Bentley&#x27;s Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman&#x27;s scholarly edition of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based.

The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen&#x27;s novels. However, whereas her first published novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was presented as being written &quot;by a Lady,&quot; &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was attributed to &quot;the Author of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;&quot;. This began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the anonymous author of all her then-published works.

==Reception==
=== 19th century ===
The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication. Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron, called it &quot;the fashionable novel&quot;. Noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he &quot;would rather have written &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, or &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, than any of the Waverley Novels&quot;.

Throughout the 19th century, not all reviews of the work were positive. Charlotte Brontë, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a disappointment, &quot;a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but [...] no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck&quot;. Along with her, Mark Twain was overwhelmingly negative of the work. He stated, &quot;Everytime I read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; I want to dig [Austen] up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.&quot;

Austen for her part thought the &quot;playfulness and epigrammaticism&quot; of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was excessive, complaining in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked &quot;shade&quot; and should have had a chapter &quot;of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the history of Buonaparté&quot;.

Walter Scott wrote in his journal, &quot;Read again and for the third time at least, Miss Austen&#x27;s very finely written novel of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.&quot;

===20th century===

The American scholar Claudia L. Johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality. One critic, Mary Poovey, wrote that the &quot;romantic conclusion&quot; of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the &quot;individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system &quot;and&quot; the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic society&quot;. Johnson wrote that Austen&#x27;s view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an &quot;escape&quot; from conflict. Johnson wrote the &quot;outrageous unconventionality&quot; of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen&#x27;s own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrote &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

In the early twentieth century, the term &quot;Collins,&quot; named for Austen&#x27;s William Collins, came into use as slang for a thank-you note to a host.

===21st century===
* In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the &quot;UK&#x27;s Best-Loved Book&quot; in which &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; came second, behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
* In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; came first in a list of the 101 best books ever written.
* The 200th anniversary of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; on 28 January 2013 was celebrated around the globe by media networks such as the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, among others.

==Adaptations==
===Film, television and theatre===

Numerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularising &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

The first television adaptation of the novel, written by Michael Barry, was produced in 1938 by the BBC. It is a lost television broadcast. Some of the notable film versions include the 1940 Academy Award-winning film, starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier (based in part on Helen Jerome&#x27;s 1935 stage adaptation) and that of 2005, starring Keira Knightley (an Oscar-nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen. Television versions include two by the BBC: a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and a 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.

A stage version created by Helen Jerome premiered at the Music Box Theatre in New York in 1935, starring Adrianne Allen and Colin Keith-Johnston, and opened at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in London in 1936, starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. &quot;Elizabeth Refuses&quot; a play by Margaret Macnamara of scenes from the novel was made into a TV programme by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1957. &quot;First Impressions&quot; was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring Polly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold. In 1995, a musical concept album was written by Bernard J. Taylor, with Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet and Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy. A new stage production, &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical&quot;, was presented in concert on 21 October 2008 in Rochester, New York, with Colin Donnell as Darcy. The Swedish composer Daniel Nelson based his 2011 opera &quot;Stolthet och fördom&quot; on &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Works inspired by the book include &quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Trishna&quot; (1985 Hindi TV series).

&quot;The Lizzie Bennet Diaries&quot; – which premiered on a dedicated YouTube channel on 9 April 2012, and concluded on 28 March 2013 – is an Emmy award-winning web-series which recounts the story via vlogs recorded primarily by the Bennet sisters. It was created by Hank Green and Bernie Su.

In 2017, the bicentenary year of Austen&#x27;s death, &quot;Pride and Prejudice – An adaptation in Words and Music&quot; to music by Carl Davis from the 1995 film and text by Gill Hornby was performed in the UK, with Hayley Mills as the narrator This adaptation was presented in 2024 at the Sydney Opera House and the Arts Centre Melbourne, narrated by Nadine Garner.

In 2018, part of the storyline of the Brazilian soap opera &quot;Orgulho e Paixão&quot;, aired on TV Globo, was inspired by the book. The soap opera was also inspired by other works of Jane Austen. It features actors, Nathalia Dill, Thiago Lacerda, Agatha Moreira, Rodrigo Simas, Gabriela Duarte, , Alessandra Negrini, and Natália do Vale.

&quot;Fire Island&quot; is a movie written by Joel Kim Booster that reimagines &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as a gay drama set on the quintessential gay vacation destination of Fire Island. Booster describes the movie &quot;as an unapologetic and modern twist on Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.&quot; The movie was released in June 2022 and features a main cast of Asian-American actors.

===Literature===
In Gwyn Cready&#x27;s comedic romance novel, &quot;Seducing Mr Darcy&quot;, the heroine lands in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by way of magic massage, has a fling with Darcy and unknowingly changes the rest of the story.

Abigail Reynolds is the author of seven Regency-set variations on &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Her Pemberley Variations series includes &quot;Mr Darcy&#x27;s Obsession&quot;, &quot;To Conquer Mr Darcy&quot;, &quot;What Would Mr Darcy Do&quot; and &quot;Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy: The Last Man in the World&quot;. Her modern adaptation, &quot;The Man Who Loved Pride and Prejudice&quot;, is set on Cape Cod.

Bella Breen is the author of nine variations on &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Poison&quot;, &quot;Four Months to Wed&quot;, &quot;Forced to Marry&quot; and &quot;The Rescue of Elizabeth Bennet&quot;.

In March 2009, Seth Grahame-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&quot; takes Austen&#x27;s work and mashes it up with zombie hordes, cannibalism, ninja and ultraviolent mayhem. In March 2010, Quirk Books published a prequel by Steve Hockensmith that deals with Elizabeth Bennet&#x27;s early days as a zombie hunter, &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls&quot;. The 2016 film of Grahame-Smith&#x27;s adaptation was released starring Lily James, Sam Riley and Matt Smith.

Marvel has also published their take on this classic by releasing a short comic series of five issues that stays true to the original storyline. The first issue was published on 1 April 2009 and was written by Nancy Hajeski. It was published as a graphic novel in 2010 with artwork by Hugo Petrus.

Pamela Aidan is the author of a trilogy of books telling the story of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; from Mr Darcy&#x27;s point of view: &quot;Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman&quot;. The books are &quot;An Assembly Such as This&quot;, &quot;Duty and Desire&quot; and &quot;These Three Remain&quot;.

Detective novel author P. D. James has written a book titled &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot;, which is a murder mystery set six years after Elizabeth and Darcy&#x27;s marriage.

Sandra Lerner&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, &quot;Second Impressions&quot;, develops the story and imagined what might have happened to the original novel&#x27;s characters. It is written in the style of Austen after extensive research into the period and language and published in 2011 under the pen name of Ava Farmer.

Jo Baker&#x27;s bestselling 2013 novel &quot;Longbourn&quot; imagines the lives of the servants of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. A cinematic adaptation of &quot;Longbourn&quot; was due to start filming in late 2018, directed by Sharon Maguire, who also directed &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot;, screenplay by Jessica Swale, produced by Random House Films and StudioCanal. The novel was also adapted for radio, appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot;, abridged by Sara Davies and read by Sophie Thompson. It was first broadcast in May 2014; and again on Radio 4 Extra in September 2018.

In the novel &quot;Eligible&quot;, Curtis Sittenfeld sets the characters of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; in modern-day Cincinnati, where the Bennet parents, erstwhile Cincinnati social climbers, have fallen on hard times. Elizabeth, a successful and independent New York journalist, and her single older sister Jane must intervene to salvage the family&#x27;s financial situation and get their unemployed adult sisters to move out of the house and onward in life. In the process they encounter Chip Bingley, a young doctor and reluctant reality TV celebrity, and his medical school classmate, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a cynical neurosurgeon.

&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has also inspired works of scientific writing. In 2010, scientists named a pheromone identified in male mouse urine &quot;darcin&quot;, after Mr Darcy, because it strongly attracted females. In 2016, a scientific paper published in the &quot;Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease&quot; speculated that Mrs Bennet may have been a carrier of a rare genetic disease, explaining why the Bennets didn&#x27;t have any sons, and why some of the Bennet sisters are so silly.

In summer 2014, Udon Entertainment&#x27;s Manga Classics line published a manga adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

<text>The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is located in London, England. It is commonly called the Houses of Parliament after the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two legislative chambers which occupy the building. The palace is one of the centres of political life in the United Kingdom; &quot;Westminster&quot; has become a metonym for the UK Parliament and the British Government, and the Westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace. The Elizabeth Tower of the palace, nicknamed Big Ben, is a landmark of London and the United Kingdom in general. The palace has been a Grade I listed building since 1970 and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

The building was originally constructed in the eleventh century as a royal palace and was the primary residence of the kings of England until 1512, when a fire destroyed the royal apartments. The monarch moved to the adjacent Palace of Whitehall, but the remainder of the palace continued to serve as the home of the Parliament of England, which had met there since the 13th century. In 1834 a second, larger fire destroyed the majority of the palace, but the twelfth century Westminster Hall was saved and incorporated into the replacement building.

The competition to design the new palace was won by the architect Charles Barry, who chose a Gothic Revival style for the building. Construction started in 1840 and lasted for 30 years, suffering delays, cost overruns, and the deaths of Barry and his assistant, Augustus Pugin. The palace contains chambers for the House of Commons, House of Lords, and the monarch, and has a floor area of . Extensive repairs had to be made after the Second World War, including rebuilding the destroyed Commons chamber. Despite further conservation work having been carried out since, the palace is in urgent need of major repairs.

== History ==
=== Old Palace ===

The site of the current palace and Houses of Parliament may have been used by Cnut during his reign from 1016 to 1035, and from Edward the Confessor built a palace and the first Westminster Abbey. The oldest surviving part of the palace is Westminster Hall, which dates from the reign of William II (). The palace was the principal residence of the English monarchs in the late Medieval period. In 1512, during the early reign of Henry VIII, a fire destroyed the royal apartments of the palace. In 1534 Henry moved to the neighbouring Palace of Whitehall, formerly York Place, which he had seized from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. Although Westminster remained a royal palace, from this point on its primary occupants were the two houses of Parliament and various courts of law.

The predecessor of Parliament, the Curia Regis, met in Westminster Hall when the king was in residence. The &quot;Model Parliament&quot;, considered the first Parliament of England, met at the palace in 1295; while medieval parliaments of England met in a variety of locations, the palace was frequently used and developed into the body&#x27;s permanent home. The palace did not have purpose-built chambers for the House of Commons or the House of Lords instead using the available large gathering spaces built for the palace. In time, the Commons adapted St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel for its use in the sixteenth century, and the Lords used the Painted Chamber and, from 1801, the White Chamber. 
The palace underwent significant alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space. These included a new storage and committee rooms by John Vardy, completed in 1770; a new official residence for the Speaker of the House of Commons, completed in 1795; and significant alterations and a new building by James Wyatt, completed in 1801. The last alterations were undertaken by Sir John Soane between 1824 and 1827, and included new library facilities for both Houses of Parliament and new law courts for the Chancery and King&#x27;s Bench.

=== Fire and reconstruction ===

On 16 October 1834, a fire broke out in the palace after an overheated stove used to destroy the Exchequer&#x27;s stockpile of tally sticks set fire to the House of Lords Chamber. Both Houses of Parliament were destroyed, along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex. Westminster Hall was saved thanks to fire-fighting efforts and a change in the direction of the wind. The Jewel Tower and the undercroft, cloisters, and chapter house of St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel were the only other parts of the palace to survive.

William IV offered the almost-completed Buckingham Palace to Parliament, hoping to dispose of a residence he disliked; however, the building was considered unsuitable for parliamentary use and the gift was rejected. The Painted Chamber and White Chamber were hastily repaired for temporary use, and in 1835, following that year&#x27;s General Election, the King permitted Parliament to make &quot;plans for [its] permanent accommodation&quot;. Each house created a committee and a Perpendicular Gothic Revival design by the architect Charles Barry was chosen. Barry was inexperienced with Gothic, and relied heavily on Augustus Pugin to design details. The Lords Chamber was completed in 1847, and the Commons Chamber in 1852. Although most of the work had been carried out by 1860, construction was not finished until a decade afterwards.

=== Second World War damage and restoration ===
 During the Second World War the palace was hit by bombs on fourteen separate occasions. A bomb that fell on 26 September 1940 lifted the statue of Richard the Lionheart from its pedestal and bent its sword, an image that was used as a symbol of the strength of democracy, &quot;which would bend but not break under attack&quot;.

The worst raid took place in the night of 10–11 May 1941, when the palace took at least twelve hits and three people (two policemen and Resident Superintendent of the House of Lords, Edward Elliott) were killed. The Commons Chamber and the roof of Westminster Hall were both set alight; as the firefighters could not save both, the hall was prioritised and saved, while the chamber was destroyed. The Lords Chamber and Clock Tower were damaged in the same raid. The Commons Chamber was rebuilt in a simplified style after the war, being completed in 1950.

=== Recent history ===
As the need for office space in the palace increased, Parliament acquired office space in the nearby Norman Shaw Building in 1975 and in the custom-built Portcullis House, completed in 2000. This increase has enabled all Members of Parliament (MP) to have their own office facilities.

The palace was designated a Grade I listed building in 1970 and a World Heritage Site in 1987. The fabric of the building is in urgent need of restoration. In January 2018, the House of Commons voted for both houses to vacate the palace to allow for a complete refurbishment of the building, which will take at least six years and start no sooner than 2025. In September 2022, the Restoration and Renewal Client Board, a joint committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons, was formed to oversee the necessary works.

== Exterior ==
Charles Barry&#x27;s collaborative design for the Palace of Westminster uses the Perpendicular Gothic style, which was popular during the 15th century and returned during the Gothic revival of the 19th century. Barry was a classical architect, but he was aided by the Gothic architect Augustus Pugin. Westminster Hall, which was built in the 11th century and survived the fire of 1834, was incorporated in Barry&#x27;s design. Pugin was displeased with the result of the work, especially with the symmetrical layout designed by Barry; he famously remarked, &quot;All Grecian, sir; Tudor details on a classic body&quot;.

=== Stonework ===
In 1839 Charles Barry toured Britain, looking at quarries and buildings, with a committee which included two leading geologists and a stonecarver. They selected Anston, a sand-coloured magnesian limestone quarried in the villages of Anston, South Yorkshire, and Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. Two quarries were chosen from a list of 102, with the majority of the stone coming from the former. A crucial consideration was transport, achieved on water via the Chesterfield Canal, the North Sea and the rivers Trent and Thames. Furthermore, Anston was cheaper, and &quot;could be supplied in blocks up to four feet thick and lent itself to elaborate carving&quot;.

Barry&#x27;s new Palace of Westminster was rebuilt using the sandy-coloured Anston limestone. However the stone soon began to decay owing to pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used. Although such defects were clear as early as 1849, nothing was done for the remainder of the 19th century even after much studying. During the 1910s, however, it became clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced. In 1928 it was deemed necessary to use Clipsham stone, a honey-coloured limestone from Rutland, to replace the decayed Anston. The project began in the 1930s but was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War and completed only during the 1950s. By the 1960s pollution had again begun to take its toll. A stone conservation and restoration programme to the external elevations and towers began in 1981 and ended in 1994.

=== Towers ===
==== Victoria Tower ====
The Palace of Westminster has three main towers. The largest and tallest is the Victoria Tower, which occupies the south-western corner of the palace. The tower was an integral part of Barry&#x27;s original design, and he intended it to be the most memorable element, conceiving it as the keep of a legislative &quot;castle&quot;. The tower was redesigned several times, and its height increased progressively; upon its completion in 1858 it was the tallest secular building in the world.

At base of the tower is the Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance, used by the monarch whenever entering the palace to open Parliament or for other state occasions. The high archway is richly decorated with sculptures, including statues of Saints George, Andrew and Patrick, and Queen Victoria. The main body of the tower houses the Parliamentary Archives in of steel shelves spread over 12 floors. The archives include the master copies of all Acts of Parliament since 1497 and important manuscripts such as the original Bill of Rights and the death warrant of King Charles I. At the top of the cast-iron pyramidal roof is a flagstaff, from which flies the Royal Standard (the monarch&#x27;s personal flag) when the Sovereign is present in the palace. On all other days the Union Flag flies from the mast.

==== Big Ben (Elizabeth Tower) ====
At the north end of the palace is the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known by the nickname &quot;Big Ben&quot;. At it is only slightly shorter than the Victoria Tower, but much slimmer. It was called the Clock Tower until 2012, when it was renamed to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the palace.

The tower houses the Great Clock, which uses the original mechanism built by Edward John Dent to designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. It is highly accurate by nineteenth-century standards, striking the hour to within a second of the time, and remaining reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the hour hand is long and the minute hand . 

Five bells hang in the belfry above the clock. The four quarter bells strike the Westminster Chimes every quarter-hour. The largest bell strikes the hours; officially called the &quot;Great Bell&quot;, it is generally referred to as Big Ben, a nickname of uncertain origins which, over time, has been applied to the whole tower. The original hour bell cracked during testing and was recast; the present bell later developed a crack of its own, which gives it a distinctive sound. It is the third-heaviest bell in Britain, weighing 13.8 tonnes. In the lantern at the top of Elizabeth Tower is the Ayrton Light, which is lit when either House of Parliament is sitting after dark. It was installed in 1885 at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace whether the members were &quot;at work&quot;, and named after Acton Smee Ayrton, who was First Commissioner of Works in the 1870s.

==== Central Tower ====
The shortest of the palace&#x27;s three principal towers (at ), the octagonal Central Tower stands over the middle of the building, immediately above the Central Lobby. It was added to the plans on the insistence of Dr. David Boswell Reid, who was in charge of the ventilation of the new Houses of Parliament: his plan called for a central chimney through which what he called &quot;vitiated air&quot; would be drawn out of the building with the heat and smoke of about four hundred fires around the palace. To accommodate the tower Barry was forced to lower the high ceiling he had planned for the Central Lobby and reduce the height of its windows; however, the tower proved to be an opportunity to improve the palace&#x27;s exterior design, and Barry to make it a spire in order to balance the effect of the more massive lateral towers. The Central Tower completely failed to fulfill its stated purpose, but it remains notable as &quot;the first occasion when mechanical services had a real influence on architectural design,&quot; withstanding certain climate-specific architectural elements such as windcatchers.

==== Smaller towers ====
Some other features of the palace of Westminster are known as towers. St Stephen&#x27;s Tower is positioned in the middle of the west front of the palace, between Westminster Hall and Old Palace Yard, and houses the public entrance to the palace. The pavilions at the northern and southern ends of the river front are called Speaker&#x27;s Tower and Chancellor&#x27;s Tower respectively, after the presiding officers of the two Houses at the time of the palace&#x27;s reconstruction—the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Chancellor. Speaker&#x27;s Tower contains Speaker&#x27;s House, the official residence of the Speaker of the Commons.

As well as the pinnacles which rise from between the window bays along the fronts of the palace, numerous turrets enliven the building&#x27;s skyline. Like the Central Tower these were built for practical reasons, as they mask ventilation shafts.

=== Grounds ===

There are a number of small gardens surrounding the Palace of Westminster. Victoria Tower Gardens is open as a public park along the side of the river south of the palace. Black Rod&#x27;s Garden (named after the office of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod) is closed to the public and is used as a private entrance. Old Palace Yard, in front of the palace, is paved over and covered in concrete security blocks (&quot;see security below&quot;). Cromwell Green (also on the frontage, and in 2006 enclosed by hoardings for the construction of a new visitor centre), New Palace Yard (on the north side) and Speaker&#x27;s Green (directly north of the palace) are all private and closed to the public. College Green, opposite the House of Lords, is a small triangular green commonly used for television interviews with politicians.

== Interior ==
The Palace of Westminster contains over 1,100 rooms, 100 staircases and of passageways, which are spread over four floors. The ground floor is occupied by offices, dining rooms and bars; the first, or principal, floor houses the main rooms of the palace, including the debating chambers, the lobbies and the libraries. The top two floors are used as committee rooms and offices.

Some of the interiors were designed and painted by J. G. Crace, working in collaboration with Pugin and others. For example, Crace decorated and gilded the ceiling of the Chapel of St. Mary Undercroft.

=== Layout ===
The palace is a roughly rectangular building with its long axis parallel to the River Thames. The building is planned around the Central Lobby, a large hall from which corridors lead north to the Commons Chamber, south to the Lords Chamber, and west to the public entrance and Westminster Hall; to the east are committee rooms and libraries. A suite of rooms known as the Royal Apartments are at the disposal of the reigning monarch; they lie beyond the Lords Chamber at the far south of the palace.

The palace has separate entrances for its different users: the monarch, members of the House of Lords, members of Parliament and the public. The Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance is at the base of the Victoria Tower in the south-west corner of the palace, and leads directly to the Royal Apartments. Members of the House of Lords use the Peers&#x27; Entrance in the middle of the Old Palace Yard façade, which opens to an entrance hall. A staircase from there leads, through a corridor and the Prince&#x27;s Chamber, to the Lords Chamber. Members of Parliament enter their part of the building from the Members&#x27; Entrance in the south side of New Palace Yard. Their route passes through a cloakroom in the lower level of the Cloisters and eventually reaches the Members&#x27; Lobby directly south of the Commons Chamber. St Stephen&#x27;s Entrance, in the approximate centre of the building&#x27;s western front, is the public entrance. From it visitors walk through a flight of stairs to St Stephen&#x27;s Hall, which houses a collection of marble statues of prominent parliamentarians, and then to the Central Lobby.

=== Royal Apartments ===

==== Norman Porch ====
The Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance is beneath the Victoria Tower. It was designed for the use of the monarch, and is used by them during the State Opening of Parliament. The Sovereign&#x27;s Entrance is also the formal entrance used by visiting dignitaries, as well as the starting point of public tours of the palace.

From the entrance, a staircase leads up to the principal floor in a broad, unbroken flight of 26 steps made of grey granite. At the top is the Norman Porch, a square landing with a central clustered column and a ceiling of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses. The porch was named for its proposed decorative scheme, which was never completed but would have consisted of statues of the Norman kings and frescoes depicting Norman history. As completed, the porch contains stained glass windows depicting Edward the Confessor and a young Queen Victoria, a copy of a 1900 painting of Victoria by Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, and busts of prime ministers who have sat in the House of Lords on the plinths intended for the statues. A double door opposite the stairs leads to the Royal Gallery, and another to the right opens to the Robing Room.

==== Robing Room ====

The Robing Room lies at the southern end of the palace&#x27;s north-south axis, and occupies the centre of the south front, overlooking Victoria Tower Gardens. It is where the Sovereign prepares for the State Opening of Parliament by changing into their official robes and putting on the Imperial State Crown. The focus of the room is the chair of state, which sits on a dais of three steps under a canopy adorned with the arms and floral emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland. A panel of purple velvet forms the backdrop to the chair, embroidered by the Royal School of Needlework with the royal arms, surrounded by stars and &quot;VR&quot; monograms. Edward Barry designed both the chair—the cushion and back of which are also embroidered—and the ornate marble fireplace across the room, which features gilded statuettes of Saint George and Saint Michael.

The decorative theme of the room is the legend of King Arthur, considered by many Victorians the source of their nationhood. Five frescoes painted by William Dyce between 1848 and 1864 cover the walls, depicting allegorical scenes from the legend. Each scene represents a chivalric virtue; the largest, between the two doors, is titled &quot;Admission of Sir Tristram to the Round Table&quot; and illustrates the virtue of Hospitality. Seven were originally commissioned but the remaining two paintings were not carried out due to the artist&#x27;s death, and on the wallpapered panels flanking the Chair of State hang oil portraits of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert by Franz Xaver Winterhalter. Other decorations in the room are also inspired by the Arthurian legend, namely a series of 18 bas-reliefs beneath the paintings, carved in oak by Henry Hugh Armstead, and the frieze running below the ceiling, which displays the attributed coats of arms of the Knights of the Round Table. The ceiling itself is decorated with heraldic badges, as is the border of the wooden floor—which, as can be seen in the adjacent image, is left exposed by the carpeting.

The Robing Room was briefly used as the House of Lords&#x27; meeting chamber while the House of Lords Chamber was occupied by the House of Commons, whose chamber had been destroyed by the Blitz in 1941.

==== Royal Gallery ====
Immediately north of the Robing Room is the Royal Gallery. At , it is one of the largest rooms in the palace. Its main purpose is to serve as the stage of the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament, which the audience watch from temporary tiered seating on both sides of the route. It has also been used on occasion by visiting statesmen from abroad when addressing both Houses of Parliament, as well as for receptions in honour of foreign dignitaries, and more regularly for the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Breakfast; in the past it was the theatre of several trials of peers by the House of Lords. Documents from the Parliamentary Archives are on display in the Royal Gallery (including a facsimile of Charles I&#x27;s death warrant), and the tables and seating offer a workspace for members of the Lords that is conveniently close to their debating chamber.

The decorative scheme of the Royal Gallery was meant to display important moments in British military history, and the walls are decorated by two large paintings by Daniel Maclise, each measuring : &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot; (depicting Lord Nelson&#x27;s demise at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805) and &quot;The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after the Battle of Waterloo&quot; (showing the Duke of Wellington meeting Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815). The murals deteriorated rapidly after their completion due to a range of factors, most importantly atmospheric pollution, and today they are almost monochrome, although a finished study of &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot; in better condition hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. The rest of the planned frescos were cancelled, and the walls are filled with portraits of kings and queens from George I onwards. Another decorative element with military undertones are the eight statues of gilded Caen stone that flank the three doorways and the bay window of the Gallery, sculpted by John Birnie Philip. Each depicts a monarch during whose reign a key battle or war took place. They are: Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror; Richard I and Edward III; Henry V and Elizabeth I; William III and Anne. The panelled ceiling, above the floor, features Tudor roses and lions, and the stained-glass windows show the coats of arms of the Kings of England and Scotland.

==== Prince&#x27;s Chamber ====

The Prince&#x27;s Chamber is a small between the Royal Gallery and the Lords Chamber, named after the room adjoining the Parliament Chamber in the Old Palace of Westminster. Thanks to its location, it is a place where members of the Lords meet to discuss business of the House. Several doors lead out of the room, to the division lobbies of the House of Lords and to a number of important offices.

The theme of the Prince&#x27;s Chamber is Tudor history, and 28 oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the Tudor dynasty. They are the work of Richard Burchett and his pupils, and their creation entailed extensive research, which contributed to the founding of the National Portrait Gallery in 1856. 12 bronze bas-reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits, executed by William Theed in 1855–1857. Scenes included are &quot;The Field of the Cloth of Gold&quot;, &quot;The Escape of Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; and &quot;Raleigh Spreading His Cloak As a Carpet for the Queen&quot;. Above the portraits, at window level, are copies of six of the ten Armada tapestries, which hung in the chamber of the House of Lords until their destruction in the 1834 fire and depicted the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The project was put on hold in 1861 (by which time only one painting had been completed), and was not revived until 2007; , all six paintings are now in their intended places.

The room also contains a statue of Queen Victoria, seated on a throne (itself placed on a pedestal) and holding a sceptre and a laurel crown, which show that she both governs and rules. This figure is flanked by allegorical statues of Justice and Clemency, the former with a bare sword and an inflexible expression and the latter showing sympathy and offering an olive branch. The sculptural ensemble, made of white marble and carved by John Gibson in 1855, reaches in height; its size has long been considered out of proportion with the fittings of the Prince&#x27;s Chamber, and the flanking statues ended up in storage between 1955 and 1976. However, the size and location of the group, in the archway opposite the doors to the Royal Gallery (which are removed before State Openings of Parliament to facilitate the royal procession), indicate that it was meant to be seen from a distance, and to symbolically remind the monarch of their royal duties as they would walk down the Royal Gallery on their way to deliver their speech.

=== Precincts of the House of Lords ===
==== Lords Chamber ====
The Chamber of the House of Lords is located in the southern part of the Palace of Westminster. The lavishly decorated room measures . The benches in the Chamber, as well as other furnishings in the Lords&#x27; side of the palace, are coloured red. The upper part of the Chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion, chivalry and law.

At the south end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; although the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers&#x27; sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the Woolsack, an armless red cushion stuffed with wool, representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the Lord Speaker since 2006, but historically the Lord Chancellor or a deputy). The House&#x27;s mace, which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the Woolsack. In front of the Woolsack is the Judges&#x27; Woolsack, a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the Law Lords (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.

Members of the House occupy red benches on three sides of the Chamber. The benches on the Lord Speaker&#x27;s right form the Spiritual Side and those to his left form the Temporal Side. The Lords Spiritual (archbishops and bishops of the established Church of England) all occupy the Spiritual Side. The Lords Temporal (nobles) sit according to party affiliation: members of the Government party sit on the Spiritual Side, while those of the Opposition sit on the Temporal Side. Some peers, who have no party affiliation, sit on the benches in the middle of the House opposite the Woolsack; they are accordingly known as crossbenchers.

The Lords Chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government&#x27;s programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords&#x27; debating floor; instead, they watch the proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.

Following the Blitz, which destroyed the chamber of the House of Commons, the Lords&#x27; chamber was occupied by the Commons. The Lords temporarily used the Robing Room during the reconstruction. The State Opening Of Parliament was carried out as normal, with the new rooms being used. Evidence can still be seen of this today, with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by Black Rod.

==== Peers&#x27; Lobby ====
Directly north of the Lords Chamber lies the Peers&#x27; Lobby, an antechamber where Lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the House, as well as collect messages from the doorkeepers, who control access to the Chamber. The Lobby is a square room measuring on each side and in height, and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece, a radiant Tudor rose made of Derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates. The rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and Latin mottoes. The walls are faced with white stone and each is pierced by a doorway; above the arches are displayed arms representing the six royal dynasties which ruled England until Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign (Saxon, Norman, Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart and Hanoverian), and between them there are windows stained with the arms of the early aristocratic families of England.

Of the doorways, the one to the south—which leads into the Lords Chamber—is the most magnificent, and sports much gilding and decoration, including the full royal arms. It is enclosed by the Brass Gates, a pair of elaborately pierced and studded doors together weighing 1.5 tonnes. The side doors, which feature clocks, open into corridors: to the east extends the Law Lords Corridor, which leads to the libraries, and nearby to the west lies the Moses Room, used for Grand Committees.

To the north is the vaulted Peers&#x27; Corridor, which is decorated with eight murals by Charles West Cope depicting historical scenes from the period around the English Civil War. The frescoes were executed between 1856 and 1866, and each scene was &quot;specifically chosen to depict the struggles through which national liberties were won&quot;. Examples include &quot;Speaker Lenthall Asserting the Privileges of the Commons Against Charles I when the Attempt was Made to Seize the Five Members&quot;, representing resistance against absolute rule, and &quot;The Embarkation of the Pilgrim Fathers for New England&quot;, which illustrates the principle of freedom of worship.

=== Central Lobby ===
Originally named &quot;Octagon Hall&quot; because of its shape, the Central Lobby is the heart of the Palace of Westminster. It lies directly below the Central Tower and forms a busy crossroads between the House of Lords to the south, the House of Commons to the north, St Stephen&#x27;s Hall and the public entrance to the west, and the Lower Waiting Hall and the libraries to the east. Its location halfway between the two debating chambers has led constitutional theorist Erskine May to describe the Lobby as &quot;the political centre of the British Empire&quot;, and allows a person standing under the great chandelier to see both the Royal Throne and the Speaker&#x27;s Chair, provided that all the intervening doors are open. Constituents may meet their Members of Parliament here, even without an appointment, and this practice is the origin of the term &quot;lobbying&quot;. The hall is also the theatre of the Speaker&#x27;s Procession, which passes from here on its way to the Commons Chamber before every sitting of the House.

The Central Lobby measures across and from the floor to the centre of the vaulted ceiling. The panels between the vault&#x27;s ribs are covered with Venetian glass mosaic displaying floral emblems and heraldic badges, and the bosses in the intersections of the ribs are also carved into heraldic symbols. Each wall of the Lobby is contained in an arch ornamented with statues of English and Scottish monarchs; on four sides there are doorways, and the tympana above them are adorned with mosaics representing the patron saints of the United Kingdom&#x27;s constituent nations: Saint George for England, Saint Andrew for Scotland, Saint David for Wales and Saint Patrick for Ireland. The other four arches are occupied by high windows, under which there are stone screens—the hall&#x27;s post office, one of two in the palace, is located behind one of these screens. In front of them stand four bigger-than-life statues of 19th-century statesmen, including one of four-time prime minister William Gladstone. The floor on which they stand is tiled with Minton encaustic tiles in intricate patterns and includes a passage from written in Latin, which translates as follows: &quot;Except the Lord build the House their labour is but lost that build it&quot;.

The East Corridor leads from the Central Lobby to the Lower Waiting Hall, and its six panels remained blank until 1910, when they were filled with scenes from Tudor history. They were all paid for by Liberal peers and each was the work of a different artist, but uniformity was achieved between the frescoes thanks to a common colour palette of red, black and gold and a uniform height for the depicted characters. One of the scenes is probably not historical: &quot;Plucking the Red and White Roses in the Old Temple Gardens&quot;, depicting the origin of these flowers as emblems of the Houses of Lancaster and York respectively, was taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;.

=== Precincts of the House of Commons ===
==== Members&#x27; Lobby ====


Continuing north from the Central Lobby is the Commons&#x27; Corridor. It is of almost identical design to its southern counterpart and is decorated with scenes of 17th-century political history between the Civil War and the Revolution of 1688. They were painted by Edward Matthew Ward and include subjects like &quot;Monk Declaring for a Free Parliament&quot; and &quot;The Lords and Commons Presenting the Crown to William III and Mary II in the Banqueting Hall&quot;. Then, mirroring the arrangement at the Lords part of the palace, is another antechamber, the Members&#x27; Lobby. In this room, Members of Parliament hold discussions or negotiations, and are often interviewed by accredited journalists, collectively known as &quot;The Lobby&quot;.

The room is similar to the Peers&#x27; Lobby but plainer in design and slightly larger, forming a cube on all sides. After the heavy damage it sustained in the 1941 bombing, it was rebuilt in a simplified style, something most evident in the floor, which is almost completely unadorned. The archway of the door leading into the Commons Chamber has been left unrepaired as a reminder of the evils of war, and is now known as the Rubble Arch or Churchill Arch. It is flanked by bronze statues of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, the prime ministers who led Britain through the Second and First World War respectively; a foot of each is conspicuously shiny, a result of a long tradition of MPs rubbing them for good luck on their way in before their maiden speech. The Lobby contains the busts and statues of most 20th-century prime ministers, as well as two large boards where MPs can receive letters and telephone messages, designed for the use of the House and installed in the early 1960s.

==== Commons Chamber ====

The Chamber of the House of Commons is at the northern end of the Palace of Westminster; it was opened in 1950 after the Victorian chamber had been destroyed in 1941 and re-built under the architect Giles Gilbert Scott. The Chamber measures and is plainer in style than the Lords Chamber; the benches, as well as other furnishings in the Commons side of the palace, are coloured green. Members of the public are forbidden to sit on the benches. Other parliaments in Commonwealth nations, including those of India, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have copied the colour scheme under which the Lower House is associated with green, and the Upper House with red.
At the north end of the Chamber is the Speaker&#x27;s Chair, a present to Parliament from Australia. The current British Speaker&#x27;s Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker&#x27;s Chair given to Australia (itself a copy of the original chair) by the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, to celebrate the opening of Provisional Parliament House, Canberra. In front of the Speaker&#x27;s Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons&#x27; ceremonial mace. The Table was a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker&#x27;s right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker&#x27;s left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament—during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end of the House.

By tradition, the British Sovereign does not enter the Chamber of the House of Commons. The last monarch to do so was King Charles I, in 1642. The King sought to arrest five Members of Parliament on charges of high treason, but when he asked the Speaker, William Lenthall, if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of these individuals, Lenthall famously replied: &quot;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.&quot; Since then, in the State Opening of Parliament, when Black Rod representing the monarch approaches the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons to make the summons, the doors are pointedly slammed in his or her face. Black Rod has to strike the door three times with a staff, to be admitted and issue the summons from the monarch to the MPs to attend. When repairs after the Second World War bombing were completed, the rebuilt chamber was opened by King George VI on 26 October 1950 who was invited to an &quot;unofficial&quot; tour of the new structure by Commons leaders.

The two red lines on the floor of the House of Commons are apart, which, by apocryphal tradition, is intended to be just over two sword-lengths. It is said that the original purpose of this was to prevent disputes in the House from degenerating into duels. However, there is no record of a time when Members of Parliament were allowed to bring swords into the Chamber; historically only the Serjeant at Arms has been allowed to carry a sword as a symbol of their role in Parliament, plus Black Rod when summoning the Commons to the Lords, and there are loops of pink ribbon in the Members&#x27; cloakroom for MPs to hang up their swords before entering the Chamber. In the days when gentlemen carried swords, there were no lines in the Chamber. Protocol dictates that MPs may not cross these lines when speaking; a Member of Parliament who violates this convention will be lambasted by opposition Members.

=== Westminster Hall ===

Westminster Hall is a large medieval great hall and the oldest surviving palace building. It was erected in 1097 for William II (&quot;William Rufus&quot;), at which point it was the largest hall in Europe. The building has had various functions over the years, including being used for judicial purposes from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. When a joint address is given to the two chambers of the UK Parliament, the House of Commons and House of Lords, the hall is on rare occasions the venue. It was also used to host coronation banquets until the nineteenth century, and since the twentieth century has been the usual venue for the lyings in state of state and ceremonial funerals.

The hall is particularly notable for its hammerbeam roof, a form typical of English Gothic architecture which uses horizontal trusses to span large distances; the hall originally had three aisles. The roof was commissioned for Richard II in 1393 and built by the royal carpenter, Hugh Herland. It is the largest clearspan medieval roof in England, measuring 20.7 by 73.2 metres (68 by 240 ft). The oak timbers came from woods in South-East England and were assembled near Farnham, Surrey, 56 kilometres (35 mi) away from Westminster. At the same time the rest of the hall was remodelled by the master mason Henry Yevele, who refaced the walls and added fifteen life-size statues of kings placed in niches. The renovations include eighty-three unique depictions of Richard&#x27;s favourite heraldic badge, a resting chained white hart.

=== Other rooms ===
There are two suites of libraries on the Principal Floor, overlooking the river, for the House of Lords Library and House of Commons Library.

The Palace of Westminster also includes state apartments for the presiding officers of the two Houses. The official residence of the Speaker stands at the northern end of the palace; the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s apartments are at the southern end. Each day, the Speaker and Lord Speaker take part in formal processions from their apartments to their respective Chambers.

The Strangers&#x27; Bar is one of the numerous bars, cafeterias and restaurants in the Palace of Westminster, with differing rules regarding who is allowed to use their facilities; many of them never close while the House is sitting. There is also a gymnasium, a hair salon; and there was a rifle range (which closed in 2015). Parliament also has two souvenir shops, where items on sale range from House of Commons key-rings and china to House of Commons Champagne.

== Security ==
An official known as Black Rod (officially the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, or Lady Usher of the Black Rod) oversees security for the House of Lords, while the Serjeant at Arms does the same for the House of Commons. These officers, however, have primarily ceremonial roles outside the actual chambers of their respective Houses. Security is the responsibility of the Parliamentary Security Director. Parliament has its own professional security force. Tradition still dictates that only the Serjeant at Arms may enter the Commons chamber armed.

With rising concern about the possibility that a vehicle full of explosives could be driven into the building, a series of concrete blocks were placed in the roadway in 2003. On the river, an exclusion zone extending from the bank exists, which no unauthorised vessels are allowed to enter.

The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 formerly made it illegal to hold a protest near the palace, or anywhere else within a designated area extending up to from Parliament Square, without authorisation from the Metropolitan Police. The Act also restricted the operation of loudspeakers in the designated area. These provisions were repealed by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which replaced them with a total ban on tents and sleeping bags in Parliament Square, as well as a prohibition on the use of loudspeakers in the Square without permission from the relevant local authority.

Members of the public continue to have access to the Strangers&#x27; Gallery in the House of Commons. Visitors pass through metal detectors and their possessions are scanned. Police from the Palace of Westminster Division of the Metropolitan Police, supported by some armed police from the Diplomatic Protection Group, are always on duty in and around the palace.

=== Incidents ===
The failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a conspiracy among a group of Roman Catholic gentry to re-establish Catholicism in England by assassinating the Protestant King James I and replacing him with a Catholic monarch. To this end, they placed large quantities of gunpowder beneath the House of Lords, which one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, would detonate during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. If successful, the explosion would have destroyed the palace, killing the King, his family and most of the aristocracy. However, the plot was discovered and most of the conspirators were either arrested or killed while trying to evade capture. The survivors were tortured in the Tower of London, tried for high treason in Westminster Hall, convicted and gruesomely executed by hanging, drawing and quartering. Since then, the cellars of the palace have been searched by the Yeomen of the Guard before every State Opening of Parliament, a traditional precaution against any similar attempts against the Sovereign.

The execution of Sir Walter Raleigh occurred at the palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618.

The previous Palace of Westminster was also the site of a prime-ministerial assassination on 11 May 1812. While in the lobby of the House of Commons, on his way to a parliamentary inquiry, Spencer Perceval was shot and killed by a Liverpool merchant adventurer, John Bellingham. Perceval remains the only British Prime Minister to have been assassinated.

The New Palace became the target of Fenian bombs on 24 January 1885, along with the Tower of London. The first bomb, a black bag containing dynamite, was discovered by a visitor on the steps towards the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft. Police Constable (PC) William Cole attempted to carry it to New Palace Yard, but the bag became so hot that Cole dropped it and it exploded. The blast opened a crater in the floor in diameter, damaged the roof of the chapel and shattered all the windows in the Hall, including the stained-glass South Window at St Stephen&#x27;s Porch. Both Cole and PC Cox, a colleague who had joined him to offer assistance, were seriously injured. A second explosion followed almost immediately in the Commons Chamber, causing great damage—especially to its south end—but no injuries, as it was empty at the time. The incident resulted in the closure of Westminster Hall to visitors for several years; when visitors were re-admitted in 1889, it was under certain restrictions and never while the two Houses were sitting.

On 17 June 1974, a bomb planted by the Provisional IRA exploded in Westminster Hall. The explosion and the resulting fire, which was fed by a ruptured gas main, injured 11 people and caused extensive damage. Five years later, a car bomb claimed the life of Airey Neave, a prominent Conservative politician, while he was driving out of the Commons car park in New Palace Yard. The attack occurred on 30 March 1979, one day after the announcement of that year&#x27;s general election; both the Irish National Liberation Army and the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for Neave&#x27;s assassination, but it is now accepted that the former were responsible.

The palace has also been the scene of numerous acts of politically motivated &quot;direct action&quot;, which often took place in the Chamber of the House of Commons. In July 1970, a man in the Strangers&#x27; Gallery threw two canisters of tear gas into the Chamber to protest against the use of such gas in Northern Ireland; an MP and two members of the House&#x27;s staff were taken to hospital and the sitting was suspended for almost two hours. In 1978, activist Yana Mintoff and another dissident threw bags of horse manure, and in June 1996 demonstrators dropped leaflets. Concern about such attacks and a possible chemical or biological attack led to the installation of a glass screen across the Strangers&#x27; Gallery in early 2004.

The new barrier does not cover the gallery in front of the Strangers&#x27; Gallery, which is reserved for ambassadors, members of the House of Lords, guests of MPs and other dignitaries, and in May 2004 protesters from Fathers 4 Justice attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair with flour bombs from this part, after obtaining admission by bidding for a place in the visitors&#x27; gallery in a charity auction. Subsequently, rules on admission to the visitors&#x27; galleries were changed, and now individuals wishing to sit in the galleries must first obtain a written pass from a Member certifying that that individual is personally known to them. In September of the same year, five protesters opposed to the proposed ban on fox hunting disrupted the proceedings of the House of Commons by running into the Chamber, the first such occurrence since King Charles I&#x27;s unauthorised entry in 1642, which triggered the English Civil War.

The House of Lords has also been targeted by protesters. On 2 February 1988, the House debated the Local Government Bill&#x27;s controversial Clause 28, a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Following the division, in which the clause passed, a number of lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans, and three of them tied ropes to the railing and climbed down onto the floor of the Chamber. Lord Monkswell, who had provided the women with passes to attend the debate, later apologised to the House for the incident but did not criticise the protest.

Similar actions have been carried out outside the Palace of Westminster. Early in the morning of 20 March 2004, two Greenpeace members scaled the Clock Tower to demonstrate against the Iraq War, raising questions about the security around such a likely target of terrorist attacks. In March 2007, another four members of Greenpeace made their way to the palace&#x27;s roof by means of a nearby crane, which was being used for repairs to Westminster Bridge. Once up, they unfurled a banner protesting against the British government&#x27;s plans to update the Trident nuclear programme.

In February 2008, five campaigners from the Plane Stupid group gained admittance to the building as visitors and then moved up to the roof to demonstrate against the proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport; from there they hung two banners they had smuggled past security. MPs and security experts found it worrying that the protesters made it to the roof in spite of the heightened security measures, and the prosecution at the activists&#x27; trial argued that they may have received help from a House of Lords employee. In October 2009, at least forty Greenpeace activists climbed to the roof of Westminster Hall to call for the adoption of policies combating climate change. Some of them climbed down after nearly five hours, while the rest spent the night on the roof.

On 22 March 2017 an Islamist-related terror attack was carried out in which a man stabbed a police officer after ploughing into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Five people were killed, including the attacker and the police officer. In August 2018 there was another attack, treated by prosecutors as terrorism.

On 1 April 2019, a group of environmental protestors from the group Extinction Rebellion stripped semi-naked in the public gallery during a Brexit debate and glued themselves to the handrail and glass screen with their buttocks facing the Commons Chamber. MPs attempted to continue the debate, some of them incorporating puns and references to nakedness into their speeches, to much hilarity.

There have been four fires on the Palace of Westminster site during 2019, and eight in 2018.

In 2022, the body of the late Queen Elizabeth was left inside the hall for people to pay their respects. A man decided to jump the barriers and pull away the flag draped over the coffin. He was detained and taken away by police and officials.

== Rules and traditions ==
The palace has accumulated many rules and traditions over the centuries.

=== Eating, drinking and smoking ===
Smoking has not been allowed in the chamber of the House of Commons since the 17th century. As a result, Members may take snuff instead and the doorkeepers still keep a snuff-box for this purpose. Despite persistent media rumours, it has not been permitted to smoke anywhere inside the palace since 2005. Members may not eat or drink in the chamber; the exception to this rule is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who may have a beverage of the Chancellors&#x27; choice while delivering the Budget statement. Traditionally this is an alcoholic beverage, often whisky or a similar spirit, but in recent times, Chancellors have opted for water.

=== Dress code ===
Men are expected to wear formal attire, women are expected to dress in business-like clothing and the wearing of T-shirts with slogans is not allowed. Hats must not be worn (although they used to be worn when a point of order was being raised), and Members may not wear military decorations or insignia. Members are not allowed to have their hands in their pocketsAndrew Robathan was heckled by opposing MPs for doing this on 19 December 1994.

=== Other traditions ===
The only animals allowed in the Palace of Westminster are guide dogs, police dogs and police horses.

Speeches may not be read out during debate in the House of Commons, although notes may be referred to. Similarly, the reading of newspapers is not allowed. Visual aids are discouraged in the chamber. Applause is also not normally allowed in the Commons, but it has since been tolerated in certain cases. Some notable exceptions to this were when Robin Cook gave his resignation speech in 2003; when Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared for the last time at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions; when Speaker Michael Martin gave his leaving speech on 17 June 2009; and after the resignation statement of Sir Robert Rogers, Clerk of the House. At the start of the new parliament in May 2015, the large influx of new Scottish National Party MPs flouted the convention and repeatedly applauded their party leader, to the displeasure of the Speaker.

The status of the building as a royal palace raises legal questionsaccording to Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, it is not possible to arrest a person within the &quot;verges&quot; of the palace (the palace itself and its immediate surroundings). However, according to a memorandum by the Clerk of the House of Commons, there is no prohibition on arrest within the palace and such arrests have been effected in the past.

== Culture and tourism ==

The exterior of the Palace of Westminsterespecially the Elizabeth Tower which houses the bell known as Big Ben, and its setting on the bank of the River Thames—is recognised worldwide, and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in London. Tsar Nicholas I called it &quot;a dream in stone&quot;. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) classifies the Palace of Westminster, along with neighbouring Westminster Abbey and St Margaret&#x27;s, as a World Heritage Site. It is also a Grade I listed building.

Although there is no casual access to the interior of the palace, there are several ways to gain admittance. UK residents may obtain tickets from an MP for a place in the viewing (&quot;strangers&quot;) gallery of the House of Commons, or from a Lord for a seat in the gallery of the House of Lords. It is also possible for both UK residents and overseas visitors to queue for admission to them at any time of the day or night when either House is in session, but capacity is limited and there is no guarantee of admission. Either House may exclude &quot;strangers&quot; if it desires to sit in private. Members of the public can also queue for a seat in a committee session, where admission is free and places cannot be booked, or they may visit the Parliamentary Archives for research purposes. Booking an appointment is necessary in the latter case, along with a proof of identity.
Free guided tours of the palace are held throughout the parliamentary session for UK residents, who can apply through their MP or a member of the House of Lords. The tours last about 75 minutes and include the state rooms, the chambers of the two Houses and Westminster Hall. Paid-for tours are available to both UK and overseas visitors during the summer recess and Saturdays throughout the year. Tours of the Elizabeth Tower were suspended until 2021 while the tower underwent refurbishment.
Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the palace as one of his five choices for the 2006 BBC television documentary series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Buildings&quot;.

The nearest London Underground station is Westminster, on the District, Circle and Jubilee lines.

In 2015, Parliament organised a year-long programme of events called &quot;Parliament in the Making&quot; to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta on 15 June, and the 750th anniversary of the first representative parliament on 20 January. Events were coordinated with Parliament Week. The BBC held events throughout the year including a &quot;Democracy Day&quot; on 20 January consisting of live discussions and debate in partnership with the Speaker&#x27;s Office of the House of Commons, including broadcasts from inside the Palace of Westminster.

<doc id="24171" wikidata="Q47160" url="?curid=24171" title="Plautus">
<text>Titus Maccius Plautus ( ; 254 – 184 BC) was a Roman playwright of the Old Latin period. His comedies are the earliest Latin literary works to have survived in their entirety. He wrote Palliata comoedia, the genre devised by Livius Andronicus, the innovator of Latin literature. The word Plautine () refers to both Plautus&#x27;s own works and works similar to or influenced by his.

==Biography==
Not much is known about Titus Maccius Plautus&#x27;s early life. It is believed that he was born in Sarsina, a small town in Emilia Romagna in northern Italy, around 254 BC. According to Morris Marples, Plautus worked as a stage-carpenter or scene-shifter in his early years. It is from this work, perhaps, that his love of the theater originated. His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the nomen &quot;Maccius&quot; (from Maccus, a clownish stock character in Atellan Farce) and agnomen &quot;Plautus&quot; (&quot;trampled flat&quot;, usually in reference to &quot;flat-footed&quot; but sometimes intending &quot;flat-eared&quot; like the ears of a hound). Tradition holds that he made enough money to go into the nautical business, but that the venture collapsed. He is then said to have worked as a manual laborer and to have studied Greek drama—particularly the New Comedy of Menander—in his leisure. His studies allowed him to produce his plays, which were released between and 184 BC. Plautus attained such popularity that his name alone became a hallmark of theatrical success.

Plautus&#x27;s comedies are mostly adapted from Greek models for a Roman audience, and are often based directly on the works of the Greek playwrights. He reworked the Greek texts to give them a flavour that would appeal to the local Roman audiences. They are the earliest surviving intact works in Latin literature.

Plautus&#x27;s epitaph read:


Since Plautus is dead, Comedy mourns,
The stage is deserted; then Laughter, Jest and Wit,
And all Melody&#x27;s countless numbers wept together.
==Surviving plays==
*&quot;Amphitruo&quot; (&quot;missing a large segment towards end&quot;)
:The play is set in Thebes in Greece. While the general, Amphitruo, is away fighting a war, the god Jupiter visits his house and sleeps with his wife Alcumena, disguising himself as her husband. Jupiter&#x27;s son Mercury, disguised as Amphitruo&#x27;s slave Sosia, keeps watch outside, and when the real Sosia turns up bringing news of the victory, Mercury teases him and beats him up. When Amphitruo turns up, Alcumena is surprised to see him back so soon. There is a quarrel and Amphitruo accuses her of adultery. He goes off to fetch a witness. Then Jupiter comes back for a second session with Alcumena, and when Amphitruo returns, Mercury, still disguised as Sosia, climbs on the roof and mischievously pelts him with tiles. (&quot;There is a gap in the manuscripts here&quot;.) Amphitruo, infuriated, is about to burst into the house and kill everybody, when suddenly there is a thunderclap; a nurse comes out and reports that Alcumena has given birth miraculously to two boys (one of them Hercules). Finally Jupiter appears and explains everything to Amphitruo.

*&quot;Asinaria&quot; (&quot;The Comedy of Asses&quot;)
:Demaenetus, an Athenian gentleman, tells his slave Libanus that he knows his son Argyrippus is in love with a prostitute, Philaenium, but has no money to pay for her. He asks the cunning Libanus to find the money by cheating his wealthy wife Artemona or her steward Saurea. Libanus is at a loss for a plan until his fellow slave, Leonida, by chance meets a stranger who has come to pay a debt to Saurea for some donkeys which had earlier been sold to a certain merchant. Leonida pretends to be Saurea, and he and Libanus gull the stranger into handing the money over to Leonida. The money is given to Argyrippus but with the stipulation that his father is to be allowed to spend the first night with Philaenium. But a rival lover, Diabolus, who wants Philaenium for himself, and arrives too late with his money, out of jealousy asks his parasite (hanger on) to inform Artemona what is going on. She storms to the brothel in a fury and drags her husband away to his great embarrassment, leaving Argyrippus to enjoy Philaenium by himself.

*&quot;Aulularia&quot; (&quot;The Pot of Gold&quot;) (&quot;missing ending&quot;)
:A miserly old man, Euclio, has found a pot () of gold in his house, and keeps checking that no one has stolen it. His wealthy neighbour Megadorus comes to ask for the hand of Euclio&#x27;s daughter Phaedrium, unaware that she was earlier raped and is heavily pregnant. Soon Megadorus&#x27;s slave Strobilus arrives with two hired cooks to prepare a wedding feast; he instructs one of the cooks, Congrio, to go to Euclio&#x27;s house and start work. When Euclio returns he is alarmed, thinking his gold is being stolen, and he chases Congrio out into the street. Euclio decides to hide the pot first in a neighbouring temple, and later in a grove outside the city, but he is spied on each time by a slave of Megadorus&#x27;s nephew Lyconides. Euclio is horrified to find that his gold has been stolen despite his precautions. At this point Lyconides confesses to Euclio that he raped Phaedrium and wishes to marry her. Later Lyconides discovers that it was his slave who stole the gold, and he insists that it must be returned. (&quot;The manuscript breaks off here, but from the ancient summary it seems that Lyconides returned the gold to Euclio, who consented to the marriage and gave him the gold as a dowry&quot;.)

*&quot;Bacchides&quot; (&quot;The Bacchis Sisters&quot;)
:(&quot;The first few scenes of the play are missing.&quot;) The young man Mnesilochus is in love with a courtesan called Bacchis. While he is abroad, his friend Pistoclerus falls in love with Bacchis&#x27;s twin sister, also called Bacchis. Mnesilochus returns from his two-year stay in Ephesus, where he had been sent by his father Nicobulus to collect some money. Mnesilochus&#x27;s cunning slave Chrysalus deceives Nicobulus into thinking that part of the money is still in Ephesus; in this way Mnesilochus will be able to keep some of the money to pay for Bacchis&#x27;s services. But when Mnesilochus hears that Pistoclerus has a girlfriend called Bacchis, in his anger he gives all the money to his father, keeping none back. Too late, he learns from Pistoclerus that there are two Bacchises. He begs Chrysalus to play another trick on his father to get the money he needs. Chrysalus tells Nicobulus that Mnesilochus has been making love to the wife of a soldier called Cleomachus who is threatening to kill Mnesilochus. To protect his son, Nicobulus willingly promises to pay 200 gold pieces. Later, in yet another deception, Chrysalus persuades Nicobulus to pay another 200 gold pieces to prevent his son committing perjury. But shortly afterwards when Nicobulus meets the soldier he learns that Bacchis is only a courtesan who owed the soldier money. Furious, Nicobulus and Pistoclerus&#x27;s father Philoxenus go to the Bacchises&#x27; house to confront their sons; the two sisters come out and charm them and persuade them to come in and enjoy the party.

*&quot;Captivi&quot; (&quot;The Captives&quot;)
:The play is set in Aetolia in western Greece. An old man, Hegio, has been buying up prisoners-of-war from Elis in the hope of exchanging one of them for his own son, who has himself been captured in Elis. Among Hegio&#x27;s captives are a young man, Philocrates, and his loyal slave Tyndarus, who have swapped identities so that Philocrates can go back to his family in Elis. The plan works, and Philocrates goes home. Meanwhile another Elian captive, Aristophontes, recognises Tyndarus and inadvertently informs Hegio what has happened. Tyndarus is sent to hard labour in a stone quarry. Later a parasite/hanger-on Ergasilus excitedly brings news that Hegio&#x27;s son has arrived at the harbour. Philocrates arrives, together with Hegio&#x27;s son, Philopolemus, bringing a run-away slave called Stalagmus. When Stalagmus is interrogated he reveals that Tyndarus is none other than Hegio&#x27;s long-lost son whom Stalagmus had kidnapped and sold years before. Tyndarus is rescued from his punishment and reunited with his father.

*&quot;Casina&quot;
:A father and son, Lysidamus and Euthynicus, are both in love with the beautiful Casina, a 16-year-old girl who was adopted into their family as a baby. The father sends his son abroad on a trip and plans for Casina to marry his farm-manager Olympio, so that he can use her as a mistress whenever he likes without his wife Cleostrata knowing. When Cleostrata discovers his intention, she plans for Casina to marry Euthynicus&#x27;s servant Chalinus, to keep her safe until Euthynicus returns. When, after lots are drawn, her plan fails, she dresses up Chalinus as Casina and sends him into the bedroom of the neighbour&#x27;s house where Lysidamus is planning to spend the night with Casina. The husband is exposed, and Casina is kept safe for Euthynicus&#x27;s return.

*&quot;Cistellaria&quot; (&quot;The Little Casket&quot;) (&quot;missing large segments&quot;)
:A young courtesan, Selenium, is in love with her first and only lover, a wealthy young man called Alcesimarchus, who has promised to marry her. But she is distressed to hear that Alcesimarchus is now engaged to marry another girl. Selenium believes she is the daughter of the courtesan Melaenis, but in fact her birth mother is Phanostrata, the mother of Alcesimarchus&#x27;s fiancée. By chance Melaenis overhears Phanostrata&#x27;s slave, Lampadio, who had been ordered to expose Selenium as a baby, telling his mistress that he had found the old woman who had picked her up, and that he learnt that she had given the baby to be adopted by a courtesan called Melaenis. Melaenis immediately hurries off to fetch the recognition tokens which she has been keeping in a small casket (). The casket is accidentally dropped in the street by the maid; it is found by Lampadio and shown to Phanostrata, who recognises the tokens. Alcesimarchus is now free to marry his beloved Selenium and all ends well. 

*&quot;Curculio&quot; 
:Phaedromus is a young man in Epidaurus in Greece, who is in love with a girl Planesium owned by a pimp Cappadox. Lacking the money to purchase her, Phaedromus had sent Curculio, a &quot;parasite&quot; (hanger-on), to Caria to borrow money from a certain friend. When he returns, Curculio tells Phaedromus that the friend had no money, but that he, Curculio, had met a soldier called Therapontigonus, who had told him that he intended to buy Planesium for himself. Curculio had stolen the soldier&#x27;s signet ring and hurried back to Epidaurus. Wearing a disguise and carrying his forged letter, he tricks the banker Lyso into paying the money to Cappadox, and so is able to purchase Planesium for Phaedromus. Planesium, however, recognises the ring as one that had once belonged to her father, and when the soldier arrives in Epidaurus he in turn recognises a ring which he had once given to her. Phaedromus is able to marry Planesium, and, because Planesium proves to be free-born, Cappadox is obliged to return the money that was paid for her.
*&quot;Epidicus&quot;
:The slave Epidicus&#x27;s young master Stratippocles returns from the war in Thebes, bringing a captive girl he has fallen in love with. He orders Epidicus to find 40 &quot;minae&quot; to pay for her. This alarms Epidicus, since earlier Stratippocles had made him find the money to buy a different girl, and Epidicus had done this by fooling Stratippocles&#x27; father Periphanes into believing that the girl was his daughter. Epidicus has an idea. He convinces Periphanes that Stratippocles is still in love with his music girl and has borrowed money to buy her. To prevent this, Epidicus suggests that Periphanes should buy the girl himself, and sell her to a certain army officer for a profit. Periphanes pays, but Epidicus brings him a different music-girl hired for the day and hands the money to Stratippocles. When the officer arrives he tells Periphanes it is not the same girl he wanted to buy. Now Philippa, a woman that Periphanes had raped years before, arrives, looking for her daughter who has been captured in the war. She and Periphanes recognise each other, but when he brings out the girl who Epidicus told him was their daughter, Philippa says it is not her. Epidicus is now in big trouble since he has fooled Periphanes twice. But by a lucky chance, when the captive arrives, Epidicus recognises her: she is Philippa&#x27;s daughter. Periphanes is so delighted to have found his missing daughter that he forgives Epidicus and gives him his freedom. 

*&quot;Menaechmi&quot;
:The play is set in Epidamnus in western Greece. The play opens when Peniculus, a &quot;parasite&quot;, arrives at the house of Menaechmus hoping to be given dinner. Menaechmus comes out, quarrelling with his shrewish wife. He tells Peniculus that he is going to give a cloak (actually his wife&#x27;s) to his girlfriend the courtesan Erotium, who lives next door. They persuade Erotium to invite them to dinner, and while waiting they go to the forum for drink. Meanwhile Menaechmus&#x27;s twin brother, also called Menaechmus, arrives from Syracuse with his slave Messenio, looking for his long-lost twin. Erotium greets him warmly, invites him in for dinner and afterwards gives him the cloak requesting it to be altered. A series of misunderstandings follows, during which the first Menaechmus gets tied up by his father-in-law and a doctor who think he has gone mad; he is rescued by Messenio. The two brothers finally meet. The first Menaechmus decides to auction off all his goods (including his wife) and return to Syracuse with his brother. Messenio claims his freedom for rescuing Menaechmus I.

*&quot;Mercator&quot; (&quot;The Merchant&quot;)
:Charinus, son of the Athenian merchant Demipho, met a beautiful girl called Pasicompsa in Rhodes and has brought her back to Athens. He intends to pretend that he has bought her as a maid for his mother. But his father catches sight of Pasicompsa at the port, and wants her for himself. He tells his son that Pasicompsa is too beautiful to be a maid, and insists she must be sold. He arranges for his friend Lysimachus to buy her and take her to his (Lysimachus&#x27;s) house. But Lysimachus&#x27;s wife returns unexpectedly from the country and when a cook turns up to prepare a feast there is a row. Lysimachus&#x27;s son Eutychus, who is a friend of Charinus, learns from a maid that Pasicompsa is inside the house. He fetches Charinus, who was about to go abroad in despair, and brings him to rescue Pasicompsa. Afterwards Eutychus meets Lysimachus and Demipho and chastises Demipho for his disgraceful behaviour.

*&quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; (&quot;The Braggart Soldier&quot;)
:The play is set in Ephesus. A boastful soldier, Pyrgopolynices, has abducted a courtesan, Philocomasium, from Athens. A resourceful slave, Palaestrio, has separately been captured and is now working in the same house. Palaestrio&#x27;s former master, the young Athenian Pleusicles, is in love with Philocomasium and has come to Ephesus to rescue her; he is lodging next door with a jovial old bachelor called Periplectomenus. Palaestrio has made a hole in the wall between the houses so that Philocomasium can visit Pleusicles. Unfortunately the lovers are spotted by Sceledrus, one of the soldier&#x27;s servants. Palaestrio comes up with a plan to pretend that the girl next door is Philocomasium&#x27;s twin sister, and he and Periplectomenus have fun tricking not very bright Sceledrus while Philocomasium pops out first from one door then the other. Palaestrio now thinks up another plan. He gets a resourceful local courtesan Acroteleutium and her maid Milphidippa to pretend that Acroteleutium is the wealthy owner of the house next door, and that she is madly in love with the soldier. The plan works, and Pyrgopolynices orders Philocomasium to depart to make room for his new bride. But when he goes next door to claim his bride he is thoroughly beaten up by Periplectomenus&#x27;s servants.

*&quot;Mostellaria&quot; (&quot;The Ghost&quot;)
: A young man, Philolaches, is in love with a courtesan Philematium, and in his father&#x27;s absence has borrowed money to buy her. Suddenly, while he and his friend Callidamates are partying, his slave Tranio brings news of the father&#x27;s return. Tranio ushers everyone inside the house and when the father, Theopropides, arrives, deceives him into thinking that the house is haunted by a ghost and cannot be entered. Next Tranio tricks the neighbour, Simo, into letting Theopropides inspect his house, which Theopropides has been told is for sale. While Tranio is off-stage, Theopropides meets two of Callidamates&#x27;s slaves and realises that he has been tricked by Tranio. He is determined to punish him. But Callidamates appears and begs Theopropides to forgive both Philolaches and Tranio.

*&quot;Persa&quot; (&quot;The Persian&quot;)
:The cunning slave Toxilus, who is looking after his master&#x27;s house while he is away, is in love with Lemniselenis, a courtesan owned by the pimp Dordalus, who lives next door. He persuades his friend Sagaristio, another cunning slave, to lend him the money needed to buy her, promising to get the money back from Dordalus by a trick. Meanwhile he persuades another friend, the parasite Saturio, to lend his daughter for the trick. Sagaristio dresses up as a Persian, and sells the girl to Dordalus for a large sum pretending she is an Arabian captive. Immediately afterwards Saturio comes to reclaim his daughter from Dordalus on the grounds that she is an Athenian citizen and drags him off to court. Since no guarantee was given at the time of the sale, the money does not have to be returned, and Toxilus and Sagaristio celebrate their victory.

*&quot;Poenulus&quot; (&quot;The Little Carthaginian&quot;)
:The play is set in Calydon in central Greece. A young man, Agorastocles, is in love with a slave-courtesan Adelphasium owned by a slave-dealer Lycus. He and his slave Milphio spot Adelphasium and her sister in the street and each try to win her over, but she rejects their overtures. Milphio suggests a plan to send Agorastocles&#x27; estate-manager Collybiscus to Lycus&#x27;s house pretending to be a rich customer. Agorastocles brings some witnesses to observe Collybiscus taking a lot of money into the house. They trick Lycus into denying that any slave with money has come to the house, and Agorastocles threatens to take him to court. Lycus flees. Now a Carthaginian traveller comes to the town, speaking in Punic, looking for his two lost daughters, who had been captured in childhood by pirates. Hanno recognises Agorastocles from a monkey-bite scar as the son of his late cousin. He also discovers that Adelphasium and her sister are his daughters. There is a joyful reunion and Agorastocles declares that he will go back to Carthage with Hanno and the girls.

*&quot;Pseudolus&quot;
:The young man Calidorus is distressed because his beloved, the slave-courtesan Phoenicium, has been sold to a Macedonian army officer. He is unable to find the 20 &quot;minae&quot; needed to buy her. The cunning slave Pseudolus promises to help. In the next scene, Phoenicium&#x27;s owner, the slave-dealer Ballio, brings all his slaves and courtesans out into the street and berates them angrily, ordering them to prepare a feast for his birthday. Later, Pseudolus meets Calidorus&#x27;s father Simo and bets him 20 &quot;minae&quot; that Phoenicium will be free by the end of the day. At this point Harpax, a servant of the officer, arrives bringing the balance of the money to be paid for Phoenicium. Pseudolus pretends to be Ballio&#x27;s steward, and Harpax hands him a letter from the officer to Ballio. Now Pseudolus dresses up another cunning slave, Simio, as Harpax and sends him to meet Ballio. The plan works and Phoenicium is released. When the real Harpax returns, Simo and Ballio think that this just is one of Pseudolus&#x27;s tricks and tease the boy lewdly. Too late, they realise that he is genuine. Ballio has to pay Simo the 20 &quot;minae&quot; he has bet that Pseudolus will not get the better of them, and Simo has to pay Pseudolus 20 &quot;minae&quot;, although Pseudolus, who by this time is very drunk, generously offers to return Simo half the money if he will attend a party with him. 

*&quot;Rudens&quot; (&quot;The Rope&quot;)
:Two girls, Palaestra and Ampelisca, escape from the sea after a shipwreck off the coast of north Africa and seek refuge in a nearby temple of Venus. The young slave Trachalio, who is in love with Ampelisca, discovers them there. Now the slave-dealer Labrax, accompanied by his business-partner Charmides, who have also been shipwrecked, arrive. When he learns that the girls are in the temple, Labrax goes in to seize them. The girls are rescued by Trachalio, with the assistance of Daemones, who lives next door to the temple. Trachalio fetches his young master, Plesidippus, who is in love with Palaestra and has already paid Labrax a deposit to buy her. Plesidippus takes Labrax to court to sue him for fraud. In the second half of the play, Daemones&#x27; slave Gripus appears, dragging a basket which he has rescued from the sea. Trachalio finds him and, suspecting that the case contains Labrax&#x27;s money and the tokens which will enable Palaestra to prove her identity, prevents him from stealing it by holding on to the rope by which Gripus is dragging the basket. Daemones is delighted to discover from the tokens that Palaestra is his own long-lost daughter. He forces Labrax to give Gripus the reward he had promised. Daemones uses the money to buy freedom for Gripus and Ampelisca, and invites everyone to dinner. 

*&quot;Stichus&quot;
:Two sisters, Philumena and Pamphila, are complaining that their husbands have been away for three years and their father is pressuring them to remarry. The father Antipho arrives and first asks their advice about his getting a new wife, then broaches the subject of their remarrying; but the sisters firmly refuse. When he has gone, Philumena sends for the parasite Gelasimus; she wants to send him to see if there is news of her husband&#x27;s ship. Gelasimus arrives, but shortly afterwards a slave boy Pinacium also comes bringing news that the ship has arrived. Gelasimus tries to angle for a dinner invitation but is rebuffed. Philumena&#x27;s husband Epignomus soon arrives with his slave Stichus: Stichus asks for a day&#x27;s holiday, which is granted together with some wine to celebrate it. For the third time Gelasimus tries his luck for a dinner invitation, but is rebuffed. Now Pamphila&#x27;s husband Pamphilippus arrives talking to Antipho, who hints that he would like to be given a music girl; the request is granted. Again Gelasimus angles for an invitation and is rebuffed. In the final part of the play Stichus and his friend Sangarinus celebrate Stichus&#x27;s safe return with some food and drink and dancing, at which they are joined by their shared girlfriend Stephanium.

*&quot;Trinummus&quot; (&quot;The Three Coins&quot;)
:An Athenian gentleman, Megaronides, reproaches his friend Callicles for having purchased the house of his neighbour Charmides, who is away in Syria, for a cheap price. Callicles explains that he did this honourably since he wanted to protect the house and the treasure buried in it from the spendthrift habits of Charmides&#x27; son Lesbonicus. Meanwhile Lesbonicus&#x27;s friend Lysiteles tells his father Philto that in order to help Lesbonicus he wishes to marry Charmides&#x27;s daughter without a dowry. Philto goes to Lesbonicus to propose the match, but the plan is thwarted when Lesbonicus refuses to give away his sister without a dowry, as it would dishonour her. Callicles, when he learns this, consults his friend Megaronides, who advises him to use Charmides&#x27; buried treasure as a dowry. When Callicles says he does not want to tell Lesbonicus about the treasure in case he misuses it, Megaronides suggests they hire an imposter for three coins (Latin ), dress him up and make him pretend that he has brought the money from Charmides in Syria. Charmides now arrives back and has an amusing conversation with the imposter. At first Charmides reproaches Callicles for buying the house but when Callicles explains everything, Charmides is delighted. Lysiteles is allowed to marry Charmides&#x27; daughter, and Lesbonicus is betrothed to Callicles&#x27; daughter.

*&quot;Truculentus&quot; (&quot;The Churl&quot;)
:A courtesan, Phronesium, has three lovers: Diniarchus, a young man from the city; Strabax, a young farmer; and Stratophanes, an army officer from the east. Diniarchus, returning from abroad, visits Phronesium but is not allowed to enter. It appears that Phronesium has found a baby and she is going to pretend that the baby is Stratophanes&#x27; child. Next the soldier Stratophanes arrives but the gifts he brings are not enough and he is refused admission. Diniarchus&#x27;s cook Cyamus now arrives bringing gifts sent by his master, and the jealous Stratophanes quarrels with him. The farmer Strabax now arrives with money and is admitted. His slave Truculentus, who is following him to prevent him wasting his father&#x27;s money, himself falls prey to the allurements of Phronesium&#x27;s maid Astaphium. Now Diniarchus comes back, but since Phronesium is busy with Strabax, he is again refused admission, despite all the presents he had sent. At this moment an old gentleman called Callicles arrives, looking for the baby which his daughter had given birth to after being raped. Two slave-girls, threatened with punishment, inform him that the baby was given to Phronesium and that the father is Diniarchus. Diniarchus begs Callicles for forgiveness, and he offers to make amends by marrying the daughter. However, when he asks Phronesium for the baby, she asks to keep it for a while longer to continue her deception of Stratophanes. When Stratophanes comes he finds Strabax emerging from the house, and quarrels jealously with him, but, despite the fact that Stratophanes pays Phronesium a further huge sum of money, Strabax wins the day.

==Manuscript tradition==

The oldest manuscript of Plautus is a palimpsest, known as the Ambrosian palimpsest (A), since it is kept in the Ambrosian Library in Milan. It is thought to date to the 5th century, but it was not discovered until 1815. This manuscript is only partly legible, since the parchment was cleaned and a copy of the books of Kings and Chronicles was written on top. Parts of the text are completely missing (for example, nothing survives of &quot;Amphitruo&quot;, &quot;Asinaria&quot;, &quot;Aulularia&quot;, or of the first 475 lines of &quot;Bacchides&quot;), and other parts are barely legible. The most legible parts of A are found in the plays &quot;Persa&quot;, &quot;Poenulus&quot;, &quot;Pseudolus&quot;, and &quot;Stichus&quot;. Despite its fragmentary state, this palimpsest has proved very valuable in correcting the errors of P.

A second manuscript tradition is represented by manuscripts of the Palatine family, so called because two of its most important manuscripts were once kept in the library of the Elector Palatine in Heidelberg in Germany. The archetype of this family is now lost but it can be reconstructed from various later manuscripts, some of them containing either only the first half or the second half of the plays. The most important manuscript of this group is &quot;B&quot;, of the 10th or early 11th century, now kept in the Vatican library. Manuscripts C and D also belong to this family. The lost original P, from which all these manuscripts were copied, is ascribed by Lindsay to the 8th or 9th century. Because of certain errors which both A and the P family have in common, it is thought that they are not completely independent, but are both copies of a single manuscript dating to perhaps the 4th or 5th century AD.

At some stage the plays in the P family were divided into two halves, one containing &quot;Amphitruo&quot; to &quot;Epidicus&quot; (omitting &quot;Bacchides&quot;), and the other containing &quot;Bacchides&quot; and &quot;Menaechmi&quot; to &quot;Truculentus&quot;. The first eight plays are found in B, and the first three and part of &quot;Captivi&quot; are found in D. The last twelve plays are found in B, C, and D. In addition there was once a fragmentary manuscript called the Codex Turnebi (T), which was used by a French scholar called Turnèbe in the 16th century. Although this manuscript is now lost, some readings from it were preserved by Turnèbe himself, and others were recorded in the margins of a 16th-century edition discovered by Lindsay in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

There are certain indications (for example, small gaps in the text where there appears to have been in a hole or in the parchment) that the original P manuscript was copied from an earlier manuscript with 19, 20 or 21 lines to the page, in other words it was a book very similar to A, which has 19 lines to the page, and probably it was about the same age. However, the order of plays in A is slightly different from that in the P family of manuscripts. The headings at the top of the scenes in A, containing character names, which were written in red ink, have been totally washed away, and those in the P family seem to be based on guesswork and so were also probably missing in an ancestor of the lost P codex. For this reason the names of some of the minor characters are not known.

==Historical context==
The historical context within which Plautus wrote can be seen, to some extent, in his comments on contemporary events and persons. Plautus was a popular comedic playwright while Roman theatre was still in its infancy and still largely undeveloped. At the same time, the Roman Republic was expanding in power and influence.

===Roman society deities===
Plautus was sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods. Any character in his plays could be compared to a god. Whether to honour a character or to mock him, these references were demeaning to the gods. These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god, or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods. Pyrgopolynices from &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; (vs. 1265), in bragging about his long life, says he was born one day later than Jupiter. In &quot;Curculio&quot;, Phaedrome says &quot;I am a god&quot; when he first meets with Planesium. In &quot;Pseudolus,&quot; Jupiter is compared to Ballio the pimp. It is not uncommon, too, for a character to scorn the gods, as seen in &quot;Poenulus&quot; and &quot;Rudens&quot;.

Tolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows social change. It is likely that there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus&#x27; era. Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods, but reflected ideas of his time. The state controlled stage productions, and Plautus&#x27; plays would have been banned, had they been too risqué.

===Second Punic War and Macedonian War===
The Second Punic War occurred from 218 to 201 BC; its central event was Hannibal&#x27;s invasion of Italy. M. Leigh has devoted an extensive chapter about Plautus and Hannibal in his 2004 book, &quot;Comedy and the Rise of Rome&quot;. He says that &quot;the plays themselves contain occasional references to the fact that the state is at arms...&quot;. One good example is a piece of verse from the &quot;Miles Gloriosus,&quot; the composition date of which is not clear but which is often placed in the last decade of the 3rd century BC. A. F. West believes that this is inserted commentary on the Second Punic War. In his article &quot;On a Patriotic Passage in the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; of Plautus&quot;, he states that the war &quot;engrossed the Romans more than all other public interests combined&quot;. The passage seems intended to rile up the audience, beginning with &quot;hostis tibi adesse&quot;, or &quot;the foe is near at hand&quot;.

At the time, the general Scipio Africanus wanted to confront Hannibal, a plan &quot;strongly favored by the plebs&quot;. Plautus apparently pushes for the plan to be approved by the senate, working his audience up with the thought of an enemy in close proximity and a call to outmaneuver him. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Plautus, according to P. B. Harvey, was &quot;willing to insert [into his plays] highly specific allusions comprehensible to the audience&quot;. M. Leigh writes in his chapter on Plautus and Hannibal that &quot;the Plautus who emerges from this investigation is one whose comedies persistently touch the rawest nerves in the audience for whom he writes&quot;.

Later, coming off the heels of the conflict with Hannibal, Rome was preparing to embark on another military mission, this time in Greece. While they would eventually move on Philip V in the Second Macedonian War, there was considerable debate beforehand about the course Rome should take in this conflict. But starting this war would not be an easy task considering those recent struggles with Carthage—many Romans were too tired of conflict to think of embarking on another campaign. As W. M. Owens writes in his article &quot;Plautus&#x27; &quot;Stichus&quot; and the Political Crisis of 200 B.C.&quot;, &quot;There is evidence that antiwar feeling ran deep and persisted even after the war was approved.&quot; Owens contends that Plautus was attempting to match the complex mood of the Roman audience riding the victory of the Second Punic War but facing the beginning of a new conflict. For instance, the characters of the dutiful daughters and their father seem obsessed over the idea of &quot;officium&quot;, the duty one has to do what is right. Their speech is littered with words such as &quot;pietas&quot; and &quot;aequus&quot;, and they struggle to make their father fulfill his proper role. The stock parasite in this play, Gelasimus, has a patron-client relationship with this family and offers to do any job in order to make ends meet; Owens puts forward that Plautus is portraying the economic hardship many Roman citizens were experiencing due to the cost of war.

With the repetition of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly on the side of the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he does seem to push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.

== Influences ==

===Greek New Comedy===
Greek New Comedy greatly differs from those plays of Aristophanes. The most notable difference, according to Dana F. Sutton, is that New Comedy, in comparison to Old Comedy, is &quot;devoid of a serious political, social or intellectual content&quot; and &quot;could be performed in any number of social and political settings without risk of giving offense&quot;. The risk-taking for which Aristophanes is known is noticeably lacking in the New Comedy plays of Menander. Instead, there is much more of a focus on the home and the family unit—something that the Romans, including Plautus, could easily understand and adopt for themselves later in history.

===Father–son relationships===
One main theme of Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander&#x27;s &quot;Dis Exapaton&quot; there is a focus on the betrayal between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it&#x27;s not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn&#x27;t seen in Menander. There is a focus on the proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, was so important to Roman society at the time of Plautus.

This becomes the main difference and, also, similarity between Menander and Plautus. They both address &quot;situations that tend to develop in the bosom of the family&quot;. Both authors, through their plays, reflect a patriarchal society in which the father-son relationship is essential to proper function and development of the household. It is no longer a political statement, as in Old Comedy, but a statement about household relations and proper behavior between a father and his son. But the attitudes on these relationships seem much different—a reflection of how the worlds of Menander and Plautus differed.

===Farce===

There are differences not just in how the father–son relationship is presented, but also in the way in which Menander and Plautus write their poetry. William S. Anderson discusses the believability of Menander versus the believability of Plautus and, in essence, says that Plautus&#x27; plays are much less believable than those plays of Menander because they seem to be such a farce in comparison. He addresses them as a reflection of Menander with some of Plautus&#x27; own contributions. Anderson argues there is unevenness in the poetry of Plautus that results in &quot;incredulity and refusal of sympathy of the audience.&quot;

===Prologues===
The poetry of Menander and Plautus is best juxtaposed in their prologues. Robert B. Lloyd makes the point that &quot;albeit the two prologues introduce plays whose plots are of essentially different types, they are almost identical in form...&quot; He goes on to address the specific style of Plautus that differs so greatly from Menander. He says that the &quot;verbosity of the Plautine prologues has often been commented upon and generally excused by the necessity of the Roman playwright to win his audience.&quot; However, in both Menander and Plautus, word play is essential to their comedy. Plautus might seem more verbose, but where he lacks in physical comedy he makes up for it with words, alliteration and paronomasia (punning). See also &quot;jokes and wordplay&quot; below.

Plautus is well known for his devotion to puns, especially when it comes to the names of his characters. In &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;, for instance, the female concubine&#x27;s name, Philocomasium, translates to &quot;lover of a good party&quot;—which is quite apt when we learn about the tricks and wild ways of this prostitute.

===Character===
Plautus&#x27; characters—many of which seem to crop up in quite a few of his plays—also came from Greek stock, though they too received some Plautine innovations. Indeed, since Plautus was adapting these plays it would be difficult not to have the same kinds of characters—roles such as slaves, concubines, soldiers, and old men. By working with the characters that were already there but injecting his own creativity, as J. C. B. Lowe wrote in his article &quot;Aspects of Plautus&#x27; Originality in the Asinaria&quot;, &quot;Plautus could substantially modify the characterization, and thus the whole emphasis of a play.&quot;

====The Clever Slave====
One of the best examples of this method is the Plautine slave, a form that plays a major role in quite a few of Plautus&#x27; works. The &quot;clever slave&quot; in particular is a very strong character; he not only provides exposition and humor, but also often drives the plot in Plautus&#x27; plays. C. Stace argues that Plautus took the stock slave character from New Comedy in Greece and altered it for his own purposes. In New Comedy, he writes, &quot;the slave is often not much more than a comedic turn, with the added purpose, perhaps, of exposition&quot;. This shows that there was precedent for this slave archetype, and obviously some of its old role continues in Plautus (the expository monologues, for instance). However, because Plautus found humor in slaves tricking their masters or comparing themselves to great heroes, he took the character a step further and created something distinct.

===Understanding of Greek by Plautus&#x27; audience===
Of the approximate 270 proper names in the surviving plays of Plautus, about 250 names are Greek. William M. Seaman proposes that these Greek names would have delivered a comic punch to the audience because of its basic understanding of the Greek language. This previous understanding of Greek language, Seaman suggests, comes from the &quot;experience of Roman soldiers during the first and second Punic wars. Not only did men billeted in Greek areas have opportunity to learn sufficient Greek for the purpose of everyday conversation, but they were also able to see plays in the foreign tongue.&quot; Having an audience with knowledge of the Greek language, whether limited or more expanded, allowed Plautus more freedom to use Greek references and words. Also, by using his many Greek references and showing that his plays were originally Greek, &quot;It is possible that Plautus was in a way a teacher of Greek literature, myth, art and philosophy; so too was he teaching something of the nature of Greek words to people, who, like himself, had recently come into closer contact with that foreign tongue and all its riches.&quot;

At the time of Plautus, Rome was expanding, and having much success in Greece. W.S. Anderson has commented that Plautus &quot;is using and abusing Greek comedy to imply the superiority of Rome, in all its crude vitality, over the Greek world, which was now the political dependent of Rome, whose effete comic plots helped explain why the Greeks proved inadequate in the real world of the third and second centuries, in which the Romans exercised mastery&quot;.

===Disputed originality===
Plautus was known for the use of Greek style in his plays, as part of the tradition of the variation on a theme. This has been a point of contention among modern scholars. One argument states that Plautus writes with originality and creativity—the other, that Plautus is a copycat of Greek New Comedy and that he makes no original contribution to playwriting.

A single reading of the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; leaves the reader with the notion that the names, place, and play are all Greek, but one must look beyond these superficial interpretations. W.S. Anderson would steer any reader away from the idea that Plautus&#x27; plays are somehow not his own or at least only his interpretation. Anderson says that, &quot;Plautus homogenizes all the plays as vehicles for his special exploitation. Against the spirit of the Greek original, he engineers events at the end... or alter[s] the situation to fit his expectations.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s vehement reaction to the co-opting of Greek plays by Plautus seems to suggest that they are in no way like their originals were. It seems more likely that Plautus was just experimenting putting Roman ideas in Greek forms.

===&quot;Contaminatio&quot;===
One idea that is important to recognize is that of &quot;contaminatio&quot;, which refers to the mixing of elements of two or more source plays. Plautus, it seems, is quite open to this method of adaptation, and quite a few of his plots seem stitched together from different stories. One excellent example is his &quot;Bacchides&quot; and its supposed Greek predecessor, Menander&#x27;s &quot;Dis Exapaton.&quot; The original Greek title translates as &quot;The Man Deceiving Twice&quot;, yet the Plautine version has three tricks. V. Castellani commented that:
Plautus&#x27; attack on the genre whose material he pirated was, as already stated, fourfold. He deconstructed many of the Greek plays&#x27; finely constructed plots; he reduced some, exaggerated others of the nicely drawn characters of Menander and of Menander&#x27;s contemporaries and followers into caricatures; he substituted for or superimposed upon the elegant humor of his models his own more vigorous, more simply ridiculous foolery in action, in statement, even in language. 

By exploring ideas about Roman loyalty, Greek deceit, and differences in ethnicity, &quot;Plautus in a sense surpassed his model.&quot; He was not content to rest solely on a loyal adaptation that, while amusing, was not new or engaging for Rome. Plautus took what he found but again made sure to expand, subtract, and modify. He seems to have followed the same path that Horace did, though Horace is much later, in that he is putting Roman ideas in Greek forms. He not only imitated the Greeks, but in fact distorted, cut up, and transformed the plays into something entirely Roman. In essence it is Greek theater colonized by Rome and its playwrights.

==Stagecraft==
In Ancient Greece during the time of New Comedy, from which Plautus drew so much of his inspiration, there were permanent theaters that catered to the audience as well as the actor. The greatest playwrights of the day had quality facilities in which to present their work and, in a general sense, there was always enough public support to keep the theater running and successful. However, this was not the case in Rome during the time of the Republic, when Plautus wrote his plays. While there was public support for theater and people came to enjoy tragedy and comedy alike, no permanent theater existed in Rome until Pompey dedicated one in 55 BC in the Campus Martius.

The lack of a permanent space was a key factor in Roman theater and Plautine stagecraft. In their introduction to the &quot;Miles Gloriosus,&quot; Hammond, Mack and Moskalew say that &quot;the Romans were acquainted with the Greek stone theater, but, because they believed drama to be a demoralizing influence, they had a strong aversion to the erection of permanent theaters&quot;. This worry rings true when considering the subject matter of Plautus&#x27; plays. The unreal becomes reality on stage in his work. T. J. Moore notes that, &quot;all distinction between the play, production, and &#x27;real life&#x27; has been obliterated [Plautus&#x27; play &quot;Curculio&quot;]&quot;. A place where social norms were upended was inherently suspect. The aristocracy was afraid of the power of the theater. It was merely by their good graces and unlimited resources that a temporary stage would have been built during specific festivals.

===The importance of the &quot;ludi&quot;===

Roman drama, specifically Plautine comedy, was acted out on stage during the &quot;ludi&quot; or festival games. In his discussion of the importance of the &quot;ludi Megalenses&quot; in early Roman theater, John Arthur Hanson says that this particular festival &quot;provided more days for dramatic representations than any of the other regular festivals, and it is in connection with these &quot;ludi&quot; that the most definite and secure literary evidence for the site of scenic games has come down to us&quot;. Because the &quot;ludi&quot; were religious in nature, it was appropriate for the Romans to set up this temporary stage close to the temple of the deity being celebrated. S.M. Goldberg notes that &quot;&quot;ludi&quot; were generally held within the precinct of the particular god being honored.&quot;

T. J. Moore notes that &quot;seating in the temporary theaters where Plautus&#x27; plays were first performed was often insufficient for all those who wished to see the play, that the primary criterion for determining who was to stand and who could sit was social status&quot;. This is not to say that the lower classes did not see the plays; but they probably had to stand while watching. Plays were performed in public, for the public, with the most prominent members of the society in the forefront.

The wooden stages on which Plautus&#x27; plays appeared were shallow and long with three openings in respect to the scene-house. The stages were significantly smaller than any Greek structure familiar to modern scholars. Because theater was not a priority during Plautus&#x27; time, the structures were built and dismantled within a day. Even more practically, they were dismantled quickly due to their potential as fire-hazards.

===Geography of the stage===
Often the geography of the stage and more importantly the play matched the geography of the city so that the audience would be well oriented to the locale of the play. Moore says that, &quot;references to Roman locales must have been stunning for they are not merely references to things Roman, but the most blatant possible reminders that the production occurs in the city of Rome&quot;. So, Plautus seems to have choreographed his plays somewhat true-to-life. To do this, he needed his characters to exit and enter to or from whatever area their social standing would befit.

Two scholars, V. J. Rosivach and N. E. Andrews, have made interesting observations about stagecraft in Plautus: V. J. Rosivach writes about identifying the side of the stage with both social status and geography. He says that, for example, &quot;the house of the &quot;medicus&quot; lies offstage to the right. It would be in the forum or thereabouts that one would expect to find a &quot;medicus&quot;.&quot; Moreover, he says that characters that oppose one another always have to exit in opposite directions. In a slightly different vein, N.E. Andrews discusses the spatial semantics of Plautus; she has observed that even the different spaces of the stage are thematically charged. She states:

Plautus&#x27; &quot;Casina&quot; employs these conventional tragic correlations between
male/outside and female/inside, but then inverts them in order to establish an even more complex relationship among genre, gender and dramatic space. In the &quot;Casina&quot;, the struggle for control between men and women... is articulated by characters&#x27; efforts to control stage movement into and out of the house.

Andrews makes note of the fact that power struggle in the &quot;Casina&quot; is evident in the verbal comings and goings. The words of action and the way that they are said are important to stagecraft. The words denoting direction or action such as &quot;abeo&quot; (&quot;I go off&quot;), &quot;transeo&quot; (&quot;I go over&quot;), &quot;fores crepuerunt&quot; (&quot;the doors creak&quot;), or &quot;intus&quot; (&quot;inside&quot;), which signal any character&#x27;s departure or entrance, are standard in the dialogue of Plautus&#x27; plays. These verbs of motion or phrases can be taken as Plautine stage directions since no overt stage directions are apparent. Often, though, in these interchanges of characters, there occurs the need to move on to the next act. Plautus then might use what is known as a &quot;cover monologue&quot;. About this S.M. Goldberg notes that, &quot;it marks the passage of time less by its length than by its direct and immediate address to the audience and by its switch from &quot;senarii&quot; in the dialogue to &quot;iambic septenarii&quot;. The resulting shift of mood distracts and distorts our sense of passing time.&quot;

===Relationship with the audience===
The small stages had a significant effect on the stagecraft of ancient Roman theater. Because of this limited space, there was also limited movement. Greek theater allowed for grand gestures and extensive action to reach the audience members who were in the very back of the theater. However the Romans would have had to depend more on their voices than large physicality. There was not an orchestra available as there was for the Greeks and this is reflected in the notable lack of a chorus in Roman drama. The replacement character that acts as the chorus would in Greek drama is often called the &quot;prologue&quot;.

Goldberg says that &quot;these changes fostered a different relationship between actors and the space in which they performed and also between them and their audiences&quot;. Actors were thrust into much closer audience interaction. Because of this, a certain acting style became required that is more familiar to modern audiences. Because they would have been in such close proximity to the actors, ancient Roman audiences would have wanted attention and direct acknowledgement from the actors.

Because there was no orchestra, there was no space separating the audience from the stage. The audience could stand directly in front of the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from a much different perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and heard every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.

===Stock characters===
Plautus&#x27; range of characters was created through his use of various techniques, but probably the most important is his use of stock characters and situations in his various plays. He incorporates the same stock characters constantly, especially when the character type is amusing to the audience. As Walter Juniper wrote, &quot;Everything, including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization, were sacrificed to humor, and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a &quot;persona&quot; who stayed in character, and where the &quot;persona&quot; by his portrayal contributed to humor.&quot;

For example, in &quot; Miles Gloriosus&quot;, the titular &quot;braggart soldier&quot; Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act, while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices&#x27; achievements, creating more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question. These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies. In disposing of highly complex individuals, Plautus was supplying his audience with what it wanted, since &quot;the audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play,&quot; but instead wanted the broad and accessible humor offered by stock set-ups. The humor Plautus offered, such as &quot;puns, word plays, distortions of meaning, or other forms of verbal humor he usually puts them in the mouths of characters belonging to the lower social ranks, to whose language and position these varieties of humorous technique are most suitable,&quot; matched well with the stable of characters.

====The clever slave====
In his article &quot;The Intriguing Slave in Greek Comedy,&quot; Philip Harsh gives evidence to show that the clever slave is not an invention of Plautus. While previous critics such as A. W. Gomme believed that the slave was &quot;[a] truly comic character, the devisor of ingenious schemes, the controller of events, the commanding officer of his young master and friends, is a creation of Latin comedy,&quot; and that Greek dramatists such as Menander did not use slaves in such a way that Plautus later did, Harsh refutes these beliefs by giving concrete examples of instances where a clever slave appeared in Greek comedy. For instance, in the works of Athenaeus, Alciphron, and Lucian there are deceptions that involve the aid of a slave, and in Menander&#x27;s &quot;Dis Exapaton&quot; there was an elaborate deception executed by a clever slave that Plautus mirrors in his &quot;Bacchides&quot;. Evidence of clever slaves also appears in Menander&#x27;s &quot;Thalis&quot;, &quot;Hypobolimaios&quot;, and from the papyrus fragment of his &quot;Perinthia&quot;. Harsh acknowledges that Gomme&#x27;s statement was probably made before the discovery of many of the papyri that we now have. While it was not necessarily a Roman invention, Plautus did develop his own style of depicting the clever slave. With larger, more active roles, more verbal exaggeration and exuberance, the slave was moved by Plautus further into the front of the action. Because of the inversion of order created by a devious or witty slave, this stock character was perfect for achieving a humorous response and the traits of the character worked well for driving the plot forward.

====The lustful old man====
Another important Plautine stock character, discussed by K.C. Ryder, is the &quot;senex amator&quot;. A senex amator is classified as an old man who contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (&quot;Asinaria&quot;), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (&quot;Bacchides&quot;), Demipho (&quot;Cistellaria&quot;), Lysidamus (&quot;Casina&quot;), Demipho (&quot;Mercator&quot;), and Antipho (&quot;Stichus&quot;). Periplectomenos (&quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;) and Daemones (&quot;Rudens&quot;) are regarded as &quot;senes lepidi&quot; because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.

===Female characters===
In examining the female role designations of Plautus&#x27;s plays, Z.M. Packman found that they are not as stable as their male counterparts: a &quot;senex&quot; will usually remain a &quot;senex&quot; for the duration of the play but designations like &quot;matrona&quot;, &quot;mulier&quot;, or &quot;uxor&quot; at times seem interchangeable. Most free adult women, married or widowed, appear in scene headings as &quot;mulier&quot;, simply translated as &quot;woman&quot;. But in Plautus&#x27; &quot;Stichus&quot; the two young women are referred to as &quot;sorores&quot;, later &quot;mulieres&quot;, and then &quot;matronae&quot;, all of which have different meanings and connotations. Although there are these discrepancies, Packman tries to give a pattern to the female role designations of Plautus. &quot;Mulier&quot; is typically given to a woman of citizen class and of marriageable age or who has already been married. Unmarried citizen-class girls, regardless of sexual experience, were designated &quot;virgo&quot;. &quot;Ancilla&quot; was the term used for female household slaves, with &quot;Anus&quot; reserved for the elderly household slaves. A young woman who is unwed due to social status is usually referred to as &quot;meretrix&quot; or &quot;courtesan&quot;. A &quot;lena&quot;, or adoptive mother, may be a woman who owns these girls.

===Unnamed characters===
Like Packman, George Duckworth uses the scene headings in the manuscripts to support his theory about unnamed Plautine characters. There are approximately 220 characters in the 20 plays of Plautus. Thirty are unnamed in both the scene headings and the text and there are about nine characters who are named in the ancient text but not in any modern one. This means that about 18% of the total number of characters in Plautus are nameless. Most of the very important characters have names while most of the unnamed characters are of less importance. However, there are some abnormalities—the main character in &quot;Casina&quot; is not mentioned by name anywhere in the text. In other instances, Plautus will give a name to a character that only has a few words or lines. One explanation is that some of the names have been lost over the years; and for the most part, major characters do have names.

==Language and style==

===Overview===
Plautus wrote in a colloquial style far from the codified form of Latin that is found in Ovid or Virgil. This colloquial style is the everyday speech that Plautus would have been familiar with, yet that means that most students of Latin are unfamiliar with it. Adding to the unfamiliarity of Plautine language is the inconsistency of the irregularities that occur in the texts. In one of his studies, A.W. Hodgman noted that:

the statements that one meets with, that this or that form is &quot;common,&quot; or &quot;regular,&quot; in Plautus, are frequently misleading, or even incorrect, and are usually unsatisfying... I have gained an increasing respect for the manuscript tradition, a growing belief that the irregularities are, after all, in a certain sense regular. The whole system of inflexion—and, I suspect, of syntax also and of versification—was less fixed and stable in Plautus&#x27; time than it became later.

===Archaic features===
The diction of Plautus, who used the colloquial speech of his own day, is distinctive and non-standard from the point of view of the later, classical period. M. Hammond, A.H. Mack, and W. Moskalew have noted in the introduction to their edition of the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; that Plautus was &quot;free from convention... [and] sought to reproduce the easy tone of daily speech rather than the formal regularity of oratory or poetry. Hence, many of the irregularities which have troubled scribes and scholars perhaps merely reflect the everyday usages of the careless and untrained tongues which Plautus heard about him.&quot; Looking at the overall use of archaic forms in Plautus, one notes that they commonly occur in promises, agreements, threats, prologues, or speeches. Plautus&#x27;s archaic forms are metrically convenient, but may also have had a stylistic effect on his original audience.

These forms are frequent and of too great a number for a complete list here, but some of the most noteworthy features which from the classical perspective will be considered irregular or obsolete are:

*the use of uncontracted forms of some verbs such as &quot;mavolo&quot; (&quot;prefer&quot;) for later &quot;malo&quot;
*the use of the final -&quot;e&quot; of second person singular imperatives in verbs which in classical Latin lack it, e.g. dic(e) &quot;say&quot;.
*the retention of -&quot;u&quot;- in place of the later -&quot;i&quot;- in words such as &quot;maxumus&quot;, &quot;proxumus&quot;, &quot;lacrumare&quot; etc. (see Latin spelling and pronunciation §Sonus medius), and of -&quot;vo&quot;- before &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, where the use after &quot;ca&quot;. 150 BC would favour -&quot;ve&quot;- (as &quot;vostrum&quot; for later &quot;vestrum&quot;)
*the use of the -&quot;ier&quot; ending for the present passive and deponent infinitive (e.g. &quot;exsurgier&quot; for &quot;exsurgī&quot;)
*the forms of &quot;sum&quot; often joined to the preceding word, which is called prodelision (as &quot;bonumst&quot; &quot;it&#x27;s good&quot; for &quot;bonum est&quot; &quot;it is good&quot;)
*the dropping of the final -&quot;s&quot; of 2nd-singular verb forms and the final -&quot;e&quot; of the question-particle when the two are joined (as &quot;viden?&quot; for &quot;videsne?&quot; &quot;you see? you get it?&quot;)
*the retention of short -&quot;ŏ&quot; in noun endings in the second declension for later -&quot;ŭ&quot;
*the retention in many words of &quot;qu-&quot; instead of later &quot;c-&quot; (as in &quot;quom&quot; instead of &quot;cum&quot;)
*the use of the &quot;-āī&quot; genitive singular ending, disyllabic, besides &quot;-ae&quot;
*the retention of final -&quot;d&quot; after long vowel in the pronouns &quot;mēd&quot;, &quot;tēd&quot;, &quot;sēd&quot; (accusative and ablative, used before prevocalic words, forms without &quot;-d&quot; also occur)
*the occasional addition of a final -&quot;pte&quot;, -&quot;te&quot;, or -&quot;met&quot; to pronouns
*the use of -&quot;īs&quot; as an accusative plural and occasionally nominative plural ending.

These are the most common linguistic peculiarities (from the later perspective) in the plays of Plautus, some of them being also found in Terence, and noting them helps in the reading of his works and gives insight into early Roman language and interaction.

===Means of expression===
There are certain ways in which Plautus expressed himself in his plays, and these individual means of expression give a certain flair to his style of writing. The means of expression are not always specific to the writer, i.e., idiosyncratic, yet they are characteristic of the writer. Two examples of these characteristic means of expression are the use of proverbs and the use of Greek language in the plays of Plautus.

Plautus employed the use of proverbs in many of his plays. Proverbs would address a certain genre such as law, religion, medicine, trades, crafts, and seafaring. Plautus&#x27; proverbs and proverbial expressions number into the hundreds. They sometimes appear alone or interwoven within a speech. The most common appearance of proverbs in Plautus appears to be at the end of a soliloquy. Plautus does this for dramatic effect to emphasize a point.

Further interwoven into the plays of Plautus and just as common as the use of proverbs is the use of Greek within the texts of the plays. J. N. Hough suggests that Plautus&#x27;s use of Greek is for artistic purposes and not simply because a Latin phrase will not fit the meter. Greek words are used when describing foods, oils, perfumes, etc. This is similar to the use of French terms in the English language such as &quot;garçon&quot; or &quot;rendezvous&quot;. These words give the language a French flair just as Greek did to the Latin-speaking Romans. Slaves or characters of low standing speak much of the Greek. One possible explanation for this is that many Roman slaves were foreigners of Greek origin.

Plautus would sometimes incorporate passages in other languages as well in places where it would suit his characters. A noteworthy example is the use of two prayers in Punic in &quot;Poenulus&quot;, spoken by the Carthaginian elder Hanno, which are significant to Semitic linguistics because they preserve the Carthaginian pronunciation of the vowels. Unlike Greek, Plautus most probably did not speak Punic himself, nor was the audience likely to understand it. The text of the prayers themselves was probably provided by a Carthaginian informant, and Plautus incorporated it to emphasize the authenticity and foreignness of Hanno&#x27;s character.

===Poetic devices===
Plautus also used more technical means of expression in his plays. One tool that Plautus used for the expression of his &quot;servus callidus&quot; stock character was alliteration. Alliteration is the repetition of sounds in a sentence or clause; those sounds usually come at the beginning of words. In the &quot;Miles Gloriosus,&quot; the &quot;servus callidus&quot; is Palaestrio. As he speaks with the character, Periplectomenus, he uses a significant amount of alliteration in order to assert his cleverness and, therefore, his authority. Plautus uses phrases such as &quot;falsiloquom, falsicum, falsiiurium&quot; (&quot;MG&quot; l. 191). These words express the deep and respectable knowledge that Palaestrio has of the Latin language. Alliteration can also happen at the endings of words as well. For example, Palaestrio says, &quot;linguam, perfidiam, malitiam atque audaciam, confidentiam,
confirmitatem, fraudulentiam&quot; (&quot;MG&quot; ll. 188–9). Also used, as seen above, is the technique of
assonance, which is the repetition of similar-sounding syllables.

===Jokes and wordplay===
Plautus&#x27; comedies abound in puns and word play, which is an important component of his poetry. One well known instance in the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; is Sceledre, &quot;scelus.&quot; Some examples stand in the text in order to accentuate and emphasize whatever is being said, and others to elevate the artistry of the language. But a great number are made for jokes, especially riddle jokes, which feature a &quot;knock knock - who&#x27;s there?&quot; pattern. Plautus is especially fond of making up and changing the meaning of words, as Shakespeare does later.

===Meter===

Further emphasizing and elevating the artistry of the language of the plays of Plautus is the use of meter, which simply put is the rhythm of the play. There seems to be great debate over whether Plautus found favour in strong word accent or verse ictus, stress. Plautus did not follow the meter of the Greek originals that he adapted for the Roman audience. Plautus used a great number of meters, but most frequently he used the iambic senarius and the trochaic septenarius. G. B. Conte has noted that Plautus favours the use of &quot;cantica&quot; instead of Greek meters.

===Vigor and immediacy===
The &quot;servus callidus&quot; functions as the exposition in many of Plautus&#x27; plays. According to C. Stace, &quot;slaves in Plautus account for almost twice as much monologue as any other character ... [and] this is a significant statistic; most of the monologues being, as they are, for purposes of humor, moralizing, or exposition of some kind, we can now begin to see the true nature of the slave&#x27;s importance.&quot; Because humor, vulgarity, and &quot;incongruity&quot; are so much a part of the Plautine comedies, the slave becomes the essential tool to connect the audience to the &quot;joke&quot; through his monologue and direct connection &quot;to&quot; the audience. He is, then, not only a source for exposition and understanding, but connection—specifically, connection to the humor of the play, the playfulness of the play. The &quot;servus callidus&quot; is a character that, as McCarthy says, &quot;draws the complete attention of the audience, and, according to C. Stace, &#x27;despite his lies and abuse, claims our complete sympathy&#x27;&quot;. He does this, according to some scholarship, using monologue, the imperative mood and alliteration—all of which are specific and effective linguistic tools in both writing and speaking.

The specific type of monologue (or soliloquy) in which a Plautine slave engages is the &quot;prologue&quot;. As opposed to simple exposition, according to N. W. Slater, &quot;these ... prologues ... have a far more important function than merely to provide information.&quot; Another way in which the &quot;servus callidus&quot; asserts his power over the play—specifically the other characters in the play—is through his use of the imperative mood. This type of language is used, according to E. Segal, for &quot;the forceful inversion, the reduction of the master to an abject position of supplication ... the master-as-suppliant is thus an extremely important feature of the Plautine comic finale&quot;. The imperative mood is therefore used in the complete role-reversal of the normal relationship between slave and master, and &quot;those who enjoy authority and respect in the ordinary Roman world are unseated, ridiculed, while the lowliest members of society mount to their pedestals ... the humble are in fact exalted&quot;.

===Food===
Meat is the most commonly mentioned foodstuff in the plays of Plautus, and where a specific meat is mentioned, it is most commonly pork, followed by fish.

==Influence==
Intellectual and academic critics have often judged Plautus&#x27;s work as crude; yet his influence on later literature is impressive—especially on two literary giants, Shakespeare and Molière.

Playwrights throughout history have looked to Plautus for character, plot, humor, and other elements of comedy. His influence ranges from similarities in idea to full literal translations woven into plays. The playwright&#x27;s apparent familiarity with the absurdity of humanity and both the comedy and tragedy that stem from this absurdity have inspired succeeding playwrights centuries after his death. The most famous of these successors is Shakespeare—Plautus had a major influence on his early comedies.

===The Middle Ages and early Renaissance===
Plautus was apparently read in the 9th century. His form was too complex to be fully understood, however, and, as indicated by the &quot;Terentius et delusor&quot;, it was unknown at the time if Plautus was writing in prose or verse.

W. B. Sedgwick has provided a record of the &quot;Amphitruo&quot;, perennially one of Plautus&#x27; most famous works. It was the most popular Plautine play in the Middle Ages, and publicly performed at the Renaissance; it was the first Plautine play to be translated into English.

The influence of Plautus&#x27;s plays was felt in the early 16th century. Limited records suggest that the first known university production of Plautus in England was of &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; at Oxford in 1522–3. The &quot;magnum jornale&quot; of Queens College contains a reference to a &quot;comoedia Plauti&quot; in either 1522 or 1523. This fits directly with comments made in the poems of Leland about the date of the production. The next production of &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; that is known from limited records was given by the Westminster School in 1564. Other records also tell us about performances of the &quot;Menaechmi&quot;. From our knowledge, performances were given in the house of Cardinal Wolsey by boys of St. Paul&#x27;s School as early as 1527.

===Shakespeare===
Shakespeare borrowed from Plautus as Plautus borrowed from his Greek models. According to C. L. Barber, &quot;Shakespeare feeds Elizabethan life into the mill of Roman farce, life realized with his distinctively generous creativity, very different from Plautus&#x27; tough, narrow, resinous genius&quot;.

The Plautine and Shakespearean plays that most parallel each other are, respectively, the &quot;Menaechmi&quot; and &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;. According to Marples, Shakespeare drew directly from Plautus &quot;parallels in plot, in incident, and in character&quot;, and was undeniably influenced by the classical playwright&#x27;s work. H. A. Watt stresses the importance of recognizing the fact that the &quot;two plays were written under conditions entirely different and served audiences as remote as the poles&quot;.

The differences between the &quot;Menaechmi&quot; and &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; are clear. In the &quot;Menaechmi&quot;, Plautus uses only one set of twins—twin brothers. Shakespeare, on the other hand, uses two sets of twins, which, according to William Connolly, &quot;dilutes the force of [Shakespeare&#x27;s] situations&quot;. One suggestion is that Shakespeare got this idea from Plautus&#x27; &quot;Amphitruo&quot;, in which both twin masters and twin slaves appear.

It can be noted that the doubling is a stock situation of Elizabethan comedy. On the fusion between Elizabethan and Plautine techniques, T. W. Baldwin writes: &quot;[...] &quot;Errors&quot; does not have the miniature unity of &quot;Menaechmi,&quot; which is characteristic of classic structure for comedy&quot;. Baldwin notes that Shakespeare covers a much greater area in the structure of the play than Plautus does. Shakespeare was writing for an audience whose minds weren&#x27;t restricted to house and home, but looked toward the greater world beyond and the role that they might play in that world.

Another difference between the audiences of Shakespeare and Plautus is that Shakespeare&#x27;s audience was Christian. At the end of &quot;Errors&quot;, the world of the play is returned to normal when a Christian abbess interferes with the feuding. &quot;Menaechmi&quot;, on the other hand, &quot;is almost completely lacking in a supernatural dimension&quot;. A character in Plautus&#x27; play would never blame an inconvenient situation on witchcraft—something that is quite common in Shakespeare.

The relationship between a master and a clever servant is also a common element in Elizabethan comedy. Shakespeare often includes foils for his characters to have one set off the other. In Elizabethan romantic comedy, it is common for the plays to end with multiple marriages and couplings of pairs. This is something that is not seen in Plautine comedy. In the &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot;, Aegeon and Aemilia are separated, Antipholus and Adriana are at odds, and Antipholus and Luciana have not yet met. At the end, all the couples are happily together. By writing his comedies in a combination of Elizabethan and Plautine styles, Shakespeare helps to create his own brand of comedy, one that uses both styles.

Also, Shakespeare uses the same kind of opening monologue so common in Plautus&#x27; plays. He even uses a &quot;villain&quot; in &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; of the same type as the one in &quot;Menaechmi&quot;, switching the character from a doctor to a teacher but keeping the character a shrewd, educated man. Watt also notes that some of these elements appear in many of his works, such as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; or &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and had a deep impact on Shakespeare&#x27;s writing.

Later playwrights also borrowed Plautus&#x27; stock characters. One of the most important echoes of Plautus is the stock character of the parasite. The best example of this is Falstaff, Shakespeare&#x27;s portly and cowardly knight. As J. W. Draper notes, the gluttonous Falstaff shares many characteristics with a parasite such as Artotrogus from &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;. Both characters seem fixated on food and where their next meal is coming from. But they also rely on flattery in order to gain these gifts, and both characters are willing to bury their patrons in empty praise. Draper notes that Falstaff is also something of a boastful military man, but says: &quot;Falstaff is so complex a character that he may well be, in effect, a combination of interlocking types&quot;.

As well as appearing in Shakespearean comedy, the Plautine parasite appears in one of the first English comedies. In &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot;, the character of Matthew Merrygreeke follows in the tradition of both Plautine parasite and Plautine slave, as he both searches and grovels for food and also attempts to achieve his master&#x27;s desires. Indeed, the play itself is often seen as borrowing heavily from or even being based on the Plautine comedy &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;.

H. W. Cole discusses the influence of Plautus and Terence on the Stonyhurst Pageants. The Stonyhurst Pageants are manuscripts of Old Testament plays that were probably composed after 1609 in Lancashire. Cole focuses on Plautus&#x27; influence on the particular Pageant of Naaman. The playwright of this pageant breaks away from the traditional style of religious medieval drama and relies heavily on the works of Plautus. Overall, the playwright cross-references eighteen of the twenty surviving plays of Plautus and five of the six extant plays by Terence. It is clear that the author of the Stonyhurst Pageant of Naaman had a great knowledge of Plautus and was significantly influenced by this.

There is evidence of Plautine imitation in Edwardes&#x27; &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; and Heywood&#x27;s &quot;Silver Age&quot; as well as in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Errors&quot;. Heywood sometimes translated whole passages of Plautus. By being translated as well as imitated, Plautus was a major influence on comedy of the Elizabethan era.
In terms of plot, or perhaps more accurately plot device, Plautus served as a source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights. The many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience the feeling of a genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and Molière. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Etourdi&quot;, two plays by Molière, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in &quot;Miles Gloriosus.&quot; These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus&#x27; plays find their driving force, which is not a simple coincidence.

===Later periods===
20th century musicals based on Plautus include &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (Larry Gelbart and Burt Shevelove, book, Stephen Sondheim, music and lyrics).

&quot;Roman Laughter: The Comedy of Plautus&quot;, a 1968 book by Erich Segal, is a scholarly study of Plautus&#x27; work.

The British TV sitcom &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot; uses situations and stock characters from Plautus&#x27;s plays. In the first series Willie Rushton plays Plautus who pops up on occasion to provide comic comments on what is going on in the episode.

<text>A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers , , and , such that . Such a triple is commonly written , a well-known example is . If is a Pythagorean triple, then so is for any positive integer . A triangle whose side lengths are a Pythagorean triple is a right triangle and called a Pythagorean triangle.

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which , and are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1). For example, is a primitive Pythagorean triple whereas is not. Every Pythagorean triple can be scaled to a unique primitive Pythagorean triple by dividing by their greatest common divisor. Conversely, every Pythagorean triple can be obtained by multiplying the elements of a primitive Pythagorean triple by a positive integer (the same for the three elements).

The name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula formula_1; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples. For instance, the triangle with sides formula_2 and formula_3 is a right triangle, but formula_4 is not a Pythagorean triple because the square root of 2 is not an integer or ratio of integers. Moreover, formula_5 and formula_6 do not have an integer common multiple because formula_6 is irrational.

Pythagorean triples have been known since ancient times. The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800 BC, written in a sexagesimal number system.

When searching for integer solutions, the equation is a Diophantine equation. Thus Pythagorean triples are among the oldest known solutions of a nonlinear Diophantine equation.

==Examples==

There are 16 primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 100:

Other small Pythagorean triples such as (6, 8, 10) are not listed because they are not primitive; for instance (6, 8, 10) is a multiple of (3, 4, 5).

Each of these points (with their multiples) forms a radiating line in the scatter plot to the right. 

Additionally, these are the remaining primitive Pythagorean triples of numbers up to 300:
==Generating a triple==


Euclid&#x27;s formula is a fundamental formula for generating Pythagorean triples given an arbitrary pair of integers and with . The formula states that the integers

:formula_8

form a Pythagorean triple. For example, given

:formula_9 

generate the primitive triple (3,4,5):

:formula_10

The triple generated by Euclid&#x27;s formula is primitive if and only if and are coprime and exactly one of them is even. When both and are odd, then , , and will be even, and the triple will not be primitive; however, dividing , , and by 2 will yield a primitive triple when and are coprime.

&quot;Every&quot; primitive triple arises (after the exchange of and , if is even) from a &quot;unique pair&quot; of coprime numbers , , one of which is even. It follows that there are infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples. This relationship of , and to and from Euclid&#x27;s formula is referenced throughout the rest of this article.

Despite generating all primitive triples, Euclid&#x27;s formula does not produce all triples—for example, (9, 12, 15) cannot be generated using integer and . This can be remedied by inserting an additional parameter to the formula. The following will generate all Pythagorean triples uniquely:

:formula_11

where , , and are positive integers with , and with and coprime and not both odd.

That these formulas generate Pythagorean triples can be verified by expanding using elementary algebra and verifying that the result equals . Since every Pythagorean triple can be divided through by some integer to obtain a primitive triple, every triple can be generated uniquely by using the formula with and to generate its primitive counterpart and then multiplying through by as in the last equation.

Choosing and from certain integer sequences gives interesting results. For example, if and are consecutive Pell numbers, and will differ by 1.

Many formulas for generating triples with particular properties have been developed since the time of Euclid.

===Proof of Euclid&#x27;s formula===

That satisfaction of Euclid&#x27;s formula by &quot;a, b, c&quot; is sufficient for the triangle to be Pythagorean is apparent from the fact that for positive integers and , , the , , and given by the formula are all positive integers, and from the fact that

:formula_12

A proof of the &quot;necessity&quot; that &quot;a, b, c&quot; be expressed by Euclid&#x27;s formula for any primitive Pythagorean triple is as follows. All such primitive triples can be written as where and , , are coprime. Thus , , are pairwise coprime (if a prime number divided two of them, it would be forced also to divide the third one). As and are coprime, at least one of them is odd. If we suppose that is odd, then is even and is odd (if both and were odd, would be even, and would be a multiple of 4, while would be congruent to 2 modulo 4, as an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4).

From formula_1 assume is odd. We obtain formula_14 and hence formula_15. Then formula_16. Since formula_17 is rational, we set it equal to formula_18 in lowest terms. Thus formula_19, being the reciprocal of formula_17. Then solving

:formula_21

for formula_22 and formula_23 gives

:formula_24

As formula_18 is fully reduced, and are coprime, and they cannot both be even. If they were both odd, the numerator of formula_26 would be a multiple of 4 (because an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4), and the denominator 2&quot;mn&quot; would not be a multiple of 4. Since 4 would be the minimum possible even factor in the numerator and 2 would be the maximum possible even factor in the denominator, this would imply to be even despite defining it as odd. Thus one of and is odd and the other is even, and the numerators of the two fractions with denominator 2&quot;mn&quot; are odd. Thus these fractions are fully reduced (an odd prime dividing this denominator divides one of and but not the other; thus it does not divide ). One may thus equate numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators, giving Euclid&#x27;s formula 
:formula_27 with and coprime and of opposite parities.

A longer but more commonplace proof is given in Maor (2007) and Sierpiński (2003). Another proof is given in , as an instance of a general method that applies to every homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two.

===Interpretation of parameters in Euclid&#x27;s formula===

Suppose the sides of a Pythagorean triangle have lengths , , and , and suppose the angle between the leg of length and the hypotenuse of length is denoted as . Then formula_28 and the full-angle trigonometric values are formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31.

===A variant===
The following variant of Euclid&#x27;s formula is sometimes more convenient, as being more symmetric in and (same parity condition on and ).

If and are two odd integers such that , then
:formula_32
are three integers that form a Pythagorean triple, which is primitive if and only if and are coprime. Conversely, every primitive Pythagorean triple arises (after the exchange of and , if is even) from a unique pair of coprime odd integers.

== Not exchanging &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ==
In the presentation above, it is said that all Pythagorean triples are uniquely obtained from Euclid&#x27;s formula &quot;after the exchange of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; is even&quot;. Euclid&#x27;s formula and the variant above can be merged as follows to avoid this exchange, leading to the following result.

Every primitive Pythagorean triple can be uniquely written
:formula_33
where and are positive coprime integers, and formula_34 if and are both odd, and formula_35 otherwise. Equivalently, formula_34 if is odd, and formula_35 if is even.

==Elementary properties of primitive Pythagorean triples==

===General properties===

The properties of a primitive Pythagorean triple with (without specifying which of or is even and which is odd) include:
* formula_38 is always a perfect square. As it is only a necessary condition but not a sufficient one, it can be used in checking if a given triple of numbers is &quot;not&quot; a Pythagorean triple. For example, the triples and each pass the test that is a perfect square, but neither is a Pythagorean triple.
*When a triple of numbers , and forms a primitive Pythagorean triple, then and one-half of are both perfect squares; however this is not a sufficient condition, as the numbers pass the perfect squares test but are not a Pythagorean triple since .
*At most one of , , is a square.
*The area of a Pythagorean triangle cannot be the square or twice the square of an integer.
*Exactly one of , is divisible by 2 (is even), and the hypotenuse is always odd.
*Exactly one of , is divisible by 3, but never .
*Exactly one of , is divisible by 4, but never (because is never even).
*Exactly one of , , is divisible by 5.
*The largest number that always divides &quot;abc&quot; is 60.
*Any odd number of the form , where is an integer and , can be the odd leg of a primitive Pythagorean triple. See almost-isosceles primitive Pythagorean triples section below. However, only even numbers divisible by 4 can be the even leg of a primitive Pythagorean triple. This is because Euclid&#x27;s formula for the even leg given above is and one of or must be even.
*The hypotenuse (which is always odd) is the sum of two squares. This requires all of its prime factors to be primes of the form. Therefore, c is of the form . A sequence of possible hypotenuse numbers for a primitive Pythagorean triple can be found at .
*The area is a congruent number divisible by 6.
*In every Pythagorean triangle, the radius of the incircle and the radii of the three excircles are positive integers. Specifically, for a primitive triple the radius of the incircle is , and the radii of the excircles opposite the sides , &quot;2mn&quot;, and the hypotenuse are respectively , , and .
*As for any right triangle, the converse of Thales&#x27; theorem says that the diameter of the circumcircle equals the hypotenuse; hence for primitive triples the circumdiameter is , and the circumradius is half of this and thus is rational but non-integer (since and have opposite parity).
*When the area of a Pythagorean triangle is multiplied by the curvatures of its incircle and 3 excircles, the result is four positive integers , respectively. Integers satisfy Descartes&#x27;s Circle Equation. Equivalently, the radius of the outer Soddy circle of any right triangle is equal to its semiperimeter. The outer Soddy center is located at , where is a rectangle, the right triangle and its hypotenuse.
*Only two sides of a primitive Pythagorean triple can be simultaneously prime because by Euclid&#x27;s formula for generating a primitive Pythagorean triple, one of the legs must be composite and even. However, only one side can be an integer of perfect power formula_39 because if two sides were integers of perfect powers with equal exponent formula_40 it would contradict the fact that there are no integer solutions to the Diophantine equation formula_41, with formula_42, formula_43 and formula_44 being pairwise coprime.
*There are no Pythagorean triangles in which the hypotenuse and one leg are the legs of another Pythagorean triangle; this is one of the equivalent forms of Fermat&#x27;s right triangle theorem.
*Each primitive Pythagorean triangle has a ratio of area, , to squared semiperimeter, , that is unique to itself and is given by
:: formula_45
*No primitive Pythagorean triangle has an integer altitude from the hypotenuse; that is, every primitive Pythagorean triangle is indecomposable.
*The set of all primitive Pythagorean triples forms a rooted ternary tree in a natural way; see Tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.
*Neither of the acute angles of a Pythagorean triangle can be a rational number of degrees. (This follows from Niven&#x27;s theorem.)

===Special cases===

In addition, special Pythagorean triples with certain additional properties can be guaranteed to exist:
*Every integer greater than 2 that is not congruent to 2 mod 4 (in other words, every integer greater than 2 which is &quot;not&quot; of the form ) is part of a primitive Pythagorean triple. (If the integer has the form , one may take and in Euclid&#x27;s formula; if the integer is , one may take and .)
*Every integer greater than 2 is part of a primitive or non-primitive Pythagorean triple. For example, the integers 6, 10, 14, and 18 are not part of primitive triples, but are part of the non-primitive triples , and .
*There exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the longest leg differ by exactly one. Such triples are necessarily primitive and have the form . This results from Euclid&#x27;s formula by remarking that the condition implies that the triple is primitive and must verify . This implies , and thus . The above form of the triples results thus of substituting for in Euclid&#x27;s formula. 
*There exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the longest leg differ by exactly two. They are all primitive, and are obtained by putting in Euclid&#x27;s formula. More generally, for every integer , there exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuse and the odd leg differ by . They are obtained by putting in Euclid&#x27;s formula.
*There exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the two legs differ by exactly one. For example, 20 + 21 = 29; these are generated by Euclid&#x27;s formula when formula_46 is a convergent to formula_6.
*For each positive integer , there exist Pythagorean triples with different hypotenuses and the same area.
*For each positive integer , there exist at least different primitive Pythagorean triples with the same leg , where is some positive integer (the length of the even leg is 2&quot;mn&quot;, and it suffices to choose with many factorizations, for example , where is a product of different odd primes; this produces at least different primitive triples).
*For each positive integer , there exist at least different Pythagorean triples with the same hypotenuse.
*If is a prime power, there exists a primitive Pythagorean triple if and only if the prime has the form ; this triple is unique up to the exchange of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. 
*More generally, a positive integer is the hypotenuse of a primitive Pythagorean triple if and only if each prime factor of is congruent to modulo ; that is, each prime factor has the form . In this case, the number of primitive Pythagorean triples with is , where is the number of distinct prime factors of . 
*There exist infinitely many Pythagorean triples with square numbers for both the hypotenuse and the sum of the legs . According to Fermat, the smallest such triple has sides ; ; and . Here and . This is generated by Euclid&#x27;s formula with parameter values and .
*There exist non-primitive Pythagorean triangles with integer altitude from the hypotenuse. Such Pythagorean triangles are known as decomposable since they can be split along this altitude into two separate and smaller Pythagorean triangles.

==Geometry of Euclid&#x27;s formula==

===Rational points on a unit circle===
Euclid&#x27;s formula for a Pythagorean triple

:formula_48

can be understood in terms of the geometry of rational points on the unit circle .

In fact, a point in the Cartesian plane with coordinates belongs to the unit circle if . The point is &quot;rational&quot; if and are rational numbers, that is, if there are coprime integers such that 
:formula_49

By multiplying both members by , one can see that the rational points on the circle are in one-to-one correspondence with the primitive Pythagorean triples.

The unit circle may also be defined by a parametric equation
:formula_50
Euclid&#x27;s formula for Pythagorean triples and the inverse relationship mean that, except for , a point on the circle is rational if and only if the corresponding value of is a rational number. Note that is also the tangent of half of the angle that is opposite the triangle side of length .

===Stereographic approach===

There is a correspondence between points on the unit circle with rational coordinates and primitive Pythagorean triples. At this point, Euclid&#x27;s formulae can be derived either by methods of trigonometry or equivalently by using the stereographic projection.

For the stereographic approach, suppose that ′ is a point on the -axis with rational coordinates

:formula_51

Then, it can be shown by basic algebra that the point has coordinates

:formula_52

This establishes that each rational point of the -axis goes over to a rational point of the unit circle. The converse, that every rational point of the unit circle comes from such a point of the -axis, follows by applying the inverse stereographic projection. Suppose that is a point of the unit circle with and rational numbers. Then the point ′ obtained by stereographic projection onto the -axis has coordinates

:formula_53

which is rational.

In terms of algebraic geometry, the algebraic variety of rational points on the unit circle is birational to the affine line over the rational numbers. The unit circle is thus called a rational curve, and it is this fact which enables an explicit parameterization of the (rational number) points on it by means of rational functions.

==Pythagorean triangles in a 2D lattice==
A 2D lattice is a regular array of isolated points where if any one point is chosen as the Cartesian origin (0, 0), then all the other points are at where and range over all positive and negative integers. Any Pythagorean triangle with triple can be drawn within a 2D lattice with vertices at coordinates , and . The count of lattice points lying strictly within the bounds of the triangle is given by   formula_54 for primitive Pythagorean triples this interior lattice count is  formula_55 The area (by Pick&#x27;s theorem equal to one less than the interior lattice count plus half the boundary lattice count) equals  formula_56 .

The first occurrence of two primitive Pythagorean triples sharing the same area occurs with triangles with sides and common area 210 . The first occurrence of two primitive Pythagorean triples sharing the same interior lattice count occurs with and interior lattice count 2287674594 . Three primitive Pythagorean triples have been found sharing the same area: , , with area 13123110. As yet, no set of three primitive Pythagorean triples have been found sharing the same interior lattice count.

==Enumeration of primitive Pythagorean triples==
By Euclid&#x27;s formula all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from integers formula_57 and formula_58 with formula_59, formula_60 odd and formula_61. Hence there is a 1 to 1 mapping of rationals (in lowest terms) to primitive Pythagorean triples where formula_62 is in the interval formula_63 and formula_60 odd.

The reverse mapping from a primitive triple formula_65 where formula_66 to a rational formula_62 is achieved by studying the two sums formula_68 and formula_69. One of these sums will be a square that can be equated to formula_70 and the other will be twice a square that can be equated to formula_71. It is then possible to determine the rational formula_62.

In order to enumerate primitive Pythagorean triples the rational can be expressed as an ordered pair formula_73 and mapped to an integer using a pairing function such as Cantor&#x27;s pairing function. An example can be seen at . It begins
::formula_74 and gives rationals
::formula_75 these, in turn, generate primitive triples
::formula_76

==Spinors and the modular group==
Pythagorean triples can likewise be encoded into a square matrix of the form
:formula_77
A matrix of this form is symmetric. Furthermore, the determinant of is
:formula_78
which is zero precisely when is a Pythagorean triple. If corresponds to a Pythagorean triple, then as a matrix it must have rank 1.

Since is symmetric, it follows from a result in linear algebra that there is a column vector such that the outer product

holds, where the denotes the matrix transpose. Since ξ and -ξ produce the same Pythagorean triple, the vector ξ can be considered a spinor (for the Lorentz group SO(1, 2)). In abstract terms, the Euclid formula means that each primitive Pythagorean triple can be written as the outer product with itself of a spinor with integer entries, as in ().

The modular group Γ is the set of 2×2 matrices with integer entries

:formula_79

with determinant equal to one: . This set forms a group, since the inverse of a matrix in Γ is again in Γ, as is the product of two matrices in Γ. The modular group acts on the collection of all integer spinors. Furthermore, the group is transitive on the collection of integer spinors with relatively prime entries. For if has relatively prime entries, then

:formula_80

where and are selected (by the Euclidean algorithm) so that .

By acting on the spinor ξ in (), the action of Γ goes over to an action on Pythagorean triples, provided one allows for triples with possibly negative components. Thus if is a matrix in , then

gives rise to an action on the matrix in (). This does not give a well-defined action on primitive triples, since it may take a primitive triple to an imprimitive one. It is convenient at this point (per ) to call a triple standard if and either are relatively prime or are relatively prime with odd. If the spinor has relatively prime entries, then the associated triple determined by () is a standard triple. It follows that the action of the modular group is transitive on the set of standard triples.

Alternatively, restrict attention to those values of and for which is odd and is even. Let the subgroup Γ(2) of Γ be the kernel of the group homomorphism

:formula_81

where is the special linear group over the finite field of integers modulo 2. Then Γ(2) is the group of unimodular transformations which preserve the parity of each entry. Thus if the first entry of ξ is odd and the second entry is even, then the same is true of for all . In fact, under the action (), the group Γ(2) acts transitively on the collection of primitive Pythagorean triples .

The group Γ(2) is the free group whose generators are the matrices
:formula_82
Consequently, every primitive Pythagorean triple can be obtained in a unique way as a product of copies of the matrices and .

==Parent/child relationships==
By a result of , all primitive Pythagorean triples can be generated from the (3, 4, 5) triangle by using the three linear transformations T1, T2, T3 below, where , , are sides of a triple:
In other words, every primitive triple will be a &quot;parent&quot; to three additional primitive triples.
Starting from the initial node with , , and , the operation produces the new triple 
:(3 − (2×4) + (2×5), (2×3) − 4 + (2×5), (2×3) − (2×4) + (3×5)) = (5, 12, 13), 
and similarly and produce the triples (21, 20, 29) and (15, 8, 17).

The linear transformations T1, T2, and T3 have a geometric interpretation in the language of quadratic forms. They are closely related to (but are not equal to) reflections generating the orthogonal group of over the integers.

==Relation to Gaussian integers==

Alternatively, Euclid&#x27;s formulae can be analyzed and proved using the Gaussian integers. Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form , where and are ordinary integers and is the square root of negative one. The units of Gaussian integers are ±1 and ±i. The ordinary integers are called the rational integers and denoted as &quot;. The Gaussian integers are denoted as . The right-hand side of the Pythagorean theorem may be factored in Gaussian integers:

:formula_83

A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which and are coprime, i.e., they share no prime factors in the integers. For such a triple, either or is even, and the other is odd; from this, it follows that is also odd.

The two factors and of a primitive Pythagorean triple each equal the square of a Gaussian integer. This can be proved using the property that every Gaussian integer can be factored uniquely into Gaussian primes up to units. (This unique factorization follows from the fact that, roughly speaking, a version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined on them.) The proof has three steps. First, if and share no prime factors in the integers, then they also share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. (Assume and with Gaussian integers , and and not a unit. Then and lie on the same line through the origin. All Gaussian integers on such a line are integer multiples of some Gaussian integer . But then the integer &quot;gh&quot; ≠ ±1 divides both and .) Second, it follows that and likewise share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. For if they did, then their common divisor would also divide and . Since and are coprime, that implies that divides . From the formula , that in turn would imply that is even, contrary to the hypothesis of a primitive Pythagorean triple. Third, since is a square, every Gaussian prime in its factorization is doubled, i.e., appears an even number of times. Since and share no prime factors, this doubling is also true for them. Hence, and are squares.

Thus, the first factor can be written

:formula_84

The real and imaginary parts of this equation give the two formulas:

:formula_85

For any primitive Pythagorean triple, there must be integers and such that these two equations are satisfied. Hence, every Pythagorean triple can be generated from some choice of these integers.

===As perfect square Gaussian integers===
If we consider the square of a Gaussian integer we get the following direct interpretation of Euclid&#x27;s formula as representing the perfect square of a Gaussian integer.

:formula_86

Using the facts that the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain and that for a Gaussian integer p formula_87 is always a square it is possible to show that a Pythagorean triple corresponds to the square of a prime Gaussian integer if the hypotenuse is prime.

If the Gaussian integer is not prime then it is the product of two Gaussian integers p and q with formula_87 and formula_89 integers. Since magnitudes multiply in the Gaussian integers, the product must be formula_90, which when squared to find a Pythagorean triple must be composite. The contrapositive completes the proof.

==Distribution of triples==
There are a number of results on the distribution of Pythagorean triples. In the scatter plot, a number of obvious patterns are already apparent. Whenever the legs of a primitive triple appear in the plot, all integer multiples of must also appear in the plot, and this property produces the appearance of lines radiating from the origin in the diagram.

Within the scatter, there are sets of parabolic patterns with a high density of points and all their foci at the origin, opening up in all four directions. Different parabolas intersect at the axes and appear to reflect off the axis with an incidence angle of 45 degrees, with a third parabola entering in a perpendicular fashion. Within this quadrant, each arc centered on the origin shows that section of the parabola that lies between its tip and its intersection with its semi-latus rectum.

These patterns can be explained as follows. If formula_91 is an integer, then (, formula_92, formula_93) is a Pythagorean triple. (In fact every Pythagorean triple can be written in this way with integer , possibly after exchanging and , since formula_94 and and cannot both be odd.) The Pythagorean triples thus lie on curves given by formula_95, that is, parabolas reflected at the -axis, and the corresponding curves with and interchanged. If is varied for a given (i.e. on a given parabola), integer values of occur relatively frequently if is a square or a small multiple of a square. If several such values happen to lie close together, the corresponding parabolas approximately coincide, and the triples cluster in a narrow parabolic strip. For instance, , ,
, and ; the corresponding parabolic strip around is clearly visible in the scatter plot.

The angular properties described above follow immediately from the functional form of the parabolas. The parabolas are reflected at the -axis at , and the derivative of with respect to at this point is –1; hence the incidence angle is 45°. Since the clusters, like all triples, are repeated at integer multiples, the value also corresponds to a cluster. The corresponding parabola intersects the -axis at right angles at , and hence its reflection upon interchange of and intersects the -axis at right angles at , precisely where the parabola for is reflected at the -axis. (The same is of course true for and interchanged.)

Albert Fässler and others provide insights into the significance of these parabolas in the context of conformal mappings.

==Special cases and related equations==

===The Platonic sequence===
The case of the more general construction of Pythagorean triples has been known for a long time. Proclus, in his commentary to the 47th Proposition of the first book of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, describes it as follows:

Certain methods for the discovery of triangles of this kind are handed down, one which they refer to Plato, and another to Pythagoras. (The latter) starts from odd numbers. For it makes the odd number the smaller of the sides about the right angle; then it takes the square of it, subtracts unity and makes half the difference the greater of the sides about the right angle; lastly it adds unity to this and so forms the remaining side, the hypotenuse.
...For the method of Plato argues from even numbers. It takes the given even number and makes it one of the sides about the right angle; then, bisecting this number and squaring the half, it adds unity to the square to form the hypotenuse, and subtracts unity from the square to form the other side about the right angle. ... Thus it has formed the same triangle that which was obtained by the other method.

In equation form, this becomes:

 is odd (Pythagoras, c. 540 BC):

:formula_96

 is even (Plato, c. 380 BC):

:formula_97

It can be shown that all Pythagorean triples can be obtained, with appropriate rescaling, from the basic Platonic sequence (, and ) by allowing to take non-integer rational values. If is replaced with the fraction in the sequence, the result is equal to the &#x27;standard&#x27; triple generator (2&quot;mn&quot;, ,) after rescaling. It follows that every triple has a corresponding rational value which can be used to generate a similar triangle (one with the same three angles and with sides in the same proportions as the original). For example, the Platonic equivalent of is generated by as . The Platonic sequence itself can be derived by following the steps for &#x27;splitting the square&#x27; described in Diophantus II.VIII.

===The Jacobi–Madden equation===

The equation,

:formula_98

is equivalent to the special Pythagorean triple,

:formula_99

There is an infinite number of solutions to this equation as solving for the variables involves an elliptic curve. Small ones are,

:formula_100

:formula_101

===Equal sums of two squares===

One way to generate solutions to formula_102 is to parametrize &quot;a, b, c, d&quot; in terms of integers &quot;m, n, p, q&quot; as follows:

===Equal sums of two fourth powers===

Given two sets of Pythagorean triples,

:formula_104

:formula_105

the problem of finding equal products of a non-hypotenuse side and the hypotenuse,

:formula_106

is easily seen to be equivalent to the equation,

:formula_107

and was first solved by Euler as formula_108. Since he showed this is a rational point in an elliptic curve, then there is an infinite number of solutions. In fact, he also found a 7th degree polynomial parameterization.

===Descartes&#x27; Circle Theorem===

For the case of Descartes&#x27; circle theorem where all variables are squares,

:formula_109

Euler showed this is equivalent to three simultaneous Pythagorean triples,

:formula_110

:formula_111

:formula_112

There is also an infinite number of solutions, and for the special case when formula_113, then the equation simplifies to,

:formula_114

with small solutions as formula_115 and can be solved as binary quadratic forms.

===Almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples===

No Pythagorean triples are isosceles, because the ratio of the hypotenuse to either other side is , but cannot be expressed as the ratio of 2 integers.

There are, however, right-angled triangles with integral sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse sides differ by one, such as,

:formula_116

:formula_117

and an infinite number of others. They can be completely parameterized as,

:formula_118

where {&quot;x, y&quot;} are the solutions to the Pell equation formula_119.

If , , are the sides of this type of primitive Pythagorean triple then the solution to the Pell equation is given by the recursive formula

:formula_120 with formula_121 and formula_122
:formula_123 with formula_124 and formula_125
:formula_126 with formula_127 and formula_128.

This sequence of primitive Pythagorean triples forms the central stem (trunk) of the rooted ternary tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.

When it is the longer non-hypotenuse side and hypotenuse that differ by one, such as in

:formula_129

:formula_130

then the complete solution for the primitive Pythagorean triple , , is

:formula_131

and

:formula_132

where integer formula_133 is the generating parameter.

It shows that all odd numbers (greater than 1) appear in this type of almost-isosceles primitive Pythagorean triple. This sequence of primitive Pythagorean triples forms the right hand side outer stem of the rooted ternary tree of primitive Pythagorean triples.

Another property of this type of almost-isosceles primitive Pythagorean triple is that the sides are related such that 
:formula_134
for some integer formula_135. Or in other words formula_136 is divisible by formula_137 such as in
:formula_138.

===Fibonacci numbers in Pythagorean triples===

Starting with 5, every second Fibonacci number is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer sides, or in other words, the largest number in a Pythagorean triple, obtained from the formula
formula_139
The sequence of Pythagorean triangles obtained from this formula has sides of lengths
:(3,4,5), (5,12,13), (16,30,34), (39,80,89), ...
The middle side of each of these triangles is the sum of the three sides of the preceding triangle.

==Generalizations==
There are several ways to generalize the concept of Pythagorean triples.

===Pythagorean -tuple===
The expression
:formula_140
is a Pythagorean -tuple for any tuple of positive integers with . The Pythagorean -tuple can be made primitive by dividing out by the largest common divisor of its values.

Furthermore, any primitive Pythagorean -tuple can be found by this approach. Use to get a Pythagorean -tuple by the above formula and divide out by the largest common integer divisor, which is . Dividing out by the largest common divisor of these values gives the same primitive Pythagorean -tuple; and there is a one-to-one correspondence between tuples of setwise coprime positive integers satisfying and primitive Pythagorean -tuples.

Examples of the relationship between setwise coprime values formula_141 and primitive Pythagorean -tuples include:

:formula_142

====Consecutive squares====
Since the sum of consecutive squares beginning with is given by the formula,

:formula_143

one may find values so that is a square, such as one by Hirschhorn where the number of terms is itself a square,

:formula_144

and is any integer not divisible by 2 or 3. For the smallest case , hence , this yields the well-known cannonball-stacking problem of Lucas,

:formula_145

a fact which is connected to the Leech lattice.

In addition, if in a Pythagorean -tuple () all addends are consecutive except one, one can use the equation,

:formula_146

Since the second power of cancels out, this is only linear and easily solved for as formula_147 though , should be chosen so that is an integer, with a small example being , yielding,

:formula_148

Thus, one way of generating Pythagorean -tuples is by using, for various ,

:formula_149

where &quot;q = n&quot;–2 and where

:formula_150

===Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem===
A generalization of the concept of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers , , and , such that , for some strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that came to be known as Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proved or disproved. The first proof was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.

=== or th powers summing to an th power===

Another generalization is searching for sequences of positive integers for which the th power of the last is the sum of the th powers of the previous terms. The smallest sequences for known values of are:

* = 3: {3, 4, 5; 6}.
* = 4: {30, 120, 272, 315; 353}
* = 5: {19, 43, 46, 47, 67; 72}
* = 7: {127, 258, 266, 413, 430, 439, 525; 568}
* = 8: {90, 223, 478, 524, 748, 1088, 1190, 1324; 1409}

For the case, in which formula_151 called the Fermat cubic, a general formula exists giving all solutions.

A slightly different generalization allows the sum of th powers to equal the sum of th powers. For example:
* (): 1 + 12 = 9 + 10, made famous by Hardy&#x27;s recollection of a conversation with Ramanujan about the number 1729 being the smallest number that can be expressed as a sum of two cubes in two distinct ways.

There can also exist positive integers whose th powers sum to an th power (though, by Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, not for ; these are counterexamples to Euler&#x27;s sum of powers conjecture. The smallest known counterexamples are

* : (95800, 217519, 414560; 422481)
* : (27, 84, 110, 133; 144)

===Heronian triangle triples===
A Heronian triangle is commonly defined as one with integer sides whose area is also an integer. The lengths of the sides of such a triangle form a Heronian triple for .
Every Pythagorean triple is a Heronian triple, because at least one of the legs , must be even in a Pythagorean triple, so the area &quot;ab&quot;/2 is an integer. Not every Heronian triple is a Pythagorean triple, however, as the example with area 24 shows.

If is a Heronian triple, so is where is any positive integer; its area will be the integer that is times the integer area of the triangle.
The Heronian triple is primitive provided &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; are setwise coprime. (With primitive Pythagorean triples the stronger statement that they are &quot;pairwise&quot; coprime also applies, but with primitive Heronian triangles the stronger statement does not always hold true, such as with .) Here are a few of the simplest primitive Heronian triples that are not Pythagorean triples:

: (4, 13, 15) with area 24
: (3, 25, 26) with area 36
: (7, 15, 20) with area 42
: (6, 25, 29) with area 60
: (11, 13, 20) with area 66
: (13, 14, 15) with area 84
: (13, 20, 21) with area 126

By Heron&#x27;s formula, the extra condition for a triple of positive integers with to be Heronian is that
or equivalently

be a nonzero perfect square divisible by 16.

===Application to cryptography===
Primitive Pythagorean triples have been used in cryptography as random sequences and for the generation of keys.

<text>Pattern welding is a practice in sword and knife making by forming a blade of several metal pieces of differing composition that are forge-welded together and twisted and manipulated to form a pattern. Often called Damascus steel, blades forged in this manner often display bands of slightly different patterning along their entire length. These bands can be highlighted for cosmetic purposes by proper polishing or acid etching. Pattern welding was an outgrowth of laminated or piled steel, a similar technique used to combine steels of different carbon contents, providing a desired mix of hardness and toughness. Although modern steelmaking processes negate the need to blend different steels, pattern welded steel is still used by custom knifemakers for the cosmetic effects it produces.

==History==

Pattern welding developed out of the necessarily complex process of making blades that were both hard and tough from the erratic and unsuitable output from early iron smelting in bloomeries. The bloomery does not generate temperatures high enough to melt iron and steel, but instead reduces the iron oxide ore into particles of pure iron, which then weld into a mass of sponge iron, consisting of lumps of impurities in a matrix of relatively pure iron, which is too soft to make a good blade. Carburizing thin iron bars or plates forms a layer of harder, high carbon steel on the surface, and early bladesmiths would forge these bars or plates together to form relatively homogeneous bars of steel. This laminating process, in which different types of steel together produce patterns that can be seen in the surface of the finished blade, forms the basis for pattern welding.

===Pattern welding in Europe===
Pattern welding dates to the first millennium BC, with Celtic, and later Germanic swords exhibiting the technique, with the Romans describing the blade patternation.
By the 2nd and 3rd century AD, the Celts commonly used pattern welding for decoration in addition to structural reasons. The technique involves folding and forging alternating layers of steel into rods, then twisting the steel to form complex patterns when forged into a blade. By the 6th and 7th centuries, pattern welding had reached a level where thin layers of patterned steel were being overlaid onto a soft iron core, making the swords far better as the iron gave them a flexible and springy core that would take any shock from sword blows to stop the blade bending or snapping. By the end of the Viking Age, pattern welding fell out of use in Europe.

In medieval swords, pattern welding was more prevalent than commonly thought. However, the presence of rust makes detection difficult without repolishing.

During the Middle Ages, Wootz steel was produced in India and exported globally, including to Europe. The similarities in the markings led many to believe it was the same process being used, and pattern welding was revived by European smiths who were attempting to duplicate the Damascus steel. While the methods used by Damascus smiths to produce their blades was lost over the centuries, recent efforts by metallurgists and bladesmiths (such as Verhoeven and Pendray) to reproduce steel with identical characteristics have yielded a process that does not involve pattern welding.
The ancient swordmakers exploited the aesthetic qualities of pattern welded steel. The Vikings, in particular, were fond of twisting bars of steel around each other, welding the bars together by hammering and then repeating the process with the resulting bars, to create complex patterns in the final steel bar. Two bars twisted in opposite directions created the common chevron pattern. Often, the center of the blade was a core of soft steel, and the edges were solid high carbon steel, similar to the laminates of the Japanese.

===Modern decorative use===
Pattern welding is still popular with contemporary bladesmiths both for visual effect and for recreating historic patterns and swords. Modern steels and methods allow for patterns with much higher number of visible layers compared to historical artifacts. Large numbers of layers can either be produced by folding similar to historical processes or by forge welding a small number of layers together, then cutting the billet in pieces to stack and forge-weld it again. This can be repeated until the desired number of layers have been achieved. A blade ground from such a blank can show a pattern similar to wood grain with small random variations in pattern. Some manufactured objects can be re-purposed into pattern welded blanks. &quot;Cable Damascus&quot;, forged from high carbon multi-strand cable, is a popular item for bladesmiths to produce, producing a finely grained, twisted pattern, while chainsaw chains produce a pattern of randomly positioned blobs of color.

Some modern bladesmiths have taken pattern welding to new heights, with elaborate applications of traditional pattern welding techniques, as well as with new technology. A layered billet of steel rods with the blade blank cut perpendicular to the layers can also produce some spectacular patterns, including mosaics or even writing. Powder metallurgy allows alloys that would not normally be compatible to be combined into solid bars. Different treatments of the steel after it is ground and polished, such as bluing, etching, or various other chemical surface treatments that react differently to the different metals used can create bright, high-contrast finishes on the steel. Some master smiths go as far as to use techniques such as electrical discharge machining to cut interlocking patterns out of different steels, fit them together, then weld the resulting assembly into a solid block of steel.

Blacksmiths will sometimes apply Wite-Out, Liquid Paper, or other types of correction fluid to metal that they want to not weld together, as the titanium dioxide in the correction fluid forms a barrier between the metal it is applied-to and any other pieces of metal. For example, when creating pattern-welded steel by filling a steel canister with pieces of metal and powdered steel and forging it together into a single mass (&quot;canister damascus steel,&quot;) smiths frequently coat the inside of the canister with correction fluid and let it dry before adding their materials. Thus, when the canister is heated and compressed using a hammer or pneumatic press, the material on the inside of the correction fluid is forged together, but it does not forge to the canister, allowing the pattern created by forging the different materials together to be seen in the finished piece because it is not covered by the homologous steel of the canister. 

==Etymology==
The term &#x27;pattern welding&#x27; was coined by English archaeologist Herbert Maryon in a 1948 paper: &quot;The welding of these swords represents an excessively difficult operation. I do not know of finer smith&#x27;s work... I have named the technique ‘pattern welding’... Examples of pattern-welding range in date from the third century to the Viking Age.&quot;

<doc id="24176" wikidata="Q5593" url="?curid=24176" title="Pablo Picasso">
<text>Pablo Ruiz Picasso (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot; (1907) and the anti-war painting &quot;Guernica&quot; (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.

Picasso&#x27;s output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso&#x27;s work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.

Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.

== Early life ==

Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. Picasso&#x27;s family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum.

Picasso&#x27;s birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. &quot;Ruiz y Picasso&quot; were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname &quot;Picasso&quot; comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy. Pablo&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.

Picasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were &quot;piz, piz&quot;, a shortening of &quot;lápiz&quot;, the Spanish word for &quot;pencil&quot;. From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.

The family moved to A Coruña in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son&#x27;s technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by him exist from later years.

In 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria. After her death, the family moved to Barcelona, where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home. Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two argued frequently.

Picasso&#x27;s father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid&#x27;s Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, the country&#x27;s foremost art school. At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Velázquez, Francisco Goya, and Francisco Zurbarán. Picasso especially admired the works of El Greco; elements such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso&#x27;s later work.

== Career ==
=== Before 1900 ===

Picasso&#x27;s training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist&#x27;s beginnings. During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun. The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in &quot;The First Communion&quot; (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted &quot;Portrait of Aunt Pepa&quot;, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called &quot;without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.&quot;

In 1897, his realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899–1900) followed. His exposure to the work of Rossetti, Steinlen, Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard Munch, combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as El Greco, led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.

Picasso made his first trip to Paris, then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine &quot;Arte Joven&quot; (&quot;Young Art&quot;), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work &quot;Picasso&quot;. From 1898 he signed his works as &quot;Pablo Ruiz Picasso&quot;, then as &quot;Pablo R. Picasso&quot; until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.

=== Blue Period: 1901–1904 ===
Picasso&#x27;s Blue Period (1901–1904), characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from the Blue Period, during which Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter—prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects—Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting &quot;La Vie&quot; (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.

The same mood pervades the well-known etching &quot;The Frugal Repast&quot; (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness, a recurrent theme in Picasso&#x27;s works of this period, is also represented in &quot;The Blindman&#x27;s Meal&quot; (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of &quot;Celestina&quot; (1903). Other Blue Period works include &quot;Portrait of Soler&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Suzanne Bloch&quot;.

=== Rose Period: 1904–1906 ===

The Rose Period (1904–1906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904. Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.

By 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted a portrait of Gertrude Stein and one of her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso&#x27;s principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal &quot;Salon&quot; at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta, who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso&#x27;s and Matisse&#x27;s paintings. Eventually, Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picassos.

In 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as André Derain, Kees van Dongen, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.

=== African art and primitivism: 1907–1909 ===
Picasso&#x27;s African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro. When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax. Picasso did not exhibit &quot;Les Demoiselles&quot; publicly until 1916.

Other works from this period include &quot;Nude with Raised Arms&quot; (1907) and &quot;Three Women&quot; (1908). Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.
Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and &quot;analyzed&quot; them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque&#x27;s paintings at this time share many similarities.

In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including André Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about the theft of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; from the Louvre. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to Géry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting&#x27;s disappearance.

=== Synthetic cubism: 1912–1919 ===
Synthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages – were pasted into compositions, marking the first cubist collage and simultaneously what is often considered to be the first assemblage, with his creation of the seminal work &quot;Still Life with Chair Caning&quot; (1912; oil and printed oilcloth 
on canvas edged with rope).

Between 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. &quot;Hard-edged square-cut diamonds&quot;, notes art historian John Richardson, &quot;these gems do not always have upside or downside&quot;. &quot;We need a new name to designate them,&quot; wrote Picasso to Gertrude Stein. The term &quot;Crystal Cubism&quot; was later used as a result of visual analogies with crystals at the time. These &quot;little gems&quot; may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order following the war.

After acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Picasso was living in Avignon. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler&#x27;s contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point, Picasso&#x27;s work would be taken on by the art dealer Léonce Rosenberg. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair with Gaby Lespinasse. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.

Towards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with Serge Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. Among his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Parade&quot;, in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Errázuriz. 

Khokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso, who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova&#x27;s insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso&#x27;s bohemian tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev&#x27;s troupe, he and Igor Stravinsky collaborated on &quot;Pulcinella&quot; in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer. In the summer of 1921, Picasso, Khokhlova and Paulo stayed at a villa in the village of Fontainebleau, France; during their time there, Picasso, using the garage as a studio, painted &quot;Three Women at the Spring&quot; and &quot;Three Musicians&quot;.

In 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and began a secret affair with her. Picasso&#x27;s marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth. The two remained legally married until Khokhlova&#x27;s death in 1955. Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya. Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four years after Picasso&#x27;s death.

=== Neoclassicism and surrealism: 1919–1929 ===

In February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a neoclassical style. This &quot;return to order&quot; is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including André Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement. Picasso&#x27;s paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres.

In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet André Breton declared Picasso as &quot;one of ours&quot; in his article &quot;Le Surréalisme et la peinture&quot;, published in &quot;Révolution surréaliste&quot;. &quot;Les Demoiselles&quot; was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of &quot;psychic automatism in its pure state&quot; defined in the &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot; never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, &quot;releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909&quot;, writes art historian Melissa McQuillan. Although this transition in Picasso&#x27;s work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, &quot;the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work&quot;, writes McQuillan. Surrealism revived Picasso&#x27;s attraction to primitivism and eroticism.

=== The Great Depression, &quot;Guernica&quot;, and the MoMA exhibition: 1930–1939 ===
During the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;. The minotaur and Picasso&#x27;s mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated &quot;Vollard Suite&quot; of etchings.

Arguably Picasso&#x27;s most famous work is his depiction of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War – &quot;Guernica&quot;. This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, &quot;It isn&#x27;t up to the painter to define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if he wrote them out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as they understand them.&quot;

&quot;Guernica&quot; was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition, and then became the centrepiece of an exhibition of 118 works by Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Henri Laurens that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso&#x27;s expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.

Before &quot;Guernica&quot;, Picasso had never addressed political themes in his art. The politicized nature of the work is largely attributed to his romantic relationship at the time with the French anti-fascist activist and surrealist photographer, Dora Maar. In addition, her black and white photographs are likely to have influenced the black and white scheme of &quot;Guernica&quot;, in stark contrast to Picasso&#x27;s usual colorful paintings. &quot;Maar&#x27;s practice of photography influenced the art of Picasso – she had a great influence on his work,&quot; said Antoine Romand, a Dora Maar expert. &quot;She contested him. She pushed him to do something new and to be more creative politically.&quot; Maar had exclusive access to Picasso&#x27;s studio to observe and photograph the creation of &quot;Guernica&quot;. At Picasso&#x27;s request, Maar painted parts of the dying horse.

In 1939 and 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, under its director Alfred Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso&#x27;s principal works until that time. This exhibition lionized Picasso, brought into full public view in America the scope of his artistry, and resulted in a reinterpretation of his work by contemporary art historians and scholars. According to Jonathan Weinberg, &quot;Given the extraordinary quality of the show and Picasso&#x27;s enormous prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of &quot;Guernica&quot; ... the critics were surprisingly ambivalent&quot;. Picasso&#x27;s &quot;multiplicity of styles&quot; was disturbing to one journalist; another described him as &quot;wayward and even malicious&quot;; Alfred Frankenstein&#x27;s review in &quot;ARTnews&quot; concluded that Picasso was both charlatan and genius.

=== World War II and late 1940s: 1939–1949 ===

During World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans occupied the city. Picasso&#x27;s artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of his apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting &quot;Guernica&quot;. &quot;Did you do that?&quot; the German asked Picasso. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;You did.&quot;

Retreating to his studio, he continued to paint, producing works such as the &quot;Still Life with Guitar&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Charnel House&quot; (1944–48). Although the Germans outlawed bronze casting in Paris, Picasso continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to him by the French Resistance.

Around this time, Picasso wrote poetry as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 he wrote more than 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where they were written (for example &quot;Paris 16 May 1936&quot;), these works were gustatory, erotic, and at times scatological, as were his two full-length plays, &quot;Desire Caught by the Tail&quot; (1941), &quot;The Four Little Girls&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Burial of the Count of Orgaz&quot; (1959).

In 1944, after the liberation of Paris, Picasso, then 63 years old, began a romantic relationship with a young art student named Françoise Gilot. She was 40 years younger than he was. Picasso grew tired of his mistress Dora Maar; Picasso and Gilot began to live together. Eventually, they had two children: Claude Picasso, born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso, born in 1949. In her 1964 book &quot;Life with Picasso&quot;, Gilot describes his abusive treatment and myriad infidelities which led her to leave him, taking the children with her. This was a severe blow to Picasso.
Picasso had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than his and Gilot&#x27;s. While still involved with Gilot, in 1951 Picasso had a six-week affair with Geneviève Laporte, who was four years younger than Gilot. By his 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as their theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. Jacqueline Roque (1927–1986) worked at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Riviera, where Picasso made and painted ceramics. She became his lover, and then his second wife in 1961. The two were together for the remainder of Picasso&#x27;s life.

His marriage to Roque was also a means of revenge against Gilot; with Picasso&#x27;s encouragement, Gilot had divorced her then-husband, Luc Simon, with the plan to marry Picasso to secure the rights of her children as Picasso&#x27;s legitimate heirs. Picasso had already secretly married Roque, after Gilot had filed for divorce. His strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed.

By this time, Picasso had constructed a huge Gothic home, and could afford large villas in the south of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of Mougins, and in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur. He was an international celebrity, with often as much interest in his personal life as his art.

=== Later works to final years: 1949–1973 ===
Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In the 1950s, Picasso&#x27;s style changed once again, as he took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of works based on Velázquez&#x27;s painting of &quot;Las Meninas&quot;. He also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix.

In addition to his artistic accomplishments, Picasso made a few film appearances, always as himself, including a cameo in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960). In 1955, he helped make the film &quot;Le Mystère Picasso&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of Picasso&quot;) directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.

He was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge -high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso. He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. Picasso said the figure represented the head of an Afghan Hound named Kabul. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.

Picasso&#x27;s final works were a mixture of styles, his means of expression in constant flux until the end of his life. Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time these works were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his prime. Only later, after Picasso&#x27;s death, when the rest of the art world had moved on from abstract expressionism, did the critical community come to see the late works of Picasso as prefiguring Neo-Expressionism.

==Death==
Pablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from pulmonary edema and a heart attack, the morning after he and his wife Jacqueline entertained friends for dinner. He was interred at the Château of Vauvenargues near Aix-en-Provence, a property he had acquired in 1958 and occupied with Jacqueline between 1959 and 1962. Jacqueline prevented his children Claude and Paloma from attending the funeral. Devastated and lonely after the death of Picasso, Jacqueline killed herself by gunshot in 1986 when she was 60 years old.

== Political views ==

Picasso remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth, despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it. He did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, or World War II. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war. In 1940, he applied for French citizenship, but it was refused on the grounds of his &quot;extremist ideas evolving towards communism&quot;. This information was not revealed until 2003.

At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Picasso was 54 years of age. Soon after hostilities began, the Republicans appointed him &quot;director of the Prado, albeit in absentia&quot;, and &quot;he took his duties very seriously&quot;, according to John Richardson, supplying the funds to evacuate the museum&#x27;s collection to Geneva. The war provided the impetus for Picasso&#x27;s first overtly political work. He expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists in &quot;The Dream and Lie of Franco&quot; (1937), which was produced &quot;specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes&quot;. This surreal fusion of words and images was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the Spanish Republican cause.

In 1944, Picasso joined the French Communist Party. He attended the 1948 World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Poland, and in 1950 received the Stalin Peace Prize from the Soviet government. A portrait of Joseph Stalin made by Picasso in 1953 drew Party criticism due to being insufficiently realistic, though he remained a loyal member of the Communist Party until his death. His dealer, D-H. Kahnweiler, a socialist, termed Picasso&#x27;s communism &quot;sentimental&quot; rather than political, saying &quot;He has never read a line of Karl Marx, nor of Engels of course.&quot; In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: &quot;I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics.&quot; His commitment to communism, common among continental intellectuals and artists at the time, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable demonstration thereof was a quote by Salvador Dalí (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship):

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Picasso es pintor, yo también; ... Picasso es español, yo también; Picasso es comunista, yo tampoco.&quot;

(Picasso is a painter, so am I; ... Picasso is a Spaniard, so am I; Picasso is a communist, neither am I.)&lt;/poem&gt;

In the late 1940s, his old friend surrealist poet André Breton, who was a Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist, was more blunt; refusing to shake hands with Picasso, he told him: &quot;I don&#x27;t approve of your joining the Communist Party nor with the stand you have taken concerning the purges of the intellectuals after the Liberation.&quot;
As a communist, Picasso opposed the intervention of the United Nations and the United States in the Korean War, and depicted it in &quot;Massacre in Korea&quot;. The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen wrote that it was &quot;inspired by reports of American atrocities&quot; and considered it one of Picasso&#x27;s communist works.

On 9 January 1949, Picasso created &quot;Dove&quot;, a black and white lithograph. It was used to illustrate a poster at the 1949 World Peace Council and became an iconographic image of the period, known as &quot;The dove of peace&quot;. Picasso&#x27;s image was used around the world as a symbol of the Peace Congresses and communism.

In 1962, he received the Lenin Peace Prize. Biographer and art critic John Berger felt his talents as an artist were &quot;wasted&quot; by the communists. According to Jean Cocteau&#x27;s diaries, Picasso once said to him in reference to the communists: &quot;I have joined a family, and like all families, it&#x27;s full of shit.&quot;

== Style and technique ==

Picasso was exceptionally prolific throughout his long lifetime. At his death there were more than 45,000 unsold works in his estate, comprising 1,885 paintings, 1,228 sculptures, 3,222 ceramics, 7,089 drawings, 150 sketchbooks, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs. The most complete – but not exhaustive – catalogue of his works, the catalogue raisonné compiled by Christian Zervos, lists more than 16,000 paintings and drawings. Picasso&#x27;s output was several times more prolific than most artists of his era; by at least one account, American artist Bob Ross is the only one to rival Picasso&#x27;s volume, and Ross&#x27;s artwork was designed specifically to be easily mass-produced quickly.

The medium in which Picasso made his most important contribution was painting. In his paintings, Picasso used colour as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space. He sometimes added sand to his paint to vary its texture. A nanoprobe of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;The Red Armchair&quot; (1931), in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 confirmed art historians&#x27; belief that Picasso used common house paint in many of his paintings. Much of his painting was done at night by artificial light.

Picasso&#x27;s early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 Picasso abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials. An example is &quot;Guitar&quot; (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a &quot;three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting&quot; that marks a &quot;revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving&quot;.

From the beginning of his career, Picasso displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled him to work in several styles at once. For example, his paintings of 1917 included the pointillist &quot;Woman with a Mantilla&quot;, the Cubist &quot;Figure in an Armchair&quot;, and the naturalistic &quot;Harlequin&quot; (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona). In 1919, he made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect his interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs. In 1921 he simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition &quot;Three Musicians&quot; (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art). In an interview published in 1923, Picasso said, &quot;The several manners I have used in my art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting ... If the subjects I have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression I have never hesitated to adopt them.&quot;

Although his Cubist works approach abstraction, Picasso never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter. Prominent in his Cubist paintings are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles. When Picasso depicted complex narrative scenes it was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; &quot;Guernica&quot; (1937) is one of his few large narrative paintings.

Picasso painted mostly from imagination or memory. According to William Rubin, Picasso &quot;could only make great art from subjects that truly involved him ... Unlike Matisse, Picasso had eschewed models virtually all his mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, his own.&quot; The art critic Arthur Danto said Picasso&#x27;s work constitutes a &quot;vast pictorial autobiography&quot; that provides some basis for the popular conception that &quot;Picasso invented a new style each time he fell in love with a new woman&quot;. The autobiographical nature of Picasso&#x27;s art is reinforced by his habit of dating his works, often to the day. He explained: &quot;I want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible. That&#x27;s why I put a date on everything I do.&quot;

== Artistic legacy ==
Picasso&#x27;s influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by his admirers and detractors alike. On the occasion of his 1939 retrospective at MoMA, &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;During the 25 years he has dominated modern European art, his enemies say he has been a corrupting influence. With equal violence, his friends say he is the greatest artist alive.&quot; Picasso was the first artist to receive a special honour exhibition at the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris in celebration of his 90 years. In 1998, Robert Hughes wrote of him: &quot;To say that Pablo Picasso dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace. ... No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as this in his own lifetime. ... Though Marcel Duchamp, that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than Picasso, the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.&quot;
At the time of Picasso&#x27;s death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he did not need to sell. In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as Henri Matisse, with whom he had exchanged works. Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection. These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the Musée Picasso in Paris. In 2003, relatives of Picasso inaugurated a museum dedicated to him in his birthplace, Málaga, Spain, the Museo Picasso Málaga.
The Museu Picasso in Barcelona features many of his early works, created while he was living in Spain, including many rarely seen works which reveal his firm grounding in classical techniques. The museum also holds many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father&#x27;s tutelage, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabartés, his close friend and personal secretary.

&quot;Guernica&quot; was on display in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art for many years. In 1981, it was returned to Spain and was on exhibit at the Casón del Buen Retiro of the Museo del Prado. In 1992, the painting was put on display in the Reina Sofía Museum when it opened.
In 1985, a museum was established in Buitrago del Lozoya by Picasso&#x27;s friend Eugenio Arias Herranz.

It was announced on 22 September 2020 that the project for a new Picasso Museum due to open in Aix-en-Provence in 2021, in a former convent (Couvent des Prêcheurs), which would have held the largest collection of his paintings of any museum, had been scrapped due to the fact that Catherine Hutin-Blay, Jacqueline Picasso&#x27;s daughter, and the City Council had failed to reach an agreement.

In the 1996 movie &quot;Surviving Picasso&quot;, Picasso is portrayed by actor Anthony Hopkins. Picasso is also a character in Steve Martin&#x27;s 1993 play, &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot;. In &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, Hemingway tells Gertrude Stein that he would like to have some Picassos, but cannot afford them. Later in the book, Hemingway mentions looking at one of Picasso&#x27;s paintings. He refers to it as Picasso&#x27;s nude of the girl with the basket of flowers, possibly related to &quot;Young Naked Girl with Flower Basket&quot;.
On 8 October 2010, &quot;Picasso: Masterpieces from the Musée National Picasso, Paris,&quot; an exhibition of 150 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs from the Musée National Picasso in Paris, opened at the Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington, US. The exhibition subsequently travelled to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, Virginia: the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, California, US.; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

, Picasso remained the top-ranked artist (based on sales of his works at auctions) according to the Art Market Trends report. More of his paintings have been stolen than any other artist&#x27;s; in 2012, the Art Loss Register had 1,147 of his works listed as stolen. The Picasso Administration functions as his official Estate. The US copyright representative for the Picasso Administration is the Artists Rights Society.

Picasso is played by Antonio Banderas in the 2018 season of &quot;Genius&quot; which focuses on his life and art.

===The Basel vote===

In the 1940s, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had bought two paintings by Picasso to diversify its investments and serve as a guarantee for the insured risks. Following an air disaster in 1967, the company had to pay out heavy reimbursements. The company decided to part with the two paintings, which were deposited in the Kunstmuseum Basel. In 1968, a large number of Basel citizens called for a local referendum on the purchase of the Picassos by the Canton of Basel-Stadt, which was successful, making it the first time in democratic history that the population of a city voted on the purchase of works of art for a public art museum. The paintings therefore remained in the museum in Basel. Informed of this, Picasso donated three paintings and a sketch to the city and its museum and was later made an honorary citizen by the city.

=== Auction history ===

Several paintings by Picasso rank among the most expensive paintings in the world. &quot;Garçon à la pipe&quot; sold for US$104 million at Sotheby&#x27;s on 4 May 2004. &quot;Dora Maar au Chat&quot; sold for US$95.2 million at Sotheby&#x27;s on 3 May 2006. On 4 May 2010, &quot;Nude, Green Leaves and Bust&quot; was sold at Christie&#x27;s for US$106.5 million. The 1932 work, which depicts Picasso&#x27;s mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter reclining and as a bust, was in the personal collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died in November 2009. On 11 May 2015 his painting &quot;Women of Algiers&quot; set the record for the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for US$179.3 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York.

On 21 June 2016, a painting by Pablo Picasso titled &quot;Femme Assise&quot; (1909) sold for £43.2 million ($63.4 million) at Sotheby&#x27;s London, exceeding the estimate by nearly $20 million, setting a world record for the highest price ever paid at auction for a Cubist work.

On 17 May 2017, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; in an article titled &quot;Picasso Work Stolen By Nazis Sells for $45 Million at Auction&quot; reported the sale of a portrait painted by Picasso, the 1939 &quot;Femme assise, robe bleu&quot;, which was previously misappropriated during the early years of WWII. The painting has changed hands several times since its recovery, most recently through auction in May 2017 at Christie&#x27;s in New York City.

In March 2018, his &quot;Femme au Béret et à la Robe Quadrillée&quot; (1937), a portrait of Marie-Thérèse Walter, sold for £49.8m at Sotheby&#x27;s in London.

== Personal life ==
From early adolescence, Picasso maintained both superficial and intense amatory sexual relationships. Biographer John Richardson stated that &#x27;work, sex, and tobacco&#x27; were his addictions. Picasso was married twice and had four children by three women:

* (4 February 1921 – 5 June 1975, Paul Joseph Picasso) – with Olga Khokhlova
* Maya (5 September 1935 – 20 December 2022, Maria de la Concepcion Picasso) – with Marie-Thérèse Walter
* Claude (15 May 1947 – 24 August 2023, Claude Pierre Pablo Picasso) and Paloma (born 19 April 1949, Anne Paloma Picasso) – with Françoise Gilot

Photographer and painter Dora Maar was a constant companion and lover of Picasso. The two were closest in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and it was Maar who documented the painting of &quot;Guernica&quot;.

The women in Picasso&#x27;s life played an important role in the emotional and erotic aspects of his creative expression, and the tumultuous nature of these relationships has been considered vital to his artistic process. Many of these women functioned as muses for him, and their inclusion in his extensive oeuvre granted them a place in art history. A largely recurring motif in his body of work is the female form. The variations in his relationships informed and collided with his progression of style throughout his career. For example, portraits created of his first wife, Olga, were rendered in a naturalistic style during his Neoclassical period. His relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter inspired many of his surrealist pieces, as well as what is referred to as his &quot;Year of Wonders&quot;. The reappearance of an acrobats theme in 1905 put an end to his &quot;Blue Period&quot;, marking the transition into his &quot;Rose Period&quot;. This transition has been incorrectly attributed to the presence of Fernande Olivier in his life.

Picasso has been characterized as a womaniser and a misogynist, being quoted as saying to long-time partner Françoise Gilot that &quot;women are machines for suffering.&quot; He later allegedly told her, &quot;For me there are only two kinds of women: goddesses and doormats.&quot; In her memoir, &quot;Picasso, My Grandfather&quot;, Marina Picasso writes of his treatment of women, &quot;He submitted them to his animal sexuality, tamed them, bewitched them, ingested them, and crushed them onto his canvas. After he had spent many nights extracting their essence, once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.&quot;

Of the several important women in his life, two – lover Marie-Thèrése Walter and his second wife Jacqueline Roque – died by suicide. Others, notably his first wife Olga Khokhlova and lover Dora Maar, succumbed to nervous breakdowns. His son, Paulo, developed a fatal alcoholism due to depression. His grandson, Pablito, also died by suicide that same year by ingesting bleach when he was barred by Jacqueline Roque from attending the artist&#x27;s funeral.

== Catalogue raisonné ==
Picasso entrusted Christian Zervos to constitute the catalogue raisonné of his work (painted and drawn). The first volume of the catalogue, &quot;Works from 1895 to 1906&quot;, published in 1932, entailed the financial ruin of Zervos, self-publishing under the name &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art&quot;, forcing him to sell part of his art collection at auction to avoid bankruptcy.

From 1932 to 1978, Zervos constituted the catalogue raisonné of the complete works of Picasso in the company of the artist who had become one of his friends in 1924. Following the death of Zervos, Mila Gagarin supervised the publication of 11 additional volumes from 1970 to 1978.

The 33 volumes cover the entire work from 1895 to 1972, with close to 16,000 black and white photographs, in accord with the will of the artist.

<text>Palm Sunday is the Christian moveable feast that falls on the Sunday before Easter. The feast commemorates Christ&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, an event mentioned in each of the four canonical Gospels. Its name originates from the palm branches waved by the crowd to greet and honor Jesus Christ as he entered the city. Palm Sunday marks the first day of Holy Week; in Western Christianity, this is the beginning of the last week of the solemn season of Lent, preceding Eastertide, while in Eastern Christianity, Holy Week commences after the conclusion of Great Lent.

In most Christian rites, Palm Sunday is celebrated by the blessing and distribution of palm branches (or the branches of other, native trees), representing the palm branches that the crowd scattered before Christ as he rode into Jerusalem. These palms are sometimes woven into crosses. The difficulty of procuring palms in unfavorable climates led to the substitution of branches of native trees, including box, olive, willow, and yew.

Many churches of mainstream Christian denominations, including the Orthodox, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican, Moravian, and Reformed traditions, distribute palm branches to their congregations during their Palm Sunday liturgies. Christians take these palms, which are often blessed by clergy, to their homes, where they hang them alongside Christian art (especially crosses and crucifixes) or keep them in their Bibles and daily devotional books. In the days preceding the next year&#x27;s Lent, known as Carnival or Shrovetide, churches often place a basket in their narthex to collect these palms, which are then ritually burned on Shrove Tuesday to make the ashes to be used on the following day, Ash Wednesday, which is the first day of Lent.

==Biblical basis and symbolism==


In the accounts of the four canonical Gospels, Christ&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem takes place a week before his resurrection. Only the Gospel of John shows a timeline of the event, dated six days before the Passover.

The raising of Lazarus is mentioned only by the Gospel of John, in the previous chapter. The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches which follows the Byzantine Rite, commemorate it on Lazarus Saturday, following the text of the Gospel. In fact, the Jewish calendar dates begin at sundown of the night beforehand, and conclude at nightfall.

The Gospel of Matthew states that this happened that the prophecy might be fulfilled of: Zechariah 9:9 &quot;The Coming of Zion&#x27;s King – See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey&quot;. It suggests that Jesus was declaring he was the King of Israel.

According to the Gospels, Jesus Christ rode on a donkey into Jerusalem, and the celebrating people there laid down their cloaks and small branches of trees in front of him, singing part of Psalm 118: 25–26 – Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord.

The symbolism of the donkey may refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, unlike the horse which is the animal of war. A king would have ridden a horse when he was bent on war and ridden a donkey to symbolize his arrival in peace. Christ&#x27;s entry to Jerusalem would have thus symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a war-waging king. Thus there have been two different meanings (or more levels of biblical hermeneutics): an historical meaning, truly happening according to the Gospels, and a secondary meaning in the symbolism.
In Luke 19:41 as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as &quot;Flevit super illam&quot; in Latin), foretelling his coming Passion and the suffering that awaits the city in the events of the destruction of the Second Temple.

In many lands in the ancient Near East, it was customary to cover in some way the path of someone thought worthy of the highest honour. The Hebrew Bible reports that Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, was treated this way. Both the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John report that people gave Jesus this form of honour. In the synoptics the people are described as laying their garments and cut rushes on the street, whereas John specifies fronds of palm (Greek &quot;phoinix)&quot;. In Jewish tradition, the palm is one of the Four Species carried for Sukkot, as prescribed for rejoicing in Leviticus 23:40.

In the Greco-Roman culture of the Roman Empire, which strongly influenced Christian tradition, the palm branch was a symbol of triumph and victory. It became the most common attribute of the goddess Nike or Victoria. For contemporary Roman observers, the procession would have evoked the Roman triumph, when the &quot;triumphator&quot; laid down his arms and wore the toga, the civilian garment of peace that might be ornamented with emblems of the palm.

Although the Epistles of Paul refer to Jesus as &quot;triumphing&quot;, the entry into Jerusalem may not have been regularly pictured as a triumphal procession in this sense before the 13th century. In ancient Egyptian religion, the palm was carried in funeral processions and represented eternal life. The martyr&#x27;s palm was later used as a symbol of Christian martyrs and their spiritual victory or triumph over death. In Revelation 7:9, the white-clad multitude stand before the throne and Lamb holding palm branches.

==Observance in the liturgy==
===Eastern and Oriental Christianity===
Palm Sunday, or the &quot;Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem&quot; as it may be called in Orthodox Churches, is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year. The day before Palm Sunday, Lazarus Saturday, believers often prepare palm fronds by knotting them into crosses in preparation for the procession on Sunday. The hangings and vestments in the church are changed to a festive color – most commonly green.

The Troparion of the Feast (a short hymn) indicates that the resurrection of Lazarus is a prefiguration of Christ&#x27;s Resurrection:

In the Russian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Catholic Church, Ruthenian Catholic Church, Polish, Bavarian and Austrian Roman Catholics, and various other Eastern European peoples, the custom developed of using pussy willow and other twigs like box tree instead of palm fronds because the latter are not readily available that far north. There is no canonical requirement as to what kind of branches must be used, so some Orthodox believers use olive branches.

Whatever the kind, these branches are blessed and distributed together with candles either during the All-Night Vigil on the Eve of the Feast (Saturday night), or before the Divine Liturgy on Sunday morning. The Great Entrance of the Divine Liturgy commemorates the &quot;Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem&quot;, so the meaningfulness of this moment is punctuated on Palm Sunday as everyone stands, holding their branches and lit candles. The faithful take these branches and candles home with them after the liturgy, and keep them in their icon corner as an &quot;evloghia&quot; (blessing).

In Russia, donkey walk processions took place in different cities, but most importantly in Novgorod and, from 1558 until 1693, in Moscow. These were prominently featured in testimonies by foreign witnesses and mentioned in contemporary Western maps of the city. The Patriarch of Moscow, representing Christ, rode on a &quot;donkey&quot;, actually a horse draped in white cloth. The Tsar of Russia humbly led the procession on foot. Originally, Moscow processions began inside the Kremlin and terminated at Trinity Church, now known as Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1658 Patriarch Nikon reversed the order of procession. Peter I in the 1720s, as a part of his nationalisation of the church, terminated the custom. It has been occasionally recreated in the 21st century.

In Oriental Orthodox churches, palm fronds are distributed at the front of the church at the sanctuary steps. In India the sanctuary itself is strewn with marigolds, and the congregation proceeds through and outside the church.

===Western Christianity===


In ancient times, palm branches symbolized goodness and victory. They were often depicted on coins and important buildings. Solomon had palm branches carved into the walls and doors of the temple. Again at the end of the Bible, people from every nation raise palm branches to honor Jesus.

Palm Sunday commemorates the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem, during which palm branches were placed in his path, before his arrest on Holy Thursday and his crucifixion on Good Friday. It thus marks the beginning of Holy Week, the final week of Lent.

In churches of many Christian denominations, members of the congregation, oftentimes children, are given palms that they carry as they walk in a procession around the inside of the church. In the Church of Pakistan, a united Protestant Church, the faithful on Palm Sunday carry palm branches into the church as they sing Psalm 24. A robust hymnody has developed for Palm Sunday, including &quot;Hosanna, Loud Hosanna&quot;, &quot;Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!&quot;, &quot;All Glory, Laud and Honour&quot;, &quot;Palms of Victory&quot;, and &quot;Hark the glad sound! the Saviour comes&quot;.

In the Roman Catholic Church, as well as among many Lutheran and Anglican congregations, palm fronds (or in colder climates some kind of substitutes) are blessed with holy water outside the church building (or in cold climates in the narthex when Easter falls early in the year) in an event called the Blessing of the Palms. A solemn procession of the entire congregation takes place immediately after the blessing of the palms, called the Palm procession.

In the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican traditions, this feast now coincides with that of Passion Sunday, which is the focus of the Mass which follows the procession. The Catholic Church considers the blessed palms to be sacramentals. The vestments for the day are deep scarlet red, the colour of blood, indicating the supreme redemptive sacrifice Christ was entering the city to make, to fulfill his passion and resurrection in Jerusalem.

In the Lutheran Churches, as well as in the Episcopal/Anglican churches, the day is officially called &quot;The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday&quot;; in practice, though, it is usually termed &quot;Palm Sunday&quot; as in the 1928 American Book of Common Prayer and in earlier Lutheran liturgies and calendars, to avoid undue confusion with the penultimate Sunday of Lent in the traditional calendar, which was &quot;Passion Sunday&quot;.

In traditional usage of the Methodist Church, &quot;The Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) provides the following Collect for Palm Sunday:
==Customs==

It is customary in many churches for worshippers to receive fresh palm leaves on Palm Sunday. In parts of the world where this has historically been impractical, substitute traditions have arisen.

===Belgium===
In Hoegaarden, one of the last remaining Palm Sunday processions takes place every year. A fellowship of Twelve Apostles carries a wooden statue of Christ around the town, while children go door to door offering the palms (box) for coins.

===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, Palm Sunday is known as &quot;Tsvetnitsa&quot; (, &quot;flower&quot;) or &quot;Vrabnitsa&quot; (&quot;varba&quot;, &quot;willow&quot;), or Flower&#x27;s Day. People with flower-related names (e.g., , etc.) celebrate this day as their name day.

===England===
In the 15th through the 17th centuries in England, Palm Sunday was frequently marked by the burning of Jack o&#x27; Lent figures. This was a straw effigy which would be stoned and abused on Ash Wednesday, and kept in the parish for burning on Palm Sunday. The symbolism was believed to be a kind of revenge on Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Christ. The effigy could also have represented the hated figure of Winter, whose destruction prepares the way for Spring.

===Egypt and Ethiopia===
In the Coptic Orthodox Church and Orthodox Ethiopia, this holiday is referred to as Hosanna. Palm leaves will be blessed and distributed, they are used to create crucifixes, rings and other ornaments.

===Finland===

In Finland, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods and trade decorated pussy willow branches for coins and candy. This is an old Karelian custom called &quot;virpominen&quot;.

It is customary for the children to chant, with some variation, &quot;Virvon varvon tuoreeks, terveeks, tulevaks vuodeks, vitsa sulle, palkka mulle!&quot; which very roughly translates as &quot;I&#x27;m wishing you a fresh, healthy upcoming year, a branch for you, a prize for me!&quot; The chant has been translated in Juha Vuorinen&#x27;s novel &quot;Totally Smashed!&quot; as &quot;Willow switch, I&#x27;m the Easter witch! I wish you health and a love that&#x27;s rich! From me I bring some luck today, for this branch what will you pay?&quot;

===Germany===
In some regions of Germany, long stakes with pussy willow, box and other twigs are taken for the Palm procession rather than nosegays. In some Southern regions either the priest leads the palm procession, riding on a donkey, or a wooden donkey (called &quot;Palmesel&quot;) with a figure of Christ is traditionally trundled with the procession of the faithful.

===India===

In most of the Catholic churches in India the palms are blessed by the priest on Palm Sunday and then distributed among the people after the holy mass. There is a tradition of folding palm fronds into palm crosses, which are kept at the altar till the next Ash Wednesday.
In the South Indian state of Kerala (and in Indian Orthodox, Church of South India (CSI), Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, and Syriac Orthodox Church (Jacobite) congregations elsewhere in India and throughout the world), flowers are strewn about the sanctuary on Palm Sunday during the reading of the Gospel, at the words uttered by the crowd welcoming Jesus, &quot;Hosanna! Blessed is he who is come and is to come in the name of the Lord God&quot;. These words are read to the congregation thrice. The congregation then repeats, &quot;Hosanna!&quot;, and the flowers are scattered, a common custom in Indian celebrations. This symbolizes Jesus&#x27; triumphant entry into Jerusalem.
Indian Orthodoxy traces its roots to the arrival in India of Saint Thomas the Apostle (traditionally dated to AD 52) and his evangelism among both the Brahmans of the Malabar Coast and the ancient Jewish community there. Its rites and ceremonies are Jewish, Indian and Levantine Christian, in origin. In Syro-Malabar Catholic Church&#x27;s palm leaves are blessed during Palm Sunday ceremony and a Procession takes place holding the palms.

===Ireland===
In Ireland&#x27;s cold climate, real palm leaves are generally not available, so yew, silver fir, spruce or cypress are used instead; it is known in Irish as &quot;Domhnach an Iúir&quot;, &quot;Yew Sunday.&quot; The historian Patrick Weston Joyce noted that yew was always called &quot;palm&quot; in his 1830s childhood, and he only later learned the tree&#x27;s correct name. &quot;Palm&quot; branches were often worn in the buttonhole or hung on the wall; the second practise is still common, and palm branches are blessed with holy water at Catholic Masses.

In the past in some areas, a palm stem was charred and a cross was marked on eggs set for hatching, while in parts of Counties Galway and Mayo, shredded palm was mixed through the seed grain. The coincidence of Palm Sunday and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day (March 17), &quot;when the shamrock and the palm are worn together,&quot; was said to presage a great event; this last happened in 1940, at the beginning of the Second World War, and will not reoccur until 2391.

===Italy===

In Italy, palm leaves are used along with small olive branches, readily available in the Mediterranean climate. These are placed at house entrances (for instance, hanging above the door) to last until the following year&#x27;s Palm Sunday. For this reason, usually palm leaves are not used whole, due to their size; instead, leaf strips are braided into smaller shapes. Small olive branches are also often used to decorate traditional Easter cakes, along with other symbols of birth, like eggs.

===Latvia===
In Latvia, Palm Sunday is called &quot;Pussy Willow Sunday&quot;, and pussy willows – symbolizing new life – are blessed and distributed to the faithful. Children are often awakened that morning with ritualistic swats of a willow branch.

===Lithuania===
When Christianity came to Lithuania, the plants which sprouted earliest were honored during spring feasts. The name &quot;Palm Sunday&quot; is a misnomer; the &quot;verba&quot; or &quot;dwarfed spruce&quot; is used instead. According to tradition, on the Saturday before Palm Sunday the Lithuanians take special care in choosing and cutting well-formed branches, which the women-folk decorate with flowers. The flowers are meticulously tied onto the branches, making the &quot;Verba&quot;.

===The Levant===
In Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria, Palm Sunday (&quot;Shaa&#x27;nineh&quot; in Arabic) Is perhaps the best-attended liturgy in the Christian Calendar, among the Orthodox, Catholic (Latin and Eastern), and Anglican Churches, perhaps because it is notably a family occasion. On this day, children attend church with branches from olive and palm trees. Also, there will be carefully woven crosses and other symbols made from palm fronds and roses and a procession at the beginning of the liturgy, during which at some point, the priest will take an olive branch and splash holy water on the faithful.

===Malta===
All the parishes of Malta and Gozo on Palm Sunday (Maltese: &quot;Ħadd il-Palm&quot;) bless the palm leaves and the olive leaves. Those parishes that have the statues of Good Friday bless the olive tree they put on the statues of &quot;Jesus prays in the Olive Garden&quot; (&quot;Ġesù fl-Ort&quot;) and the &quot;Betrayal of Judas&quot; (&quot;il-Bewsa ta&#x27; Ġuda&quot;). Also, many people take a small olive branch to their homes because it is a sacramental.

===Netherlands===
In the Saxon regions of the Netherlands, crosses are decorated with candy and bread, made in the form of a rooster. In the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden, a great procession with oil lamps is held the night before Palm Sunday in honour of the Sorrowful Mother of Warfhuizen.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, a statue of Christ riding a donkey (the &quot;Humenta&quot;), or the presiding priest on horseback, is brought to the local church in a morning procession. Congregants line the route, waving &quot;palaspás&quot; (ornately woven palm branches) and spreading &quot;tapis&quot; (heirloom &quot;aprons&quot; made for this ritual) in imitation of the excited Jerusalemites. At the church parvise, a house, or the town plaza, children dressed as angels scatter flowers as they sing the day&#x27;s antiphon &quot;Hosanna filio David&quot; in the vernacular and to traditional tunes. The first Mass of the day then follows.

Once blessed, the &quot;palaspás&quot; are brought home and placed on altars, doorways, and windows. The Church teaches that this is a sign of welcoming Christ into the home, but folk belief holds that the blessed &quot;palaspás&quot; are apotropaic, deterring evil spirits, lightning, and fires. Another folk custom is to feed pieces of blessed &quot;palaspás&quot; to roosters used in &quot;sabong&quot; (cockfighting); this was strongly discouraged by the Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle. In other provinces, the flowers strewn by the angels during the procession are added to the rice seeds being planted, in the belief that these will ensure a bountiful harvest.

===Poland===

Many Polish towns and villages (the best known are Lipnica Murowana in Lesser Poland and Łyse in Mazovia) organize artificial palm competitions. The biggest of those reach above in length; for example, the highest palm in 2008 was .

===Romania and Moldova===
In Romania and Moldova, Palm Sunday is known as &quot;Duminica Floriilor&quot; or simply &quot;Florii&quot;, translating &quot;Flowers&#x27; Sunday&quot;. This name has its roots in a pre-Christian fertility festival, where flowers played a prominent role.

===Spain===
In Spain, there is a tradition at the Palmeral of Elche (Europe&#x27;s largest palm grove) in which local people cover palm leaves from the sun to allow them to whiten, and then they tie and braid them into intricate shapes.
A Spanish rhyming proverb states: &quot;Domingo de Ramos, quien no estrena algo, se le caen las manos&quot; (&quot;On Palm Sunday, the hands drop off of those who fail to wear something new&quot;). On Palm Sunday, it is customary to don new clothing or shoes.

===Syria===
In Syria, it is popular for children to dress up as Easter witches and go door to door in neighborhoods for coins and candy.

===Wales===

In southern Wales and nearby portions of England, &#x27;Sul y Blodau&#x27; or &#x27;Flowering Sunday&#x27; is a grave decoration tradition commonly observed on Palm Sunday, although historically Flowering Sunday grave decoration was also observed on other days as well. Today, the names Palm Sunday and Flowering Sunday are used interchangeably in those regions. In 1829, Thomas Wallace of Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire published a poem which contains the first known reference to the custom being practiced only on Palm Sunday.

Welsh cemetery cleaning and decoration traditions may have begun as an Easter celebration before becoming more commonly associated with Palm Sunday. As early as 1786, cleaning and flower decorations were attested by William Matthews during a tour of South Wales. Richard Warner attested in 1797 &quot;the ornamenting of the graves of the deceased with various plants and flowers, at certain seasons, by the surviving relatives&quot; and noted that Easter was the most popular time for this tradition. By 1803, Malkin&#x27;s observations in &quot;The Scenery, Antiquities, and Biography of South Wales from materials collected during two excursions in the year 1803&quot; reflect the shift away predominantly associating the custom with Easter.

<text>Preterism is a Christian eschatological view or belief that interprets some (partial preterism) or all (full preterism) prophecies of the Bible as events which have already been fulfilled in history. This school of thought interprets the Book of Daniel as referring to events that happened from the seventh century BC until the first century AD, while seeing the prophecies of the Book of Revelation, as well as Christ&#x27;s predictions within the Olivet Discourse, as events that happened in the first century AD. Preterism holds that Ancient Israel finds its continuation or fulfillment in the Christian church at the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.

The term &quot;preterism&quot; comes from the Latin , which is a prefix denoting that something is or . Adherents of preterism are known as preterists. Preterism teaches that either all (full preterism) or a majority (partial preterism) of the Olivet Discourse had come to pass by AD 70.

Historically, preterists and non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar (1554–1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy , published during the Counter-Reformation.

==History==

At the time of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar wrote a prominent preterist exposition of prophecy. Moses Stuart noted in 1845 that Alcasar&#x27;s preterist interpretation advantaged the Roman Catholic Church during its arguments with Protestants, and Kenneth Newport in an eschatological commentary in 2000 described preterism as a Catholic defense against the Protestant historicist view which identified the Roman Catholic Church as a persecuting apostasy.

Due to resistance from Protestant historicists, the preterist view was slow to gain acceptance outside the Roman Catholic Church. Among Protestants preterism was first accepted by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645), a Dutch Protestant eager to establish common ground between Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church. His first attempt to do this in his &quot;Commentary on Certain Texts Which Deal with Antichrist&quot; (1640) arguing that the texts relating to Antichrist had had their fulfillment in the 1st century AD. Protestants did not welcome these views but Grotius remained undeterred and in his next work, &quot;Commentaries On The New Testament&quot; (1641–1650), he expanded his preterist views to include the Olivet Discourse and the Book of Revelation.

Preterism continued to struggle to gain credibility within other Protestant communities, especially in England. The English commentator Thomas Hayne claimed in 1645 that the prophecies of the Book of Daniel had all been fulfilled by the 1st century,
and Joseph Hall expressed the same conclusion concerning Daniel&#x27;s prophecies in 1650,
but neither of them applied a preterist approach to Revelation. However, the exposition of Grotius convinced the Englishman Henry Hammond (1605-1660). Hammond sympathized with Grotius&#x27; desire for unity among Christians, and found his preterist exposition useful to this end. Hammond wrote his own preterist exposition in 1653, borrowing extensively from Grotius. In his introduction to Revelation he claimed that others had independently arrived at similar conclusions as himself, though giving pride of place to Grotius. Hammond was Grotius&#x27; only notable Protestant convert, and despite his reputation and influence, Protestants overwhelmingly rejected Grotius&#x27; interpretation of Revelation, which gained no ground for at least 100 years.

By the end of the 18th century preterist exposition had gradually become more widespread. In 1730 the Protestant and Arian, Frenchman Firmin Abauzit wrote the first full preterist exposition, &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;Apocalypse&quot;. Abauzit worked in the then independent Republic of Geneva as a librarian. This was part of a growing development of more systematic preterist expositions of Revelation. Later, though, it appears that Abauzit recanted this approach after a critical examination by his English translator, Leonard Twells.

The earliest American full-preterist work, &quot;The Second Advent of the Lord Jesus Christ: A Past Event&quot;, was written in 1845 by Robert Townley. Townley later recanted this view.

==Schools of preterist thought==
The two principal schools of preterist thought are commonly called &quot;partial preterism&quot; and &quot;full preterism&quot;. Preterists disagree significantly about the exact meaning of the terms used to denote these divisions of preterist thought.

Some partial preterists prefer to call their position &quot;orthodox preterism&quot;, thus contrasting their agreement with the creeds of the Ecumenical Councils with what they perceive to be the full preterists&#x27; rejection of the same. This, in effect, makes full preterism unorthodox in the eyes of partial preterists and gives rise to the claim by some that full preterism is heretical. Partial preterism is also sometimes called &quot;orthodox preterism&quot;, &quot;classical preterism&quot; or &quot;moderate preterism&quot;.

On the other hand, some full preterists prefer to call their position &quot;consistent preterism&quot;, reflecting their extension of preterism to &quot;all&quot; biblical prophecy and thus claiming an inconsistency in the partial preterist hermeneutic.

Sub-variants of preterism include a form of partial preterism which places fulfillment of some eschatological passages in the first three centuries of the current era, culminating in the fall of Rome. In addition, certain statements from classical theological liberalism are easily mistaken for preterism, as they hold that the biblical record accurately reflects Jesus&#x27; and the Apostles&#x27; belief that all prophecy would be fulfilled within their generation. Theological liberalism generally regards these apocalyptic expectations as being errant or mistaken, however, so this view cannot accurately be considered a form of preterism.

===Partial preterism===
Partial preterism (often referred to as &quot;orthodox preterism&quot; or &quot;classical preterism&quot;) may hold that most eschatological prophecies, such as the destruction of Jerusalem, the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, and the advent of the Day of the Lord as a &quot;judgment-coming&quot; of Christ, were fulfilled either in AD 70 or during the persecution of Christians under the Emperor Nero.

Some partial preterists may believe that the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, and the advent of the Day of the Lord as a &quot;judgment-coming&quot; of Christ, were not historically fulfilled.

Some partial preterists identify &quot;Babylon the Great&quot; (Revelation 17–18) with the pagan Roman Empire, though some, such as N.T. Wright, Scott Hahn, Jimmy Akin, David Chilton, and Kenneth Gentry identify it with the city of Jerusalem. Most interpretations identify Nero as the Beast, while his mark is often interpreted as the stamped image of the emperor&#x27;s head on every coin of the Roman Empire: the stamp on the hand or in the mind of all, without which no one could buy or sell. Another partial preterist view regards first and second century events as recurrent patterns with Nero and Bar Kochba presented as archetypes. There is evidence that the epithet of Bar Kochba is a play on the Hebrew &quot;Shema&quot; with the value equating to the gematria value of 666. The pun on his patronymic equates to the variant reading 616. However, others believe the Book of Revelation was written after Nero&#x27;s suicide in AD 68, and identify the Beast with another emperor. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states that Revelation was &quot;written during the latter part of the reign of the Roman Emperor Domitian, probably in AD 95 or 96&quot;. Many Protestant scholars agree. The Second Coming, resurrection of the dead, and Final Judgment however, have not yet occurred in the partial preterist system.

===Full preterism===
Full preterism differs from partial preterism in that full preterists believe that the destruction of Jerusalem fulfilled &quot;all&quot; eschatological or &quot;end times&quot; events, including the resurrection of the dead and Jesus&#x27;s Second Coming, or &quot;Parousia&quot;, and the Final Judgment.

Other names of full preterism include:
* &quot;preterism&quot; (because the term itself means &quot;past&quot;)
* &quot;consistent preterism&quot;
* &quot;true preterism&quot;
* &quot;hyper-preterism&quot; (a pejorative term used by opponents of preterists)
* &quot;pantelism&quot;. (The term &quot;pantelism&quot; comes from two Greek roots: παν (&quot;pan&quot;), &quot;everything&quot;, and τελ- (&quot;tel-&quot;), referring to completion).
* &quot;Covenant Eschatology&quot;
* &quot;Fulfilled Eschatology&quot;

Full preterists argue that a literal reading of Matthew 16:28 (where Jesus tells the disciples that some of them will not taste death until they see him coming in his kingdom) places the second coming in the first century. This precludes a physical second coming of Christ. Instead, the second coming is symbolic of a &quot;judgment&quot; against Jerusalem, said to have taken place with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. For this reason, those who oppose the notion also call full preterism &quot;the AD 70 doctrine&quot;, since the whole eschatology is hinged on this one event. R. C. Sproul said of full preterist Max R. King, &quot;for this schema to work, the traditional idea of resurrection must be replaced with a metaphorical idea of resurrection&quot;. Detractors of full preterism often refer to the school as &quot;hyper-preterism&quot;.

In recent years full preterism has divided into sub-groups. An important offshoot that differs markedly from the theology of Max King is the Individual Body View (IBV) of full preterism. The term refers to a belief in a rapture of individuals that occurred in AD 66 (or AD 70), an event that first involved an experiential change into spiritual bodies. This is counter to the Max King variant of full preterism, the Corporate Body View (CBV), which Edward E. Stevens, debating against that view, defines as &quot;a spiritual-only change of status for a collective body, and that it had absolutely nothing to do with the resurrection of individual disembodied souls out of Hades to receive their new immortal bodies and go to heaven where their fellowship with God was eternally restored.&quot;

==Influences within Christian thought==

Partial preterism is generally considered to be a historic orthodox interpretation as it affirms all eschatological points of the ecumenical Creeds of the Church. Still, partial preterism is not the majority view among American denominations founded after 1500 and meets with significant vocal opposition, especially by those denominations which espouse dispensationalism. Additionally, dispensationalists are concerned that partial preterism logically leads to an acceptance of full preterism, a concern which is denied by partial preterists.

Full preterism is sometimes viewed as heretical, based upon the historic creeds of the church (which would exclude this view), and also from biblical passages that condemn a past view of the resurrection or the denial of a physical resurrection or transformation of the body — doctrines which most Christians believe to be essential to the faith. Critics of full preterism point to Paul the Apostle&#x27;s condemnation of the doctrine of Hymenaeus and Philetus, which they regard as analogous to full preterism. Adherents of full preterism, however, dispute this assertion by pointing out that Paul&#x27;s condemnation was written during a time in which (their idea of) the resurrection was still in the future (i.e., pre-AD 70). Their critics assert that if the Resurrection has not yet happened, then the condemnation would still apply.

==Interpretation of the Book of Revelation==
Preterism holds that the contents of Revelation constitute a prophecy of events that were fulfilled in the first century. Preterists believe that the dating of the book of Revelation is of vital importance and that it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. Preterism was first expounded by the Jesuit Luis de Alcasar during the Counter-Reformation. The preterist view served to bolster the Catholic Church&#x27;s position against attacks by Protestants, who identified the Pope with the Antichrist.

==Interpretation of the Great Tribulation==

In the preterist view, the Tribulation took place in the past when Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70 during the end stages of the First Jewish–Roman War, and it affected only the Jewish people rather than all mankind.

Christian preterists believe that the Tribulation was a divine judgment visited upon the Jews for their sins, including rejection of Jesus as the promised Messiah. It occurred entirely in the past, around 70 AD when the armed forces of the Roman Empire destroyed Jerusalem and its temple.

A preterist discussion of the Tribulation has its focus on the Gospels, in particular the prophetic passages in Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, and the Olivet Discourse, rather than on the Book of Revelation. Most preterists apply much of the symbolism in Revelation to Rome, the Caesars, and their persecution of Christians, rather than to the Tribulation upon the Jews.

Jesus&#x27;s warning in Matthew 24:34 that &quot;this generation shall not pass until all these things be fulfilled&quot; is tied back to his similar warning to the scribes and the Pharisees that their judgment would &quot;come upon this generation&quot;, that is, during the first century rather than at a future time long after the scribes and Pharisees had died. The destruction in AD 70 occurred within a 40-year biblical generation from the time when Jesus gave that discourse. Preterism maintains that the judgment on the Jewish nation was executed by the Roman legions, &quot;the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet.&quot; This can also be found in Luke 21:20.

Since Matthew 24 begins with Jesus visiting the Jerusalem Temple and pronouncing that &quot;there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down&quot; (vs. 3), preterists see nothing in scripture to indicate that another Jewish temple will ever be built. The prophecies were all fulfilled against the temple of that time, which was subsequently destroyed within that generation.

==Key verses==




This predicted event has been variously interpreted as referring to:
# Jesus&#x27; transfiguration
# the resurrection
# the coming of the Spirit at Pentecost
# the spread of the kingdom through the preaching of the early church
# the destruction of the Temple and of Jerusalem in AD 70
# the second coming and final establishment of the kingdom
# the coming of Jesus Christ in vision to the apostle John in revelation.

Many preterists find view 6 unacceptable because it implies a mistake on the part of Jesus about the timing of his return. Many preterists believe the immediate context seems to indicate the first view, the transfiguration, which immediately follows. This view seems to satisfy that &quot;some&quot; disciples would see the glory of the Son of Man, but it does not satisfy the statement that &quot;he will repay every man for what he has done&quot;. The same situation occurs with views 2 through 4. Only view 5 (the judgement on Jerusalem in AD 70) appears to satisfy both conditions, reinforced with Revelation 2:23, 20:12 and 22:12, as a preterist would argue.

<doc id="24182" wikidata="Q3067154" url="?curid=24182" title="Per Hasselberg">
<text>Per Hasselberg (1 January 1850 – 25 July 1894), until 1870 &quot;Karl Petter Åkesson&quot;, was a Swedish sculptor. He has received critical acclaim mainly for his delicate and allegorical nudes, copies of which are widely distributed in public places and private homes in Sweden.

== Biography ==
Hasselberg was born 1 January 1850 in the small village Hasselstad near Ronneby in the province of Blekinge in the south of Sweden.

He grew up as the sixth child in a poor family. His very religious father, Åke Andersson, was a small farmer, a construction worker for bridges, and a cabinet-maker.

Hasselberg finished school at the age of twelve and became a carpenter apprentice in Karlshamn, where he even got a training as ornamental sculptor. After this, he moved to Stockholm in 1869, where he took several jobs as ornamental sculptor and visited evening and weekend courses at craft school.

In 1876, he got a scholarship from the Swedish National Board of Trade to travel to Paris, where he was accepted at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts the following year. There, he studied for three years under the sculptor and academy professor François Jouffroy. He then worked as sculptor in Paris until 1890, when he returned to Stockholm to open a studio in Östermalm.

In 1885, he was taken in at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg because of aortic dissection. He recovered, but doctors told him he had only a few years to live.

In 1894, his condition became serious again and he died 25 July in Stockholm at the hospital Sophiahemmet.

At the time of his death, he had no debts and a book of orders of a total sum of about 30.000 Swedish Crowns, which is equivalent to about 250.000 US-Dollar in 2015. His will was that the large marble blocks, which were being shipped from Italy and which were destined for large copies of &quot;Farfadern&quot; and &quot;Näckrosen&quot;, should be handed over to his sculptor colleague Christian Eriksson to do the assignment, which he also did.

== Major works ==
=== Snöklockan (Snowdrop, Paris 1881) ===

The original French name was &quot;La Perce-Neige&quot; (snow breaker) and it was first made in plaster cast for the 1881 Salon in Paris. Hasselberg&#x27;s model was a 16-year-old Italian. At her feet shows a small snowdrop, and the statue was understood as a symbol of new life breaking through the snow in springtime.

&quot;Snöklocka&quot; actually is not the ordinary Swedish name for the flower, which is &quot;snödroppe&quot;. It is a rare poetic name that historically was derived from a literal translation of the ordinary German name &quot;Schneeglöckchen&quot; (little snowbell). Thus a musical connotation was added by using it for the statue, and her right hand is close to her right ear.

The Snowdrop was not only accepted at the 1881 Salon, but even received an honorable mention, which no other Swedish work achieved that year. This success meant that Hasselberg suddenly was a famous artist in Sweden, where the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm soon ordered a copy in marble. It was finished in 1883 and received a gold medal at the Salon in Paris the same year. In 1885, also the Gothenburg Museum of Art had its marble copy. The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen/Denmark has one since 1889. Copies in bronze at public places are on Maria Square (Mariatorget)/Stockholm, in Falun, Ronneby, and near Sunne (Rottneros park).

1,700 pieces in parian ware (marble imitation) with a height of 50 cm and 625 pieces in 60 cm were produced in 1887-1926 by Gustavsberg porcelain.

The more recent reception of the Snowdrop in Sweden in the 21st century presented a new additive in the form of certain feminist views. One author of the catalogue of the large Hasselberg retrospective in Stockholm 2010 claimed that the closed eyes of the statue were not a sign of just waking up but rather showed that Hasselberg had &quot;“forced”&quot; the &quot;“body of the young woman”&quot; into a &quot;“state of unconsciousness”&quot;.

=== Farfadern (Father’s Father, Paris 1886) ===
The original French name was &quot;L&#x27;Aiëul&quot; (The Grandfather) and it was first made in plaster cast 1886 in Paris and exhibited at the Palais de l&#x27;Industrie that year. The basic idea was to show nature&#x27;s cycle containing the poles of young and old. It had its origin during Hasselberg&#x27;s long treatment at university hospital in Gothenburg in 1885, after which he learned that he had only a few more years to live. He knew, therefore, that the planned work might be his last one and thus his artistic testament.

The idea became more definitive after he had seen an old man sitting with a naked sleeping boy on his knees on a boulevard in Paris. When it was finished, his artist friends were enthusiastic about it, but the exhibition in Paris was no success.

The original copies in plaster cast by Hasselberg are lost, but a copy in bronze was placed near the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm 1896, and a copy in marble also from 1896 is today in the Gothenburg Museum of Art.

=== Grodan (Frog, Paris 1889) ===
&quot;Grodan&quot; (French &quot;La Grenouille&quot;, English &quot;The Frog&quot;) was made in plaster cast for the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris and exhibited there. There is a frog between the knees of a girl. Hasselberg reported that the concept of this piece had spontaneously come up when a model in his studio during a break sat on the floor in this position to rest.

The French word &quot;grenouille&quot; does not only mean &quot;frog&quot; but in slang also for &quot;street girl&quot;. It is unknown if Hasselberg was aware of this second meaning, but it was commented that by this statue, he possibly wanted to express his time&#x27;s view of a tension between the noble and the less noble sides of youth.

Several copies in bronze are in public parks in Sweden and marble copies in museums. The most recent bronze copy from 2009 in Ulricehamn replaced a stolen copy from the 1940s. 230 pieces in parian ware (marble imitation) with a height of 38 cm and 241 pieces in 26 cm were produced in 1906-1926 by Gustavsberg porcelain.

=== Näckrosen (Water Lily, Stockholm 1892) ===
&quot;Näckrosen&quot; was first exhibited in plaster cast at the Danish art society Kunstforeningen in Copenhagen 1892 and later that year in Gothenburg/Sweden. In 1893, it was exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

The statue shows a young woman lying on her back, floating on a large water lily leaf, surrounded by water lilies, and heads of old men symbolizing mermen. The first part of the flower&#x27;s name &quot;näck&quot; in Scandinavia means water spirit. So a literal translation of &quot;Näckrosen&quot; would be &quot;Water Spirit Rose&quot;. While this association is usually not present when talking about the flower, Hasselberg here made it unavoidable by the heads of old men in the water. On the backside of the statue, there is a tree stump that holds a chain with a large padlock, apparently indicating that the large water lily leaf was put on chain.

<text>Parma is a village in Jackson County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 769 at the 2010 census. The village is divided into three sections with boundaries in Parma Township and Sandstone Charter Township.

== History ==
Parma was originally located a few miles east of its current location along the Michigan Central Railroad at a stop known as Gidley&#x27;s Station. When it was moved to its current location, it was known as Groveland, after a noticeable grove of trees within the town. Part of this grove still exists where Grove St. curves around a copse of trees near its intersection with Westlawn St. in the eastern half of Parma. When the village was incorporated in 1847, its name was changed to Parma. In the early 1900s Parma was also known as Cracker Hill. A book was published called Cracker Hill Crumbs in 1976.

== Culture and community ==
Parma has two United Methodist churches: The North Parma United Methodist Church and the Parma United Methodist Church. North Parma serves the farming congregation to the north and the &quot;Plain Parma&quot; church serves the village congregation. North Parma is a white clapboard country church and &quot;Plain Parma&quot; is an orange brick church. Both churches were served by the same minister until the fall of 2005. Currently the minister assigned to the charge serves only North Parma. The two churches remained formally connected to a certain degree until 2006, when the charge was dissolved. The Parma UMC is now formally connected to the Trinity UMC in Jackson. As of 2007, North Parma remains independent, though this is not necessarily considered to be a permanent arrangement.

Spring Life Church, formerly Howe Wesleyan Church, was part of the Methodist branch in the area and was started in 1908. In October 1912, it united with the Wesleyan Methodist church and was connected with the Rives Circuit made up of Rives, Robinson and Howe schools. In 1968 it became a Wesleyan Church with the merger of the Wesleyan Methodist and Pilgrim Holiness denominations. In April 2007, the congregation voted to change its name to Spring Life Church to re-emphasize the mission of the church which is to &quot;Cultivate, Plant, and Grow&quot;.

Other country churches in the community are Calvary Apostolic Church and Parma Baptist Church.

===Nearby communities===
To the southeast is the community of Spring Arbor; northwest is the village of Springport; to the east is the city of Jackson and to the west is the city of Albion and beyond the cities of Marshall and Battle Creek, all in Calhoun County.

Parma is on Old US 12, which today is known as Michigan Avenue when it runs through Parma (and most of Southern Michigan). Today, the village has two exits on I-94, which replaced US 12 as the primary route from Detroit to Chicago when the Interstate highway system was built. The segment of I-94 that services Parma was originally part of the US 12 bypass, a freeway built prior to the Interstate system that allowed motorists to bypass Jackson and Parma. This is the oldest segment of I-94, beginning at Sargent Road in East Jackson and running west to Michigan Avenue outside of Parma. This older segment of the road is identifiable by its median, which is significantly narrower than the rest of I-94.

Parma is also located on the Michigan Central Railroad, which was historically the most significant and is currently the only railway from Detroit to Chicago. At one time Parma had a regular train station, but service was discontinued in 1954, and the old train station building was torn down.

An interurban trolley formerly ran between Parma and Jackson as well. On June 23, 1923, the train derailed and slammed into the jail, which was destroyed and never rebuilt. The scene, which is still remembered by some older residents, was commemorated in 1999 as part of the elaborate &quot;History of Parma&quot; section of the playground at Groner Park. The interurban station serves as the current library.

==Education==
The Parma Union School District served the village and surrounding rural areas until 1957, when it consolidated with other school districts to form the Western School District. High school students from Parma therefore currently attend Western High School, which Parma shares with nearby Spring Arbor and the western edge of Jackson. The high school, along with the junior high and district administration, are located east of the village of Parma. One of the district&#x27;s three elementaries, Parma Elementary School, is located on the south side of the village, near the site of the demolished Parma High School. The other two elementary schools are in the Spring Arbor area. When Parma Elementary was first built (in 1952), the Kindergarten class met in the Masonic Temple in Parma until the school was ready to open. The school opened mid year so the Kindergarten class of 1952 also attended the first half of First Grade in the Masonic Temple.

Spring Arbor University is located about away, while Albion College is distant. Parma is also served by Jackson College.

==Industry and commerce==
Parma is historically and traditionally an agricultural community, and most of the surrounding area remains used for that purpose. During the last 20 years, the farming atmosphere has been eroded by hints of urban sprawl from the Jackson area, as well as a general decline in the viability of family farming.

There are a handful of small manufacturing concerns in the area, located mostly along the Michigan Avenue corridor. The community scored quite a coup In the early 1990s, Michigan Automotive Compressors, Inc., an auto parts plant run by a Japanese company, was constructed here.

<text>Infant baptism (or paedobaptism) is the practice of baptizing infants or young children. Infant baptism is also called christening by some faith traditions.

Most Christians belong to denominations that practice infant baptism. Branches of Christianity that practice infant baptism include Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Oriental Orthodoxy. Among Protestants, several denominations practice infant baptism including Anglicans, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Methodists, Nazarenes, Moravians, and United Protestants.

Christians who do not practice infant baptism are called credobaptists.

== Ceremony ==
The exact details of the baptismal ceremony vary among Christian denominations. Many follow a prepared ceremony, called a rite or liturgy. In a typical ceremony, parents or godparents bring their child to their congregation&#x27;s priest or minister. The rite used would be the same as that denomination&#x27;s rite for adults, i.e., by pouring holy water (affusion) or by sprinkling water (aspersion). Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic traditions practice total immersion and baptize babies in a font, and this practice is also the first method listed in the baptismal ritual of Latin Rite Catholics, although pouring is the standard practice within the Latin branch of Catholicism. Catholic and Orthodox churches that do this do not sprinkle. At the moment of baptism, the minister utters the words &quot;I baptize you (or, &quot;The servant of God (name) is baptized&quot;) in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&quot; (see Matthew 28:19).

Although it is not required, many parents and godparents choose to dress the baby in a white gown called a christening gown for the baptism ceremony. Christening gowns often become treasured keepsakes that are used by many other children in the family and handed down from generation to generation. Traditionally, this gown is white or slightly off white and made with much lace, trim and intricate detail. In the past, a gown was used for both boys and girls; in the present day it has become more common to dress children in a baptismal outfit. Also normally made of white fabric, the outfit consists of a romper with a vest or other accessories. These clothes are often kept as a memento after the ceremony.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
Scholars disagree on the date when infant baptism was first practiced. Some believe that 1st-century Christians did not practice it, noting the lack of any explicit evidence of infant baptism. Others, noting the lack of any explicit evidence of exclusion of infant baptism, believe that they did, understanding biblical references to individuals &quot;and [her] household&quot; being baptized as including young children.

The earliest extrabiblical directions for baptism, which occur in the Didache (c. 100), are taken to be about baptism of adults, since they require fasting by the person to be baptized. However, inscriptions dating back to the 2nd century which refer to young children as &quot;children of God&quot; may indicate that Christians customarily baptized infants too. The earliest reference to infant baptism was by Irenaeus (c. 130–202) in his work &quot;Against Heresies&quot;. Due to its reference to Eleutherus as the current bishop of Rome, the work is usually dated . Irenaeus speaks of children being &quot;born again to God.&quot; Three passages by Origen (185–c. 254) mention infant baptism as traditional and customary. Also Augustine of Hippo referred the baptism of children as an apostolic tradition.

While Tertullian writing c. 198–203 advises the postponement of baptism of little children and the unmarried, he mentions that it was customary to baptize infants, with sponsors speaking on their behalf. The Apostolic Tradition, sometimes attributed to Hippolytus of Rome (died 235), describes how to perform the ceremony of baptism; it states that children were baptized first, and if any of them could not answer for themselves, their parents or someone else from their family was to answer for them.

From at least the 3rd century onward Christians baptized infants as standard practice, although some preferred to postpone baptism until late in life so as to ensure forgiveness for all their preceding sins.

== Middle Ages ==
High infant mortality contributed greatly to the spread of paedobaptism from the 6th century onwards, which was often practiced as a baptism in extremis (hence the use of the respite sanctuary). Infant baptism became widespread with the Carolingian and then Gregorian reforms of the 9th century and then the 11th-12th centuries. 

== Theology ==

=== Agreements among infant baptizers ===
Based on their understanding of New Testament passages such as Colossians 2:11–12, Christians who baptize infants believe that infant baptism is the New Testament counterpart to the Old Testament circumcision. In the Old Testament, all male converts to Judaism, male infants born to Jewish parents, and male servants were circumcised as ceremony of initiation into the Jewish community. Christians who baptize infants believe that baptism has replaced Old Testament circumcision and is the religious ceremony of initiation into the Christian community.

During the medieval and Reformation eras, infant baptism was seen as a way to incorporate newborn babies into the secular community as well as inducting them into the Christian faith. Due to high rates of infant mortality, it is important to note that canon law denied unbaptized infants a Christian burial in sacred ground.

=== Teachings of Christian denominations practicing infant baptism ===

Different Christian denominations who practice infant baptism attach different meanings to the sacrament and explain its efficacy in different ways.

==== Catholic Church ====
The Catholic Church considers baptism, even for an infant, so important that &quot;parents are obliged to see that their infants are baptized within the first few weeks&quot; and, &quot;if the infant is in danger of death, it is to be baptized without any delay.&quot; It declares: &quot;The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole &#x27;households&#x27; received baptism, infants may also have been baptized&quot;. It notes that &quot;when the first direct evidence of infant Baptism appears in the second century, it is never presented as an innovation&quot;, that 2nd-century Irenaeus treated baptism of infants as a matter of course, and that, &quot;at a Synod of African Bishops, St. Cyprian stated that &#x27;God&#x27;s mercy and grace should not be refused to anyone born&#x27;, and the Synod, recalling that &#x27;all human beings&#x27; are &#x27;equal&#x27;, whatever be &#x27;their size or age&#x27;, declared it lawful to baptize children &#x27;by the second or third day after their birth&#x27;&quot;. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many infants were baptized on the day of their birth as in the cases of Francoise-Athenais, Marquise de Montespan, Jeanne Du Barry and Marie Anne de Cupis de Camargo. Infant baptism is seen as showing very clearly that salvation is an unmerited favor from God, not the fruit of human effort. &quot;Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the children of God, to which all men are called ... The Church and the parents would deny a child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism shortly after birth&quot;.

The church has no dogmatic official teaching regarding the fate of infants who die without baptism, and theologians of the church hold various views (in particular, many have asserted that they go to Limbo). &quot;The Church entrusts these infants to the mercy of God.&quot;

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued on 20 October 1980 an instruction on infant baptism, whose purpose was &quot;to recall the principal points of doctrine in this field which justify the Church&#x27;s constant practice down the centuries and demonstrate its permanent value in spite of the difficulties raised today&quot;. The document then indicated some general guidelines for pastoral action.

The document recalled that infant baptism has long been considered of apostolic origin, and that the first direct evidence of its practice, dating from the 2nd century, does not present it as an innovation. It then responded to objections that baptism should follow faith, that the person baptized should consciously receive the grace of the sacrament, that the person should freely accept baptism, that infant baptism is unsuitable in a society marked by instability of values and conflicts of ideas, and that the practice is inimical to a missionary outlook on the part of the church.

The instruction then gave guidelines for pastoral practice, based on two principles. The major principle is that baptism, as the sign and means of God&#x27;s love that precedes any action on our part and that frees from original sin and communicates divine life, must not be delayed. The subordinate principle is that assurances must be given that the gift thus granted can grow by authentic education in the faith and Christian life. If these assurances are not really serious, there can be grounds for delaying baptism. If they are certainly absent, the sacrament should even be refused.

Accordingly, the rules for involvement on the part of practicing Christian parents must be supplemented with other considerations in the case of &quot;families with little faith or non-Christian families&quot;. If these request that a child of theirs be baptized, there must be assurances that the child will be given the benefit of the Christian upbringing required by the sacrament. Examples of such assurances are &quot;the choice of godparents who will take sincere care of the child, or the support of the community&quot;. If there is satisfactory assurance, i.e., &quot;any pledge giving a well-founded hope for the Christian upbringing of the children&quot;, then &quot;the priest cannot refuse to celebrate the sacrament without delay, as in the case of children of Christian families&quot;. If there is insufficient assurance, &quot;it will be prudent to delay baptism&quot;, while keeping contact with the parents in the hope of securing the required conditions for celebrating the sacrament. As a last resort, enrollment of the child in a course of catechetical instruction on reaching school age can be offered in lieu of immediate celebration of baptism. The possibility of delaying infant baptism in the case of non practicing or non believing parents raises a number of questions. How can we discern that there are guarantees of an authentic Christian education? Can a priest propose an alternative celebration in the case where baptism is to be delayed? In some German speaking countries, bishops have opened the door to a &quot;two step baptism&quot;, i.e. two celebrations separated by a time of evangelization of the parents. In this case, the rite of baptism itself is to be performed in the second celebration, when parents are supposed to have enough maturity to raise the child in the Catholic faith.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: &quot;Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate&quot;. In the Roman Rite, the wording of the prayer of exorcism is: &quot;Almighty and ever-living God, you sent your only Son into the world to cast out the power of Satan, spirit of evil, to rescue man from the kingdom of darkness and bring him into the splendour of your kingdom of light. We pray for this child: set him (her) free from original sin, make him (her) a temple of your glory, and send your Holy Spirit to dwell with him (her). Through Christ our Lord.&quot;

==== Eastern Churches ====

The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East also insist on the need to have infants baptized as soon as is practicable after birth. Similar to the Catholic Church, they teach that baptism is not merely a symbol but actually conveys grace. Baptism is a sacrament because it is an &quot;instrument&quot; instituted by Jesus Christ to impart grace to its recipients. Infants are traditionally baptized on the eighth day, recalling the biblical injunction to circumcise on the eighth day. However, this is not mandatory. In many of these churches, the Sacred Mystery of Chrismation (Confirmation) is administered by the priest immediately after baptism. Holy Communion, in the form of consecrated wine and bread, is also given to infants after they are baptized.

==== Lutheran Churches ====
Lutherans practice infant baptism because they believe that God mandates it through the instruction of Jesus Christ, &quot;Go and &quot;make disciples of all nations&quot;, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot;, in which Jesus does not set any age limit:

They also cite other biblical passages such as Mark 10:13-15, Mark 16:16, John 3:3-7 and Acts 2:38-39 in support of their position. For example, in the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; Peter&#x27;s teachings on Pentecost included children in the promise of baptism, &quot;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for &quot;you and your children&quot;&quot;.

For them baptism is a &quot;means of grace&quot; through which God creates and strengthens &quot;saving faith&quot; as the &quot;washing of regeneration&quot; in which people are reborn (John 3:3–7): &quot;baptismal regeneration&quot;. Since the creation of faith is exclusively God&#x27;s work, it does not depend on the actions of the one baptized, whether infant or adult. Even though baptized infants cannot articulate that faith, Lutherans believe that it is present all the same. Because it is faith alone that receives these divine gifts, Lutherans confess that baptism &quot;works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare&quot;. In the special section on infant baptism in his Large Catechism Luther argues that infant baptism is God-pleasing because persons so baptized were reborn and sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

==== Methodist Churches ====
In the Methodist Churches, baptism is a sacrament of initiation into the visible church. Wesleyan covenant theology further teaches that baptism is a sign and a seal of the covenant of grace:
Infant baptism, in Methodism, is celebrated as &quot;an acceptance of the prevenient grace of God and as a confession on the part of the church of its responsibility for children in general and for every child in particular.&quot; Methodists teach that people receive justifying grace, which is integral to salvation, after they repent and personally accept Jesus as Savior. Many Methodist denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church and Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, practice infant baptism for families who desire it for their children, but provide a rite for child dedication for those who have a preference for credobaptism only after their child has made a personal acceptance of Jesus as his/her savior.

==== Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Churches ====

Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians believe that baptism, whether of infants or adults, is a &quot;sign and seal of the covenant of grace&quot;, and that baptism admits the party baptized into the visible church. Being a member of the visible church does not guarantee salvation; though it does provide the child with many benefits, including that of one&#x27;s particular congregation consenting to assist in the raising of that child in &quot;the way he should go, (so that) when he is old he will not turn from it&quot;. Elect infants (those predestined for salvation) who die in infancy are by faith considered regenerate on the basis of God&#x27;s covenant promises in the covenant of grace.

Presbyterian, Congregational and many Reformed Christians see infant baptism as the New Testament form of circumcision in the Jewish covenant. Circumcision did not create faith in the 8-day-old Jewish boy. It merely marked him as a member of God&#x27;s covenant people Israel. Likewise, baptism does not create faith; it is a sign of membership in the visible covenant community.

Presbyterian, Congregational and Reformed Christians consider children of professing Christians to be members of the visible church (the covenant community). They also consider them to be full members of the local congregation where their parents are members and members of the universal church (the set of all true believers who make up the invisible church) unless and until they prove otherwise. Baptism is the mark of membership in the covenant of grace and in the universal church, although regeneration is not inseparably connected with baptism.

===Contrasts between infant and adult baptism===
Infant baptism can be contrasted with what is called &quot;believer&#x27;s baptism&quot; (or credobaptism, from the Latin word &quot;credo&quot; meaning &quot;I believe&quot;), which is the religious practice of baptizing only individuals who personally confess faith in Jesus, therefore excluding underage children.

Pedobaptism and credobaptism are positions which bubble up from theological views at a more fundamental level of one&#x27;s theological system.
* If baptism is a sign that a person is a member of God&#x27;s covenant community, and if the children of believers are members of that community, it follows that the children of believers should receive the sign that they are members of God&#x27;s covenant community by being baptized, as an infant is entitled to a passport that indicates the child as a member of a particular country.
* Believers and the children of believers become members of God&#x27;s covenant community (or church) through baptism.
* It is believed by some Christians that in the heart of a baptized child, faith as a gift or grace from God, as distinct from an act by the person, is made present.
* It is believed by some Christians that baptism is not merely a symbol and that it has a real effect, conveying divine grace.

=== Arguments for infant baptism ===

Christians who practice infant baptism do not completely agree on the reasons for doing so, and offer different reasons in support of the practice. Among the arguments made in support of the practice are:

* Analogy with circumcision: Some Christians posit an analogy of baptism to circumcision, pointing to children, since the historic Israelite application of circumcision was to infants, not to adult converts, of which there were few. Covenant theology identifies baptism less as a statement of faith than as an assumption of identity; that is to say that infant baptism is a sign of covenantal inclusion. Assuming that what God instituted in the Old Testament continues unless the New Testament specifically abrogates it, including infants in the giving of the sign of the covenant must continue in the New Covenant. It is especially so if the practice is an important one.
* Jesus&#x27; affirmation: According to Luke 18:15-17, when parents brought their babies to Jesus, the disciples tried to prevent them from coming. Jesus becomes indignant and says, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&quot; This seems to confirm that infants can have a personal relationship with Jesus just as parents can have a personal relationship with their babies. More importantly, Jesus confirms that babies of believers belong to the kingdom of God. In other words, babies of believers are counted as believers, not unbelievers. Therefore, Jesus specifically instructs not to hinder them.
* Peter&#x27;s speech: According to the Book of Acts, &quot;Peter replied, &#x27;Repent and be baptized, &quot;every one of you&quot;, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you &quot;and your children&quot; and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.&#x27;&quot; (Acts 2:38–39, NIV–UK, emphasis added) Some churches within The United Methodist Church argue that the phrase &quot;every one of you&quot; recalls the use of the same phrase in Deuteronomy 29:10–12, where there is explicit mention of the &quot;little ones&quot; present; and it takes the phrase &quot;and your children&quot; to mean that Peter included children in the covenant community.
* Early Christian practice: Several early Church Fathers seem to have taught that infant baptism is proper; Origen states that the practice of baptizing infants is of apostolic origin.

=== Arguments against infant baptism ===
* Infants cannot repent or believe: Baptism in Scripture always has the prerequisite of repentance and faith, which are impossible for an infant.
* No scriptural instances: There are no explicit instances of infant baptism in the scripture

==== Denominations and religious groups opposed to infant baptism ====
Trinitarian Christian denominations that oppose infant baptism include the International Christian Church, all Baptist and Anabaptist traditions and denominations, Pentecostals, Assemblies of God and more.

Several nontrinitarian religious groups also oppose infant baptism, including Oneness Pentecostals, Christadelphians, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, United Church of God, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

B.R. White describes the motivations behind persecution of the Anabaptists during the Reformation as follows:

Other Christians saw the baptism of each new-born baby into the secular parish community and close links between church and state as the divinely-ordained means of holding society together. Hence many other Christians saw the Anabaptists as subversive of all order. Consequently, from the earliest days, they were sharply persecuted and leaders were soon executed.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) completely rejects infant baptism. Little children are considered both born without sin and incapable of committing sin. They have no need of baptism until age eight, when they can begin to learn to discern right from wrong, and are thus accountable to God for their own actions. However, the LDS Church performs a non-saving ordinance to name and bless children, customarily performed on infants.

== Confirmation ==

For Catholic, Methodist Christians, and Weslian Confirmation &quot;strengthens&quot; (the original meaning of the word &quot;confirm&quot;) the grace of Baptism, by conferring an increase and deepening of that grace.

In Eastern Christianity, including the Eastern Catholic Churches, the sacrament of Confirmation is conferred immediately after baptism, and there is no renewal of baptismal promises. In the Latin Church and its Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church, the sacrament is to be conferred at about the age of discretion (generally taken to be about 7), unless the Episcopal Conference has decided on a different age, or there is danger of death or, in the judgment of the minister, a grave reason suggests otherwise (canon 891 of the Code of Canon Law). The renewal of baptismal promises by those receiving the sacrament in the Western Catholic Church is incidental to the rite and not essentially different from the solemn renewal of their baptismal promises that is asked of all members of this church each year at the Easter Vigil service. Only in French-speaking countries has there been a development of ceremonies, quite distinct from the sacrament of Confirmation, for young Catholics to profess their faith publicly, in line with their age.

Within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, confirmation or &quot;the laying on of hands&quot; is an essential part of the baptismal ordinance, and to receive baptism without confirmation is to leave the ordinance incomplete. Confirmation is the conferring of the gift of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. To confirm means to &quot;make more sure&quot; and the ordinance of confirmation stands as a witness of the individual becoming a member of the LDS Church and not just an acceptance of Jesus.

== Opposition to infant baptism ==
According to Catholic legal professor and former Irish president Mary McAleese, as outlined in her doctoral thesis, infant baptism amounts to &quot;enforced membership of the Catholic Church&quot;, which violates fundamental rights of children. These &quot;infant conscripts ... are held to lifelong obligations of obedience&quot; without their understanding or consent. &quot;Parents can guide and direct [their children] but they can&#x27;t impose, and what the church has failed to do is to recognize that there has to be a point at which our young people, as adults who have been baptized into the church and raised in the faith, have the chance to say &#x27;I validate this&#x27; or &#x27;I repudiate this&#x27;. You and I know, we live now in times where we have the right to freedom of conscience, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion, freedom of religion and freedom to change religion. The Catholic Church yet has to fully embrace that thinking.&quot;

=== Controversies ===
Baptisms have sometimes accidentally led to injuries, or deaths, such as drowning deaths, to babies. In Romania, this has served as an opportunity to revise practices.

== Yazidi baptism ==

In Yazidism, children are baptized at birth and circumcision is not required, but is practiced by some due to regional customs. The Yazidi baptism is called &quot;Mor kirin&quot; (literally: &#x27;to seal&#x27;). Traditionally, Yazidi children are baptized at birth with water from the &quot;Kaniya Sipî&quot; (&#x27;White Spring&#x27;) at Lalish. It involves pouring holy water from the spring on the child&#x27;s head three times.
