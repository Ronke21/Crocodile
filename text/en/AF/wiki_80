<text>A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force can be transformed by a connecting rod and crank into rotational force for work. The term &quot;steam engine&quot; is most commonly applied to reciprocating engines as just described, although some authorities have also referred to the steam turbine and devices such as Hero&#x27;s aeolipile as &quot;steam engines&quot;. The essential feature of steam engines is that they are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In general usage, the term &quot;steam engine&quot; can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.), such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine.

As noted, steam-driven devices such as the aeolipile were known in the first century AD, and there were a few other uses recorded in the 16th century. In 1606 Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented his invention of the first steam-powered water pump for draining mines. Thomas Savery is considered the inventor of the first commercially used steam powered device, a steam pump that used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. James Watt made a critical improvement in 1764, by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed. By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines replaced sails for ships on paddle steamers, and steam locomotives operated on the railways.

Reciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power until the early 20th century. The efficiency of stationary steam engine increased dramatically until about 1922. The highest Rankine Cycle Efficiency of 91% and combined thermal efficiency of 31% was demonstrated and published in 1921 and 1928. Advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines resulted in the gradual replacement of steam engines in commercial usage. Steam turbines replaced reciprocating engines in power generation, due to lower cost, higher operating speed, and higher efficiency. Note that small scale steam turbines are much less efficient than large ones.

, large reciprocating piston steam engines are still being manufactured in Germany.

== History ==
=== Early experiments ===

As noted, one recorded rudimentary steam-powered engine was the aeolipile described by Hero of Alexandria, a Hellenistic mathematician and engineer in Roman Egypt during the first century AD. In the following centuries, the few steam-powered engines known were, like the aeolipile, essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam.

A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in Ottoman Egypt in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in Italy in 1629. The Spanish inventor Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for 50 steam-powered inventions, including a water pump for draining inundated mines. Frenchman Denis Papin did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679, and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690.

=== Pumping engines ===
The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery. It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which raised water from below and then used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They had a very limited lift height and were prone to boiler explosions. Savery&#x27;s engine was used in mines, pumping stations and supplying water to water wheels powering textile machinery. One advantage of Savery&#x27;s engine was its low cost. Bento de Moura Portugal introduced an improvement of Savery&#x27;s construction &quot;to render it capable of working itself&quot;, as described by John Smeaton in the Philosophical Transactions published in 1751. It continued to be manufactured until the late 18th century. At least one engine was still known to be operating in 1820.

===Piston steam engines===

The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was the atmospheric engine, invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712. It improved on Savery&#x27;s steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen&#x27;s engine was relatively inefficient, and mostly used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths originally impractical using traditional means, and for providing reusable water for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable &quot;head&quot;. Water that passed over the wheel was pumped up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.
In 1780 James Pickard patented the use of a flywheel and crankshaft to provide rotative motion from an improved Newcomen engine.

In 1720, Jacob Leupold described a two-cylinder high-pressure steam engine. The invention was published in his major work &quot;Theatri Machinarum Hydraulicarum&quot;. The engine used two heavy pistons to provide motion to a water pump. Each piston was raised by the steam pressure and returned to its original position by gravity. The two pistons shared a common four-way rotary valve connected directly to a steam boiler.
The next major step occurred when James Watt developed (1763–1775) an improved version of Newcomen&#x27;s engine, with a separate condenser. Boulton and Watt&#x27;s early engines used half as much coal as John Smeaton&#x27;s improved version of Newcomen&#x27;s. Newcomen&#x27;s and Watt&#x27;s early engines were &quot;atmospheric&quot;. They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam, instead of the pressure of expanding steam. The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was atmospheric pressure.

Watt developed his engine further, modifying it to provide a rotary motion suitable for driving machinery. This enabled factories to be sited away from rivers, and accelerated the pace of the Industrial Revolution.

===High-pressure engines===
The meaning of high pressure, together with an actual value above ambient, depends on the era in which the term was used. For early use of the term Van Reimsdijk refers to steam being at a sufficiently high pressure that it could be exhausted to atmosphere without reliance on a vacuum to enable it to perform useful work. states that Watt&#x27;s condensing engines were known, at the time, as low pressure compared to high pressure, non-condensing engines of the same period.

Watt&#x27;s patent prevented others from making high pressure and compound engines. Shortly after Watt&#x27;s patent expired in 1800, Richard Trevithick and, separately, Oliver Evans in 1801 introduced engines using high-pressure steam; Trevithick obtained his high-pressure engine patent in 1802, and Evans had made several working models before then. These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.

The Cornish engine was developed by Trevithick and others in the 1810s. It was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively, then condensed the low-pressure steam, making it relatively efficient. The Cornish engine had irregular motion and torque through the cycle, limiting it mainly to pumping. Cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century.

=== Horizontal stationary engine ===
Early builders of stationary steam engines considered that horizontal cylinders would be subject to excessive wear. Their engines were therefore arranged with the piston axis in vertical position. In time the horizontal arrangement became more popular, allowing compact, but powerful engines to be fitted in smaller spaces.

The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine, patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff. When Corliss was given the Rumford Medal, the committee said that &quot;no one invention since Watt&#x27;s time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine&quot;. In addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off, making it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning.

=== Road vehicles ===
The first experimental road-going steam-powered vehicles were built in the late 18th century, but it was not until after Richard Trevithick had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam-powered vehicles on roads. Improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s. Steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of internal combustion engine technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the Second World War. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s, the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam-powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology, no steam vehicles are in production at present.

=== Marine engines ===

Near the end of the 19th century, compound engines came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the steam turbine, electric motors, and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with merchant shipping relying increasingly upon diesel engines, and warships on the steam turbine.

=== Steam locomotives ===
As the development of steam engines progressed through the 18th century, various attempts were made to apply them to road and railway use. In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a model steam road locomotive. An early working model of a steam rail locomotive was designed and constructed by steamboat pioneer John Fitch in the United States probably during the 1780s or 1790s.
His steam locomotive used interior bladed wheels guided by rails or tracks.

The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and, on 21 February 1804, the world&#x27;s first railway journey took place as Trevithick&#x27;s steam locomotive hauled 10 tones of iron, 70 passengers and five wagons along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales. The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency. Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives.

Trevithick continued his own experiments using a trio of locomotives, concluding with the Catch Me Who Can in 1808. Only four years later, the successful twin-cylinder locomotive &quot;Salamanca&quot; by Matthew Murray was used by the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway. In 1825 George Stephenson built the &quot;Locomotion&quot; for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. This was the first public steam railway in the world and then in 1829, he built &quot;The Rocket&quot; which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened in 1830 making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains.

Steam locomotives continued to be manufactured until the late twentieth century in places such as China and the former East Germany (where the DR Class 52.80 was produced).

=== Steam turbines ===
The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States, 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.

=== Present development ===
Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines.

== Components and accessories of steam engines ==
There are two fundamental components of a steam plant: the boiler or steam generator, and the &quot;motor unit&quot;, referred to itself as a &quot;steam engine&quot;. Stationary steam engines in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart. For portable or mobile use, such as steam locomotives, the two are mounted together.

The widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast-iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.

Engines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere.

Other components are often present; pumps (such as an injector) to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the latent heat of vaporisation, and superheaters to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin (bunker) to the firebox.

=== Heat source ===
The heat required for boiling the water and raising the temperature of the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (e.g., combustion chamber, firebox, furnace). In the case of model or toy steam engines and a few full scale cases, the heat source can be an electric heating element.

=== Boilers ===

Boilers are pressure vessels that contain water to be boiled, and features that transfer the heat to the water as effectively as possible.

The two most common types are:
; Water-tube boiler: Water is passed through tubes surrounded by hot gas.
; Fire-tube boiler: Hot gas is passed through tubes immersed in water, the same water also circulates in a water jacket surrounding the firebox and, in high-output locomotive boilers, also passes through tubes in the firebox itself (thermic syphons and security circulators).

Fire-tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.

Many boilers raise the temperature of the steam after it has left that part of the boiler where it is in contact with the water. Known as superheating it turns &#x27;wet steam&#x27; into &#x27;superheated steam&#x27;. It avoids the steam condensing in the engine cylinders, and gives a significantly higher efficiency.

=== Motor units ===
In a steam engine, a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature, using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work.

These &quot;motor units&quot; are often called &#x27;steam engines&#x27; in their own right. Engines using compressed air or other gases differ from steam engines only in details that depend on the nature of the gas although compressed air has been used in steam engines without change.

=== Cold sink ===
As with all heat engines, the majority of primary energy must be emitted as waste heat at relatively low temperature.

The simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment. This is often used on steam locomotives to avoid the weight and bulk of condensers. Some of the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire, which greatly increases engine power, but reduces efficiency.

Sometimes the waste heat from the engine is useful itself, and in those cases, very high overall efficiency can be obtained.

Steam engines in stationary power plants use surface condensers as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water (&quot;condensate&quot;), is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler. A dry-type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative (wet) cooling towers, which use a secondary external water circuit that evaporates some of flow to the air.

River boats initially used a jet condenser in which cold water from the river is injected into the exhaust steam from the engine. Cooling water and condensate mix. While this was also applied for sea-going vessels, generally after only a few days of operation the boiler would become coated with deposited salt, reducing performance and increasing the risk of a boiler explosion. Starting about 1834, the use of surface condensers on ships eliminated fouling of the boilers, and improved engine efficiency.

Evaporated water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant boiler feed water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air.

=== Water pump ===
Most steam boilers have a means to supply water whilst at pressure, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler. Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives. It is the pressurization of the water that circulates through the steam boiler that allows the water to be raised to temperatures well above boiling point of water at one atmospheric pressure, and by that means to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle.

=== Monitoring and control ===

For safety reasons, nearly all steam engines are equipped with mechanisms to monitor the boiler, such as a pressure gauge and a sight glass to monitor the water level.

Many engines, stationary and mobile, are also fitted with a governor to regulate the speed of the engine without the need for human interference.

The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines. See image of indicator diagram below (in &quot;Types of motor units&quot; section).

===Governor===

The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt&#x27;s partner Boulton saw one on the equipment of a flour mill Boulton &amp; Watt were building. The governor could not actually hold a set speed, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning. The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.

== Engine configuration ==
=== Simple engine ===
In a simple engine, or &quot;single expansion engine&quot; the charge of steam passes through the entire expansion process in an individual cylinder, although a simple engine may have one or more individual cylinders. It is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser. As steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine, its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system; this is known as adiabatic expansion and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature. This causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke, which is a source of inefficiency.


The dominant efficiency loss in reciprocating steam engines is cylinder condensation and re-evaporation. The steam cylinder and adjacent metal parts/ports operate at a temperature about halfway between the steam admission saturation temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the exhaust pressure. As high-pressure steam is admitted into the working cylinder, much of the high-temperature steam is condensed as water droplets onto the metal surfaces, significantly reducing the steam available for expansive work. When the expanding steam reaches low pressure (especially during the exhaust stroke), the previously deposited water droplets that had just been formed within the cylinder/ports now boil away (re-evaporation) and this steam does no further work in the cylinder.

There are practical limits on the expansion ratio of a steam engine cylinder, as increasing cylinder surface area tends to exacerbate the cylinder condensation and re-evaporation issues. This negates the theoretical advantages associated with a high ratio of expansion in an individual cylinder.

=== Compound engines ===
A method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his &quot;Woolf high-pressure compound engine&quot; in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders, with the overall temperature drop within each cylinder reduced considerably. By expanding the steam in steps with smaller temperature range (within each cylinder) the condensation and re-evaporation efficiency issue (described above) is reduced. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and in rare cases the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.

Double-expansion (usually known as compound) engines expanded the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.

Two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:
* Cross compounds: The cylinders are side by side.
* Tandem compounds: The cylinders are end to end, driving a common connecting rod
* Angle compounds: The cylinders are arranged in a V (usually at a 90° angle) and drive a common crank.

With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (&quot;quartered&quot;). When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a four-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other. In one case (the first type of Vauclain compound), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90° as for a two-cylinder engine. With the three-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two, or in some cases, all three cranks were set at 120°.

The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930). However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.

=== Multiple-expansion engines ===

It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the multiple-expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as &quot;triple-&quot; and &quot;quadruple-expansion engines&quot; respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double-expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing &quot;system&quot; was used on some marine triple-expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the &quot;Olympic&quot; class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine. It is noted, however, that triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines were used to drive the World War II Liberty ships, by far the largest number of identical ships ever built. Over 2700 ships were built, in the United States, from a British original design. 

The image in this section shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right. The valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder.

Land-based steam engines could exhaust their steam to atmosphere, as feed water was usually readily available. Prior to and during World War I, the expansion engine dominated marine applications, where high vessel speed was not essential. It was, however, superseded by the British invention steam turbine where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the dreadnought battleships, and ocean liners. of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.

== Types of motor units ==

=== Reciprocating piston ===


In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the same end of the cylinder. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four &quot;events&quot; – admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a &quot;steam chest&quot; adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam &quot;ports&quot; communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by valve gear, of which there are many types.

The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Many however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually &quot;shortening the cutoff&quot; or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (&quot;kick back&quot;).

In the 1840s and 1850s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide &quot;lap&quot; by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy, and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.

==== Compression ====
Before the exhaust phase is quite complete, the exhaust side of the valve closes, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder. This determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing; it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock, which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cycle.

==== Lead in the valve timing====
The above effects are further enhanced by providing &quot;lead&quot;: as was later discovered with the internal combustion engine, it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase, giving the valve &quot;lead&quot; so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the &quot;clearance volume&quot; comprising the ports and the cylinder ends (not part of the piston-swept volume) before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston.

=== Uniflow (or unaflow) engine ===

Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where, during each stroke, the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam, whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring the working temperature. The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower. However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties..

=== Turbine engines ===

A steam turbine consists of one or more &quot;rotors&quot; (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of &quot;stators&quot; (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship&#x27;s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the United States with 60 Hertz power, and 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications, due to enormous size, the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

Steam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion. Thus, they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft. This contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating engine.

The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world&#x27;s electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the &quot;Turbinia&quot;), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.

Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator. Nuclear-powered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ turbo-electric transmission, where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors. A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain, but were not repeated. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced. It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.

=== Oscillating cylinder steam engines ===
An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting (trunnion). These engines are mainly used in toys and models because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full-size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued.

=== Rotary steam engines ===
It is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine. Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the cutoff, is also a serious problem with many such designs.

By the 1840s, it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press. However, the arrival of electricity on the scene, and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine, led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s, and a few designs had some limited success..

Of the few designs that were manufactured in quantity, those of the Hult Brothers Rotary Steam Engine Company of Stockholm, Sweden, and the spherical engine of Beauchamp Tower are notable. Tower&#x27;s engines were used by the Great Eastern Railway to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives, and by the Admiralty for driving dynamos on board the ships of the Royal Navy. They were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines.

=== Rocket type ===
The aeolipile represents the use of steam by the rocket-reaction principle, although not for direct propulsion.

In more modern times there has been limited use of steam for rocketry – particularly for rocket cars. Steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle. The drop in pressure immediately boils some of the water and the steam leaves through a nozzle, creating a propulsive force.

Ferdinand Verbiest&#x27;s carriage was powered by an aeolipile in 1679.

== Safety ==
Steam engines possess boilers and other components that are pressure vessels that contain a great deal of potential energy. Steam escapes and boiler explosions (typically BLEVEs) can and have in the past caused great loss of life. While variations in standards may exist in different countries, stringent legal, testing, training, care with manufacture, operation and certification is applied to ensure safety.

Failure modes may include:
* over-pressurisation of the boiler
* insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure
* buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots, especially in riverboats using dirty feed water
* pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance.
* escape of steam from pipework/boiler causing scalding

Steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal is illegally broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.

Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler&#x27;s firebox. If the water level drops, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.

== Steam cycle ==


The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and uses the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal, and nuclear power plants. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath.

The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle, a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.

The working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an &quot;open loop&quot; system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied. Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its thermodynamic properties. Mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine. Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a binary cycle.

The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered latent heat, which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black, who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature. The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.

== Efficiency ==

The efficiency of an engine cycle can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy put into the engine.

The historical measure of a steam engine&#x27;s energy efficiency was its &quot;duty&quot;. The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs. Duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt&#x27;s original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.

No heat engine can be more efficient than the Carnot cycle, in which heat is moved from a high-temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature, and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference. For the greatest efficiency, steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible (superheated steam), and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible.

The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid. Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range over which the cycle can operate is small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 64% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.

One principal advantage the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine (or reciprocating engine) power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern simple cycle gas turbines are fairly well matched.

In practice, a reciprocating steam engine cycle exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency (including the boiler) in the range of 1–10%. However, with the addition of a condenser, Corliss valves, multiple expansion, and high steam pressure/temperature, it may be greatly improved. Historically into the range of 10–20%, and very rarely slightly higher.

A modern, large electrical power station (producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output) with steam reheat, economizer etc. will achieve efficiency in the mid 40% range, with the most efficient units approaching 50% thermal efficiency.

It is also possible to capture the waste heat using cogeneration in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam.

<doc id="27694" wikidata="Q35230" url="?curid=27694" title="Satan">
<text>Satan, also known as [[Devil|the Devil]], is an entity in Abrahamic religions who seduces humans into sin (or falsehood). In Judaism, Satan is seen as an agent subservient to God, typically regarded as a metaphor for the &quot;yetzer hara&quot;, or &#x27;evil inclination&#x27;. In Christianity and Islam, he is usually seen as a fallen angel or jinn who has rebelled against God, who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and a host of demons. In the Quran, Iblis is an evil entity (&quot;shaitan&quot;) made of fire who was cast out of Heaven because he refused to bow before the newly created Adam and incites humans to sin by infecting their minds with &quot;waswās&quot; (&#x27;evil suggestions&#x27;).

A figure known as &quot;ha-satan&quot; (&quot;the satan&quot;) first appears in the Hebrew Bible as a heavenly prosecutor, subordinate to Yahweh (God), who prosecutes the nation of Judah in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh&#x27;s followers. During the intertestamental period, possibly due to influence from the Zoroastrian figure of Angra Mainyu, the satan developed into a malevolent entity with abhorrent qualities in dualistic opposition to God. In the apocryphal Book of Jubilees, Yahweh grants the satan (referred to as Mastema) authority over a group of fallen angels, or their offspring, to tempt humans to sin and punish them.

Although the Book of Genesis does not mention him, Christians often identify the serpent in the Garden of Eden as Satan. In the Synoptic Gospels, Satan tempts Jesus in the desert and is identified as the cause of illness and temptation. In the Book of Revelation, Satan appears as a Great Red Dragon, who is defeated by Michael the Archangel and cast down from Heaven. He is later bound for one thousand years, but is briefly set free before being ultimately defeated and cast into the Lake of Fire.

In the Middle Ages, Satan played a minimal role in Christian theology and was used as a comic relief figure in mystery plays. During the early modern period, Satan&#x27;s significance greatly increased as beliefs such as demonic possession and witchcraft became more prevalent. During the Age of Enlightenment, belief in the existence of Satan was harshly criticized by thinkers such as Voltaire. Nonetheless, belief in Satan has persisted, particularly in the Americas.

Although Satan is generally viewed as evil, some groups have very different beliefs. In theistic Satanism, Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In LaVeyan Satanism, Satan is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty. Satan&#x27;s appearance is never described in the Bible, but, since the ninth century, he has often been shown in Christian art with horns, cloven hooves, unusually hairy legs, and a tail, often naked and holding a pitchfork. These are an amalgam of traits derived from various pagan deities, including Pan, Poseidon, and Bes. Satan appears frequently in Christian literature, most notably in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, all variants of the classic Faust story, John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, and the poems of William Blake. He continues to appear in film, television, and music.

==Historical development==
===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew term &quot;śāṭān&quot; () is a generic noun meaning &quot;accuser&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot;, and is derived from a verb meaning primarily &quot;to obstruct, oppose&quot;. In the earlier biblical books, e.g. 1 Samuel 29:4, it refers to human adversaries, but in the later books, especially Job 1–2 and Zechariah 3, to a supernatural entity. When used without the definite article (simply &quot;satan&quot;), it can refer to any accuser, but when it is used with the definite article (&quot;ha-satan&quot;), it usually refers specifically to the heavenly accuser, literally, &quot;the&quot; satan.

The word with the definite article &quot;Ha-Satan&quot; ( &quot;hasSāṭān&quot;) occurs 17 times in the Masoretic Text, in two books of the Hebrew Bible: Job ch. 1–2 (14×) and Zechariah 3:1–2 (3×). It is translated in English bibles mostly as &#x27;Satan&#x27;.
The word does not occur in the Book of Genesis, which mentions only a talking serpent and does not identify the serpent with any supernatural entity. The first occurrence of the word &quot;satan&quot; in the Hebrew Bible in reference to a supernatural figure comes from Numbers 22:22, which describes the Angel of Yahweh confronting Balaam on his donkey: &quot;Balaam&#x27;s departure aroused the wrath of Elohim, and the Angel of Yahweh stood in the road as a satan against him.&quot; In 2 Samuel 24, Yahweh sends the &quot;Angel of Yahweh&quot; to inflict a plague against Israel for three days, killing 70,000 people as punishment for David having taken a census without his approval. 1 Chronicles 21:1 repeats this story, but replaces the &quot;Angel of Yahweh&quot; with an entity referred to as &quot;a satan&quot;.

Some passages clearly refer to the satan, without using the word itself. 1 Samuel 2:12 describes the sons of Eli as &quot;sons of Belial&quot;; the later usage of this word makes it clearly a synonym for &quot;satan&quot;. In 1 Samuel 16:14–2, Yahweh sends a &quot;troubling spirit&quot; to torment King Saul as a mechanism to ingratiate David with the king. In 1 Kings 22:19–25, the prophet Micaiah describes to King Ahab a vision of Yahweh sitting on his throne surrounded by the Host of Heaven. Yahweh asks the Host which of them will lead Ahab astray. A &quot;spirit&quot;, whose name is not specified, but who is analogous to the satan, volunteers to be &quot;a Lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets&quot;.

====Book of Job====
The satan appears in the Book of Job, a poetic dialogue set within a prose framework, which may have been written around the time of the Babylonian captivity. In the text, Job is a righteous man favored by Yahweh. Job 1:6–8 describes the &quot;sons of God&quot; (&quot;bənê hāʼĕlōhîm&quot;) presenting themselves before Yahweh. Yahweh asks one of them, &quot;the satan&quot;, where he has been, to which he replies that he has been roaming around the earth. Yahweh asks, &quot;Have you considered My servant Job?&quot; The satan replies by urging Yahweh to let him torture Job, promising that Job will abandon his faith at the first tribulation. Yahweh consents: the satan destroys Job&#x27;s servants and flocks, yet Job refuses to condemn Yahweh. The first scene repeats itself, with the satan presenting himself to Yahweh alongside the other &quot;sons of God&quot;. Yahweh points out Job&#x27;s continued faithfulness, to which the satan insists that more testing is necessary; Yahweh once again gives him permission to test Job. In the end, Job remains faithful and righteous, and it is implied that the satan is shamed in his defeat.

====Book of Zechariah====
Zechariah 3:1–7 contains a description of a vision dated to the middle of February of 519 BC, in which an angel shows Zechariah a scene of Joshua the High Priest dressed in filthy rags, representing the nation of Judah and its sins, on trial with Yahweh as the judge and the satan standing as the prosecutor. Yahweh rebukes the satan and orders for Joshua to be given clean clothes, representing Yahweh&#x27;s forgiveness of Judah&#x27;s sins.

===Second Temple period===

During the Second Temple Period, when Jews were living in the Achaemenid Empire, Judaism was heavily influenced by Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Achaemenids. Jewish conceptions of Satan were impacted by Angra Mainyu, the Zoroastrian spirit of evil, darkness, and ignorance. In the Septuagint, the Hebrew &quot;ha-Satan&quot; in Job and Zechariah is translated by the Greek word &quot;diabolos&quot; (slanderer), the same word in the Greek New Testament from which the English word &quot;devil&quot; is derived. Where &quot;satan&quot; is used to refer to human enemies in the Hebrew Bible, such as Hadad the Edomite and Rezon the Syrian, the word is left untranslated but transliterated in the Greek as &quot;satan&quot;, a neologism in Greek.

The idea of Satan as an opponent of God and a purely evil figure seems to have taken root in Jewish pseudepigrapha during the Second Temple Period, particularly in the &quot;apocalypses&quot;. The Book of Enoch, which the Dead Sea Scrolls have revealed to have been nearly as popular as the Torah, describes a group of 200 angels known as the &quot;Watchers&quot;, who are assigned to supervise the earth, but instead abandon their duties and have sexual intercourse with human women. The leader of the Watchers is Semjâzâ and another member of the group, known as Azazel, spreads sin and corruption among humankind. The Watchers are ultimately sequestered in isolated caves across the earth and are condemned to face judgement at the end of time. The Book of Jubilees, written in around 150 BC, retells the story of the Watchers&#x27; defeat, but, in deviation from the Book of Enoch, Mastema, the &quot;Chief of Spirits&quot;, intervenes before all of their demon offspring are sealed away, requesting for Yahweh to let him keep some of them to become his workers. Yahweh acquiesces to this request and Mastema uses them to tempt humans into committing more sins, so that he may punish them for their wickedness. Later, Mastema induces Yahweh to test Abraham by ordering him to sacrifice Isaac.

The Second Book of Enoch, also called the Slavonic Book of Enoch, contains references to a Watcher called Satanael. It is a pseudepigraphic text of an uncertain date and unknown authorship. The text describes Satanael as being the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was &quot;righteous&quot; and &quot;sinful&quot;. In the Book of Wisdom, the devil is taken to be the being who brought death into the world, but originally the culprit was recognized as Cain. The name Samael, which is used in reference to one of the fallen angels, later became a common name for Satan in Jewish Midrash and Kabbalah.

==Judaism==

Most Jews do not believe in the existence of a supernatural omnimalevolent figure. Traditionalists and philosophers in medieval Judaism adhered to rational theology, rejecting any belief in rebel or fallen angels, and viewing evil as abstract. The rabbis usually interpreted the word &quot;satan&quot; lacking the article &quot;ha-&quot; as it is used in the Tanakh as referring strictly to &quot;human&quot; adversaries. Nonetheless, the word &quot;satan&quot; has occasionally been metaphorically applied to evil influences, such as the Jewish exegesis of the &quot;yetzer hara&quot; (&quot;evil inclination&quot;) mentioned in Genesis 6:5. The Talmudic image of Satan is contradictory. While Satan&#x27;s identification with the abstract &quot;yetzer hara&quot; remains uniform over the sages&#x27; teachings, he is generally identified as an entity with divine agency. For instance, the sages considered Satan to be an angel of death (later given the name &quot;Samael&quot;), as God prohibiting Satan from killing Job would imply he would otherwise be able to do so, yet despite this syncretization with a known heavenly body, Satan is identified as the &quot;yetzer hara&quot; in the very same passage. Satan&#x27;s status as a &#x27;physical&#x27; entity is strengthened by numerous other rabbinical anecdotes: one tale describes two separate incidents where Satan appeared as a woman in order to tempt Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Akiva into sin, while another describes Satan taking the form of an ill-mannered, diseased beggar in order to tempt the sage Peleimu into breaking the mitzvah of hospitality. Another passage relates that Satan once kissed the feet of Aha bar Jacob for having taught his students that his objectionable actions are done only to serve the intents of God.

Rabbinical scholarship on the Book of Job generally follows the Talmud and Maimonides in identifying &quot;the satan&quot; from the prologue as a metaphor for the &quot;yetzer hara&quot; and not an actual entity. Satan is rarely mentioned in Tannaitic literature, but is found in Babylonian aggadah. According to a narration, the sound of the shofar, which is primarily intended to remind Jews of the importance of &quot;teshuva&quot;, is also intended symbolically to &quot;confuse the accuser&quot; (Satan) and prevent him from rendering any litigation to God against the Jews. Kabbalah presents Satan as an agent of God whose function is to tempt humans into sinning so that he may accuse them in the heavenly court. The Hasidic Jews of the eighteenth century associated ha-Satan with &quot;Baal Davar&quot;.

Each modern sect of Judaism has its own interpretation of Satan&#x27;s identity. Orthodox Judaism outwardly embraces Talmudic teachings on Satan, and involves Satan in religious life far more inclusively than other sects. Satan is mentioned explicitly in some daily prayers, including during Shacharit and certain post-meal benedictions, as described in the Talmud and the Jewish Code of Law. In Reform Judaism, Satan is generally seen in his Talmudic role as a metaphor for the &quot;yetzer hara&quot; and the symbolic representation of innate human qualities such as selfishness.

===Names===

The most common English synonym for &quot;Satan&quot; is &quot;devil&quot;, which descends from Middle English &quot;devel&quot;, from Old English &quot;dēofol,&quot; that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin &quot;diabolus&quot; (also the source of &quot;diabolical&quot;). This in turn was borrowed from Greek &quot;diabolos&quot; &quot;slanderer&quot;, from &quot;diaballein&quot; &quot;to slander&quot;: &quot;dia-&quot; &quot;across, through&quot; + &quot;ballein&quot; &quot;to hurl&quot;. In the New Testament, the words &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;diabolos&quot; are used interchangeably as synonyms. Beelzebub, meaning &quot;Lord of Flies&quot;, is the contemptuous name given in the Hebrew Bible and New Testament to a Philistine god whose original name has been reconstructed as most probably &quot;Ba&#x27;al Zabul&quot;, meaning &quot;Baal the Prince&quot;. The Synoptic Gospels identify Satan and Beelzebub as the same. The name Abaddon (meaning &quot;place of destruction&quot;) is used six times in the Old Testament, mainly as a name for one of the regions of Sheol. describes Abaddon, whose name is translated into Greek as &quot;Apollyon&quot;, meaning &quot;the destroyer&quot;, as an angel who rules the Abyss. In modern usage, Abaddon is sometimes equated with Satan.

===New Testament===
====Gospels, Acts, and epistles====

The three Synoptic Gospels all describe the temptation of Christ by Satan in the desert (, , and ). Satan first shows Jesus a stone and tells him to turn it into bread. He also takes him to the pinnacle of the Temple in Jerusalem and commands Jesus to throw himself down so that the angels will catch him. Satan takes Jesus to the top of a tall mountain as well; there, he shows him the kingdoms of the earth and promises to give them all to him if he will bow down and worship him. Each time Jesus rebukes Satan and, after the third temptation, he is administered by the angels. Satan&#x27;s promise in and to give Jesus all the kingdoms of the earth implies that all those kingdoms belong to him. The fact that Jesus does not dispute Satan&#x27;s promise indicates that the authors of those gospels believed this to be true.

Satan plays a role in some of the parables of Jesus, namely the Parable of the Sower, the Parable of the Weeds, Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, and the Parable of the Strong Man. According to the Parable of the Sower, Satan &quot;profoundly influences&quot; those who fail to understand the gospel. The latter two parables say that Satan&#x27;s followers will be punished on Judgement Day, with the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats stating that the Devil, his angels, and the people who follow him will be consigned to &quot;eternal fire&quot;. When the Pharisees accused Jesus of exorcising demons through the power of Beelzebub, Jesus responds by telling the Parable of the Strong Man, saying: &quot;how can someone enter a strong man&#x27;s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house&quot; (). The strong man in this parable represents Satan.

The Synoptic Gospels identify Satan and his demons as the causes of illness, including fever (), leprosy (), and arthritis (), while the Epistle to the Hebrews describes the Devil as &quot;him who holds the power of death&quot; (). The author of Luke-Acts attributes more power to Satan than either Matthew and Mark. In , Jesus grants Satan the authority to test Peter and the other apostles. states that Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus because &quot;Satan entered&quot; him and, in , Peter describes Satan as &quot;filling&quot; Ananias&#x27;s heart and causing him to sin. The Gospel of John only uses the name &quot;Satan&quot; three times. In , Jesus says that his Jewish or Judean enemies are the children of the Devil rather than the children of Abraham. The same verse describes the Devil as &quot;a man-killer from the beginning&quot; and &quot;a liar and the father of lying.&quot; describes the Devil as inspiring Judas to betray Jesus and identifies Satan as &quot;the Archon of this Cosmos&quot;, who is destined to be overthrown through Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection. promises that the Holy Spirit will &quot;accuse the World concerning sin, justice, and judgement&quot;, a role resembling that of the Satan in the Old Testament.

 refers to a dispute between Michael the Archangel and the Devil over the body of Moses. Some interpreters understand this reference to be an allusion to the events described in . The classical theologian Origen attributes this reference to the non-canonical Assumption of Moses. According to James H. Charlesworth, there is no evidence the surviving book of this name ever contained any such content. Others believe it to be in the lost ending of the book. The second chapter of the pseudepigraphical Second Epistle of Peter copies much of the content of the Epistle of Jude, but omits the specifics of the example regarding Michael and Satan, with instead mentioning only an ambiguous dispute between &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Glories&quot;. Throughout the New Testament, Satan is referred to as a &quot;tempter&quot; (), &quot;the ruler of the demons&quot; (), &quot;the God of this Age&quot; (), &quot;the evil one&quot; (), and &quot;a roaring lion&quot; ().

====Book of Revelation====

The Book of Revelation represents Satan as the supernatural ruler of the Roman Empire and the ultimate cause of all evil in the world. In , as part of the letter to the church at Smyrna, John of Patmos refers to the Jews of Smyrna as &quot;a synagogue of Satan&quot; and warns that &quot;the Devil is about to cast some of you into prison as a test [&quot;peirasmos&quot;], and for ten days you will have affliction.&quot; In , in the letter to the church of Pergamum, John warns that Satan lives among the members of the congregation and declares that &quot;Satan&#x27;s throne&quot; is in their midst. Pergamum was the capital of the Roman Province of Asia and &quot;Satan&#x27;s throne&quot; may be referring to the monumental Pergamon Altar in the city, which was dedicated to the Greek god Zeus, or to a temple dedicated to the Roman emperor Augustus.

 describes a vision of a Great Red Dragon with seven heads, ten horns, seven crowns, and a massive tail, an image which is likely inspired by the vision of the four beasts from the sea in the Book of Daniel and the Leviathan described in various Old Testament passages. The Great Red Dragon knocks &quot;a third of the sun... a third of the moon, and a third of the stars&quot; out the sky and pursues the Woman of the Apocalypse. declares: &quot;And war broke out in Heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon. The Dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in Heaven. Dragon the Great was thrown down, that ancient serpent who is called Devil and Satan, the one deceiving the whole inhabited World – he was thrown down to earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot; Then a voice booms down from Heaven heralding the defeat of &quot;the Accuser&quot; (&quot;ho Kantegor&quot;), identifying the Satan of Revelation with the satan of the Old Testament.

In , Satan is bound with a chain and hurled into the Abyss, where he is imprisoned for one thousand years. In , he is set free and gathers his armies along with Gog and Magog to wage war against the righteous, but is defeated with fire from Heaven, and cast into the lake of fire. Some Christians associate Satan with the number 666, which describes as the Number of the Beast. However, the beast mentioned in Revelation 13 is not Satan, and the use of 666 in the Book of Revelation has been interpreted as a reference to the Roman Emperor Nero, as 666 is the numeric value of his name in Hebrew.

===Patristic era===
Christians have traditionally interpreted the unnamed serpent in the Garden of Eden as Satan due to , which calls Satan &quot;that ancient serpent&quot;. This verse, however, is probably intended to identify Satan with the Leviathan, a monstrous sea-serpent whose destruction by Yahweh is prophesied in . The first recorded individual to identify Satan with the serpent from the Garden of Eden was the second-century AD Christian apologist Justin Martyr, in chapters 45 and 79 of his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;. Other early church fathers to mention this identification include Theophilus and Tertullian. The early Christian Church, however, encountered opposition from pagans such as Celsus, who claimed in his treatise &quot;The True Word&quot; that &quot;it is blasphemy... to say that the greatest God... has an adversary who constrains his capacity to do good&quot; and said that Christians &quot;impiously divide the kingdom of God, creating a rebellion in it, as if there were opposing factions within the divine, including one that is hostile to God&quot;.

The name &quot;Heylel&quot;, meaning &quot;morning star&quot; (or, in Latin, &quot;Lucifer&quot;), was a name for Attar, the god of the planet Venus in Canaanite mythology, who attempted to scale the walls of the heavenly city, but was vanquished by the god of the sun. The name is used in in metaphorical reference to the king of Babylon. uses a description of a cherub in Eden as a polemic against Ithobaal II, the king of Tyre.

The Church Father Origen of Alexandria ( 184 – 253), who was only aware of the actual text of these passages and not the original myths to which they refer, concluded in his treatise &quot;On the First Principles&quot;, which is preserved in a Latin translation by Tyrannius Rufinus, that neither of these verses could literally refer to a human being. He concluded that Isaiah 14:12 is an allegory for Satan and that Ezekiel 28:12–15 is an allusion to &quot;a certain Angel who had received the office of governing the nation of the Tyrians&quot;, but was hurled down to Earth after he was found to be corrupt. In his apologetic treatise &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, however, Origen interprets both Isaiah 14:12 and Ezekiel 28:12–15 as referring to Satan. According to Henry Ansgar Kelly, Origen seems to have adopted this new interpretation to refute unnamed persons who, perhaps under the influence of Zoroastrian radical dualism, believed &quot;that Satan&#x27;s original nature was Darkness.&quot; The later Church Father Jerome ( 347 – 420), translator of the Latin Vulgate, accepted Origen&#x27;s theory of Satan as a fallen angel and wrote about it in his commentary on the Book of Isaiah. In Christian tradition ever since, both Isaiah 14:12 and Ezekiel 28:12–15 have been understood as allegorically referring to Satan. For most Christians, Satan has been regarded as an angel who rebelled against God.

According to the ransom theory of atonement, which was popular among early Christian theologians, Satan gained power over humanity through Adam and Eve&#x27;s sin and Christ&#x27;s death on the cross was a ransom to Satan in exchange for humanity&#x27;s liberation. This theory holds that Satan was tricked by God because Christ was not only free of sin, but also the incarnate Deity, whom Satan lacked the ability to enslave. Irenaeus of Lyons described a prototypical form of the ransom theory, but Origen was the first to propose it in its fully developed form. The theory was later expanded by theologians such as Gregory of Nyssa and Rufinus of Aquileia. In the eleventh century, Anselm of Canterbury criticized the ransom theory, along with the associated Christus Victor theory, resulting in the theory&#x27;s decline in western Europe. The theory has nonetheless retained some of its popularity in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Most early Christians firmly believed that Satan and his demons had the power to possess humans, and exorcisms were widely practiced by Jews, Christians, and pagans alike. Belief in demonic possession continued through the Middle Ages into the early modern period. Exorcisms were seen as a display of God&#x27;s power over Satan. The vast majority of people who thought they were possessed by the Devil did not suffer from hallucinations or other &quot;spectacular symptoms&quot;, but &quot;complained of anxiety, religious fears, and evil thoughts&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

Satan had minimal role in medieval Christian theology, but he frequently appeared as a recurring comedic stock character in late medieval mystery plays, in which he was portrayed as a comic relief figure who &quot;frolicked, fell, and farted in the background&quot;. Jeffrey Burton Russell describes the medieval conception of Satan as &quot;more pathetic and repulsive than terrifying&quot; and he was seen as little more than a nuisance to God&#x27;s overarching plan. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, a collection of saints&#x27; lives compiled in around 1260 by the Dominican Friar Jacobus de Voragine, contains numerous stories about encounters between saints and Satan, in which Satan is constantly duped by the saints&#x27; cleverness and by the power of God. Henry Ansgar Kelly remarks that Satan &quot;comes across as the opposite of fearsome&quot;. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; was the most popular book during the High and Late Middle Ages and more manuscripts of it have survived from the period than for any other book, including even the Bible itself.

The &quot;Canon Episcopi&quot;, written in the eleventh century AD, condemns belief in witchcraft as heretical, but also documents that many people at the time apparently believed in it. Witches were believed to fly through the air on broomsticks, consort with demons, perform in &quot;lurid sexual rituals&quot; in the forests, murder human infants and eat them as part of Satanic rites, and engage in conjugal relations with demons. In 1326, Pope John XXII issued the papal bull &quot;Super illius Specula&quot;, which condemned folk divination practices as consultation with Satan. By the 1430s, the Catholic Church began to regard witchcraft as part of a vast conspiracy led by Satan himself.

===Early modern period===
During the Early Modern Period, Christians gradually began to regard Satan as increasingly powerful and the fear of Satan&#x27;s power became a dominant aspect of the worldview of Christians across Europe. During the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther taught that, rather than trying to argue with Satan, Christians should avoid temptation altogether by seeking out pleasant company; Luther especially recommended music as a safeguard against temptation, since the Devil &quot;cannot endure gaiety&quot;. John Calvin repeated a maxim from Saint Augustine that &quot;Man is like a horse, with either God or the devil as rider.&quot;

In the late fifteenth century, a series of witchcraft panics erupted in France and Germany. The German Inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger argued in their book &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, published in 1487, that all &quot;maleficia&quot; (&quot;sorcery&quot;) was rooted in the work of Satan. In the mid-sixteenth century, the panic spread to England and Switzerland. Both Protestants and Catholics alike firmly believed in witchcraft as a real phenomenon and supported its prosecution. In the late 1500s, the Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer argued in his treatise &quot;De praestigiis daemonum&quot; that witchcraft did not exist, but that Satan promoted belief in it to lead Christians astray. The panic over witchcraft intensified in the 1620s and continued until the end of the 1600s. Brian Levack estimates that around 60,000 people were executed for witchcraft during the entire span of the witchcraft hysteria.

The early English settlers of North America, especially the Puritans of New England, believed that Satan &quot;visibly and palpably&quot; reigned in the New World. John Winthrop claimed that the Devil made rebellious Puritan women give birth to stillborn monsters with claws, sharp horns, and &quot;on each foot three claws, like a young fowl&quot;. Cotton Mather wrote that devils swarmed around Puritan settlements &quot;like the frogs of Egypt&quot;. The Puritans believed that the Native Americans were worshippers of Satan and described them as &quot;children of the Devil&quot;. Some settlers claimed to have seen Satan himself appear in the flesh at native ceremonies. During the First Great Awakening, the &quot;new light&quot; preachers portrayed their &quot;old light&quot; critics as ministers of Satan. By the time of the Second Great Awakening, Satan&#x27;s primary role in American evangelicalism was as the opponent of the evangelical movement itself, who spent most of his time trying to hinder the ministries of evangelical preachers, a role he has largely retained among present-day American fundamentalists.

By the early 1600s, skeptics in Europe, including the English author Reginald Scot and the Anglican bishop John Bancroft, had begun to criticize the belief that demons still had the power to possess people. This skepticism was bolstered by the belief that miracles only occurred during the Apostolic Age, which had long since ended. Later, Enlightenment thinkers, such as David Hume, Denis Diderot, and Voltaire, attacked the notion of Satan&#x27;s existence altogether. Voltaire labelled John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; a &quot;disgusting fantasy&quot; and declared that belief in Hell and Satan were among the many lies propagated by the Catholic Church to keep humanity enslaved. By the eighteenth century, trials for witchcraft had ceased in most western countries, with the notable exceptions of Poland and Hungary, where they continued. Belief in the power of Satan, however, remained strong among traditional Christians.

===Modern era===

Mormonism developed its own views on Satan. According to the Book of Moses, the Devil offered to be the redeemer of mankind for the sake of his own glory. Conversely, Jesus offered to be the redeemer of mankind so that his father&#x27;s will would be done. After his offer was rejected, Satan became rebellious and was subsequently cast out of heaven. In the Book of Moses, Cain is said to have &quot;loved Satan more than God&quot; and conspired with Satan to kill Abel. It was through this pact that Cain became a Master Mahan. The Book of Moses also says that Moses was tempted by Satan before calling upon the name of the &quot;Only Begotten&quot;, which caused Satan to depart. Douglas Davies asserts that this text &quot;reflects&quot; the temptation of Jesus in the Bible.

Belief in Satan and demonic possession remains strong among Christians in the United States and Latin America. According to a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, fifty-seven percent of people in the United States believe in a literal Devil, compared to eighteen percent of people in Britain. Fifty-one percent of Americans believe that Satan has the power to possess people. W. Scott Poole, author of &quot;Satan in America: The Devil We Know&quot;, has opined that &quot;In the United States over the last forty to fifty years, a composite image of Satan has emerged that borrows from both popular culture and theological sources&quot; and that most American Christians do not &quot;separate what they know [about Satan] from the movies from what they know from various ecclesiastical and theological traditions&quot;. The Catholic Church generally played down Satan and exorcism during late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, but Pope Francis brought renewed focus on the Devil in the early 2010s, stating, among many other pronouncements, that &quot;The devil is intelligent, he knows more theology than all the theologians together.&quot; According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, liberal Christianity tends to view Satan &quot;as a [figurative] mythological attempt to express the reality and extent of evil in the universe, existing outside and apart from humanity but profoundly influencing the human sphere&quot;.

Bernard McGinn describes multiple traditions detailing the relationship between the Antichrist and Satan. In the dualist approach, Satan will become incarnate in the Antichrist, just as God became incarnate in Jesus. However, in Orthodox Christian thought, this view is problematic because it is too similar to Christ&#x27;s incarnation. Instead, the &quot;indwelling&quot; view has become more accepted, which stipulates that the Antichrist is a human figure inhabited by Satan, since the latter&#x27;s power is not to be seen as equivalent to God&#x27;s.

==Islam==
The Arabic equivalent of the word &quot;Satan&quot; is &quot;Shaitan&quot; (شيطان, from the triliteral root š-ṭ-n شط⁬ن). The word itself is an adjective (meaning &quot;astray&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;, sometimes translated as &quot;devil&quot;) that can be applied to both man (&quot;al-ins&quot;, الإنس) and &quot;al-jinn&quot; (الجن), but it is also used in reference to Satan in particular. In the Quran, Satan&#x27;s name is Iblis (), probably a derivative of the Greek word &quot;diabolos&quot;. Muslims do not regard Satan as the cause of evil, but as a tempter, who takes advantage of humans&#x27; inclinations toward self-centeredness.

===Quran===

Seven chapters in the Quran describe how God ordered all the angels and Iblis to bow before the newly created human, Adam. All the angels bowed, but Iblis refused, claiming to be superior to Adam because he was made from fire, whereas Adam was made from clay (). Consequently, God expelled him from Paradise and condemned him to Jahannam. Iblis thereafter became a &quot;kafir&quot;, &quot;an ungrateful disbeliever&quot;, whose sole mission is to lead humanity astray. (Q) God allows Iblis to do this, because he knows that the righteous will be able to resist Iblis&#x27;s attempts to misguide them. On Judgement Day, while the lot of Satan remains in question, those who followed him will be thrown into the fires of Jahannam. After his banishment from Paradise, Iblis, who thereafter became known as &quot;Al-Shaitan&quot; (&quot;the Demon&quot;), lured Adam and Eve into eating the forbidden fruit.

The primary characteristic of Satan, aside from his hubris and despair, is his ability to cast evil suggestions (&quot;waswās&quot;) into men and women. states that Satan has no influence over the righteous, but that those who fall in error are under his power. implies that those who obey God&#x27;s laws are immune to the temptations of Satan. warns that Satan tries to keep Muslims from reading the Quran and recommends reciting the Quran as an antidote against Satan. refers to Satan as the enemy of humanity and forbids humans from worshipping him. In the Quranic retelling of the story of Job, Job knows that Satan is the one tormenting him.

===Islamic tradition===
====Affiliation====

In the Quran, Satan is apparently an angel, while, in , he is described as &quot;from the jinns&quot;. This, combined with the fact that he describes himself as having been made from fire, posed a major problem for Muslim exegetes of the Quran, who disagree on whether Satan is a fallen angel or the leader of a group of evil jinn. According to a hadith from Ibn Abbas, Iblis was actually an angel whom God created out of fire. Ibn Abbas asserts that the word &quot;jinn&quot; could be applied to earthly jinn, but also to &quot;fiery angels&quot; like Satan.

Hasan of Basra, an eminent Muslim theologian who lived in the seventh century AD, was quoted as saying: &quot;Iblis was not an angel even for the time of an eye wink. He is the origin of Jinn as Adam is of Mankind.&quot; The medieval Persian scholar Abu al-Zamakhshari states that the words &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;jinn&quot; are synonyms. Another Persian scholar, al-Baydawi, instead argues that Satan &quot;hoped&quot; to be an angel, but that his actions made him a jinn. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi who is reverred as the founder of Maturidiyyah Sunni orthodoxy (&quot;kalam&quot;) argued that since angels can be blessed by God, they are also put to a test and can be punished. Accordingly, Satan became a devil (&quot;shaiṭān&quot;) or jinn after he refused to obey. The &quot;Tarikh Khamis&quot; narrates that Satan was a jinn who was admitted into Paradise as a reward for his righteousness and, unlike the angels, was given the choice to obey or disobey God. When he was expelled from Paradise, Satan blamed humanity for his punishment. Concerning the fiery origin of Iblis, Zakariya al-Qazwini and Muhammad ibn Ahmad Ibshihi state that all supernatural creatures originated from fire but the angels from its light and the jinn from its blaze, thus fire denotes a disembodiment origin of all spiritual entities. Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi argued that only the angels of mercy are created from light, but angels of punishment have been created from fire.

The Muslim historian Al-Tabari, who died in around 923 AD, writes that, before Adam was created, earthly jinn made of smokeless fire roamed the earth and spread corruption. He further relates that Iblis was originally an angel named &quot;Azazil&quot; or &quot;Al-Harith&quot;, from a group of angels, created from the &quot;fires of simoom&quot;, sent by God to confront the earthly jinn. Azazil defeated the jinn in battle and drove them into the mountains, but he became convinced that he was superior to humans and all the other angels, leading to his downfall. In this account, Azazil&#x27;s group of angels were called &quot;jinn&quot; because they guarded Jannah (Paradise). In another tradition recorded by Al-Tabari, Satan was one of the earthly jinn, who was taken captive by the angels and brought to Heaven as a prisoner. God appointed him as judge over the other jinn and he became known as &quot;Al-Hakam&quot;. He fulfilled his duty for a thousand years before growing negligent, but was rehabilitated again and resumed his position until his refusal to bow before Adam.

====Other traditions====
During the first two centuries of Islam, Muslims almost unanimously accepted the traditional story known as the Satanic Verses as true. According to this narrative, Muhammad was told by Satan to add words to the Quran which would allow Muslims to pray for the intercession of pagan goddesses. He mistook the words of Satan for divine inspiration. Modern Muslims almost universally reject this story as heretical, as it calls the integrity of the Quran into question.

On the third day of the Hajj, Muslim pilgrims to Mecca throw seven stones at a pillar known as the &quot;Jamrah al-’Aqabah&quot;, symbolizing the stoning of the Devil. This ritual is based on the Islamic tradition that, when God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his son Ishmael, Satan tempted him three times not to do it, and, each time, Abraham responded by throwing seven stones at him.

The hadith teach that newborn babies cry because Satan touches them while they are being born, and that this touch causes people to have an aptitude for sin. This doctrine bears some similarities to the doctrine of original sin. Muslim tradition holds that only Jesus and Mary were not touched by Satan at birth. However, when he was a boy, Muhammad&#x27;s heart was literally opened by an angel, who removed a black clot that symbolized sin.

Muslim tradition preserves a number of stories involving dialogues between Jesus and Iblis, all of which are intended to demonstrate Jesus&#x27;s virtue and Satan&#x27;s depravity. Ahmad ibn Hanbal records an Islamic retelling of Jesus&#x27;s temptation by Satan in the desert from the Synoptic Gospels. Ahmad quotes Jesus as saying, &quot;The greatest sin is love of the world. Women are the ropes of Satan. Wine is the key to every evil.&quot; Abu Uthman al-Jahiz credits Jesus with saying, &quot;The world is Satan&#x27;s farm, and its people are his plowmen.&quot; Al-Ghazali tells an anecdote about how Jesus went out one day and saw Satan carrying ashes and honey; when he asked what they were for, Satan replied, &quot;The honey I put on the lips of backbiters so that they achieve their aim. The ashes I put on the faces of orphans, so that people come to dislike them.&quot; The thirteenth-century scholar Sibt ibn al-Jawzi states that, when Jesus asked him what truly broke his back, Satan replied, &quot;The neighing of horses in the cause of Allah.&quot;

Muslims believe that Satan is also the cause of deceptions originating from the mind and desires for evil. He is regarded as a cosmic force for separation, despair and spiritual envelopment. Muslims do distinguish between the satanic temptations and the murmurings of the bodily lower self (&quot;nafs&quot;). The lower self-commands the person to do a specific task or to fulfill a specific desire; whereas the inspirations of Satan tempt the person to do evil in general and, after a person successfully resists his first suggestion, Satan returns with new ones. If a Muslim feels that Satan is inciting him to sin, he is advised to seek refuge with God by reciting: &quot;In the name of Allah, I seek refuge in you, from Satan the outcast.&quot; Muslims are also obliged to &quot;seek refuge&quot; before reciting the Quran.

===Islamic mysticism===
According to some adherents of Sufi mysticism, Iblis refused to bow to Adam because he was fully devoted to God alone and refused to bow to anyone else. For this reason, Sufi masters regard Satan and Muhammad as the two most perfect monotheists. Sufis reject the concept of dualism and instead believe in the unity of existence. In the same way that Muhammad was the instrument of God&#x27;s mercy, Sufis regard Satan as the instrument of God&#x27;s wrath. For the Muslim Sufi scholar Ahmad Ghazali, Iblis was the paragon of lovers in self-sacrifice for refusing to bow down to Adam out of pure devotion to God Ahmad Ghazali&#x27;s student Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir was among the Sunni Muslim mystics who defended Iblis, asserted that evil was also God&#x27;s creation, Sheikh Adi argued that if evil existed without the will of God, then God would be powerless and powerlessness can&#x27;t be attributed to God. Some Sufis assert, since Iblis was destined by God to become a devil, God will also restore him to his former angelic nature. Attar compares Iblis&#x27;s damnation to the Biblical Benjamin: Both were accused unjustly, but their punishment had a greater meaning. In the end, Iblis will be released from hell.

However, not all Muslim Sufi mystics are in agreement with a positive depiction of Iblis. Rumi&#x27;s viewpoint on Iblis is much more in tune with Islamic orthodoxy. Rumi views Iblis as the manifestation of the great sins of haughtiness and envy. He states: &quot;(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.&quot;

==Baháʼí Faith==
In the Baháʼí Faith, Satan is not regarded as an independent evil power as he is in some faiths, but signifies the &quot;lower nature&quot; of humans. `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá explains: &quot;This lower nature in man is symbolized as Satan—the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside.&quot; All other evil spirits described in various faith traditions—such as fallen angels, demons, and jinns—are also metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God. Actions, that are described as &quot;satanic&quot; in some Baháʼí writings, denote humans&#x27; deeds caused by selfish desires.

==Satanism==
=== Theistic Satanism ===

Theistic Satanism, commonly referred to as &quot;devil worship&quot;, views Satan as a deity, whom individuals may supplicate to. It consists of loosely affiliated or independent groups and cabals, which all agree that Satan is a real entity.

===Atheistic Satanism===
Atheistic Satanism, as exemplified by LaVeyan Satanism (practiced by the Church of Satan and First Satanic Church) and The Satanic Temple, holds that Satan does not exist as a literal anthropomorphic entity, but rather as a symbol of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be permeated and motivated by a force that has been given many names by humans over the course of time. In this religion, &quot;Satan&quot; is not viewed or depicted as a hubristic, irrational, and fraudulent creature, but rather is revered with Prometheus-like attributes, symbolizing liberty and individual empowerment. To adherents, he also serves as a conceptual framework and an external metaphorical projection of the Satanist&#x27;s highest personal potential. In his essay &quot;Satanism: The Feared Religion&quot;, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that &quot;...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates. The reality behind Satan is simply the dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things. Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will&quot;.

LaVeyan Satanists embrace the original etymological meaning of the word &quot;Satan&quot; (Hebrew: שָּׂטָן &quot;satan&quot;, meaning &quot;adversary&quot;). According to Gilmore, &quot;The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We see ourselves as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment of our life as a human being.&quot;

Post-LaVeyan Satanists, like the adherents of The Satanic Temple, argue that the human animal has a natural altruistic and communal tendency, and frame Satan as a figure of struggle against injustice and activism. They also believe in bodily autonomy, that personal beliefs should conform to science and inspire nobility, and that people should atone for their mistakes.

==Allegations of worship==

The main deity in the tentatively Indo-European pantheon of the Yazidis, Melek Taus, is similar to the devil in Christian and Islamic traditions, as he refused to bow down before humanity. Therefore, Christians and Muslims often consider Melek Taus to be Satan. However, rather than being Satanic, Yazidism can be understood as a remnant of a pre-Islamic Middle Eastern Indo-European religion, and/or a ghulat Sufi movement founded by Shaykh Adi. In fact, there is no entity in Yazidism which represents evil in opposition to God; such dualism is rejected by Yazidis.

In the Middle Ages, the Cathars, practitioners of a dualistic religion, were accused of worshipping Satan by the Catholic Church. Pope Gregory IX stated in his work &quot;Vox in Rama&quot; that the Cathars believed that God had erred in casting Lucifer out of heaven and that Lucifer would return to reward his faithful. On the other hand, according to Catharism, the creator god of the material world worshipped by the Catholic Church is actually Satan.

Wicca is a modern, syncretic Neopagan religion, whose practitioners many Christians have incorrectly assumed to worship Satan. In actuality, Wiccans do not believe in the existence of Satan or any analogous figure and have repeatedly and emphatically rejected the notion that they venerate such an entity. 

The cult of the skeletal figure of Santa Muerte, which has grown exponentially in Mexico, has been denounced by the Catholic Church as Devil-worship. However, devotees of Santa Muerte view her as an angel of death created by God, and many of them identify as Catholic.

Much modern folklore about Satanism does not originate from the actual beliefs or practices of theistic or atheistic Satanists, but rather from a mixture of medieval Christian folk beliefs, political or sociological conspiracy theories, and contemporary urban legends. An example is the &quot;Satanic ritual abuse&quot; scare of the 1980s—beginning with the memoir &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;—which depicted Satanism as a vast conspiracy of elites with a predilection for child abuse and human sacrifice. This genre frequently describes Satan as physically incarnating in order to receive worship.

==In culture==
===In literature===
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Satan appears as a giant demon, frozen mid-breast in ice at the center of the Ninth Circle of Hell. Satan has three faces and a pair of bat-like wings affixed under each chin. In his three mouths, Satan gnaws on Brutus, Judas Iscariot, and Cassius, whom Dante regarded as having betrayed the &quot;two greatest heroes of the human race&quot;: Julius Caesar, the founder of the new order of government, and Jesus, the founder of the new order of religion. As Satan beats his wings, he creates a cold wind that continues to freeze the ice surrounding him and the other sinners in the Ninth Circle. Dante and Virgil climb up Satan&#x27;s shaggy legs until gravity is reversed and they fall through the earth into the southern hemisphere.
Satan appears in several stories from &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer, including &quot;The Summoner&#x27;s Prologue&quot;, in which a friar arrives in Hell and sees no other friars, but is told there are millions. Then Satan lifts his tail to reveal that all of the friars live inside his anus. Chaucer&#x27;s description of Satan&#x27;s appearance is clearly based on Dante&#x27;s. The legend of Faust, recorded in the 1589 chapbook &quot;The History of the Damnable Life and the Deserved Death of Doctor John Faustus&quot;, concerns a pact allegedly made by the German scholar Johann Georg Faust with a demon named Mephistopheles agreeing to sell his soul to Satan in exchange for twenty-four years of earthly pleasure. This chapbook became the source for Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus&quot;.

John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; features Satan as its main protagonist. Milton portrays Satan as a tragic antihero destroyed by his own hubris. The poem, which draws extensive inspiration from Greek tragedy, recreates Satan as a complex literary character, who dares to rebel against the &quot;tyranny&quot; of God, in spite of God&#x27;s own omnipotence. The English poet and painter William Blake famously quipped that &quot;The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels &amp; God, and at liberty when of Devils &amp; Hell, is because he was a true poet and of the Devils party without knowing it.&quot; &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, is a retelling of Satan&#x27;s temptation of Jesus in the desert.

William Blake regarded Satan as a model of rebellion against unjust authority and features him in many of his poems and illustrations, including his 1780 book &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, in which Satan is celebrated as the ultimate rebel, the incarnation of human emotion and the epitome of freedom from all forms of reason and orthodoxy. Based on the Biblical passages portraying Satan as the accuser of sin, Blake interpreted Satan as &quot;a promulgator of moral laws&quot;.

===In visual art===

Satan&#x27;s appearance does not appear in the Bible or in early Christian writings, though Paul the Apostle does write that &quot;Satan disguises himself as an angel of light&quot; (). The Devil was never shown in early Christian artwork and may have first appeared in the sixth century in one of the mosaics of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic &quot;Christ the Good Sheppard&quot; features a blue-violet angel at the left hand side of Christ behind three goats.

Depictions of the devil became more common in the ninth century, where he is shown with cloven hooves, hairy legs, the tail of a goat, pointed ears, a beard, a flat nose, and a set of horns. Satan may have first become associated with goats through the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, recorded in , in which Jesus separates sheep (representing the saved) from goats (representing the damned); the damned are thrown into an &quot;everlasting fire&quot; along with Satan and his angels.

Medieval Christians were known to adapt previously existing pagan iconography to suit depictions of Christian figures. Much of Satan&#x27;s traditional iconography in Christianity appears to be derived from Pan, a rustic, goat-legged fertility god in ancient Greek religion. Early Christian writers such as Saint Jerome equated the Greek satyrs and the Roman fauns, whom Pan resembled, with demons. The Devil&#x27;s pitchfork appears to have been adapted from the trident wielded by the Greek god Poseidon and Satan&#x27;s flame-like hair seems to have originated from the Egyptian god Bes. By the High Middle Ages, Satan and devils appear in all works of Christian art: in paintings, sculptures, and on cathedrals. Satan is usually depicted naked, but his genitals are rarely shown and are often covered by animal furs. The goat-like portrayal of Satan was especially closely associated with him in his role as the object of worship by sorcerers and as the incubus, a demon believed to rape human women in their sleep.

Italian frescoes from the late Middle Ages onward frequently show Satan chained in Hell, feeding on the bodies of the perpetually damned. These frescoes are early enough to have inspired Dante&#x27;s portrayal in his &quot;Inferno&quot;. As the serpent in the Garden of Eden, Satan is often shown as a snake with arms and legs as well the head and full-breasted upper torso of a woman. Satan and his demons could take any form in medieval art, but, when appearing in their true form, they were often shown as short, hairy, black-skinned humanoids with clawed and bird feet and extra faces on their chests, bellies, genitals, buttocks, and tails. The modern popular culture image of Satan as a well-dressed gentleman with small horns and a tail originates from portrayals of Mephistopheles in the operas &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; (1846) by Hector Berlioz, &quot;Mefistofele&quot; (1868) by Arrigo Boito, and &quot;Faust&quot; by Charles Gounod.

Illustrations of Satan/Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any satanic figure or heretic, and with a black body, to symbolize his corrupted nature. Another common depiction of Iblis shows him wearing a special head covering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban. In one painting, however, Iblis wears a traditional Islamic head covering. The turban probably refers to a narration of Iblis&#x27; fall: there he wore a turban, then he was sent down from heaven. Many other pictures show and describe Iblis at the moment, when the angels prostrate themselves before Adam. Here, he is usually seen beyond the outcrop, his face transformed with his wings burned, to the envious countenance of a devil. Iblis and his cohorts (&quot;div&quot; or &quot;shayatin&quot;) are often portrayed in Turko-Persian art as bangled creatures with flaming eyes, only covered by a short skirt. Similar to European arts, who took traits of pagan deities to depict devils, they depicted such demons often in a similar fashion to that of Hindu deities.

===In music===

References to Satan in music can be dated back to the Middle Ages. Giuseppe Tartini was inspired to write his most famous work, the Violin Sonata in G minor, also known as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Trill&quot;, after dreaming of the Devil playing the violin. Tartini claimed that the sonata was a lesser imitation of what the Devil had played in his dream. Niccolò Paganini was believed to have derived his musical talent from a deal with the Devil. Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; features a narrative that involves Satan.

In the early 1900s, jazz and blues became known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Music&quot; as they were considered &quot;dangerous and unholy&quot;. According to legend, blues musician Tommy Johnson was a terrible guitarist before exchanging his soul to the Devil for a guitar. Later, Robert Johnson claimed that he had sold his soul in return for becoming a great blues guitarist. Satanic symbolism appears in rock music from the 1960s. Mick Jagger assumes the role of Lucifer in the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (1968), while Black Sabbath portrayed the Devil in numerous songs, including &quot;War Pigs&quot; (1970) and &quot;N.I.B.&quot; (1970).

===In film and television===

The Devil is depicted as a vampire bat in Georges Méliès&#x27; &quot;The Haunted Castle&quot; (1896), which is often considered the first horror film. So-called &quot;Black Masses&quot; have been portrayed in sensationalist B-movies since the 1960s. One of the first films to portray such a ritual was the 1965 film &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, also known as &quot;13&quot;. Alex Sanders, a former black magician, served as a consultant on the film to ensure that the rituals portrayed in it were depicted accurately. Over the next thirty years, the novels of Dennis Wheatley and the films of Hammer Film Productions both played a major role in shaping the popular image of Satanism.

The film version of Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; established made Satanic themes a staple of mainstream horror fiction. Later films such as &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997) feature Satan as an antagonist. The Turkish horror film &quot;Semum&quot; (2008) is based the representation of Satan in Islamic scriptures.

<text>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making specific disciplined use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.

It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages, with the latter including support for block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966, and the publication of the influential &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot; open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, who coined the term &quot;structured programming&quot;.

Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when exception handling has to be performed.

==Elements==

===Control structures===
Following the structured program theorem, all programs are seen as composed of three control structures:
* &quot;Sequence&quot;; ordered statements or subroutines executed in sequence.
* &quot;Selection&quot;; one of a number of statements is executed depending on the state of the program. This is usually expressed with keywords such as codice_1. The conditional statement should have at least one true condition and each condition should have one exit point at max.
* &quot;Iteration&quot;; a statement or block is executed until the program reaches a certain state, or operations have been applied to every element of a collection. This is usually expressed with keywords such as codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 or codice_5. Often it is recommended that each loop should only have one entry point (and in the original structural programming, also only one exit point, and a few languages enforce this).

===Subroutines===
Subroutines; callable units such as procedures, functions, methods, or subprograms are used to allow a sequence to be referred to by a single statement.

===Blocks===
Blocks are used to enable groups of statements to be treated as if they were one statement. &quot;Block-structured&quot; languages have a syntax for enclosing structures in some formal way, such as an if-statement bracketed by codice_6 as in ALGOL 68, or a code section bracketed by codice_7, as in PL/I and Pascal, whitespace indentation as in Python, or the curly braces codice_8 of C and many later languages.

==Structured programming languages==
It is possible to do structured programming in any programming language, though it is preferable to use something like a procedural programming language. Some of the languages initially used for structured programming include: ALGOL, Pascal, PL/I, Ada and RPL but most new procedural programming languages since that time have included features to encourage structured programming, and sometimes deliberately left out features – notably GOTO – in an effort to make unstructured programming more difficult.

&quot;Structured programming&quot; (sometimes known as modular programming) enforces a logical structure on the program being written to make it more efficient and easier to understand and modify.

==History==

===Theoretical foundation===
The structured program theorem provides the theoretical basis of structured programming. It states that three ways of combining programs—sequencing, selection, and iteration—are sufficient to express any computable function. This observation did not originate with the structured programming movement; these structures are sufficient to describe the instruction cycle of a central processing unit, as well as the operation of a Turing machine. Therefore, a processor is always executing a &quot;structured program&quot; in this sense, even if the instructions it reads from memory are not part of a structured program. However, authors usually credit the result to a 1966 paper by Böhm and Jacopini, possibly because Dijkstra cited this paper himself. The structured program theorem does not address how to write and analyze a usefully structured program. These issues were addressed during the late 1960s and early 1970s, with major contributions by Dijkstra, Robert W. Floyd, Tony Hoare, Ole-Johan Dahl, and David Gries.

===Debate===
P. J. Plauger, an early adopter of structured programming, described his reaction to the structured program theorem:

Donald Knuth accepted the principle that programs must be written with provability in mind, but he disagreed with abolishing the GOTO statement, and has continued to use it in his programs. In his 1974 paper, &quot;Structured Programming with Goto Statements&quot;, he gave examples where he believed that a direct jump leads to clearer and more efficient code without sacrificing provability. Knuth proposed a looser structural constraint: It should be possible to draw a program&#x27;s flow chart with all forward branches on the left, all backward branches on the right, and no branches crossing each other. Many of those knowledgeable in compilers and graph theory have advocated allowing only reducible flow graphs.

Structured programming theorists gained a major ally in the 1970s after IBM researcher Harlan Mills applied his interpretation of structured programming theory to the development of an indexing system for &quot;The New York Times&quot; research file. The project was a great engineering success, and managers at other companies cited it in support of adopting structured programming, although Dijkstra criticized the ways that Mills&#x27;s interpretation differed from the published work.

As late as 1987 it was still possible to raise the question of structured programming in a computer science journal. Frank Rubin did so in that year with an open letter titled &quot;&#x27;GOTO Considered Harmful&#x27; Considered Harmful&quot;. Numerous objections followed, including a response from Dijkstra that sharply criticized both Rubin and the concessions other writers made when responding to him.

===Outcome===
By the end of the 20th century, nearly all computer scientists were convinced that it is useful to learn and apply the concepts of structured programming. High-level programming languages that originally lacked programming structures, such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC, now have them.

==Common deviations==

While goto has now largely been replaced by the structured constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), few languages are purely structured. The most common deviation, found in many languages, is the use of a return statement for early exit from a subroutine. This results in multiple exit points, instead of the single exit point required by structured programming. There are other constructions to handle cases that are awkward in purely structured programming.

===Early exit===
The most common deviation from structured programming is early exit from a function or loop. At the level of functions, this is a codice_9 statement. At the level of loops, this is a codice_10 statement (terminate the loop) or codice_11 statement (terminate the current iteration, proceed with next iteration). In structured programming, these can be replicated by adding additional branches or tests, but for returns from nested code this can add significant complexity. C is an early and prominent example of these constructs. Some newer languages also have &quot;labeled breaks&quot;, which allow breaking out of more than just the innermost loop. Exceptions also allow early exit, but have further consequences, and thus are treated below.

Multiple exits can arise for a variety of reasons, most often either that the subroutine has no more work to do (if returning a value, it has completed the calculation), or has encountered &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances that prevent it from continuing, hence needing exception handling.

The most common problem in early exit is that cleanup or final statements are not executed – for example, allocated memory is not deallocated, or open files are not closed, causing memory leaks or resource leaks. These must be done at each return site, which is brittle and can easily result in bugs. For instance, in later development, a return statement could be overlooked by a developer, and an action that should be performed at the end of a subroutine (e.g., a trace statement) might not be performed in all cases. Languages without a return statement, such as standard Pascal and Seed7, do not have this problem.

Most modern languages provide language-level support to prevent such leaks; see detailed discussion at resource management. Most commonly this is done via unwind protection, which ensures that certain code is guaranteed to be run when execution exits a block; this is a structured alternative to having a cleanup block and a codice_12. This is most often known as codice_13 and considered a part of exception handling. In case of multiple codice_9 statements introducing codice_13 without exceptions might look strange. Various techniques exist to encapsulate resource management. An alternative approach, found primarily in C++, is Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, which uses normal stack unwinding (variable deallocation) at function exit to call destructors on local variables to deallocate resources.

Kent Beck, Martin Fowler and co-authors have argued in their refactoring books that nested conditionals may be harder to understand than a certain type of flatter structure using multiple exits predicated by guard clauses. Their 2009 book flatly states that &quot;one exit point is really not a useful rule. Clarity is the key principle: If the method is clearer with one exit point, use one exit point; otherwise don’t&quot;. They offer a cookbook solution for transforming a function consisting only of nested conditionals into a sequence of guarded return (or throw) statements, followed by a single unguarded block, which is intended to contain the code for the common case, while the guarded statements are supposed to deal with the less common ones (or with errors). Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu also argue in their 2004 C++ tips book that the single-exit point is an obsolete requirement.

In his 2004 textbook, David Watt writes that &quot;single-entry multi-exit control flows are often desirable&quot;. Using Tennent&#x27;s framework notion of sequencer, Watt uniformly describes the control flow constructs found in contemporary programming languages and attempts to explain why certain types of sequencers are preferable to others in the context of multi-exit control flows. Watt writes that unrestricted gotos (jump sequencers) are bad because the destination of the jump is not self-explanatory to the reader of a program until the reader finds and examines the actual label or address that is the target of the jump. In contrast, Watt argues that the conceptual intent of a return sequencer is clear from its own context, without having to examine its destination. Watt writes that a class of sequencers known as &quot;escape sequencers&quot;, defined as a &quot;sequencer that terminates execution of a textually enclosing command or procedure&quot;, encompasses both breaks from loops (including multi-level breaks) and return statements. Watt also notes that while jump sequencers (gotos) have been somewhat restricted in languages like C, where the target must be an inside the local block or an encompassing outer block, that restriction alone is not sufficient to make the intent of gotos in C self-describing and so they can still produce &quot;spaghetti code&quot;. Watt also examines how exception sequencers differ from escape and jump sequencers; this is explained in the next section of this article.

In contrast to the above, Bertrand Meyer wrote in his 2009 textbook that instructions like codice_10 and codice_11 &quot;are just the old codice_12 in sheep&#x27;s clothing&quot; and strongly advised against their use.

=== Exception handling ===
Based on the coding error from the Ariane 501 disaster, software developer Jim Bonang argues that any exceptions thrown from a function violate the single-exit paradigm, and proposes that all inter-procedural exceptions should be forbidden. Bonang proposes that all single-exit conforming C++ should be written along the lines of:
bool MyCheck1() throw() {
 bool success = false;
 try {
 // Do something that may throw exceptions.
 if (!MyCheck2()) {
 throw SomeInternalException();
 // Other code similar to the above.
 success = true;
 } catch (...) {
 // All exceptions caught and logged.
 return success;


Peter Ritchie also notes that, in principle, even a single codice_19 right before the codice_9 in a function constitutes a violation of the single-exit principle, but argues that Dijkstra&#x27;s rules were written in a time before exception handling became a paradigm in programming languages, so he proposes to allow any number of throw points in addition to a single return point. He notes that solutions that wrap exceptions for the sake of creating a single-exit have higher nesting depth and thus are more difficult to comprehend, and even accuses those who propose to apply such solutions to programming languages that support exceptions of engaging in cargo cult thinking.

David Watt also analyzes exception handling in the framework of sequencers (introduced in this article in the previous section on early exits.) Watt notes that an abnormal situation (generally exemplified with arithmetic overflows or input/output failures like file not found) is a kind of error that &quot;is detected in some low-level program unit, but [for which] a handler is more naturally located in a high-level program unit&quot;. For example, a program might contain several calls to read files, but the action to perform when a file is not found depends on the meaning (purpose) of the file in question to the program and thus a handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located in low-level system code. Watts further notes that introducing status flags testing in the caller, as single-exit structured programming or even (multi-exit) return sequencers would entail, results in a situation where &quot;the application code tends to get cluttered by tests of status flags&quot; and that &quot;the programmer might forgetfully or lazily omit to test a status flag. In fact, abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored!&quot; He notes that in contrast to status flags testing, exceptions have the opposite default behavior, causing the program to terminate unless the programmer explicitly deals with the exception in some way, possibly by adding code to willfully ignore it. Based on these arguments, Watt concludes that jump sequencers or escape sequencers (discussed in the previous section) are not as suitable as a dedicated exception sequencer with the semantics discussed above.

The textbook by Louden and Lambert emphasizes that exception handling differs from structured programming constructs like codice_2 loops because the transfer of control &quot;is set up at a different point in the program than that where the actual transfer takes place. At the point where the transfer actually occurs, there may be no syntactic indication that control will in fact be transferred.&quot; Computer science professor Arvind Kumar Bansal also notes that in languages which implement exception handling, even control structures like codice_4, which have the single-exit property in absence of exceptions, no longer have it in presence of exceptions, because an exception can prematurely cause an early exit in any part of the control structure; for instance if codice_23 throws an exception in codice_24, then the usual exit point after check() is not reached. Citing multiple prior studies by others (1999–2004) and their own results, Westley Weimer and George Necula wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they &quot;create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about&quot;.

The necessity to limit code to single-exit points appears in some contemporary programming environments focused on parallel computing, such as OpenMP. The various parallel constructs from OpenMP, like codice_25, do not allow early exits from inside to the outside of the parallel construct; this restriction includes all manner of exits, from codice_10 to C++ exceptions, but all of these are permitted inside the parallel construct if the jump target is also inside it.

===Multiple entry===

More rarely, subprograms allow multiple &quot;entry.&quot; This is most commonly only &quot;re&quot;-entry into a coroutine (or generator/semicoroutine), where a subprogram yields control (and possibly a value), but can then be resumed where it left off. There are a number of common uses of such programming, notably for streams (particularly input/output), state machines, and concurrency. From a code execution point of view, yielding from a coroutine is closer to structured programming than returning from a subroutine, as the subprogram has not actually terminated, and will continue when called again – it is not an early exit. However, coroutines mean that multiple subprograms have execution state – rather than a single call stack of subroutines – and thus introduce a different form of complexity.

It is very rare for subprograms to allow entry to an arbitrary position in the subprogram, as in this case the program state (such as variable values) is uninitialized or ambiguous, and this is very similar to a goto.

===State machines===
Some programs, particularly parsers and communications protocols, have a number of states that follow each other in a way that is not easily reduced to the basic structures, and some programmers implement the state-changes with a jump to the new state. This type of state-switching is often used in the Linux kernel.

However, it is possible to structure these systems by making each state-change a separate subprogram and using a variable to indicate the active state (see trampoline). Alternatively, these can be implemented via coroutines, which dispense with the trampoline.

<doc id="27696" wikidata="Q1570432" url="?curid=27696" title="Semiconductor device fabrication">
<text>Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture semiconductor devices, typically integrated circuits (ICs) such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, and memories (such as RAM and flash memory). It is a multiple-step photolithographic and physico-chemical process (with steps such as thermal oxidation, thin-film deposition, ion-implantation, etching) during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer, typically made of pure single-crystal semiconducting material. Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications.

The fabrication process is performed in highly specialized semiconductor fabrication plants, also called foundries or &quot;fabs&quot;, with the central part being the &quot;clean room&quot;. In more advanced semiconductor devices, such as modern 14/10/7 nm nodes, fabrication can take up to 15 weeks, with 11–13 weeks being the industry average. Production in advanced fabrication facilities is completely automated, with automated material handling systems taking care of the transport of wafers from machine to machine.

A wafer often has several integrated circuits which are called dies as they are pieces diced from a single wafer. Individual dies are separated from a finished wafer in a process called die singulation, also called wafer dicing. The dies can then undergo further assembly and packaging.

Within fabrication plants, the wafers are transported inside special sealed plastic boxes called FOUPs. FOUPs in many fabs contain an internal nitrogen atmosphere which helps prevent copper from oxidizing on the wafers. Copper is used in modern semiconductors for wiring. The insides of the processing equipment and FOUPs is kept cleaner than the surrounding air in the cleanroom. This internal atmosphere is known as a mini-environment and helps improve yield which is the amount of working devices on a wafer. This mini environment is within an EFEM (equipment front end module) which allows a machine to receive FOUPs, and introduces wafers from the FOUPs into the machine. Additionally many machines also handle wafers in clean nitrogen or vacuum environments to reduce contamination and improve process control. Fabrication plants need large amounts of liquid nitrogen to maintain the atmosphere inside production machinery and FOUPs, which are constantly purged with nitrogen. There can also be an air curtain or a mesh between the FOUP and the EFEM which helps reduce the amount of humidity that enters the FOUP and improves yield. 

Companies that manufacture machines used in the industrial semiconductor fabrication process include ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron and Lam Research.

==Feature size==



Feature size is determined by the width of the smallest lines that can be patterned in a semiconductor fabrication process, this measurement is known as the linewidth. Patterning often refers to photolithography which allows a device design or pattern to be defined on the device during fabrication. F2 is used as a measurement of area for different parts of a semiconductor device, based on the feature size of a semiconductor manufacturing process. Many semiconductor devices are designed in sections called cells, and each cell represents a small part of the device such as a memory cell to store data. Thus F2 is used to measure the area taken up by these cells or sections.

A specific semiconductor process has specific rules on the minimum size (width or CD/Critical Dimension) and spacing for features on each layer of the chip.
Normally a new semiconductor process has smaller minimum sizes and tighter spacing. In some cases, this allows a simple die shrink of a currently produced chip design to reduce costs, improve performance, and increase transistor density (number of transistors per unit area) without the expense of a new design.

Early semiconductor processes had arbitrary names for generations (viz., HMOS I/II/III/IV and CHMOS III/III-E/IV/V). Later each new generation process became known as a technology node or process node, designated by the process&#x27; minimum feature size in nanometers (or historically micrometers) of the process&#x27;s transistor gate length, such as the &quot;90 nm process&quot;. However, this has not been the case since 1994, and the number of nanometers used to name process nodes (see the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) has become more of a marketing term that has no standardized relation with functional feature sizes or with transistor density (number of transistors per unit area).

Initially transistor gate length was smaller than that suggested by the process node name (e.g. 350 nm node); however this trend reversed in 2009. Feature sizes can have no connection to the nanometers (nm) used in marketing.
For example, Intel&#x27;s former 10 nm process actually has features (the tips of FinFET fins) with a width of 7 nm, so the Intel 10 nm process is similar in transistor density to TSMC&#x27;s 7 nm process. As another example, GlobalFoundries&#x27; 12 and 14 nm processes have similar feature sizes.

==History==
===20th century===

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick, working at Bell Telephone Laboratories, accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide transistors; the first planar field effect transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. At Bell Labs, the importance of their discoveries was immediately realized. Memos describing the results of their work circulated around Bell Labs before being formally published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni, who would later invent the planar process in 1959 while at Fairchild Semiconductor.

In 1948, Bardeen patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer; Bardeen&#x27;s concept forms the basis of MOSFET technology today. An improved type of MOSFET technology, CMOS, was developed by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963. CMOS was commercialised by RCA in the late 1960s. RCA commercially used CMOS for its 4000-series integrated circuits in 1968, starting with a 20μm process before gradually scaling to a 10 μm process over the next several years. Many early semiconductor device manufacturers developed and built their own equipment such as ion implanters.

In 1963, Harold M. Manasevit was the first to document epitaxial growth of silicon on sapphire while working at the Autonetics division of North American Aviation (now Boeing). In 1964, he published his findings with colleague William Simpson in the &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;. In 1965, C.W. Mueller and P.H. Robinson fabricated a MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) using the silicon-on-sapphire process at RCA Laboratories.

Semiconductor device manufacturing has since spread from Texas and California in the 1960s to the rest of the world, including Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 

Wafer size has grown over time, from 25 mm (1 inch) in 1960, to 50 mm (2 inches) in 1969, 100 mm (4 inches) in 1976, 125 mm (5 inches) in 1981, 150 mm (6 inches) in 1983 and 200 mm in 1992.

In the era of 2-inch wafers, these were handled manually using tweezers and held manually for the time required for a given process. Tweezers were replaced by vacuum wands as they generate fewer particles which can contaminate the wafers. Wafer carriers or cassettes, which can hold several wafers at once, were developed to carry several wafers between process steps, but wafers had to be individually removed from the carrier, processed and returned to the carrier, so acid-resistant carriers were developed to eliminate this time consuming process, so the entire cassette with wafers was dipped into wet etching and wet cleaning tanks. When wafer sizes increased to 100 mm, the entire cassette would often not be dipped as uniformly, and the quality of the results across the wafer became hard to control. By the time 150 mm wafers arrived, the cassettes were not dipped and were only used as wafer carriers and holders to store wafers, and robotics became prevalent for handling wafers. With 200 mm wafers manual handling of wafer cassettes becomes risky as they are heavier.

In the 1970s, several companies migrated their semiconductor manufacturing technology from bipolar to MOSFET technology. Semiconductor manufacturing equipment has been considered costly since 1978.

In 1984, KLA developed the first automatic reticle and photomask inspection tool. In 1985, KLA developed an automatic inspection tool for silicon wafers, which replaced manual microscope inspection.

In 1985, SGS (now STmicroelectronics) invented BCD, also called BCDMOS, a semiconductor manufacturing process using bipolar, CMOS and DMOS devices. Applied Materials developed the first practical multi chamber, or cluster wafer processing tool, the Precision 5000.

Until the 1980s, physical vapor deposition was the primary technique used for depositing materials onto wafers, until the advent of chemical vapor deposition. Equipment with diffusion pumps was replaced with those using turbomolecular pumps as the latter do not use oil which often contaminated wafers during processing in vacuum.

200 mm diameter wafers were first used in 1990 and became the standard until the introduction of 300 mm diameter wafers in 2000. Bridge tools were used in the transition from 150 mm wafers to 200 mm wafers and in the transition from 200 mm to 300 mm wafers. The semiconductor industry has adopted larger wafers to cope with the increased demand for chips as larger wafers provide more surface area per wafer. Over time, the industry shifted to 300 mm wafers which brought along the adoption of FOUPs, but many products that are not advanced are still produced in 200 mm wafers such as analog ICs, RF chips, power ICs, BCDMOS and MEMS devices. 

Some processes such as cleaning, ion implantation, etching, annealing and oxidation started to adopt single wafer processing instead of batch wafer processing in order to improve the reproducibility of results. A similar trend existed in MEMS manufacturing. In 1998, Applied Materials introduced the Producer, a cluster tool that had chambers grouped in pairs for processing wafers, which shared common vacuum and supply lines but were otherwise isolated, which was revolutionary at the time as it offered higher productivity than other cluster tools without sacrificing quality, due to the isolated chamber design.

===21st century===

The semiconductor industry is a global business today. The leading semiconductor manufacturers typically have facilities all over the world. Samsung Electronics, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of semiconductors, has facilities in South Korea and the US. Intel, the second-largest manufacturer, has facilities in Europe and Asia as well as the US. TSMC, the world&#x27;s largest pure play foundry, has facilities in Taiwan, China, Singapore, and the US. Qualcomm and Broadcom are among the biggest fabless semiconductor companies, outsourcing their production to companies like TSMC. They also have facilities spread in different countries. As the average utilization of semiconductor devices increased, durability became an issue and manufacturers started to design their devices to ensure they last for enough time, and this depends on the market the device is designed for. This especially became a problem at the 10 nm node.

Silicon on insulator (SOI) technology has been used in AMD&#x27;s 130 nm, 90 nm, 65 nm, 45 nm and 32 nm single, dual, quad, six and eight core processors made since 2001. During the transition from 200 mm to 300 mm wafers in 2001, many bridge tools were used which could process both 200 mm and 300 mm wafers. At the time, 18 companies could manufacture chips in the leading edge 130nm process.

In 2006, 450 mm wafers were expected to be adopted in 2012, and 675 mm wafers were expected to be used by 2021.
Since 2009, &quot;node&quot; has become a commercial name for marketing purposes that indicates new generations of process technologies, without any relation to gate length, metal pitch or gate pitch. For example, GlobalFoundries&#x27; 7 nm process was similar to Intel&#x27;s 10 nm process, thus the conventional notion of a process node has become blurred. Additionally, TSMC and Samsung&#x27;s 10 nm processes are only slightly denser than Intel&#x27;s 14 nm in transistor density. They are actually much closer to Intel&#x27;s 14 nm process than they are to Intel&#x27;s 10 nm process (e.g. Samsung&#x27;s 10 nm processes&#x27; fin pitch is the exact same as that of Intel&#x27;s 14 nm process: 42 nm). Intel has changed the name of its 10 nm process to position it as a 7 nm process. As transistors become smaller, new effects start to influence design decisions such as self-heating of the transistors, and other effects such as electromigration have become more evident since the 16nm node.

In 2011, Intel demonstrated Fin field-effect transistors (FinFETs), where the gate surrounds the channel on three sides, allowing for increased energy efficiency and lower gate delay—and thus greater performance—over planar transistors at the 22nm node, because planar transistors which only have one surface acting as a channel, started to suffer from short channel effects. A startup called SuVolta created a technology called Deeply Depleted Channel (DDC) to compete with FinFET transistors, which uses planar transistors at the 65 nm node which are very lightly doped.

By 2018, a number of transistor architectures had been proposed for the eventual replacement of FinFET, most of which were based on the concept of GAAFET: horizontal and vertical nanowires, horizontal nanosheet transistors (Samsung MBCFET, Intel Nanoribbon), vertical FET (VFET) and other vertical transistors, complementary FET (CFET), stacked FET, vertical TFETs, FinFETs with III-V semiconductor materials (III-V FinFET), several kinds of horizontal gate-all-around transistors such as nano-ring, hexagonal wire, square wire, and round wire gate-all-around transistors and negative-capacitance FET (NC-FET) which uses drastically different materials. FD-SOI was seen as a potential low cost alternative to FinFETs.

As of 2019, 14 nanometer and 10 nanometer chips are in mass production by Intel, UMC, TSMC, Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix, Toshiba Memory and GlobalFoundries, with 7 nanometer process chips in mass production by TSMC and Samsung, although their 7 nanometer node definition is similar to Intel&#x27;s 10 nanometer process. The 5 nanometer process began being produced by Samsung in 2018. As of 2019, the node with the highest transistor density is TSMC&#x27;s 5nanometer N5 node, with a density of 171.3million transistors per square millimeter. In 2019, Samsung and TSMC announced plans to produce 3 nanometer nodes. GlobalFoundries has decided to stop the development of new nodes beyond 12 nanometers in order to save resources, as it has determined that setting up a new fab to handle sub-12 nm orders would be beyond the company&#x27;s financial abilities.

From 2020 to 2022, there was a global chip shortage. During this shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many semiconductor manufacturers banned employees from leaving company grounds. Many countries granted subsidies to semiconductor companies for building new fabrication plants or fabs. Many companies were affected by counterfeit chips. Semiconductors have become vital to the world economy and the national security of some countries. The US has asked TSMC to not produce semiconductors for Huawei, a Chinese company. CFET transistors were explored, which stacks NMOS and PMOS transistors on top of each other. Two approaches were evaluated for constructing these transistors: a monolithic approach which built both types of transistors in one process, and a sequential approach which built the two types of transistors separately and then stacked them.

==List of steps==

This is a list of processing techniques that are employed numerous times throughout the construction of a modern electronic device; this list does not necessarily imply a specific order, nor that all techniques are taken during manufacture as, in practice the order and which techniques are applied, are often specific to process offerings by foundries, or specific to an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) for their own products, and a semiconductor device might not need all techniques. Equipment for carrying out these processes is made by a handful of companies. All equipment needs to be tested before a semiconductor fabrication plant is started. These processes are done after integrated circuit design. A semiconductor fab operates 24/7 and many fabs use large amounts of water, primarily for rinsing the chips.

==Prevention of contamination and defects==

When feature widths were far greater than about 10 micrometres, semiconductor purity was not as big of an issue as it is today in device manufacturing. In the 1960s, workers could work on semiconductor devices in street clothing. As devices become more integrated, cleanrooms must become even cleaner. Today, fabrication plants are pressurized with filtered air to remove even the smallest particles, which could come to rest on the wafers and contribute to defects. The ceilings of semiconductor cleanrooms have fan filter units (FFUs) at regular intervals to constantly replace and filter the air in the cleanroom; semiconductor capital equipment may also have their own FFUs to clean air in the equipment&#x27;s EFEM which allows the equipment to receive wafers in FOUPs. The FFUs, combined with raised floors with grills, help ensure a laminar air flow, to ensure that particles are immediately brought down to the floor and do not stay suspended in the air due to turbulence. The workers in a semiconductor fabrication facility are required to wear cleanroom suits to protect the devices from contamination by humans. To increase yield, FOUPs and semiconductor capital equipment may have a mini environment with ISO class 1 level of dust, and FOUPs can have an even cleaner micro environment. FOUPs and SMIF pods isolate the wafers from the air in the cleanroom, increasing yield because they reduce the number of defects caused by dust particles. Also, fabs have as few people as possible in the cleanroom to make maintaining the cleanroom environment easier, since people, even when wearing cleanroom suits, shed large amounts of particles, especially when walking.

==Wafers==

A typical wafer is made out of extremely pure silicon that is grown into mono-crystalline cylindrical ingots (boules) up to 300 mm (slightly less than 12 inches) in diameter using the Czochralski process. These ingots are then sliced into wafers about 0.75 mm thick and polished to obtain a very regular and flat surface. During the production process wafers are often grouped into lots, which are represented by a FOUP, SMIF or a wafer cassette, which are wafer carriers. FOUPs and SMIFs can be transported in the fab between machines and equipment with an automated OHT (Overhead Hoist Transport) AMHS (Automated Material Handling System). Besides SMIFs and FOUPs, wafer cassettes can be placed in a wafer box or a wafer carrying box.

==Processing==

In semiconductor device fabrication, the various processing steps fall into four general categories: deposition, removal, patterning, and modification of electrical properties.
* &quot;Deposition&quot; is any process that grows, coats, or otherwise transfers a material onto the wafer. Available technologies include physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrochemical deposition (ECD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and more recently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) among others. Deposition can be understood to include oxide layer formation, by thermal oxidation or, more specifically, LOCOS.
* &quot;Removal&quot; is any process that removes material from the wafer; examples include etch processes (either wet or dry) and chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP).
* &quot;Patterning&quot; is the shaping or altering of deposited materials, and is generally referred to as lithography. For example, in conventional lithography, the wafer is coated with a chemical called a &quot;photoresist&quot;; then, a machine called an aligner or &quot;stepper&quot; focuses a mask image on the wafer using short-wavelength light; the exposed regions (for &quot;positive&quot; resist) are washed away by a developer solution. The wafer then undergoes etching where materials not protected by the mask are removed. After removal or other processing, the remaining photoresist is removed by &quot;dry&quot; stripping/plasma ashing/resist ashing or by &quot;wet&quot; resist stripper chemistry. Wet etching was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, but it was replaced by dry etching/plasma etching starting at the 10 micron to 3 micron nodes. This is because wet etching makes undercuts (etching under mask layers or resist layers with patterns). Dry etching has become the dominant etching technique.
* &quot;Modification of electrical properties&quot; has historically entailed doping transistor &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;drains&quot; and polysilicon. Doping consists of introducing impurities into the atomic structure of a semiconductor material, in order to modify its electrical properties. Initially thermal diffusion with furnaces at 900-1200°C with gases containing dopants were used for doping wafers and there was resistance against ion implantation as it still required a separate furnace but ion implantation ultimately prevailed in the 1970s as it offers better reproducibility of results. Ion implantation is practical because of the high sensitivity of semiconductor devices to foreign atoms, as ion implantation does not deposit large numbers of atoms. Doping processes with ion implantation are followed by furnace annealing or, in advanced devices, by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) to activate the dopants. Annealing was initially done at 500 to 700°C, but this was later increased to 900 to 1100°C. Implanters can either process a single wafer at a time or several, up to 17, mounted on a rotating disk.

Modification of electrical properties now also extends to the reduction of a material&#x27;s dielectric constant in low-κ insulators via exposure to ultraviolet light in UV processing (UVP). Modification is frequently achieved by oxidation, which can be carried out to create semiconductor-insulator junctions, such as in the local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) to fabricate metal oxide field effect transistors. Modern chips have up to eleven or more metal levels produced in over 300 or more sequenced processing steps. 

A recipe in semiconductor manufacturing is a list of conditions under which a wafer will be processed by a particular machine in a processing step during manufacturing. Process variability is a challenge in semiconductor processing, in which wafers are not processed evenly or the quality or effectiveness of processes carried out on a wafer are not even across the wafer surface.

===Front-end-of-line (FEOL) processing===
Wafer processing is separated into FEOL and BEOL stages. FEOL processing refers to the formation of the transistors directly in the silicon. The raw wafer is engineered by the growth of an ultrapure, virtually defect-free silicon layer through epitaxy. In the most advanced logic devices, &quot;prior&quot; to the silicon epitaxy step, tricks are performed to improve the performance of the transistors to be built. One method involves introducing a &quot;straining step&quot; wherein a silicon variant such as silicon-germanium (SiGe) is deposited. Once the epitaxial silicon is deposited, the crystal lattice becomes stretched somewhat, resulting in improved electronic mobility. Another method, called &quot;silicon on insulator&quot; technology involves the insertion of an insulating layer between the raw silicon wafer and the thin layer of subsequent silicon epitaxy. This method results in the creation of transistors with reduced parasitic effects. Semiconductor equipment may have several chambers which process wafers in processes such as deposition and etching. Many pieces of equipment handle wafers between these chambers in an internal nitrogen or vacuum environment to improve process control. Wet benches with tanks containing chemical solutions were historically used for cleaning and etching wafers.

At the 90nm node, transistor channels made with strain engineering were introduced to improve drive current in PMOS transistors by introducing regions with Silicon-Germanium in the transistor. The same was done in NMOS transistors at the 20nm node.

In 2007, HKMG (high-k/metal gate) transistors were introduced by Intel at the 45nm node, which replaced polysilicon gates which in turn replaced metal gate (aluminum gate) technology in the 1970s. High-k dielectric such as hafnium oxide (HfO2) replaced silicon oxynitride (SiON), in order to prevent large amounts of leakage current in the transistor while allowing for continued scaling or shrinking of the transistors. However HfO2 is not compatible with polysilicon gates which requires the use of a metal gate. Two approaches were used in production: gate-first and gate-last. Gate-first consists of depositing the high-k dielectric and then the gate metal such as Tantalum nitride whose workfunction depends on whether the transistor is NMOS or PMOS, polysilicon deposition, gate line patterning, source and drain ion implantation, dopant anneal, and silicidation of the polysilicon and the source and drain. In DRAM memories this technology was first adopted in 2015.

Gate-last consisted of first depositing the High-κ dielectric, creating dummy gates, manufacturing sources and drains by ion deposition and dopant annealing, depositing an &quot;interlevel dielectric (ILD)&quot; and then polishing, and removing the dummy gates to replace them with a metal whose workfunction depended on whether the transistor was NMOS or PMOS, thus creating the metal gate. A third process, full silicidation (FUSI) was not pursued due to manufacturing problems. Gate-first became dominant at the 22nm/20nm node. HKMG has been extended from planar transistors for use in FinFET and nanosheet transistors. Hafnium silicon
oxynitride can also be used instead of Hafnium oxide. 

Since the 16nm/14nm node, Atomic layer etching (ALE) is increasingly used for etching as it offers higher precision than other etching methods. In production, plasma ALE is commonly used, which removes materials unidirectionally, creating structures with vertical walls. Thermal ALE can also be used to remove materials isotropically, in all directions at the same time but without the capability to create vertical walls. Plasma ALE was initially adopted for etching contacts in transistors, and since the 7nm node it is also used to create transistor structures by etching them.

====Gate oxide and implants====

Front-end surface engineering is followed by growth of the gate dielectric (traditionally silicon dioxide), patterning of the gate, patterning of the source and drain regions, and subsequent implantation or diffusion of dopants to obtain the desired complementary electrical properties. In dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) devices, storage capacitors are also fabricated at this time, typically stacked above the access transistor (the now defunct DRAM manufacturer Qimonda implemented these capacitors with trenches etched deep into the silicon surface).

===Back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing===
====Metal layers====
Once the various semiconductor devices have been created, they must be interconnected to form the desired electrical circuits. This occurs in a series of wafer processing steps collectively referred to as BEOL (not to be confused with &quot;back end&quot; of chip fabrication, which refers to the packaging and testing stages). BEOL processing involves creating metal interconnecting wires that are isolated by dielectric layers. The insulating material has traditionally been a form of SiO2 or a silicate glass, but recently new low dielectric constant materials, also called low-κ dielectrics, are being used (such as silicon oxycarbide), typically providing dielectric constants around 2.7 (compared to 3.82 for SiO2), although materials with constants as low as 2.2 are being offered to chipmakers. 

BEoL has been used since 1995 at the 350nm and 250nm nodes (0.35 and 0.25 micron nodes), at the same time chemical mechanical polishing began to be employed. At the time, 2 metal layers for interconnect, also called metallization was state-of-the-art.

Since the 22nm node, some manufacturers have added a new process called middle-of-line (MOL) which connects the transistors to the rest of the interconnect made in the BEoL process. The MOL is often based on tungsten and has upper and lower layers: the lower layer connects the junctions of the transistors, and an upper layer which is a tungsten plug that connects the transistors to the interconnect. Intel at the 10nm node introduced contact-over-active-gate (COAG) which, instead of placing the contact for connecting the transistor close to the gate of the transistor, places it directly over the gate of the transistor to improve transistor density.

====Interconnect====

Historically, the metal wires have been composed of aluminum. In this approach to wiring (often called &quot;subtractive aluminum&quot;), blanket films of aluminum are deposited first, patterned, and then etched, leaving isolated wires. Dielectric material is then deposited over the exposed wires. The various metal layers are interconnected by etching holes (called &quot;&quot;vias&quot;)&quot; in the insulating material and then depositing tungsten in them with a CVD technique using tungsten hexafluoride; this approach can still be (and often is) used in the fabrication of many memory chips such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), because the number of interconnect levels can be small (no more than four). The aluminum was sometimes alloyed with copper for preventing recrystallization. Gold was also used in interconnects in early chips.

More recently, as the number of interconnect levels for logic has substantially increased due to the large number of transistors that are now interconnected in a modern microprocessor, the timing delay in the wiring has become so significant as to prompt a change in wiring material (from aluminum to copper interconnect layer) alongside a change in dielectric material in the interconnect (from silicon dioxides to newer low-κ insulators). This performance enhancement also comes at a reduced cost via damascene processing, which eliminates processing steps. As the number of interconnect levels increases, planarization of the previous layers is required to ensure a flat surface prior to subsequent lithography. Without it, the levels would become increasingly crooked, extending outside the depth of focus of available lithography, and thus interfering with the ability to pattern. CMP (chemical-mechanical planarization) is the primary processing method to achieve such planarization, although dry &quot;etch back&quot; is still sometimes employed when the number of interconnect levels is no more than three. Copper interconnects use an electrically conductive barrier layer to prevent the copper from diffusing into (&quot;poisoning&quot;) its surroundings, often made of tantalum nitride. In 1997, IBM was the first to adopt copper interconnects.

In 2014, Applied Materials proposed the use of cobalt in interconnects at the 22nm node, used for encapsulating copper interconnects in cobalt to prevent electromigration, replacing tantalum nitride since it needs to be thicker than cobalt in this application.

==Wafer metrology==
The highly serialized nature of wafer processing has increased the demand for metrology in between the various processing steps. For example, thin film metrology based on ellipsometry or reflectometry is used to tightly control the thickness of gate oxide, as well as the thickness, refractive index, and extinction coefficient of photoresist and other coatings. Wafer metrology equipment/tools, or wafer inspection tools are used to verify that the wafers haven&#x27;t been damaged by previous processing steps up until testing; if too many dies on one wafer have failed, the entire wafer is scrapped to avoid the costs of further processing. Virtual metrology has been used to predict wafer properties based on statistical methods without performing the physical measurement itself.

==Device test==
Once the front-end process has been completed, the semiconductor devices or chips are subjected to a variety of electrical tests to determine if they function properly. The percent of devices on the wafer found to perform properly is referred to as the yield. Manufacturers are typically secretive about their yields, but it can be as low as 30%, meaning that only 30% of the chips on the wafer work as intended. Process variation is one among many reasons for low yield. Testing is carried out to prevent faulty chips from being assembled into relatively expensive packages.

The yield is often but not necessarily related to device (die or chip) size. As an example, in December 2019, TSMC announced an average yield of ~80%, with a peak yield per wafer of &gt;90% for their 5nm test chips with a die size of 17.92 mm2. The yield went down to 32% with an increase in die size to 100 mm2. The number of killer defects on a wafer, regardless of die size, can be noted as the defect density (or D0) of the wafer per unit area, usually cm2.

The fab tests the chips on the wafer with an electronic tester that presses tiny probes against the chip. The machine marks each bad chip with a drop of dye. Currently, electronic dye marking is possible if wafer test data (results) are logged into a central computer database and chips are &quot;binned&quot; (i.e. sorted into virtual bins) according to predetermined test limits such as maximum operating frequencies/clocks, number of working (fully functional) cores per chip, etc. The resulting binning data can be graphed, or logged, on a wafer map to trace manufacturing defects and mark bad chips. This map can also be used during wafer assembly and packaging. Binning allows chips that would otherwise be rejected to be reused in lower-tier products, as is the case with GPUs and CPUs, increasing device yield, especially since very few chips are fully functional (have all cores functioning correctly, for example). eFUSEs may be used to disconnect parts of chips such as cores, either because they did not work as intended during binning, or as part of market segmentation (using the same chip for low, mid and high-end tiers). Chips may have spare parts to allow the chip to fully pass testing even if it has several non-working parts.

Chips are also tested again after packaging, as the bond wires may be missing, or analog performance may be altered by the package. This is referred to as the &quot;final test&quot;. Chips may also be imaged using x-rays.

Usually, the fab charges for testing time, with prices on the order of cents per second. Testing times vary from a few milliseconds to a couple of seconds, and the test software is optimized for reduced testing time. Multiple chip (multi-site) testing is also possible because many testers have the resources to perform most or all of the tests in parallel and on several chips at once.

Chips are often designed with &quot;testability features&quot; such as scan chains or a &quot;built-in self-test&quot; to speed testing and reduce testing costs. In certain designs that use specialized analog fab processes, wafers are also laser-trimmed during testing, in order to achieve tightly distributed resistance values as specified by the design.

Good designs try to test and statistically manage &quot;corners&quot; (extremes of silicon behavior caused by a high operating temperature combined with the extremes of fab processing steps). Most designs cope with at least 64 corners.

==Device yield==
Device yield or die yield is the number of working chips or dies on a wafer, given in percentage since the number of chips on a wafer (Die per wafer, DPW) can vary depending on the chips&#x27; size and the wafer&#x27;s diameter. Yield degradation is a reduction in yield, which historically was mainly caused by dust particles, however since the 1990s, yield degradation is mainly caused by process variation, the process itself and by the tools used in chip manufacturing, although dust still remains a problem in many older fabs. Dust particles have an increasing effect on yield as feature sizes are shrunk with newer processes. Automation and the use of mini environments inside of production equipment, FOUPs and SMIFs have enabled a reduction in defects caused by dust particles. Device yield must be kept high to reduce the selling price of the working chips since working chips have to pay for those chips that failed, and to reduce the cost of wafer processing. Yield can also be affected by the design and operation of the fab.

Tight control over contaminants and the production process are necessary to increase yield. Contaminants may be chemical contaminants or be dust particles. &quot;Killer defects&quot; are those caused by dust particles that cause complete failure of the device (such as a transistor). There are also harmless defects. A particle needs to be 1/5 the size of a feature to cause a killer defect. So if a feature is 100 nm across, a particle only needs to be 20 nm across to cause a killer defect. Electrostatic electricity can also affect yield adversely. Chemical contaminants or impurities include heavy metals such as iron, copper, nickel, zinc, chromium, gold, mercury and silver, alkali metals such as sodium, potassium and lithium, and elements such as aluminum, magnesium, calcium, chlorine, sulfur, carbon, and fluorine. It is important for these elements to not remain in contact with the silicon, as they could reduce yield. Chemical mixtures may be used to remove these elements from the silicon; different mixtures are effective against different elements.

Several models are used to estimate yield. They are Murphy&#x27;s model, Poisson&#x27;s model, the binomial model, Moore&#x27;s model and Seeds&#x27; model. There is no universal model; a model has to be chosen based on actual yield distribution (the location of defective chips). For example, Murphy&#x27;s model assumes that yield loss occurs more at the edges of the wafer (non-working chips are concentrated on the edges of the wafer), Poisson&#x27;s model assumes that defective dies are spread relatively evenly across the wafer, and Seeds&#x27;s model assumes that defective dies are clustered together.

Smaller dies cost less to produce (since more fit on a wafer, and wafers are processed and priced as a whole), and can help achieve higher yields since smaller dies have a lower chance of having a defect, due to their lower surface area on the wafer. However, smaller dies require smaller features to achieve the same functions of larger dies or surpass them, and smaller features require reduced process variation and increased purity (reduced contamination) to maintain high yields. Metrology tools are used to inspect the wafers during the production process and predict yield, so wafers predicted to have too many defects may be scrapped to save on processing costs.

==Die preparation==

Once tested, a wafer is typically reduced in thickness in a process also known as &quot;backlap&quot;, &quot;backfinish&quot;, &quot;wafer backgrind&quot; or &quot;wafer thinning&quot; before the wafer is scored and then broken into individual dies, a process known as wafer dicing. Only the good, unmarked chips are packaged.

==Packaging==
After the dies are tested for functionality and binned, they are packaged. Plastic or ceramic packaging involves mounting the die, connecting the die/bond pads to the pins on the package, and sealing the die. Tiny bondwires are used to connect the pads to the pins. In the &#x27;old days&#x27; (1970s), wires were attached by hand, but now specialized machines perform the task. Traditionally, these wires have been composed of gold, leading to a lead frame (pronounced &quot;leed frame&quot;) of solder-plated copper; lead is poisonous, so lead-free &quot;lead frames&quot; are now mandated by RoHS. Traditionally the bond pads are located on the edges of the die, however, Flip-chip packaging can be used to place bond pads across the entire surface of the die.

Chip scale package (CSP) is another packaging technology. A plastic dual in-line package, like most packages, is many times larger than the actual die hidden inside, whereas CSP chips are nearly the size of the die; a CSP can be constructed for each die &quot;before&quot; the wafer is diced.

The packaged chips are retested to ensure that they were not damaged during packaging and that the die-to-pin interconnect operation was performed correctly. A laser then etches the chip&#x27;s name and numbers on the package. The steps involving testing and packaging of dies, followed by final testing of finished, packaged chips, are called the back end, post-fab, ATMP (Assembly, Test, Marking, and Packaging) or ATP (Assembly, Test and Packaging) of semiconductor manufacturing, and may be carried out by OSAT (OutSourced Assembly and Test) companies which are separate from semiconductor foundries. A foundry is a company or fab performing manufacturing processes such as photolithography and etching that are part of the front end of semiconductor manufacturing.

==Hazardous materials==

Many toxic materials are used in the fabrication process. These include:
* poisonous elemental dopants, such as arsenic, antimony, and phosphorus.
* poisonous compounds, such as arsine and phosphine in ion implantation doping, tungsten hexafluoride, used in CVD deposition of tungsten in transistor interconnects, and silane used for depositing polysilicon.
* highly reactive liquids, such as hydrogen peroxide, fuming nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and hydrofluoric acid, used in etching and cleaning.

It is vital that workers not be directly exposed to these dangerous substances. The high degree of automation common in the IC fabrication industry helps to reduce the risks of exposure. Most fabrication facilities employ exhaust management systems, such as wet scrubbers, combustors, heated absorber cartridges, etc., to control the risk to workers and to the environment.

<doc id="27698" wikidata="Q11059" url="?curid=27698" title="Sanskrit">
<text>Sanskrit (; stem form ; nominal singular , ,) is a classical language belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages. It arose in South Asia after its predecessor languages had diffused there from the northwest in the late Bronze Age. Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism, the language of classical Hindu philosophy, and of historical texts of Buddhism and Jainism. It was a link language in ancient and medieval South Asia, and upon transmission of Hindu and Buddhist culture to Southeast Asia, East Asia and Central Asia in the early medieval era, it became a language of religion and high culture, and of the political elites in some of these regions. As a result, Sanskrit had a lasting effect on the languages of South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia, especially in their formal and learned vocabularies.

Sanskrit generally connotes several Old Indo-Aryan language varieties. The most archaic of these is the Vedic Sanskrit found in the Rigveda, a collection of 1,028 hymns composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE by Indo-Aryan tribes migrating east from the mountains of what is today northern Afghanistan across northern Pakistan and into northwestern India. Vedic Sanskrit interacted with the preexisting ancient languages of the subcontinent, absorbing names of newly encountered plants and animals; in addition, the ancient Dravidian languages influenced Sanskrit&#x27;s phonology and syntax. &quot;Sanskrit&quot; can also more narrowly refer to Classical Sanskrit, a refined and standardized grammatical form that emerged in the mid-1st millennium BCE and was codified in the most comprehensive of ancient grammars, the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; (&#x27;Eight chapters&#x27;) of Pāṇini. The greatest dramatist in Sanskrit, Kālidāsa, wrote in classical Sanskrit, and the foundations of modern arithmetic were first described in classical Sanskrit. The two major Sanskrit epics, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa, however, were composed in a range of oral storytelling registers called Epic Sanskrit which was used in northern India between 400 BCE and 300 CE, and roughly contemporary with classical Sanskrit. In the following centuries, Sanskrit became tradition-bound, stopped being learned as a first language, and ultimately stopped developing as a living language.

The hymns of the Rigveda are notably similar to the most archaic poems of the Iranian and Greek language families, the &quot;Gathas&quot; of old Avestan and &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer. As the Rigveda was orally transmitted by methods of memorisation of exceptional complexity, rigour and fidelity, as a single text without variant readings, its preserved archaic syntax and morphology are of vital importance in the reconstruction of the common ancestor language Proto-Indo-European. Sanskrit does not have an attested native script: from around the turn of the 1st-millennium CE, it has been written in various Brahmic scripts, and in the modern era most commonly in Devanagari.

Sanskrit&#x27;s status, function, and place in India&#x27;s cultural heritage are recognized by its inclusion in the Constitution of India&#x27;s Eighth Schedule languages. However, despite attempts at revival, there are no first-language speakers of Sanskrit in India. In each of India&#x27;s recent decennial censuses, several thousand citizens have reported Sanskrit to be their mother tongue, but the numbers are thought to signify a wish to be aligned with the prestige of the language. Sanskrit has been taught in traditional gurukulas since ancient times; it is widely taught today at the secondary school level. The oldest Sanskrit college is the Benares Sanskrit College founded in 1791 during East India Company rule. Sanskrit continues to be widely used as a ceremonial and ritual language in Hindu and Buddhist hymns and chants.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
In Sanskrit, the verbal adjective &quot;&quot; is a compound word consisting of (&#x27;together, good, well, perfected&#x27;) and &quot;-&quot; (&#x27;made, formed, work&#x27;). It connotes a work that has been &quot;well prepared, pure and perfect, polished, sacred&quot;. According to Biderman, the perfection contextually being referred to in the etymological origins of the word is its tonal—rather than semantic—qualities. Sound and oral transmission were highly valued qualities in ancient India, and its sages refined the alphabet, the structure of words, and its exacting grammar into a &quot;collection of sounds, a kind of sublime musical mold&quot; as an integral language they called &quot;Saṃskṛta&quot;. From the late Vedic period onwards, state Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, resonating sound and its musical foundations attracted an &quot;exceptionally large amount of linguistic, philosophical and religious literature&quot; in India. Sound was visualized as &quot;pervading all creation&quot;, another representation of the world itself; the &quot;mysterious magnum&quot; of Hindu thought. The search for perfection in thought and the goal of liberation were among the dimensions of sacred sound, and the common thread that wove all ideas and inspirations together became the quest for what the ancient Indians believed to be a perfect language, the &quot;phonocentric episteme&quot; of Sanskrit.

Sanskrit as a language competed with numerous, less exact vernacular Indian languages called &quot;Prakritic languages&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The term literally means &quot;original, natural, normal, artless&quot;, states Franklin Southworth. The relationship between Prakrit and Sanskrit is found in Indian texts dated to the 1st millennium CE. Patañjali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian Daṇḍin states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit, but involves &quot;loss of sounds&quot; and corruptions that result from a &quot;disregard of the grammar&quot;. Daṇḍin acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit. This view is found in the writing of Bharata Muni, the author of the ancient &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; text. The early Jain scholar Namisādhu acknowledged the difference, but disagreed that Prakrit language was a corruption of Sanskrit. Namisādhu stated that the Prakrit language was the (&#x27;came before, origin&#x27;) and that it came naturally to children, while Sanskrit was a refinement of Prakrit through &quot;purification by grammar&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origin and development ===
Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three earliest ancient documented languages that arose from a common root language now referred to as Proto-Indo-European:
* Vedic Sanskrit ( 1500–500 BCE).
* Mycenaean Greek ( 1450 BCE) and Ancient Greek ( 750–400 BCE).
* Hittite ( 1750–1200 BCE).

Other Indo-European languages distantly related to Sanskrit include archaic and Classical Latin ( 600 BCE–100 CE, Italic languages), Gothic (archaic Germanic language, ), Old Norse ( 200 CE and after), Old Avestan () and Younger Avestan ( 900 BCE). The closest ancient relatives of Vedic Sanskrit in the Indo-European languages are the Nuristani languages found in the remote Hindu Kush region of northeastern Afghanistan and northwestern Himalayas, as well as the extinct Avestan and Old Persian – both Iranian languages. Sanskrit belongs to the satem group of the Indo-European languages.

Colonial era scholars familiar with Latin and Greek were struck by the resemblance of the Sanskrit language, both in its vocabulary and grammar, to the classical languages of Europe.
In &quot;The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World&quot;, Mallory and Adams illustrate the resemblance with the following examples of cognate forms (with the addition of Old English for further comparison):

The correspondences suggest some common root, and historical links between some of the distant major ancient languages of the world.

The Indo-Aryan migrations theory explains the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages by proposing that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in South Asia from a region of common origin, somewhere north-west of the Indus region, during the early 2nd millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the Baltic and Slavic languages, vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European Uralic languages, and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.

The pre-history of Indo-Aryan languages which preceded Vedic Sanskrit is unclear and various hypotheses place it over a fairly wide limit. According to Thomas Burrow, based on the relationship between various Indo-European languages, the origin of all these languages may possibly be in what is now Central or Eastern Europe, while the Indo-Iranian group possibly arose in Central Russia. The Iranian and Indo-Aryan branches separated quite early. It is the Indo-Aryan branch that moved into eastern Iran and then south into South Asia in the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Once in ancient India, the Indo-Aryan language underwent rapid linguistic change and morphed into the Vedic Sanskrit language.

===Vedic Sanskrit===
The pre-Classical form of Sanskrit is known as &quot;Vedic Sanskrit&quot;. The earliest attested Sanskrit text is the Rigveda (), a Hindu scripture from the mid- to late-second millennium BCE. No written records from such an early period survive, if any ever existed, but scholars are generally confident that the oral transmission of the texts is reliable: they are ceremonial literature, where the exact phonetic expression and its preservation were a part of the historic tradition.

However some scholars have suggested that the original Ṛg-veda differed in some fundamental ways in phonology compared to the sole surviving version available to us. In particular that retroflex consonants did not exist as a natural part of the earliest Vedic language, and that these developed in the centuries after the composition had been completed, and as a gradual unconscious process during the oral transmission by generations of reciters.

The primary source for this argument is internal evidence of the text which betrays an instability of the phenomenon of retroflexion, with the same phrases having sandhi-induced retroflexion in some parts but not other. This is taken along with evidence of controversy, for example, in passages of the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka (700 BCE), which features a discussion on whether retroflexion is valid in particular cases.

The Ṛg-veda is a collection of books, created by multiple authors. These authors represented different generations, and the mandalas 2 to 7 are the oldest while the mandalas 1 and 10 are relatively the youngest. Yet, the Vedic Sanskrit in these books of the Ṛg-veda &quot;hardly presents any dialectical diversity&quot;, states Louis Renou – an Indologist known for his scholarship of the Sanskrit literature and the Ṛg-veda in particular. According to Renou, this implies that the Vedic Sanskrit language had a &quot;set linguistic pattern&quot; by the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Beyond the Ṛg-veda, the ancient literature in Vedic Sanskrit that has survived into the modern age include the &quot;Samaveda&quot;, &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, along with the embedded and layered Vedic texts such as the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and the early Upanishads. These Vedic documents reflect the dialects of Sanskrit found in the various parts of the northwestern, northern, and eastern Indian subcontinent.

According to Michael Witzel, Vedic Sanskrit was a spoken language of the semi-nomadic Aryans. The Vedic Sanskrit language or a closely related Indo-European variant was recognized beyond ancient India as evidenced by the &quot;Mitanni Treaty&quot; between the ancient Hittite and Mitanni people, carved into a rock, in a region that now includes parts of Syria and Turkey. Parts of this treaty, such as the names of the Mitanni princes and technical terms related to horse training, for reasons not understood, are in early forms of Vedic Sanskrit. The treaty also invokes the gods Varuna, Mitra, Indra, and Nasatya found in the earliest layers of the Vedic literature.
The Vedic Sanskrit found in the Ṛg-veda is distinctly more archaic than other Vedic texts, and in many respects, the Rigvedic language is notably more similar to those found in the archaic texts of Old Avestan Zoroastrian &quot;Gathas&quot; and Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. According to Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton – Indologists known for their translation of the Ṛg-veda – the Vedic Sanskrit literature &quot;clearly inherited&quot; from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European times the social structures such as the role of the poet and the priests, the patronage economy, the phrasal equations, and some of the poetic metres. While there are similarities, state Jamison and Brereton, there are also differences between Vedic Sanskrit, the Old Avestan, and the Mycenaean Greek literature. For example, unlike the Sanskrit similes in the Ṛg-veda, the Old Avestan &quot;Gathas&quot; lack simile entirely, and it is rare in the later version of the language. The Homerian Greek, like Ṛg-vedic Sanskrit, deploys simile extensively, but they are structurally very different.

=== Classical Sanskrit ===

The early Vedic form of the Sanskrit language was far less homogenous compared to the Classical Sanskrit as defined by grammarians by about the mid-1st millennium BCE. According to Richard Gombrich—an Indologist and a scholar of Sanskrit, Pāli and Buddhist Studies—the archaic Vedic Sanskrit found in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; had already evolved in the Vedic period, as evidenced in the later Vedic literature. Gombrich posits that the language in the early Upanishads of Hinduism and the late Vedic literature approaches Classical Sanskrit, while the archaic Vedic Sanskrit had by the Buddha&#x27;s time become unintelligible to all except ancient Indian sages.

The formalization of the Saṃskṛta language is credited to , along with Patañjali&#x27;s and Katyayana&#x27;s commentary that preceded Patañjali&#x27;s work. Panini composed &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Eight-Chapter Grammar&#x27;), which became the foundation of Vyākaraṇa, a Vedānga. The was not the first description of Sanskrit grammar, but it is the earliest that has survived in full, and the culmination of a long grammatical tradition that Fortson says, is &quot;one of the intellectual wonders of the ancient world&quot;. Pāṇini cites ten scholars on the phonological and grammatical aspects of the Sanskrit language before him, as well as the variants in the usage of Sanskrit in different regions of India. The ten Vedic scholars he quotes are Āpiśali, Kaśyapa, Gārgya, Gālava, Cakravarmaṇa, Bhāradvāja, Śākaṭāyana, Śākalya, Senaka and Sphoṭāyana.

In the , language is observed in a manner that has no parallel among Greek or Latin grammarians. Pāṇini&#x27;s grammar, according to Renou and Filliozat, is a classic that defines the linguistic expression and sets the standard for the Sanskrit language. Pāṇini made use of a technical metalanguage consisting of a syntax, morphology and lexicon. This metalanguage is organised according to a series of meta-rules, some of which are explicitly stated while others can be deduced. Despite differences in the analysis from that of modern linguistics, Pāṇini&#x27;s work has been found valuable and the most advanced analysis of linguistics until the twentieth century.

Pāṇini&#x27;s comprehensive and scientific theory of grammar is conventionally taken to mark the start of Classical Sanskrit. His systematic treatise inspired and made Sanskrit the preeminent Indian language of learning and literature for two millennia. It is unclear whether Pāṇini himself wrote his treatise or he orally created the detailed and sophisticated treatise then transmitted it through his students. Modern scholarship generally accepts that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as &quot;lipi&quot; (&#x27;script&#x27;) and (&#x27;scribe&#x27;) in section 3.2 of the .

The Classical Sanskrit language formalized by Pāṇini, states Renou, is &quot;not an impoverished language&quot;, rather it is &quot;a controlled and a restrained language from which archaisms and unnecessary formal alternatives were excluded&quot;. The Classical form of the language simplified the &quot;sandhi&quot; rules but retained various aspects of the Vedic language, while adding rigor and flexibilities, so that it had sufficient means to express thoughts as well as being &quot;capable of responding to the future increasing demands of an infinitely diversified literature&quot;, according to Renou. Pāṇini included numerous &quot;optional rules&quot; beyond the Vedic Sanskrit&#x27;s framework, to respect liberty and creativity so that individual writers separated by geography or time would have the choice to express facts and their views in their own way, where tradition followed competitive forms of the Sanskrit language.

The phonetic differences between Vedic Sanskrit and Classical Sanskrit, as discerned from the current state of the surviving literature, are negligible when compared to the intense change that must have occurred in the pre-Vedic period between the Proto-Indo-Aryan language and Vedic Sanskrit. The noticeable differences between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit include the much-expanded grammar and grammatical categories as well as the differences in the accent, the semantics and the syntax. There are also some differences between how some of the nouns and verbs end, as well as the &quot;sandhi&quot; rules, both internal and external. Quite many words found in the early Vedic Sanskrit language are never found in late Vedic Sanskrit or Classical Sanskrit literature, while some words have different and new meanings in Classical Sanskrit when contextually compared to the early Vedic Sanskrit literature.

Arthur Macdonell was among the early colonial era scholars who summarized some of the differences between the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit. Louis Renou published in 1956, in French, a more extensive discussion of the similarities, the differences and the evolution of the Vedic Sanskrit within the Vedic period and then to the Classical Sanskrit along with his views on the history. This work has been translated by Jagbans Balbir.

===Sanskrit and Prakrit languages===

The earliest known use of the word (Sanskrit), in the context of a speech or language, is found in verses 5.28.17–19 of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Outside the learned sphere of written Classical Sanskrit, vernacular colloquial dialects (Prakrits) continued to evolve. Sanskrit co-existed with numerous other Prakrit languages of ancient India. The Prakrit languages of India also have ancient roots and some Sanskrit scholars have called these , literally &#x27;spoiled&#x27;. The Vedic literature includes words whose phonetic equivalent are not found in other Indo-European languages but which are found in the regional Prakrit languages, which makes it likely that the interaction, the sharing of words and ideas began early in the Indian history. As the Indian thought diversified and challenged earlier beliefs of Hinduism, particularly in the form of Buddhism and Jainism, the Prakrit languages such as Pali in Theravada Buddhism and Ardhamagadhi in Jainism competed with Sanskrit in the ancient times. However, states Paul Dundas, these ancient Prakrit languages had &quot;roughly the same relationship to Sanskrit as medieval Italian does to Latin&quot;. The Indian tradition states that the Buddha and the Mahavira preferred the Prakrit language so that everyone could understand it. However, scholars such as Dundas have questioned this hypothesis. They state that there is no evidence for this and whatever evidence is available suggests that by the start of the common era, hardly anybody other than learned monks had the capacity to understand the old Prakrit languages such as Ardhamagadhi.

A section of European scholars state that Sanskrit was never a spoken language. However, evidences shows that Sanskrit was a spoken language, essential for oral tradition that preserved the vast number of Sanskrit manuscripts from ancient India. The textual evidence in the works of Yaksa, Panini, and Patanajali affirms that Classical Sanskrit in their era was a spoken language () used by the cultured and educated. Some &quot;sutras&quot; expound upon the variant forms of spoken Sanskrit versus written Sanskrit. Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang mentioned in his memoir that official philosophical debates in India were held in Sanskrit, not in the vernacular language of that region.
According to Sanskrit linguist professor Madhav Deshpande, Sanskrit was a spoken language in a colloquial form by the mid-1st millennium BCE which coexisted with a more formal, grammatically correct form of literary Sanskrit. This, states Deshpande, is true for modern languages where colloquial incorrect approximations and dialects of a language are spoken and understood, along with more &quot;refined, sophisticated and grammatically accurate&quot; forms of the same language being found in the literary works. The Indian tradition, states Winternitz, has favored the learning and the usage of multiple languages from the ancient times. Sanskrit was a spoken language in the educated and the elite classes, but it was also a language that must have been understood in a wider circle of society because the widely popular folk epics and stories such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, the &quot;Panchatantra&quot; and many other texts are all in the Sanskrit language. The Classical Sanskrit with its exacting grammar was thus the language of the Indian scholars and the educated classes, while others communicated with approximate or ungrammatical variants of it as well as other natural Indian languages. Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the vernacular Prakrits. Many Sanskrit dramas indicate that the language coexisted with the vernacular Prakrits. The cities of Varanasi, Paithan, Pune and Kanchipuram were centers of classical Sanskrit learning and public debates until the arrival of the colonial era.

According to Lamotte, Sanskrit became the dominant literary and inscriptional language because of its precision in communication. It was, states Lamotte, an ideal instrument for presenting ideas, and as knowledge in Sanskrit multiplied, so did its spread and influence. Sanskrit was adopted voluntarily as a vehicle of high culture, arts, and profound ideas. Pollock disagrees with Lamotte, but concurs that Sanskrit&#x27;s influence grew into what he terms a &quot;Sanskrit Cosmopolis&quot; over a region that included all of South Asia and much of southeast Asia. The Sanskrit language cosmopolis thrived beyond India between 300 and 1300 CE.

Today, it is believed that Kashmiri is the closest language to Sanskrit.

=== Dravidian influence on Sanskrit ===
Reinöhl mentions that not only have the Dravidian languages borrowed from Sanskrit vocabulary, but they have also affected Sanskrit on deeper levels of structure, &quot;for instance in the domain of phonology where Indo-Aryan retroflexes have been attributed to Dravidian influence&quot;. Similarly, Ferenc Ruzca states that all the major shifts in Indo-Aryan phonetics over two millennia can be attributed to the constant influence of a Dravidian language with a similar phonetic structure to Tamil. Hock et al. quoting George Hart state that there was influence of Old Tamil on Sanskrit. Hart compared Old Tamil and Classical Sanskrit to arrive at a conclusion that there was a common language from which these features both derived – &quot;that both Tamil and Sanskrit derived their shared conventions, metres, and techniques from a common source, for it is clear that neither borrowed directly from the other.&quot;

Reinöhl further states that there is a symmetric relationship between Dravidian languages like Kannada or Tamil, with Indo-Aryan languages like Bengali or Hindi, whereas the same relationship is not found for non-Indo-Aryan languages, for example, Persian or English:

Shulman mentions that &quot;Dravidian nonfinite verbal forms (called in Tamil) shaped the usage of the Sanskrit nonfinite verbs (originally derived from inflected forms of action nouns in Vedic). This particularly salient case of the possible influence of Dravidian on Sanskrit is only one of many items of syntactic assimilation, not least among them the large repertoire of morphological modality and aspect that, once one knows to look for it, can be found everywhere in classical and postclassical Sanskrit&quot;.

The main influence of Dravidian on Sanskrit is found to have been concentrated in the timespan between the late Vedic period and the crystallization of Classical Sanskrit. As in this period the Indo-Aryan tribes had not yet made contact with the inhabitants of the South of the subcontinent, this suggests a significant presence of Dravidian speakers in North India (the central Gangetic plain and the classical Madhyadeśa) who were instrumental in this substratal influence on Sanskrit.

== Influence ==

Sanskrit has been the predominant language of Hindu texts encompassing a rich tradition of philosophical and religious texts, as well as poetry, music, drama, scientific, technical and others. It is the predominant language of one of the largest collection of historic manuscripts. The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit are from the 1st century BCE, such as the Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana and Ghosundi-Hathibada (Chittorgarh).

Though developed and nurtured by scholars of orthodox schools of Hinduism, Sanskrit has been the language for some of the key literary works and theology of heterodox schools of Indian philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. The structure and capabilities of the Classical Sanskrit language launched ancient Indian speculations about &quot;the nature and function of language&quot;, what is the relationship between words and their meanings in the context of a community of speakers, whether this relationship is objective or subjective, discovered or is created, how individuals learn and relate to the world around them through language, and about the limits of language. They speculated on the role of language, the ontological status of painting word-images through sound, and the need for rules so that it can serve as a means for a community of speakers, separated by geography or time, to share and understand profound ideas from each other. These speculations became particularly important to the Mīmāṃsā and the Nyaya schools of Hindu philosophy, and later to Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism, states Frits Staal—a scholar of Linguistics with a focus on Indian philosophies and Sanskrit. Though written in a number of different scripts, the dominant language of Hindu texts has been Sanskrit. It or a hybrid form of Sanskrit became the preferred language of Mahayana Buddhism scholarship; for example, one of the early and influential Buddhist philosophers, Nagarjuna (200 CE), used Classical Sanskrit as the language for his texts. According to Renou, Sanskrit had a limited role in the Theravada tradition (formerly known as the Hinayana) but the Prakrit works that have survived are of doubtful authenticity. Some of the canonical fragments of the early Buddhist traditions, discovered in the 20th century, suggest the early Buddhist traditions used an imperfect and reasonably good Sanskrit, sometimes with a Pali syntax, states Renou. The Mahāsāṃghika and Mahavastu, in their late Hinayana forms, used hybrid Sanskrit for their literature. Sanskrit was also the language of some of the oldest surviving, authoritative and much followed philosophical works of Jainism such as the &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot; by Umaswati.
The Sanskrit language has been one of the major means for the transmission of knowledge and ideas in Asian history. Indian texts in Sanskrit were already in China by 402 CE, carried by the influential Buddhist pilgrim Faxian who translated them into Chinese by 418 CE. Xuanzang, another Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, learnt Sanskrit in India and carried 657 Sanskrit texts to China in the 7th century where he established a major center of learning and language translation under the patronage of Emperor Taizong. By the early 1st millennium CE, Sanskrit had spread Buddhist and Hindu ideas to Southeast Asia, parts of the East Asia and the Central Asia. It was accepted as a language of high culture and the preferred language by some of the local ruling elites in these regions. According to the Dalai Lama, the Sanskrit language is a parent language that is at the foundation of many modern languages of India and the one that promoted Indian thought to other distant countries. In Tibetan Buddhism, states the Dalai Lama, Sanskrit language has been a revered one and called &quot;legjar lhai-ka&quot; or &quot;elegant language of the gods&quot;. It has been the means of transmitting the &quot;profound wisdom of Buddhist philosophy&quot; to Tibet.
The Sanskrit language created a pan-Indo-Aryan accessibility to information and knowledge in the ancient and medieval times, in contrast to the Prakrit languages which were understood just regionally. It created a cultural bond across the subcontinent. As local languages and dialects evolved and diversified, Sanskrit served as the common language. It connected scholars from distant parts of South Asia such as Tamil Nadu and Kashmir, states Deshpande, as well as those from different fields of studies, though there must have been differences in its pronunciation given the first language of the respective speakers. The Sanskrit language brought Indo-Aryan speaking people together, particularly its elite scholars. Some of these scholars of Indian history regionally produced vernacularized Sanskrit to reach wider audiences, as evidenced by texts discovered in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Once the audience became familiar with the easier to understand vernacularized version of Sanskrit, those interested could graduate from colloquial Sanskrit to the more advanced Classical Sanskrit. Rituals and the rites-of-passage ceremonies have been and continue to be the other occasions where a wide spectrum of people hear Sanskrit, and occasionally join in to speak some Sanskrit words such as .

Classical Sanskrit is the standard register as laid out in the grammar of , around the fourth century BCE. Its position in the cultures of Greater India is akin to that of Latin and Ancient Greek in Europe. Sanskrit has significantly influenced most modern languages of the Indian subcontinent, particularly the languages of the northern, western, central and eastern Indian subcontinent.

=== Decline ===
The decline of Sanskrit began in the 13th century. This coincides with the beginning of Islamic invasions of South Asia to create, and thereafter expand the Muslim rule in the form of Sultanates, and later the Mughal Empire. Sheldon Pollock characterises the decline of Sanskrit as a long-term &quot;cultural, social, and political change&quot;. He dismisses the idea that Sanskrit declined due to &quot;struggle with barbarous invaders&quot;, and emphasises factors such as the increasing attractiveness of vernacular language for literary expression.

With the fall of Kashmir around the 13th century, a premier center of Sanskrit literary creativity, Sanskrit literature there disappeared, perhaps in the &quot;fires that periodically engulfed the capital of Kashmir&quot; or the &quot;Mongol invasion of 1320&quot; states Pollock. The Sanskrit literature which was once widely disseminated out of the northwest regions of the subcontinent, stopped after the 12th century. As Hindu kingdoms fell in the eastern and the South India, such as the great Vijayanagara Empire, so did Sanskrit. There were exceptions and short periods of imperial support for Sanskrit, mostly concentrated during the reign of the tolerant Mughal emperor Akbar. Muslim rulers patronized the Middle Eastern language and scripts found in Persia and Arabia, and the Indians linguistically adapted to this Persianization to gain employment with the Muslim rulers. Hindu rulers such as Shivaji of the Maratha Empire, reversed the process, by re-adopting Sanskrit and re-asserting their socio-linguistic identity. After Islamic rule disintegrated in South Asia and the colonial rule era began, Sanskrit re-emerged but in the form of a &quot;ghostly existence&quot; in regions such as Bengal. This decline was the result of &quot;political institutions and civic ethos&quot; that did not support the historic Sanskrit literary culture and the failure of new Sanskrit literature to assimilate into the changing cultural and political environment.

Sheldon Pollock states that in some crucial way, &quot;Sanskrit is dead&quot;. After the 12th century, the Sanskrit literary works were reduced to &quot;reinscription and restatements&quot; of ideas already explored, and any creativity was restricted to hymns and verses. This contrasted with the previous 1,500 years when &quot;great experiments in moral and aesthetic imagination&quot; marked the Indian scholarship using Classical Sanskrit, states Pollock.

Scholars maintain that the Sanskrit language did not die, but rather only declined. Jurgen Hanneder disagrees with Pollock, finding his arguments elegant but &quot;often arbitrary&quot;. According to Hanneder, a decline or regional absence of creative and innovative literature constitutes a negative evidence to Pollock&#x27;s hypothesis, but it is not positive evidence. A closer look at Sanskrit in the Indian history after the 12th century suggests that Sanskrit survived despite the odds. According to Hanneder,

The Sanskrit language scholar Moriz Winternitz states that Sanskrit was never a dead language and it is still alive though its prevalence is lesser than ancient and medieval times. Sanskrit remains an integral part of Hindu journals, festivals, Ramlila plays, drama, rituals and the rites-of-passage. Similarly, Brian Hatcher states that the &quot;metaphors of historical rupture&quot; by Pollock are not valid, that there is ample proof that Sanskrit was very much alive in the narrow confines of surviving Hindu kingdoms between the 13th and 18th centuries, and its reverence and tradition continues.

Hanneder states that modern works in Sanskrit are either ignored or their &quot;modernity&quot; contested.

According to Robert P. Goldman and Sally Sutherland, Sanskrit is neither &quot;dead&quot; nor &quot;living&quot; in the conventional sense. It is a special, timeless language that lives in the numerous manuscripts, daily chants, and ceremonial recitations, a &quot;heritage language&quot; that Indians contextually prize, and which some practice.

When the British introduced English to India in the 19th century, knowledge of Sanskrit and ancient literature continued to flourish as the study of Sanskrit changed from a more traditional style into a form of analytical and comparative scholarship mirroring that of Europe.

=== Modern Indo-Aryan languages ===
The relationship of Sanskrit to the Prakrit languages, particularly the modern form of Indian languages, is complex and spans about 3,500 years, states Colin Masica—a linguist specializing in South Asian languages. A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency toward anachronistic errors. Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE – 600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE – 1000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE – present), each can further be subdivided into early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.

Vedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan stage, while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions—archaic and more formalized—that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE – 1000 CE period. Two literary Indo-Aryan languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are &quot;Apabhramsa&quot; and &quot;Elu&quot; (a literary form of Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.

There is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. While the roots of all Prakrit languages may be in Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Proto-Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from Classical Sanskrit. It is generally accepted by scholars and widely believed in India that the modern Indo-Aryan languages – such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, and Punjabi – are descendants of the Sanskrit language. Sanskrit, states Burjor Avari, can be described as &quot;the mother language of almost all the languages of north India&quot;.

== Geographic distribution ==

The Sanskrit language&#x27;s historic presence is attested across a wide geography beyond South Asia. Inscriptions and literary evidence suggests that Sanskrit language was already being adopted in Southeast Asia and Central Asia in the 1st millennium CE, through monks, religious pilgrims and merchants.

South Asia has been the geographic range of the largest collection of the ancient and pre-18th-century Sanskrit manuscripts and inscriptions. Beyond ancient India, significant collections of Sanskrit manuscripts and inscriptions have been found in China (particularly the Tibetan monasteries), Myanmar, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. Sanskrit inscriptions, manuscripts or its remnants, including some of the oldest known Sanskrit written texts, have been discovered in dry high deserts and mountainous terrains such as in Nepal, Tibet, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. Some Sanskrit texts and inscriptions have also been discovered in Korea and Japan.

=== Official status ===
In India, Sanskrit is among the 22 official languages of India in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. In 2010, Uttarakhand became the first state in India to make Sanskrit its second official language. In 2019, Himachal Pradesh made Sanskrit its second official language, becoming the second state in India to do so.

== Phonology ==

Sanskrit shares many Proto-Indo-European phonological features, although it features a larger inventory of distinct phonemes. The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated &quot;tʰ&quot;, to the voiceless &quot;t&quot;, voiced &quot;d&quot; and voiced aspirated &quot;dʰ&quot; found in PIE languages.

The most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel merger. The short &quot;*e&quot;, &quot;*o&quot; and &quot;*a&quot;, all merge as &quot;a&quot; (अ) in Sanskrit, while long &quot;*ē&quot;, &quot;*ō&quot; and &quot;*ā&quot;, all merge as long &quot;ā&quot; (आ). Compare Sanskrit &quot;nāman&quot; to Latin &quot;nōmen&quot;. These mergers occurred very early and significantly affected Sanskrit&#x27;s morphological system. Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed &quot;*y&quot;, &quot;*w&quot;, and &quot;*s&quot; intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.

===Vowels===

The cardinal vowels (&quot;svaras&quot;) &quot;a&quot; (अ), &quot;i&quot; (इ), and &quot;u&quot; (उ) distinguish length in Sanskrit. The short &quot;a&quot; (अ) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than ā, equivalent to schwa. The mid vowels ē (ए) and ō (ओ) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs &quot;*ai&quot; and &quot;*au&quot;. They are inherently long, though often transcribed &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid &quot;r̥&quot; in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE &quot;*r̥&quot; and &quot;*l̥&quot;. The long &quot;r̥&quot; is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.

According to Masica, Sanskrit has four traditional semivowels, with which were classed, &quot;for morphophonemic reasons, the liquids: y, r, l, and v; that is, as y and v were the non-syllabics corresponding to i, u, so were r, l in relation to r̥ and l̥&quot;. The northwestern, the central and the eastern Sanskrit dialects have had a historic confusion between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. The Paninian system that followed the central dialect preserved the distinction, likely out of reverence for the Vedic Sanskrit that distinguished the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. However, the northwestern dialect only had &quot;r&quot;, while the eastern dialect probably only had &quot;l&quot;, states Masica. Thus literary works from different parts of ancient India appear inconsistent in their use of &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, resulting in doublets that are occasionally semantically differentiated.

The nasal &#x27;ṃ&#x27; is optionally the corresponding nasal consonant before plosives (aṃ + k = aṅk or am k) and an &#x27;m&#x27;-sound before r, s, ś, ṣ, and h. Before y, l, v, it can cause nasalaization and gemination (am + y = aỹy or am y).

===Consonants===
Sanskrit possesses a symmetric consonantal phoneme structure based on how the sound is articulated, though the actual usage of these sounds conceals the lack of parallelism in the apparent symmetry possibly from historical changes within the language.

* Sanskrit has a series of retroflex stops originating as conditioned alternants of dentals.
* &quot;jh&quot; is a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.
* The palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents. 
* The &quot;anusvara&quot; that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of post-vocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions. 
* The &quot;visarga&quot; is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.
* The voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is rarer than the other three series.
* While the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three is the retroflex sibilant ʂ being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k.

===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===
Sanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through &quot;sandhi&quot; rules (literally, the rules of &quot;putting together, union, connection, alliance&quot;), similar to the English alteration of &quot;going to&quot; as &quot;gonna&quot;. The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the &quot;sandhi&quot; of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external &quot;sandhi&quot; rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization. Among the consonants, most external &quot;sandhi&quot; rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. These rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries. In Vedic Sanskrit, the external &quot;sandhi&quot; rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.

=== Vedic Pitch Accent ===

Vedic Sanskrit included a three-way pitch accent system of &quot;udātta&quot; (raised), &quot;anudātta&quot; (not-raised or grave), and &quot;svarita&quot; (sounded) which were high, low and falling pitches respectively. Each word generally had one accent &quot;udātta&quot; except for certain compound words. The classical language ultimately lost this system, but it was preserved in Vedic texts and phonological treatises. Traditional chanting renders the &quot;udātta&quot; as an unaccented mid-tone and the first half of the &quot;svarita&quot; as higher than an &quot;udātta&quot;; the other half is rendered the same level of that of an &quot;udātta.&quot;
==Morphology==
The basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, &quot;a morpheme bearing lexical meaning&quot;. The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the &quot;three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively&quot;.

A Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:

The root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a &quot;root&quot; is that it does not end in a short &quot;a&quot; (अ) and that it is monosyllabic. In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment &quot;a-&quot; added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the &quot;-na/n-&quot; infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.

Sanskrit verbs have the following canonical structure:

According to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English. Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to &quot;who is doing it&quot; (person or persons), &quot;when it is done&quot; (tense) and &quot;how it is done&quot; (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.

Both verbs and nouns in Sanskrit are either thematic or athematic, states Jamison. &quot;Guna&quot; (strengthened) forms in the active singular regularly alternate in athematic verbs. The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.

These elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; preverbs regularly occur in tmesis, states Jamison, which means they are &quot;separated from the finite verb&quot;. This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit&#x27;s attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, &quot;preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms&quot;.

While roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure. A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as &quot;mātar-&quot; (mother), &quot;nas-&quot; (nose), &quot;śvan-&quot; (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.

The Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison. Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.

Stems, that is &quot;root + affix&quot;, appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, &quot;Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions&quot;. Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types. The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four &quot;Paninian&quot; components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the &quot;Astadhyaayi&quot;, a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; &quot;Sivasutras&quot;, an inventory of &quot;anubandhas&quot; (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the &quot;pratyharas&quot; technique; &quot;Dhatupatha&quot;, a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the &quot;Ganapatha&quot;, an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems. There are peripheral adjuncts to these four, such as the &quot;Unadisutras&quot;, which focus on irregularly formed derivatives from the roots.

Sanskrit morphology is generally studied in two broad fundamental categories: the nominal forms and the verbal forms. These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context. Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and &quot;nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings&quot;.

===Verbal forms===
The Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past aorist and past perfect. It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle. The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as (word for another) and (word for oneself).

The paradigm for the tense-aspect system in Sanskrit is the three-way contrast between the &quot;present&quot;, the &quot;aorist&quot; and the &quot;perfect&quot; architecture. Vedic Sanskrit is more elaborate and had several additional tenses. For example, the &quot;Rigveda&quot; includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the &quot;present&quot; system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the &quot;aorist&quot; stems retain the aorist tense and the &quot;perfect&quot; stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect. The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than in other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.

The three verbal moods in Sanskrit are indicative, potential (optative), and imperative.

===Nominal forms===
Sanskrit recognizes three numbers—singular, dual, and plural. The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition. Illustrations include &quot;dyāvā&quot; (literally, &quot;the two heavens&quot; for heaven-and-earth), &quot;mātarā&quot; (literally, &quot;the two mothers&quot; for mother-and-father). A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he/she/it&quot;, &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot;.

There are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third. Sanskrit uses the 3×3 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.

The Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter. All nouns have inherent gender. With some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns. Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the &quot;-ā-&quot; (आ, Rādhā) and &quot;-ī-&quot; (ई, Rukminī). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional. Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.

Pronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives. Examples of the former include &quot;ahám&quot; (first singular), &quot;vayám&quot; (first plural) and &quot;yūyám&quot; (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric. Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the &quot;sá/tám&quot; pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.

===Prosody, metre===

The Sanskrit language formally incorporates poetic metres. By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study; it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature, including the later Vedic texts. This study of Sanskrit prosody is called &quot;chandas&quot;, and is considered one of the six Vedangas, or limbs of Vedic studies.

Sanskrit metres include those based on a fixed number of syllables per verse, and those based on fixed number of morae per verse. The Vedic Sanskrit employs fifteen metres, of which seven are common, and the most frequent are three (8-, 11- and 12-syllable lines). The Classical Sanskrit deploys both linear and non-linear metres, many of which are based on syllables and others based on diligently crafted verses based on repeating numbers of morae (matra per foot).

== Writing system ==

The early history of writing Sanskrit and other languages in ancient India is a problematic topic despite a century of scholarship, states Richard Salomon – an epigraphist and Indologist specializing in Sanskrit and Pali literature. The earliest possible script from South Asia is from the Indus Valley civilization (3rd/2nd millennium BCE), but this script – if it is a script – remains undeciphered. If any scripts existed in the Vedic period, they have not survived. Scholars generally accept that Sanskrit was spoken in an oral society, and that an oral tradition preserved the extensive Vedic and Classical Sanskrit literature. Other scholars such as Jack Goody argue that the Vedic Sanskrit texts are not the product of an oral society, basing this view by comparing inconsistencies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as the Greek (Greco-Sanskrit), Serbian, and other cultures. This minority of scholars argue that the Vedic literature is too consistent and vast to have been composed and transmitted orally across generations, without having been written down.

&quot;Lipi&quot; is the term in Sanskrit which means &quot;writing, letters, alphabet&quot;. It contextually refers to scripts, the art or any manner of writing or drawing. The term, in the sense of a writing system, appears in some of the earliest Buddhist, Hindu, and Jaina texts. Pāṇini&#x27;s &quot;Astadhyayi&quot;, composed sometime around the 5th or 4th century BCE, for example, mentions &quot;lipi&quot; in the context of a writing script and education system in his times, but he does not name the script. Several early Buddhist and Jaina texts, such as the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Pannavana Sutta&quot; include lists of numerous writing scripts in ancient India. The Buddhist texts list the sixty four &quot;lipi&quot; that the Buddha knew as a child, with the Brahmi script topping the list. &quot;The historical value of this list is however limited by several factors&quot;, states Salomon. The list may be a later interpolation. The Jain canonical texts such as the &quot;Pannavana Sutta&quot; – probably older than the Buddhist texts – list eighteen writing systems, with the Brahmi topping the list and Kharotthi (Kharoshthi) listed as fourth. The Jaina text elsewhere states that the &quot;Brahmi is written in 18 different forms&quot;, but the details are lacking. However, the reliability of these lists has been questioned and the empirical evidence of writing systems in the form of Sanskrit or Prakrit inscriptions dated prior to the 3rd century BCE has not been found. If the ancient surfaces for writing Sanskrit were palm leaves, tree bark and cloth – the same as those in later times – these have not survived. According to Salomon, many find it difficult to explain the &quot;evidently high level of political organization and cultural complexity&quot; of ancient India without a writing system for Sanskrit and other languages.

The oldest datable writing systems for Sanskrit are the Brāhmī script, the related Kharoṣṭhī script and the Brahmi derivatives. The Kharosthi was used in the northwestern part of South Asia and it became extinct, while the Brahmi was used all over the subcontinent along with regional scripts such as Old Tamil. Of these, the earliest records in the Sanskrit language are in Brahmi, a script that later evolved into numerous related Indic scripts for Sanskrit, along with Southeast Asian scripts (Burmese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, others) and many extinct Central Asian scripts such as those discovered along with the Kharosthi in the Tarim Basin of western China and in Uzbekistan. The most extensive inscriptions that have survived into the modern era are the rock edicts and pillar inscriptions of the 3rd century BCE Mauryan emperor Ashoka, but these are not in Sanskrit.

===Scripts===
Over the centuries, and across countries, a number of scripts have been used to write Sanskrit.

====Brahmi script====
The Brahmi script for writing Sanskrit is a &quot;modified consonant-syllabic&quot; script. The graphic syllable is its basic unit, and this consists of a consonant with or without diacritic modifications. Since the vowel is an integral part of the consonants, and given the efficiently compacted, fused consonant cluster morphology for Sanskrit words and grammar, the Brahmi and its derivative writing systems deploy ligatures, diacritics and relative positioning of the vowel to inform the reader how the vowel is related to the consonant and how it is expected to be pronounced for clarity. This feature of Brahmi and its modern Indic script derivatives makes it difficult to classify it under the main script types used for the writing systems for most of the world&#x27;s languages, namely logographic, syllabic and alphabetic.

====Nagari script====
Many modern era manuscripts are written and available in the Nagari script, whose form is attestable to the 1st millennium CE. The Nagari script is the ancestor of Devanagari (north India), Nandinagari (south India) and other variants. The Nāgarī script was in regular use by 7th century CE, and had fully evolved into Devanagari and Nandinagari scripts by about the end of the first millennium of the common era. The Devanagari script, states Banerji, became more popular for Sanskrit in India since about the 18th century. However, Sanskrit does have special historical connection to the Nagari script as attested by the epigraphical evidence.

The Nagari script used for Classical Sanskrit has the fullest repertoire of characters consisting of fourteen vowels and thirty three consonants. For Vedic Sanskrit, it has two more allophonic consonantal characters (the intervocalic ळ &quot;ḷa&quot;, and ळ्ह &quot;ḷha&quot;). To communicate phonetic accuracy, it also includes several modifiers such as the &quot;anusvara&quot; dot and the &quot;visarga&quot; double dot, punctuation symbols and others such as the &quot;halanta&quot; sign.

====Other writing systems====
Other scripts such as Gujarati, Bangla-Assamese, Odia and major south Indian scripts, states Salomon, &quot;have been and often still are used in their proper territories for writing Sanskrit&quot;. These and many Indian scripts look different to the untrained eye, but the differences between Indic scripts is &quot;mostly superficial and they share the same phonetic repertoire and systemic features&quot;, states Salomon. They all have essentially the same set of eleven to fourteen vowels and thirty-three consonants as established by the Sanskrit language and attestable in the Brahmi script. Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same &quot;varnamala&quot; (literally, &quot;garland of letters&quot;) alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across South Asia.
In the south, where Dravidian languages predominate, scripts used for Sanskrit include the Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Grantha alphabets.

=== Transliteration schemes, Romanisation ===

Since the late 18th century, Sanskrit has been transliterated using the Latin alphabet. The system most commonly used today is the IAST (International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration), which has been the academic standard since 1888. ASCII-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include Harvard-Kyoto and ITRANS, a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of Unicode-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an alphanumeric keyboard and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X&#x27;s international support.

===Epigraphy===


==Literature==
Literature in Sanskrit can be broadly divided into texts composed in Vedic Sanskrit and the later Classical Sanskrit. Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the extensive liturgical works of the Vedic religion, which aside from the four Vedas, include the Brāhmaṇas and the Sūtras.

The Vedic literature that survives is entirely of a religious form, whereas works in Classical Sanskrit exist in a wide variety of fields including epics, lyric, drama, romance, fairytale, fables, grammar, civil and religious law, the science of politics and practical life, the science of love and sex, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, astrology and mathematics, and is largely secular in subject-matter.

While Vedic literature is essentially optimistic in spirit, portraying man as strong and powerful capable of finding fulfilment both here and in the afterworld, the later literature is pessimistic, portraying humans as controlled by the forces of fate with worldly pleasures deemed the cause of misery. These fundamental differences in psychology are attributed to the absence of the doctrines of Karma and reincarnation in the Vedic period, notions which are very prevalent in later times.

===Works===

Sanskrit has been written in various scripts on a variety of media such as palm leaves, cloth, paper, rock and metal sheets, from ancient times.
==Lexicon==
As an Indo-European language, Sanskrit&#x27;s core lexicon is inherited from Proto-Indo-European. Over time however, the language exhibits a tendency to shed many of these inherited words and borrow others in their place from other sources.

In the oldest Vedic literature, there are few such non-Indo-European words, but these progressively grow in volume.

The following are some of the old Indo-European words that eventually fade out of use in Sanskrit:

===Dravidian lexical influence===
The sources of these new loanwords are many, and vary across the different regions of the Indian subcontinent. But of all influences on the lexicon of Sanskrit, the most important is Dravidian.

The following is a list of Dravidian entrants into Sanskrit lexicon, although some may have been contested:

===Nominal-form preference===
While Vedic and epic form of speech is largely cognate to that of other Indo-European languages such as Greek and Latin, later Sanskrit shows a tendency to move away from using verbal forms to nominal ones. Examples of nominal forms taking the place of conventional conjugation are:

However the most notable development is the prolific use of word-compounding to express ideas normally conveyed by verbal forms and sub-clauses introduced by conjunctions.

Classical Sanskrit&#x27;s pre-eminent playwright Kālidāsa uses:

== Influence on other languages ==
For nearly 2,000 years, Sanskrit was the language of a cultural order that exerted influence across South Asia, Inner Asia, Southeast Asia, and to a certain extent East Asia. A significant form of post-Vedic Sanskrit is found in the Sanskrit of Indian epic poetry—the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The deviations from in the epics are generally considered to be on account of interference from Prakrits, or innovations, and not because they are pre-Paninian. Traditional Sanskrit scholars call such deviations &quot;ārṣa&quot; (आर्ष), meaning &#x27;of the ṛṣis&#x27;, the traditional title for the ancient authors. In some contexts, there are also more &quot;prakritisms&quot; (borrowings from common speech) than in Classical Sanskrit proper. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit is a literary language heavily influenced by the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, based on early Buddhist Prakrit texts which subsequently assimilated to the Classical Sanskrit standard in varying degrees.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Sanskrit has greatly influenced the languages of India that grew from its vocabulary and grammatical base; for instance, Hindi is a &quot;Sanskritised register&quot; of Hindustani. All modern Indo-Aryan languages, as well as Munda and Dravidian languages have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (&quot;tatsama&quot; words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (&quot;tadbhava&quot; words). Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated at fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages, as well as the literary forms of Malayalam and Kannada. Literary texts in Telugu are lexically Sanskrit or Sanskritised to an enormous extent, perhaps seventy percent or more. Marathi is another prominent language in Western India, that derives most of its words and Marathi grammar from Sanskrit. Sanskrit words are often preferred in the literary texts in Marathi over corresponding colloquial Marathi word.

There has been a profound influence of Sanskrit on the lexical and grammatical systems of Dravidian languages. As per Dalby, India has been a single cultural area for about two millennia which has helped Sanskrit influence on all the Indic languages. Emeneau and Burrow mention the tendency &quot;for all four of the Dravidian literary languages in South to make literary use of total Sanskrit lexicon indiscriminately&quot;. There are a large number of loanwords found in the vocabulary of the three major Dravidian languages Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu. Tamil also has significant loanwords from Sanskrit. Krishnamurthi mentions that although it is not clear when the Sanskrit influence happened on the Dravidian languages, it might have been around the 5th century BCE at the time of separation of Tamil and Kannada from a common ancestral stage. ‌The borrowed words are classified into two types based on phonological integration – &quot;tadbhava&quot; – those words derived from Prakrit and &quot;tatsama&quot; – unassimilated loanwords from Sanskrit.

Strazny mentions that &quot;so massive has been the influence that it is hard to utter Sanskrit words have influenced Kannada from the early times&quot;. The first document in Kannada, the Halmidi inscription has a large number of Sanskrit words. As per Kachru, the influence has not only been on single lexical items in Kannada but also on &quot;long nominal compounds and complicated syntactic expressions&quot;. New words have been created in Kannada using Sanskrit derivational prefixes and suffixes like &quot;vikēndrīkaraṇa, anilīkaraṇa, bahīskruṭa&quot;. Similar stratification is found in verb morphology. Sanskrit words readily undergo verbalization in Kannada, verbalizing suffixes as in: &quot;chāpisu, dauḍāyisu, ravānisu.&quot;

George mentions that &quot;No other Dravidian language has been so deeply influenced by Sanskrit as Malayalam&quot;. According to Lambert, Malayalam is so immensely Sanskritised that every Sanskrit word can be used in Malayalam by integrating &quot;prosodic phonological&quot; changes as per Grant. Loanwords have been integrated into Malayalam by &quot;prosodic phonological&quot; changes as per Grant. These phonological changes are either by replacement of a vowel as in &quot;sant-&quot;am coming from Sanskrit &quot;santa&quot;, &quot;sāgar&quot;-am from &quot;sāgara&quot;, or addition of prothetic vowel as in &quot;aracan&quot; from &quot;rājā-&quot;, &quot;uruvam&quot; from &quot;rūpa&quot;, &quot;codyam&quot; from &quot;sodhya&quot;.

Hans Henrich et al. note that, the language of the pre-modern Telugu literature was also highly influenced by Sanskrit and was standardized between 11th and 14th centuries. Aiyar has shown that in a class of &quot;tadbhavas&quot; in Telugu the first and second letters are often replaced by the third and fourth letters and fourth again replaced often by h. Examples of the same are: Sanskrit &quot;artha&quot; becomes &quot;ardhama&quot;, &quot;vīthi&quot; becomes &quot;vidhi&quot;, &quot;putra&quot; becomes &quot;bidda&quot;, &quot;mukham&quot; becomes &quot;muhamu&quot;.

Tamil also has been influenced by Sanskrit. Hans Henrich et al. mention that propagation of Jainism and Buddhism into south India had its influence. Shulman mentions that although contrary to the views held by Tamil purists, modern Tamil has been significantly influenced from Sanskrit, further states that &quot;Indeed, there may well be more Sanskrit in Tamil than in the Sanskrit derived north-Indian vernaculars&quot;. Sanskrit words have been Tamilized through the &quot;Tamil phonematic grid&quot;.

=== Beyond the Indian subcontinent ===

Sanskrit was a language for religious purposes and for the political elite in parts of medieval era Southeast Asia, Central Asia and East Asia, having been introduced in these regions mainly along with the spread of Buddhism. In some cases, it has competed with Pāli for prominence.

==== East Asia ====
Buddhist Sanskrit has had a considerable influence on Sino-Tibetan languages such as Chinese, state William Wang and Chaofen Sun. Many words have been adopted from Sanskrit into Chinese, both in its historic religious discourse and everyday use. This process likely started about 200 CE and continued through about 1400 CE, with the efforts of monks such as Yuezhi, Anxi, Kangju, Tianzhu, Yan Fodiao, Faxian, Xuanzang and Yijing.

Further, as the Chinese languages and culture influenced the rest of East Asia, the ideas in Sanskrit texts and some of its linguistic elements migrated further.

Many terms were transliterated directly and added to the Chinese vocabulary. Chinese words like &quot;chànà&quot; (Devanagari: क्षण &quot;&quot; &#x27;instantaneous period&#x27;) were borrowed from Sanskrit. Many Sanskrit texts survive only in Tibetan collections of commentaries to the Buddhist teachings, the Tengyur.

Sanskrit has also influenced the religious register of Japanese mostly through transliterations. These were borrowed from Chinese transliterations. In particular, the Shingon () sect of esoteric Buddhism has been relying on Sanskrit and original Sanskrit mantras and writings, as a means of realizing Buddhahood.

==== Southeast Asia ====

A large number of inscriptions in Sanskrit across Southeast Asia testify the influence the language held in these regions.

Languages such as Indonesian, Thai and Lao contain many loanwords from Sanskrit, as does Khmer. Many Sanskrit loanwords are also found in Austronesian languages, such as Javanese, particularly the older form in which nearly half the vocabulary is borrowed.

Other Austronesian languages, such as Malay (descended into modern Malaysian and Indonesian standards) also derive much of their vocabulary from Sanskrit. Similarly, Philippine languages such as Tagalog have some Sanskrit loanwords, although more are derived from Spanish.

A Sanskrit loanword encountered in many Southeast Asian languages is the word &quot;bhāṣā&quot;, or spoken language, which is used to refer to the names of many languages.

To this day, Southeast Asian languages such as Thai are known to draw upon Sanskrit for technical vocabulary.

=====Indonesia=====
The earliest Sanskrit text which was founded in the Indonesian Archipelago was at Eastern Borneo dating back to 400 CE known as the Mulavarman inscription. This is one of the reason of strong influence of Indian culture that entered the Malay Archipelago during the Indianization era, and since then, Indian culture has been absorbed towards Indonesian culture and language. Thus, the Sanskrit culture in Indonesia exists not as a religious aspect but more towards a cultural aspect that has been present for generations, resulting in a more cultural rather than Hinduistic value of the Indonesian people. As a result, it is common to find Muslim or Christian Indonesians with names that have Indian or Sanskrit nuances. Unlike names derived from Sanskrit in Thai and Khmer, the pronunciation of Sanskrit names in Indonesia is more similar to the original Indian pronunciation, except that &quot;v&quot; is changed to &quot;w&quot;, for example, &quot;Vishnu&quot; in India will be spelled &quot;Wisnu&quot; in Indonesia.

==== Rest of the world ====
In ancient and medieval times, several Sanskrit words in the field of food and spices made their way into European languages including Greek, Latin and later English. Some of these are &quot;pepper&quot;, &quot;ginger&quot; and &quot;sugar&quot;. English today has several words of Sanskrit origin, most of them borrowed during the British Raj or later. Some of these words have in turn been borrowed by other European or world languages.

== Modern era ==

=== Liturgy, ceremonies and meditation ===
Sanskrit is the sacred language of various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. It is used during worship in Hindu temples. In Newar Buddhism, it is used in all monasteries. Sanskrit mantras and Sanskrit as a ritual language was commonplace among Jains throughout their medieval history.

Many Hindu rituals and rites-of-passage such as the &quot;giving away the bride&quot; and mutual vows at weddings, a baby&#x27;s naming or first solid food ceremony and the goodbye during a cremation invoke and chant Sanskrit hymns. Major festivals such as the &quot;Durga Puja&quot; ritually recite entire Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; every year particularly among the numerous communities of eastern India. In the south, Sanskrit texts are recited at many major Hindu temples such as the Meenakshi Temple. In India and beyond, recitations of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; occur in diverse settings, including &quot;simple private household readings, to family and neighborhood recitation sessions, to holy men reciting in temples or at pilgrimage places for passersby, to public Gita discourses held almost nightly at halls and auditoriums in every Indian city&quot;.

=== Literature and arts ===

More than 3,000 Sanskrit works have been composed since India&#x27;s independence in 1947. Much of this work has been judged of high quality, in comparison to both classical Sanskrit literature and modern literature in other Indian languages. In 2009, Satya Vrat Shastri became the first Sanskrit author to win the Jnanpith Award, India&#x27;s highest literary award.

Sanskrit is used extensively in the Carnatic and Hindustani branches of classical music. Kirtanas, bhajans, stotras, and shlokas of Sanskrit are popular throughout India. The Samaveda uses musical notations in several of its recessions.

In Mainland China, musicians such as Sa Dingding have written pop songs in Sanskrit.

Numerous loan Sanskrit words are found in other major Asian languages. For example, Filipino, Cebuano, Lao, Khmer, Thai and its alphabets, Malay (including Malaysian and Indonesian), Javanese (old Javanese-English dictionary by P.J. Zoetmulder contains over 25,500 entries), and even in English.

===Media===

Since 1974, there has been a short daily news broadcast on All India Radio. These broadcasts are also made available on the internet on AIR&#x27;s website. Sanskrit news is broadcast on TV and on the internet through the DD National channel. Over 90 weeklies, fortnightlies and quarterlies are published in Sanskrit. &quot;Sudharma&quot;, a daily printed newspaper in Sanskrit, has been published out of Mysore, India, since 1970. It was started by K.N. Varadaraja Iyengar, a Sanskrit scholar from Mysore.

=== Schools and contemporary status ===

Sanskrit has been taught in schools from time immemorial in India. In modern times, the first Sanskrit University was Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, established in 1791 in the Indian city of Varanasi. Sanskrit is taught in 5,000 traditional schools (Pathashalas), and 14,000 schools in India, where there are also 22 colleges and universities dedicated to the exclusive study of the language. Sanskrit is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. Despite it being a studied school subject in contemporary India, Sanskrit has not been spoken as a native language in centuries.

In India, Sanskrit is offered as a language in central and several state education board schools and is also taught in traditional gurukulas across the country. A number of colleges and universities in India have dedicated departments for Sanskrit studies. In March 2020, the Indian Parliament passed the &quot;Central Sanskrit Universities Act, 2020&quot; which upgraded three universities, National Sanskrit University, Central Sanskrit University and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri National Sanskrit University, from the deemed to be university status to a central university status.

Dmitri Mendeleev used the Sanskrit numbers of one, two and three (&quot;eka-&quot;, &quot;dvi-&quot; or &quot;dwi-&quot;, and &quot;tri-&quot; respectively) to give provisional names to his predicted elements, like eka-boron being Gallium or eka-Francium being Ununennium.

In the province of Bali in Indonesia, a number of educational and scholarly institutions have also been conducting Sanskrit lessons for Hindu locals.

==== In the West ====
St James Junior School and Avanti Schools Trust in London, England, offer Sanskrit as part of the curriculum. Since September 2009, US high school students have been able to receive credits as Independent Study or toward Foreign Language requirements by studying Sanskrit as part of the &quot;SAFL: Samskritam as a Foreign Language&quot; program coordinated by Samskrita Bharati. In Australia, the private boys&#x27; high school Sydney Grammar School offers Sanskrit from years 7 through to 12, including for the Higher School Certificate. Other schools that offer Sanskrit include the Ficino School in Auckland, New Zealand; St James Preparatory Schools in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, South Africa; John Colet School, Sydney, Australia; Erasmus School, Melbourne, Australia.

=== European studies and discourse ===
European scholarship in Sanskrit, begun by Heinrich Roth (1620–1668) and Johann Ernst Hanxleden (1681–1731), is considered responsible for the discovery of an Indo-European language family by Sir William Jones (1746–1794). This research played an important role in the development of Western philology, or historical linguistics.

The 18th- and 19th-century speculations about the possible links of Sanskrit to ancient Egyptian language were later proven to be wrong, but it fed an orientalist discourse both in the form Indophobia and Indophilia, states Trautmann. Sanskrit writings, when first discovered, were imagined by Indophiles to potentially be &quot;repositories of the primitive experiences and religion of the human race, and as such confirmatory of the truth of Christian scripture&quot;, as well as a key to &quot;universal ethnological narrative&quot;. The Indophobes imagined the opposite, making the counterclaim that there is little of any value in Sanskrit, portraying it as &quot;a language fabricated by artful [Brahmin] priests&quot;, with little original thought, possibly copied from the Greeks who came with Alexander or perhaps the Persians.

Scholars such as William Jones and his colleagues felt the need for systematic studies of Sanskrit language and literature. This launched the Asiatic Society, an idea that was soon transplanted to Europe starting with the efforts of Henry Thomas Colebrooke in Britain, then Alexander Hamilton who helped expand its studies to Paris and thereafter his student Friedrich Schlegel who introduced Sanskrit to the universities of Germany. Schlegel nurtured his own students into influential European Sanskrit scholars, particularly through Franz Bopp and Friedrich Max Müller. As these scholars translated the Sanskrit manuscripts, the enthusiasm for Sanskrit grew rapidly among European scholars, states Trautmann, and chairs for Sanskrit &quot;were established in the universities of nearly every German statelet&quot; creating a competition for Sanskrit experts.

=== Symbolic usage ===
In India, Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia, Sanskrit phrases are widely used as mottoes for various national, educational and social organisations:
* India: &quot;Satyameva Jayate&quot; (सत्यमेव जयते), meaning &#x27;truth alone triumphs&#x27;.
* Nepal: &quot;Janani Janmabhūmischa Swargādapi Garīyasī&quot; (जननी जन्मभूमिश्च स्वर्गादपि गरीयसी), meaning &#x27;mother and motherland are superior to heaven&#x27;.
* Indonesia: In Indonesia, Sanskrit is widely used as terms and mottoes of the armed forces and other national organizations &quot;(See: Indonesian Armed Forces mottoes)&quot;. &quot;Rastra Sewakottama&quot; (राष्ट्र सेवकोत्तम, ) is the official motto of the Indonesian National Police, &quot;Tri Dharma Eka Karma&quot; (त्रिधर्म एक कर्म) is the official motto of the Indonesian Military, &quot;Kartika Eka Paksi&quot; (कार्तिक एक पक्षी, ) is the official motto of the Indonesian Army, &quot;Adhitakarya Mahatvavirya Nagarabhakti&quot; (अधीतकार्य महत्ववीर्य नगरभक्ति, ) is the official motto of the Indonesian Military Academy, &quot;Upakriya Labdha Prayojana Balottama&quot; (उपक्रिया लब्ध प्रयोजन बालोत्तम, ) is the official motto of the Army Psychological Corps, &quot;Karmanye Vadikaraste Mafalesu Kadatjana&quot; (कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन, ) is the official motto of the Air-Force Special Forces (Paskhas), &quot;Jalesu Bhumyamca Jayamahe&quot; (जलेषु भूम्यम्च जयमहे, ) is the official motto of the Indonesian Marine Corps, and there are more units and organizations in Indonesia either Armed Forces or civil which use the Sanskrit language respectively as their mottoes and other purposes.
* Many of India&#x27;s and Nepal&#x27;s scientific and administrative terms use Sanskrit. The Indian guided missile program that was commenced in 1983 by the Defence Research and Development Organisation has named the five missiles (ballistic and others) that it developed Prithvi, Agni, Akash, Nag and the Trishul missile system. India&#x27;s first modern fighter aircraft is named HAL Tejas.

In November 2020, Gaurav Sharma, a New Zealand politician of Indian origin swore into parliament using Sanskrit alongside Māori; the decision was made as a &quot;homage to all Indian languages&quot; compromising between his native Pahari and Punjabi.

=== In popular culture ===
The song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; by George Harrison includes The Hare Krishna mantra, also referred to reverentially as the Maha Mantra, a 16-word Vaishnava mantra which is mentioned in the Kali-Santarana Upanishad. &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, an opera by Philip Glass, uses texts from the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, sung in Sanskrit. In 1996, English psychedelic rock band Kula Shaker released &quot;Govinda&quot;, a song entirely sung in Sanskrit. The closing credits of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has a prayer from the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot;. The song &quot;Cyber-raga&quot; from Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Music&quot; includes Sanskrit chants, and &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; from her 1998 album &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, which won a Grammy, is the ashtanga vinyasa yoga chant. The lyrics include the mantra &quot;Om shanti&quot;. Composer John Williams featured choirs singing in Sanskrit for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; and in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. The theme song of &quot;Battlestar Galactica 2004&quot; is the Gayatri Mantra, taken from the Rigveda. The lyrics of &quot;The Child in Us&quot; by Enigma also contain Sanskrit verses. In 2006, Mexican singer Paulina Rubio was influenced in Sanskrit for her concept album &quot;Ananda&quot;.

<text>Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning, instead of spoken words. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination with non-manual markers. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. Sign languages are not universal and are usually not mutually intelligible, although there are similarities among different sign languages.

Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of natural language, meaning that both emerged through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolved over time without meticulous planning. This is supported by the fact that there is substantial overlap between the neural substrates of sign and spoken language processing, despite the obvious differences in modality.

Sign language should not be confused with body language, a type of nonverbal communication. Linguists also distinguish natural sign languages from other systems that are precursors to them or obtained from them, such as constructed manual codes for spoken languages, home sign, &quot;baby sign&quot;, and signs learned by non-human primates.

Wherever communities of people with hearing challenges or people who experience deafness exist, sign languages have developed as useful means of communication and form the core of local deaf cultures. Although signing is used primarily by the deaf and hard of hearing, it is also used by hearing individuals, such as those unable to physically speak, those who have trouble with oral language due to a disability or condition (augmentative and alternative communication), and those with deaf family members including children of deaf adults.

The number of sign languages worldwide is not precisely known. Each country generally has its own native sign language; some have more than one. The 2021 edition of &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists 150 sign languages, while the SIGN-HUB Atlas of Sign Language Structures lists over 200 and notes that there are more that have not been documented or discovered yet. As of 2021, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the most-used sign language in the world, and &quot;Ethnologue&quot; ranks it as the 151st most &quot;spoken&quot; language in the world.

Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition.

== History ==

Groups of deaf people have used sign languages throughout history. One of the earliest written records of a sign language is from the fifth century BC, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Cratylus&quot;, where Socrates says: &quot;If we hadn&#x27;t a voice or a tongue, and wanted to express things to one another, wouldn&#x27;t we try to make signs by moving our hands, head, and the rest of our body, just as dumb people do at present?&quot; Most of what is known about pre-19th-century sign languages is limited to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate the transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself.

Debate around European monastic sign languages developed in the Middle Ages has come to regard them as gestural systems rather than true sign languages. Monastic sign languages were the basis for the first known manual alphabet used in deaf schools, developed by Pedro Ponce de León.
The earliest records of contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples of the Gulf Coast region in what is now Texas and northern Mexico note a fully formed sign language already in use by the time of the Europeans&#x27; arrival there. These records include the accounts of Cabeza de Vaca in 1527 and Coronado in 1541.

In 1620, Juan Pablo Bonet published (&#x27;Reduction of letters and art for teaching mute people to speak&#x27;) in Madrid. It is considered the first modern treatise of sign language phonetics, setting out a method of oral education for deaf people and a manual alphabet.
In Britain, manual alphabets were also in use for a number of purposes, such as secret communication, public speaking, or communication by or with deaf people. In 1648, John Bulwer described &quot;Master Babington&quot;, a deaf man proficient in the use of a manual alphabet, &quot; on the of his fingers&quot;, whose wife could converse with him easily, even in the dark through the use of tactile signing.

In 1680, George Dalgarno published &quot;Didascalocophus, or, The deaf and dumb mans tutor&quot;, in which he presented his own method of deaf education, including an &quot;arthrological&quot; alphabet, where letters are indicated by pointing to different joints of the fingers and palm of the left hand. Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time; some have speculated that they can be traced to early Ogham manual alphabets.

The vowels of this alphabet have survived in the modern alphabets used in British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern two-handed alphabet appeared in 1698 with (Latin for &quot;Language&quot; [or &quot;Tongue&quot;] &quot;of the Finger&quot;), a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak. He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment. Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted.

Charles de La Fin published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems. He described such codes for both English and Latin.

By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form. Descendants of this alphabet have been used by deaf communities, at least in education, in the former British colonies India, Australia, New Zealand, Uganda and South Africa, as well as the republics and provinces of the former Yugoslavia, Grand Cayman Island in the Caribbean, Indonesia, Norway, Germany and the United States.

During the Polygar Wars against the British, Veeran Sundaralingam communicated with Veerapandiya Kattabomman&#x27;s mute younger brother, Oomaithurai, by using their own sign language.

Frenchman Charles-Michel de l&#x27;Épée published his manual alphabet in the 18th century, which has survived largely unchanged in France and North America until the present time. In 1755, Abbé de l&#x27;Épée founded the first school for deaf children in Paris; Laurent Clerc was arguably its most famous graduate. Clerc went to the United States with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to found the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817. Gallaudet&#x27;s son, Edward Miner Gallaudet, founded a school for the deaf in 1857 in Washington, D.C., which in 1864 became the National Deaf-Mute College. Now called Gallaudet University, it is still the only liberal arts university for deaf people in the world.

International Sign, formerly known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf events such as the Deaflympics and meetings of the World Federation of the Deaf. While recent studies claim that International Sign is a kind of a pidgin, they conclude that it is more complex than a typical pidgin and indeed is more like a full sign language. While the more commonly used term is International Sign, it is sometimes referred to as Gestuno, International Sign Pidgin or International Gesture (IG). International Sign is a term used by the World Federation of the Deaf and other international organisations.

== Linguistics ==
Sign languages have capability and complexity equal to spoken languages; their study as part of the field of linguistics has demonstrated that they exhibit the fundamental properties that exist in all languages. Such fundamental properties include duality of patterning and recursion. Duality of patterning means that languages are composed of smaller, meaningless units which can be combined into larger units with meaning (see below). The term recursion means that languages exhibit grammatical rules and the output of such a rule can be the input of the same rule. It is, for example, possible in sign languages to create subordinate clauses and a subordinate clause may contain another subordinate clause.

Sign languages are not mime—in other words, signs are conventional, often arbitrary and do not necessarily have a visual relationship to their referent, much as most spoken language is not onomatopoeic. While iconicity is more systematic and widespread in sign languages than in spoken ones, the difference is not categorical. The visual modality allows the human preference for close connections between form and meaning, to be more fully expressive, where as this is more suppressed in spoken language.,

Sign languages, like spoken languages, organize elementary, meaningless units into meaningful semantic units. This type of organization in natural language is often called duality of patterning. As in spoken languages, these meaningless units are represented as (combinations of) features, although coarser descriptions are often also made in terms of five &quot;parameters&quot;: handshape (or &quot;handform&quot;), orientation, location (or &quot;place of articulation&quot;), movement, and non-manual expression. These meaningless units in sign languages were initially called cheremes, from the Greek word for &quot;hand&quot;, by analogy to the phonemes, from Greek for &quot;voice&quot;, of spoken languages. Now they are sometimes called phonemes when describing sign languages too, since the function is essentially the same, but more commonly discussed in terms of &quot;features&quot; or &quot;parameters&quot;. More generally, both sign and spoken languages share the characteristics that linguists have found in all natural human languages, such as transitoriness, semanticity, arbitrariness, productivity, and cultural transmission.

Common linguistic features of many sign languages are the occurrence of classifier constructions, a high degree of inflection by means of changes of movement, and a topic-comment syntax. More than spoken languages, sign languages can convey meaning by simultaneous means, e.g. by the use of space, two manual articulators, and the signer&#x27;s face and body. Though there is still much discussion on the topic of iconicity in sign languages, classifiers are generally considered to be highly iconic, as these complex constructions &quot;function as predicates that may express any or all of the following: motion, position, stative-descriptive, or handling information&quot;. The term classifier is not used by everyone working on these constructions. Across the field of sign language linguistics the same constructions are also referred with other terms such as depictive signs.

Today, linguists study sign languages as true languages, part of the field of linguistics. However, the category &quot;sign languages&quot; was not added to the &quot;Linguistic Bibliography/Bibliographie Linguistique&quot; until the 1988 volume, when it appeared with 39 entries.

=== Relationships with spoken languages ===
There is a common misconception that sign languages are spoken language expressed in signs, or that they were invented by hearing people. Similarities in language processing in the brain between signed and spoken languages further perpetuated this misconception. Hearing teachers in deaf schools, such as Charles-Michel de l&#x27;Épée or Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, are often incorrectly referred to as &quot;inventors&quot; of sign language. Instead, sign languages, like all natural languages, are developed by the people who use them, in this case, deaf people, who may have little or no knowledge of any spoken language.

As a sign language develops, it sometimes borrows elements from spoken languages, just as all languages borrow from other languages that they are in contact with. Sign languages vary in how much they borrow from spoken languages. In many sign languages, a manual alphabet (&quot;fingerspelling&quot;) may be used in signed communication to borrow a word from a spoken language. This is most commonly used for proper names of people and places; it is also used in some languages for concepts for which no sign is available at that moment, particularly if the people involved are to some extent bilingual in the spoken language. Fingerspelling can sometimes be a source of new signs, such as initialized signs, in which the handshape represents the first letter of a spoken word with the same meaning.
On the whole, though, sign languages are independent of spoken languages and follow their own paths of development. For example, British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) are quite different and mutually unintelligible, even though the hearing people of the United Kingdom and the United States share the same spoken language. The grammars of sign languages do not usually resemble those of spoken languages used in the same geographical area; in fact, in terms of syntax, ASL shares more with spoken Japanese than it does with English.

Similarly, countries which use a single spoken language throughout may have two or more sign languages, or an area that contains more than one spoken language might use only one sign language. South Africa, which has 11 official spoken languages and a similar number of other widely used spoken languages, is a good example of this. It has only one sign language with two variants due to its history of having two major educational institutions for the deaf which have served different geographic areas of the country.

=== Spatial grammar and simultaneity ===
Sign languages exploit the unique features of the visual medium (sight), but may also exploit tactile features (tactile sign languages). Spoken language is by and large linear; only one sound can be made or received at a time. Sign language, on the other hand, is visual and, hence, can use a simultaneous expression, although this is limited articulatorily and linguistically. Visual perception allows processing of simultaneous information.

One way in which many sign languages take advantage of the spatial nature of the language is through the use of classifiers. Classifiers allow a signer to spatially show a referent&#x27;s type, size, shape, movement, or extent.

The possible simultaneity of sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry or signing with one articulator only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the morphology (internal structure of individual signs).

=== Non-manual elements ===

Sign languages convey much of their prosody through non-manual elements. Postures or movements of the body, head, eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, and mouth are used in various combinations to show several categories of information, including lexical distinction, grammatical structure, adjectival or adverbial content, and discourse functions.

At the lexical level, signs can be lexically specified for non-manual elements in addition to the manual articulation. For instance, facial expressions may accompany verbs of emotion, as in the sign for &quot;angry&quot; in Czech Sign Language. Non-manual elements may also be lexically contrastive. For example, in ASL (American Sign Language), facial components distinguish some signs from other signs. An example is the sign translated as &quot;not yet&quot;, which requires that the tongue touch the lower lip and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features the sign would be interpreted as &quot;late&quot;. Mouthings, which are (parts of) spoken words accompanying lexical signs, can also be contrastive, as in the manually identical signs for &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;battery&quot; in Sign Language of the Netherlands.

While the content of a signed sentence is produced manually, many grammatical functions are produced non-manually (i.e., with the face and the torso). Such functions include questions, negation, relative clauses and topicalization. ASL and BSL use similar non-manual marking for yes/no questions, for example. They are shown through raised eyebrows and a forward head tilt.

Some adjectival and adverbial information is conveyed through non-manual elements, but what these elements are varies from language to language. For instance, in ASL a slightly open mouth with the tongue relaxed and visible in the corner of the mouth means &quot;carelessly&quot;, but a similar non-manual in BSL means &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;unpleasant&quot;.

Discourse functions such as turn taking are largely regulated through head movement and eye gaze. Since the addressee in a signed conversation must be watching the signer, a signer can avoid letting the other person have a turn by not looking at them, or can indicate that the other person may have a turn by making eye contact.

=== Iconicity ===
Iconicity is similarity or analogy between the form of a sign (linguistic or otherwise) and its meaning, as opposed to arbitrariness. The first studies on iconicity in ASL were published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many early sign language linguists rejected the notion that iconicity was an important aspect of sign languages, considering most perceived iconicity to be extralinguistic. However, mimetic aspects of sign language (signs that imitate, mimic, or represent) are found in abundance across a wide variety of sign languages. For example, when deaf children learning sign language try to express something but do not know the associated sign, they will often invent an iconic sign that displays mimetic properties. Though it never disappears from a particular sign language, iconicity is gradually weakened as forms of sign languages become more customary and are subsequently grammaticized. As a form becomes more conventional, it becomes disseminated in a methodical way phonologically to the rest of the sign language community. Nancy Frishberg concluded that though originally present in many signs, iconicity is degraded over time through the application of natural grammatical processes.

In 1978, psychologist Roger Brown was one of the first to suggest that the properties of ASL give it a clear advantage in terms of learning and memory. In his study, Brown found that when a group of six hearing children were taught signs that had high levels of iconic mapping they were significantly more likely to recall the signs in a later memory task than another group of six children that were taught signs that had little or no iconic properties. In contrast to Brown, linguists Elissa Newport and Richard Meier found that iconicity &quot;appears to have virtually no impact on the acquisition of American Sign Language&quot;.

A central task for the pioneers of sign language linguistics was trying to prove that ASL was a real language and not merely a collection of gestures or &quot;English on the hands.&quot; One of the prevailing beliefs at this time was that &quot;real languages&quot; must consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. Thus, if ASL consisted of signs that had iconic form-meaning relationship, it could not be considered a real language. As a result, iconicity as a whole was largely neglected in research of sign languages for a long time. However, iconicity also plays a role in many spoken languages. Spoken Japanese for example exhibits many words mimicking the sounds of their potential referents (see Japanese sound symbolism). Later researchers, thus, acknowledged that natural languages do not need to consist of an arbitrary relationship between form and meaning. The visual nature of sign language simply allows for a greater degree of iconicity compared to spoken languages as most real-world objects can be described by a prototypical shape (e.g., a table usually has a flat surface), but most real-world objects do not make prototypical sounds that can be mimicked by spoken languages (e.g., tables do not make prototypical sounds). However, sign languages are not fully iconic. On the one hand, there are also many arbitrary signs in sign languages and, on the other hand, the grammar of a sign language puts limits to the degree of iconicity: All known sign languages, for example, express lexical concepts via manual signs. From a truly iconic language one would expect that a concept like smiling would be expressed by mimicking a smile (i.e., by performing a smiling face). All known sign languages, however, do not express the concept of smiling by a smiling face, but by a manual sign.

The cognitive linguistics perspective rejects a more traditional definition of iconicity as a relationship between linguistic form and a concrete, real-world referent. Rather it is a set of selected correspondences between the form and meaning of a sign. In this view, iconicity is grounded in a language user&#x27;s mental representation (&quot;construal&quot; in cognitive grammar). It is defined as a fully grammatical and central aspect of a sign language rather than a peripheral phenomenon.

The cognitive linguistics perspective allows for some signs to be fully iconic or partially iconic given the number of correspondences between the possible parameters of form and meaning. In this way, the Israeli Sign Language (ISL) sign for &quot;ask&quot; has parts of its form that are iconic (&quot;movement away from the mouth&quot; means &quot;something coming from the mouth&quot;), and parts that are arbitrary (the handshape, and the orientation).

Many signs have metaphoric mappings as well as iconic or metonymic ones. For these signs there are three-way correspondences between a form, a concrete source and an abstract target meaning. The ASL sign LEARN has this three-way correspondence. The abstract target meaning is &quot;learning&quot;. The concrete source is putting objects into the head from books. The form is a grasping hand moving from an open palm to the forehead. The iconic correspondence is between form and concrete source. The metaphorical correspondence is between concrete source and abstract target meaning. Because the concrete source is connected to two correspondences linguistics refer to metaphorical signs as &quot;double mapped&quot;.
=== Classification ===

Sign languages may be classified by how they arise.

In non-signing communities, home sign is not a full language, but closer to a pidgin. Home sign is amorphous and generally idiosyncratic to a particular family, where a deaf child does not have contact with other deaf children and is not educated in sign. Such systems are not generally passed on from one generation to the next. Where they are passed on, creolization would be expected to occur, resulting in a full language. However, home sign may also be closer to full language in communities where the hearing population has a gestural mode of language; examples include various Australian Aboriginal sign languages and gestural systems across West Africa, such as Mofu-Gudur in Cameroon.

A village sign language is a local indigenous language that typically arises over several generations in a relatively insular community with a high incidence of deafness, and is used both by the deaf and by a significant portion of the hearing community, who have deaf family and friends. The most famous of these is probably the extinct Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language of the U.S., but there are also numerous village languages scattered throughout Africa, Asia, and America.

Deaf-community sign languages, on the other hand, arise where deaf people come together to form their own communities. These include school sign, such as Nicaraguan Sign Language, which develop in the student bodies of deaf schools which do not use sign as a language of instruction, as well as community languages such as Bamako Sign Language, which arise where generally uneducated deaf people congregate in urban centers for employment. At first, Deaf-community sign languages are not generally known by the hearing population, in many cases not even by close family members. However, they may grow, in some cases becoming a language of instruction and receiving official recognition, as in the case of ASL.

Both contrast with speech-taboo languages such as the various Aboriginal Australian sign languages, which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf. It is doubtful whether most of these are languages in their own right, rather than manual codes of spoken languages, though a few such as Yolngu Sign Language are independent of any particular spoken language. Hearing people may also develop sign to communicate with users of other languages, as in Plains Indian Sign Language; this was a contact signing system or pidgin that was evidently not used by deaf people in the Plains nations, though it presumably influenced home sign.

Language contact and creolization is common in the development of sign languages, making clear family classifications difficult– it is often unclear whether lexical similarity is due to borrowing or a common parent language, or whether there was one or several parent languages, such as several village languages merging into a Deaf-community language. Contact occurs between sign languages, between sign and spoken languages (contact sign, a kind of pidgin), and between sign languages and gestural systems used by the broader community. For example, Adamorobe Sign Language, a village sign language of Ghana, may be related to the &quot;gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa&quot;, in vocabulary and areal features including prosody and phonetics.
* BSL, Auslan and NZSL are usually considered to be a language known as BANZSL. Maritime Sign Language and South African Sign Language are also related to BSL.
* Danish Sign Language and its descendants Norwegian Sign Language and Icelandic Sign Language are largely mutually intelligible with Swedish Sign Language. Finnish Sign Language and Portuguese Sign Language derive from Swedish SL, though with local admixture in the case of mutually unintelligible Finnish SL. Danish SL has French SL influence and Wittmann (1991) places them in that family, though he proposes that Swedish, Finnish, and Portuguese SL are instead related to British Sign Language.
* Swedish Sign Language Family includes the following languages: Swedish Sign Language, Finnish Sign Language, Finland-Swedish Sign Language, Portuguese Sign Language, Eritrean Sign Language and the Cape Verdian Sign Language, although some reports also say that the São Tomé and Príncipe Sign Language is largely intelligible with Portuguese Sign.
* Indian Sign Language (ISL) is similar to Pakistani Sign Language.
* Japanese Sign Language, Taiwanese Sign Language and Korean Sign Language are thought to be members of a Japanese Sign Language family.
* French Sign Language family. There are a number of sign languages that emerged from French Sign Language (LSF), or are the result of language contact between local community sign languages and LSF. These include: French Sign Language, Italian Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language(LSQ), American Sign Language, Irish Sign Language, Russian Sign Language, Dutch Sign Language (NGT), Spanish Sign Language, Mexican Sign Language, Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), Catalan Sign Language, Ukrainian Sign Language, Austrian Sign Language (along with its twin Hungarian Sign Language and its offspring Czech Sign Language) and others.
** A subset of this group includes languages that have been heavily influenced by American Sign Language (ASL), or are regional varieties of ASL. Bolivian Sign Language is sometimes considered a dialect of ASL. Thai Sign Language is a mixed language derived from ASL and the native sign languages of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, and may be considered part of the ASL family. Others possibly influenced by ASL include Ugandan Sign Language, Kenyan Sign Language, Philippine Sign Language and Malaysian Sign Language.
** According to an SIL report, the sign languages of Russia, Moldova and Ukraine share a high degree of lexical similarity and may be dialects of one language, or distinct related languages. The same report suggested a &quot;cluster&quot; of sign languages centered around Czech Sign Language, Hungarian Sign Language and Slovak Sign Language. This group may also include Romanian, Bulgarian, and Polish sign languages.
* German Sign Language (DGS) gave rise to Polish Sign Language; it also at least strongly influenced Israeli Sign Language, though it is unclear whether the latter derives from DGS or from Austrian Sign Language, which is in the French family.
* The southern dialect of Chinese Sign Language gave rise to Hong Kong Sign Language, used in Hong Kong and Macau
* Lyons Sign Language may be the source of Flemish Sign Language (VGT) though this is unclear.
* Sign languages of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq (and possibly Saudi Arabia) may be part of a sprachbund, or may be one dialect of a larger Eastern Arabic Sign Language.
* Known isolates include Nicaraguan Sign Language, Turkish Sign Language, Armenian Sign Language, Kata Kolok, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language and Providence Island Sign Language.

The only comprehensive classification along these lines going beyond a simple listing of languages dates back to 1991. The classification is based on the 69 sign languages from the 1988 edition of Ethnologue that were known at the time of the 1989 conference on sign languages in Montreal and 11 more languages the author added after the conference.

In his classification, the author distinguishes between primary and auxiliary sign languages as well as between single languages and names that are thought to refer to more than one language. The prototype-A class of languages includes all those sign languages that seemingly cannot be derived from any other language. Prototype-R languages are languages that are remotely modelled on a prototype-A language (in many cases thought to have been French Sign Language) by a process Kroeber (1940) called &quot;stimulus diffusion&quot;. The families of BSL, DGS, JSL, LSF (and possibly LSG) were the products of creolization and relexification of prototype languages. Creolization is seen as enriching overt morphology in sign languages, as compared to reducing overt morphology in spoken languages.

=== Typology ===
Linguistic typology (going back to Edward Sapir) is based on word structure and distinguishes morphological classes such as agglutinating/concatenating, inflectional, polysynthetic, incorporating, and isolating ones.

Sign languages vary in word-order typology. For example, Austrian Sign Language, Japanese Sign Language and Indo-Pakistani Sign Language are Subject-object-verb while ASL is Subject-verb-object. Influence from the surrounding spoken languages is not improbable.

Sign languages tend to be incorporating classifier languages, where a classifier handshape representing the object is incorporated into those transitive verbs which allow such modification. For a similar group of intransitive verbs (especially motion verbs), it is the subject which is incorporated. Only in a very few sign languages (for instance Japanese Sign Language) are agents ever incorporated. In this way, since subjects of intransitives are treated similarly to objects of transitives, incorporation in sign languages can be said to follow an ergative pattern.

Brentari classifies sign languages as a whole group determined by the medium of communication (visual instead of auditory) as one group with the features monosyllabic and polymorphemic. That means, that one syllable (i.e. one word, one sign) can express several morphemes, e.g., subject and object of a verb determine the direction of the verb&#x27;s movement (inflection).

Another aspect of typology that has been studied in sign languages is their systems for cardinal numbers. Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.

=== Acquisition ===
Children who are exposed to a sign language from birth will acquire it, just as hearing children acquire their native spoken language. In a study done at McGill University, they found that American Sign Language users who acquired the language natively (from birth) performed better when asked to copy videos of ASL sentences than ASL users who acquired the language later in life. They also found that there are differences in the grammatical morphology of ASL sentences between the two groups, all suggesting that there is a very important critical period in learning signed languages.

The acquisition of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When a word that always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh-question word) is learned, the non-manual aspects are attached to the word but do not have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.

=== Written forms ===

Sign languages do not have a traditional or formal written form. Many deaf people do not see a need to write their own language.

Several ways to represent sign languages in written form have been developed.

* Stokoe notation, devised by Dr. William Stokoe for his 1965 &quot;Dictionary of American Sign Language&quot;, is an abstract phonemic notation system. Designed specifically for representing the use of the hands, it has no way of expressing facial expression or other non-manual features of sign languages. However, it was designed for research, particularly in a dictionary, not for general use.
* The Hamburg Notation System (HamNoSys), developed in the early 1990s, is a detailed phonetic system, not designed for any one sign language, and intended as a transcription system for researchers rather than as a practical script.
* David J. Peterson has attempted to create a phonetic transcription system for signing that is ASCII-friendly known as the Sign Language International Phonetic Alphabet (SLIPA).
* SignWriting, developed by Valerie Sutton in 1974, is a system for representing sign languages phonetically (including mouthing, facial expression and dynamics of movement). The script is sometimes used for detailed research, language documentation, as well as publishing texts and works in sign languages.
* si5s is another orthography which is largely phonemic. However, a few signs are logographs and/or ideographs due to regional variation in sign languages.
* ASL-phabet is a system designed primarily for education of deaf children by Dr. Sam Supalla which uses a minimalist collection of symbols in the order of Handshape-Location-Movement. Many signs can be written the same way (homograph).
*The Alphabetic Writing System for sign languages (, SEA, by its Spanish name and acronym), developed by linguist Ángel Herrero Blanco and two deaf researchers, Juan José Alfaro and Inmacualada Cascales, was published as a book in 2003 and made accessible in Spanish Sign Language on-line. This system makes use of the letters of the Latin alphabet with a few diacritics to represent sign through the morphemic sequence S L C Q D F (bimanual sign, place, contact, handshape, direction and internal form). The resulting words are meant to be read by signing. The system is designed to be applicable to any sign language with minimal modification and to be usable through any medium without special equipment or software. Non-manual elements can be encoded to some extent, but the authors argue that the system does not need to represent all elements of a sign to be practical, the same way written oral language does not. The system has seen some updates which are kept publicly on a wiki page. The Center for Linguistic Normalization of Spanish Sign Language has made use of SEA to transcribe all signs on its dictionary.

So far, there is no consensus regarding the written form of sign language. Except for SignWriting, none are widely used. Maria Galea writes that SignWriting &quot;is becoming widespread, uncontainable and untraceable. In the same way that works written in and about a well developed writing system such as the Latin script, the time has arrived where SW is so widespread, that it is impossible in the same way to list all works that have been produced using this writing system and that have been written about this writing system.&quot; For example, in 2015 at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, João Paulo Ampessan wrote his linguistics master&#x27;s dissertation in Brazilian Sign Language using Sutton SignWriting. In his dissertation, &quot;The Writing of Grammatical Non-Manual Expressions in Sentences in LIBRAS Using the SignWriting System,&quot; Ampessan states that &quot;the data indicate the need for [non-manual expressions] usage in writing sign language&quot;.

=== Sign perception ===
For a native signer, sign perception influences how the mind makes sense of their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary based on the other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development. The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category. Different handshapes are stored in other categories. The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, at the same time preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.

== In society ==

=== Deaf communities and Deaf culture ===
When deaf people constitute a relatively small proportion of the general population, deaf communities often develop that are distinct from the surrounding hearing community.
These deaf communities are very widespread in the world, associated especially with sign languages used in urban areas and throughout a nation, and the cultures they have developed are very rich.

One example of sign language variation in the deaf community is Black ASL. This sign language was developed in the black deaf community as a variant during the American era of segregation and racism, where young black deaf students were forced to attend separate schools than their white deaf peers.

=== Use of sign languages in hearing communities ===
On occasion, where the prevalence of deaf people is high enough, a deaf sign language has been taken up by an entire local community, forming what is sometimes called a &quot;village sign language&quot; or &quot;shared signing community&quot;. Typically this happens in small, tightly integrated communities with a closed gene pool. Famous examples include:
* Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language, United States
* Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, Israel
* Kata Kolok, Bali
* Adamorobe Sign Language, Ghana 
* Yucatec Maya Sign Language, Mexico 
In such communities deaf people are generally well-integrated in the general community and not socially disadvantaged, so much so that it is difficult to speak of a separate &quot;Deaf&quot; community.

Many Australian Aboriginal sign languages arose in a context of extensive speech taboos, such as during mourning and initiation rites. They are or were especially highly developed among the Warlpiri, Warumungu, Dieri, Kaytetye, Arrernte, and Warlmanpa, and are based on their respective spoken languages.

A sign language arose among tribes of American Indians in the Great Plains region of North America (see Plains Indian Sign Language) before European contact. It was used by hearing people to communicate among tribes with different spoken languages, as well as by deaf people. There are especially users today among the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.

Sign language is also used as a form of alternative or augmentative communication by people who can hear but have difficulties using their voices to speak.

Increasingly, hearing schools and universities are expressing interest in incorporating sign language. In the U.S., enrollment for ASL (American Sign Language) classes as part of students&#x27; choice of second language is on the rise. In New Zealand, one year after the passing of NZSL Act 2006 in parliament, a NZSL curriculum was released for schools to take NZSL as an optional subject. The curriculum and teaching materials were designed to target intermediate schools from Years 7 to 10, (NZ Herald, 2007).

=== Legal recognition ===

Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. Sarah Batterbury has argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for those with disabilities, but as the communication medium of language communities.

Legal requirements covering sign language accessibility in media vary from country to country. In the United Kingdom, the Broadcasting Act 1996 addressed the requirements for blind and deaf viewers, but has since been replaced by the Communications Act 2003.

=== Interpretation ===
In order to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing people, sign language interpreters are often used. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the interpreter, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own syntax, different from any spoken language.

The interpretation flow is normally between a sign language and a spoken language that are customarily used in the same country, such as French Sign Language (LSF) and spoken French in France, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish in Spain, British Sign Language (BSL) and spoken English in the U.K., and American Sign Language (ASL) and spoken English in the U.S. and most of anglophone Canada (since BSL and ASL are distinct sign languages both used in English-speaking countries), etc. Sign language interpreters who can translate between signed and spoken languages that are not normally paired (such as between LSE and English), are also available, albeit less frequently.

Sign language is sometimes provided for television programmes that include speech. The signer usually appears in the bottom corner of the screen, with the programme being broadcast full size or slightly shrunk away from that corner. Typically for press conferences such as those given by the Mayor of New York City, the signer appears to stage left or right of the public official to allow both the speaker and signer to be in frame at the same time. Live sign interpretation of important televised events is increasingly common but still an informal industry In traditional analogue broadcasting, some programmes are repeated outside main viewing hours with a signer present. Some emerging television technologies allow the viewer to turn the signer on and off in a similar manner to subtitles and closed captioning.

=== Technology ===
One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT&amp;T&#x27;s videophone (trademarked as the Picturephone) was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair– two deaf users were able to freely communicate with each other between the fair and another city. However, video communication did not become widely available until sufficient bandwidth for the high volume of video data became available in the early 2000s.

The Internet now allows deaf people to talk via a video link, either with a special-purpose videophone designed for use with sign language or with &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; video services designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer webcam. The special videophones that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than &#x27;off-the-shelf&#x27; services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person&#x27;s video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.

Interpreters may be physically present with both parties to the conversation but, since the technological advancements in the early 2000s, provision of interpreters in remote locations has become available. In video remote interpreting (VRI), the two clients (a sign language user and a hearing person who wish to communicate with each other) are in one location, and the interpreter is in another. The interpreter communicates with the sign language user via a video telecommunications link, and with the hearing person by an audio link. VRI can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available.

However, VRI cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. With video relay service (VRS), the sign language user, the interpreter, and the hearing person are in three separate locations, thus allowing the two clients to talk to each other on the phone through the interpreter.

With recent developments in artificial intelligence in computer science, some recent deep learning based machine translation algorithms have been developed which automatically translate short videos containing sign language directly to written language.

Sign language has been incorporated into film; for example, all movies shown in Brazilian movie theaters must have a Brazilian Sign Language video track available to play alongside the film via a second screen. 

=== Sign Union flag ===
The Sign Union flag was designed by Arnaud Balard. After studying flags around the world and vexillology principles for two years, Balard revealed the design of the flag, featuring the stylized outline of a hand. The three colors which make up the flag design are representative of Deafhood and humanity (dark blue), sign language (turquoise), and enlightenment and hope (yellow). Balard intended the flag to be an international symbol which welcomes deaf people.

=== Language endangerment and extinction ===
As with any spoken language, sign languages are also vulnerable to becoming endangered. For example, a sign language used by a small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users shift to a sign language used by a larger community, as has happened with Hawai&#x27;i Sign Language, which is almost extinct except for a few elderly signers. Even nationally recognised sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users. Methods are being developed to assess the language vitality of sign languages.
;Endangered sign languages:
*Adamorobe Sign Language (AdaSL)
*Ban Khor Sign Language (BKSL)
*Benkala Sign Language (KK)
*Finland-Swedish Sign Language (FinSSL)
*Hawai&#x27;i Sign Language (HPSL)
*Inuit Sign Language (IUR)
*Jamaican Country Sign Language (KS)
*Maritime Sign Language (MSL)
*Old Bangkok Sign Language (OBSL)
*Old Chiangmai Sign Language (OCSL)
*Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL)
*Providencia Sign Language (PSL)
*Rennellese Sign Language (RSL)

;Extinct sign languages:
* Angami Naga Sign Language
* Henniker Sign Language
* Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL)
* Old French Sign Language (VLSF)
* Old Kentish Sign Language (OKSL)
* Pitta Pitta sign language
* Plateau Sign Language
* Sandy River Valley Sign Language
* Warluwarra sign language
== Communication systems similar to sign language ==
There are a number of communication systems that are similar in some respects to sign languages, while not having all the characteristics of a full sign language, particularly its grammatical structure. Many of these are either precursors to natural sign languages or are derived from them.

=== Manual codes for spoken languages ===
When Deaf and Hearing people interact, signing systems may be developed that use signs drawn from a natural sign language but used according to the grammar of the spoken language. In particular, when people devise one-for-one sign-for-word correspondences between spoken words (or even morphemes) and signs that represent them, the system that results is a manual code for a spoken language, rather than a natural sign language. Such systems may be invented in an attempt to help teach Deaf children the spoken language, and generally are not used outside an educational context.

=== &quot;Baby sign language&quot; with hearing children ===
Some hearing parents teach signs to young hearing children. Since the muscles in babies&#x27; hands grow and develop quicker than their mouths, signs are seen as a beneficial option for better communication. Babies can usually produce signs before they can speak. This reduces the confusion between parents when trying to figure out what their child wants. When the child begins to speak, signing is usually abandoned, so the child does not progress to acquiring the grammar of the sign language.

This is in contrast to hearing children who grow up with Deaf parents, who generally acquire the full sign language natively, the same as Deaf children of Deaf parents.

=== Home sign ===
Informal, rudimentary sign systems are sometimes developed within a single family. For instance, when hearing parents with no sign language skills have a deaf child, the child may develop a system of signs naturally, unless repressed by the parents. The term for these mini-languages is home sign (sometimes &quot;kitchen sign&quot;).

Home sign arises due to the absence of any other way to communicate. Within the span of a single lifetime and without the support or feedback of a community, the child naturally invents signs to help meet his or her communication needs, and may even develop a few grammatical rules for combining short sequences of signs. Still, this kind of system is inadequate for the intellectual development of a child and it comes nowhere near meeting the standards linguists use to describe a complete language. No type of home sign is recognized as a full language.

===Primate use===
There have been several notable examples of scientists teaching signs to non-human primates in order to communicate with humans, such as chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. However, linguists generally point out that this does not constitute knowledge of a human &quot;language&quot; as a complete system, rather than simply signs/words. Notable examples of animals who have learned signs include:
* Chimpanzees: Washoe, Nim Chimpsky and Loulis
* Gorillas: Koko and Michael

=== Gestural theory of human language origins ===
One theory of the evolution of human language states that it developed first as a gestural system, which later shifted to speech. An important question for this gestural theory is what caused the shift to vocalization.

<text>In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). A string is generally considered as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. &quot;String&quot; may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.

Depending on the programming language and precise data type used, a variable declared to be a string may either cause storage in memory to be statically allocated for a predetermined maximum length or employ dynamic allocation to allow it to hold a variable number of elements.

When a string appears literally in source code, it is known as a string literal or an anonymous string.

In formal languages, which are used in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, a string is a finite sequence of symbols that are chosen from a set called an alphabet.

== Purpose ==

A primary purpose of strings is to store human-readable text, like words and sentences. Strings are used to communicate information from a computer program to the user of the program. A program may also accept string input from its user. Further, strings may store data expressed as characters yet not intended for human reading.

Example strings and their purposes:

* A message like &quot;codice_1&quot; is a string that software shows to end users. In the program&#x27;s source code, this message would likely appear as a string literal.
* User-entered text, like &quot;codice_2&quot; as a status update on a social media service. Instead of a string literal, the software would likely store this string in a database.
* Alphabetical data, like &quot;codice_3&quot; representing nucleic acid sequences of DNA.
* Computer settings or parameters, like &quot;codice_4&quot; as a URL query string. Often these are intended to be somewhat human-readable, though their primary purpose is to communicate to computers.

The term string may also designate a sequence of data or computer records other than characters like a &quot;string of bits&quot; but when used without qualification it refers to strings of characters.

==History==

Use of the word &quot;string&quot; to mean any items arranged in a line, series or succession dates back centuries. In 19th-century typesetting, compositors used the term &quot;string&quot; to denote a length of type printed on paper; the string would be measured to determine the compositor&#x27;s pay.

Use of the word &quot;string&quot; to mean &quot;a sequence of symbols or linguistic elements in a definite order&quot; emerged from mathematics, symbolic logic, and linguistic theory to speak about the formal behavior of symbolic systems, setting aside the symbols&#x27; meaning.

For example, logician C. I. Lewis wrote in 1918:

A mathematical system is any set of strings of recognisable marks in which some of the strings are taken initially and the remainder derived from these by operations performed according to rules which are independent of any meaning assigned to the marks. That a system should consist of &#x27;marks&#x27; instead of sounds or odours is immaterial.
According to Jean E. Sammet, &quot;the first realistic string handling and pattern matching language&quot; for computers was COMIT in the 1950s, followed by the SNOBOL language of the early 1960s.

== String datatypes ==
A string datatype is a datatype modeled on the idea of a formal string. Strings are such an important and useful datatype that they are implemented in nearly every programming language. In some languages they are available as primitive types and in others as composite types. The syntax of most high-level programming languages allows for a string, usually quoted in some way, to represent an instance of a string datatype; such a meta-string is called a &quot;literal&quot; or &quot;string literal&quot;.

=== String length ===
Although formal strings can have an arbitrary finite length, the length of strings in real languages is often constrained to an artificial maximum. In general, there are two types of string datatypes: &quot;fixed-length strings&quot;, which have a fixed maximum length to be determined at compile time and which use the same amount of memory whether this maximum is needed or not, and &quot;variable-length strings&quot;, whose length is not arbitrarily fixed and which can use varying amounts of memory depending on the actual requirements at run time (see Memory management). Most strings in modern programming languages are variable-length strings. Of course, even variable-length strings are limited in length by the amount of available memory. The string length can be stored as a separate integer (which may put another artificial limit on the length) or implicitly through a termination character, usually a character value with all bits zero such as in C programming language. See also &quot;Null-terminated&quot; below.

=== Character encoding ===
String datatypes have historically allocated one byte per character, and, although the exact character set varied by region, character encodings were similar enough that programmers could often get away with ignoring this, since characters a program treated specially (such as period and space and comma) were in the same place in all the encodings a program would encounter. These character sets were typically based on ASCII or EBCDIC. If text in one encoding was displayed on a system using a different encoding, text was often mangled, though often somewhat readable and some computer users learned to read the mangled text.

Logographic languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (known collectively as CJK) need far more than 256 characters (the limit of a one 8-bit byte per-character encoding) for reasonable representation. The normal solutions involved keeping single-byte representations for ASCII and using two-byte representations for CJK ideographs. Use of these with existing code led to problems with matching and cutting of strings, the severity of which depended on how the character encoding was designed. Some encodings such as the EUC family guarantee that a byte value in the ASCII range will represent only that ASCII character, making the encoding safe for systems that use those characters as field separators. Other encodings such as ISO-2022 and Shift-JIS do not make such guarantees, making matching on byte codes unsafe. These encodings also were not &quot;self-synchronizing&quot;, so that locating character boundaries required backing up to the start of a string, and pasting two strings together could result in corruption of the second string.

Unicode has simplified the picture somewhat. Most programming languages now have a datatype for Unicode strings. Unicode&#x27;s preferred byte stream format UTF-8 is designed not to have the problems described above for older multibyte encodings. UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 require the programmer to know that the fixed-size code units are different from the &quot;characters&quot;, the main difficulty currently is incorrectly designed APIs that attempt to hide this difference (UTF-32 does make &quot;code points&quot; fixed-sized, but these are not &quot;characters&quot; due to composing codes).

=== Implementations ===

Some languages, such as C++, Perl and Ruby, normally allow the contents of a string to be changed after it has been created; these are termed &quot;mutable&quot; strings. In other languages, such as Java, JavaScript, Lua, Python, and Go, the value is fixed and a new string must be created if any alteration is to be made; these are termed &quot;immutable&quot; strings. Some of these languages with immutable strings also provide another type that is mutable, such as Java and .NET&#x27;s , the thread-safe Java , and the Cocoa codice_5. There are both advantages and disadvantages to immutability: although immutable strings may require inefficiently creating many copies, they are simpler and completely thread-safe.

Strings are typically implemented as arrays of bytes, characters, or code units, in order to allow fast access to individual units or substrings—including characters when they have a fixed length. A few languages such as Haskell implement them as linked lists instead.

A lot of high-level languages provide strings as a primitive data type, such as JavaScript and PHP, while most others provide them as a composite data type, some with special language support in writing literals, for example, Java and C#.

Some languages, such as C, Prolog and Erlang, avoid implementing a dedicated string datatype at all, instead adopting the convention of representing strings as lists of character codes. Even in programming languages having a dedicated string type, string can usually be iterated as a sequence character codes, like lists of integers or other values.

=== Representations ===
Representations of strings depend heavily on the choice of character repertoire and the method of character encoding. Older string implementations were designed to work with repertoire and encoding defined by ASCII, or more recent extensions like the ISO 8859 series. Modern implementations often use the extensive repertoire defined by Unicode along with a variety of complex encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16.

The term &quot;byte string&quot; usually indicates a general-purpose string of bytes, rather than strings of only (readable) characters, strings of bits, or such. Byte strings often imply that bytes can take any value and any data can be stored as-is, meaning that there should be no value interpreted as a termination value.

Most string implementations are very similar to variable-length arrays with the entries storing the character codes of corresponding characters. The principal difference is that, with certain encodings, a single logical character may take up more than one entry in the array. This happens for example with UTF-8, where single codes (UCS code points) can take anywhere from one to four bytes, and single characters can take an arbitrary number of codes. In these cases, the logical length of the string (number of characters) differs from the physical length of the array (number of bytes in use). UTF-32 avoids the first part of the problem.

==== Null-terminated ====
The length of a string can be stored implicitly by using a special terminating character; often this is the null character (NUL), which has all bits zero, a convention used and perpetuated by the popular C programming language. Hence, this representation is commonly referred to as a C string. This representation of an &quot;n&quot;-character string takes &quot;n&quot; + 1 space (1 for the terminator), and is thus an implicit data structure.

In terminated strings, the terminating code is not an allowable character in any string. Strings with &quot;length&quot; field do not have this limitation and can also store arbitrary binary data.

An example of a &quot;null-terminated string&quot; stored in a 10-byte buffer, along with its ASCII (or more modern UTF-8) representation as 8-bit hexadecimal numbers is:

The length of the string in the above example, &quot;codice_6&quot;, is 5 characters, but it occupies 6 bytes. Characters after the terminator do not form part of the representation; they may be either part of other data or just garbage. (Strings of this form are sometimes called &quot;ASCIZ strings&quot;, after the original assembly language directive used to declare them.)

==== Byte- and bit-terminated ====
Using a special byte other than null for terminating strings has historically appeared in both hardware and software, though sometimes with a value that was also a printing character. codice_7 was used by many assembler systems, codice_8 used by CDC systems (this character had a value of zero), and the ZX80 used codice_9 since this was the string delimiter in its BASIC language.

Somewhat similar, &quot;data processing&quot; machines like the IBM 1401 used a special word mark bit to delimit strings at the left, where the operation would start at the right. This bit had to be clear in all other parts of the string. This meant that, while the IBM 1401 had a seven-bit word, almost no-one ever thought to use this as a feature, and override the assignment of the seventh bit to (for example) handle ASCII codes.

Early microcomputer software relied upon the fact that ASCII codes do not use the high-order bit, and set it to indicate the end of a string. It must be reset to 0 prior to output.

==== Length-prefixed ====
The length of a string can also be stored explicitly, for example by prefixing the string with the length as a byte value. This convention is used in many Pascal dialects; as a consequence, some people call such a string a Pascal string or P-string. Storing the string length as byte limits the maximum string length to 255. To avoid such limitations, improved implementations of P-strings use 16-, 32-, or 64-bit words to store the string length. When the &quot;length&quot; field covers the address space, strings are limited only by the available memory.

If the length is bounded, then it can be encoded in constant space, typically a machine word, thus leading to an implicit data structure, taking &quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot; space, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of characters in a word (8 for 8-bit ASCII on a 64-bit machine, 1 for 32-bit UTF-32/UCS-4 on a 32-bit machine, etc.).
If the length is not bounded, encoding a length &quot;n&quot; takes log(&quot;n&quot;) space (see fixed-length code), so length-prefixed strings are a succinct data structure, encoding a string of length &quot;n&quot; in log(&quot;n&quot;) + &quot;n&quot; space.

In the latter case, the length-prefix field itself does not have fixed length, therefore the actual string data needs to be moved when the string grows such that the length field needs to be increased.

Here is a Pascal string stored in a 10-byte buffer, along with its ASCII / UTF-8 representation:

==== Strings as records ====
Many languages, including object-oriented ones, implement strings as records with an internal structure like:
class string {
 size_t length;
 char *text;


However, since the implementation is usually hidden, the string must be accessed and modified through member functions. codice_10 is a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory area, which might be expanded as needed. See also string (C++).

==== Other representations ====
Both character termination and length codes limit strings: For example, C character arrays that contain null (NUL) characters cannot be handled directly by C string library functions: Strings using a length code are limited to the maximum value of the length code.

Both of these limitations can be overcome by clever programming.

It is possible to create data structures and functions that manipulate them that do not have the problems associated with character termination and can in principle overcome length code bounds. It is also possible to optimize the string represented using techniques from run length encoding (replacing repeated characters by the character value and a length) and Hamming encoding.

While these representations are common, others are possible. Using ropes makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and concatenations more efficient.

The core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) that represents the current state of the file being edited.
While that state could be stored in a single long consecutive array of characters, a typical text editor instead uses an alternative representation as its sequence data structure—a gap buffer, a linked list of lines, a piece table, or a rope—which makes certain string operations, such as insertions, deletions, and undoing previous edits, more efficient.

=== Security concerns ===
The differing memory layout and storage requirements of strings can affect the security of the program accessing the string data. String representations requiring a terminating character are commonly susceptible to buffer overflow problems if the terminating character is not present, caused by a coding error or an attacker deliberately altering the data. String representations adopting a separate length field are also susceptible if the length can be manipulated. In such cases, program code accessing the string data requires bounds checking to ensure that it does not inadvertently access or change data outside of the string memory limits.

String data is frequently obtained from user input to a program. As such, it is the responsibility of the program to validate the string to ensure that it represents the expected format. Performing limited or no validation of user input can cause a program to be vulnerable to code injection attacks.

== Literal strings ==
Sometimes, strings need to be embedded inside a text file that is both human-readable and intended for consumption by a machine. This is needed in, for example, source code of programming languages, or in configuration files. In this case, the NUL character does not work well as a terminator since it is normally invisible (non-printable) and is difficult to input via a keyboard. Storing the string length would also be inconvenient as manual computation and tracking of the length is tedious and error-prone.

Two common representations are:
* Surrounded by quotation marks (ASCII 0x22 double quote codice_11 or ASCII 0x27 single quote codice_12), used by most programming languages. To be able to include special characters such as the quotation mark itself, newline characters, or non-printable characters, escape sequences are often available, usually prefixed with the backslash character (ASCII 0x5C).
* Terminated by a newline sequence, for example in Windows INI files.

== Non-text strings ==
While character strings are very common uses of strings, a string in computer science may refer generically to any sequence of homogeneously typed data. A bit string or byte string, for example, may be used to represent non-textual binary data retrieved from a communications medium. This data may or may not be represented by a string-specific datatype, depending on the needs of the application, the desire of the programmer, and the capabilities of the programming language being used. If the programming language&#x27;s string implementation is not 8-bit clean, data corruption may ensue.

C programmers draw a sharp distinction between a &quot;string&quot;, aka a &quot;string of characters&quot;, which by definition is always null terminated, vs. a &quot;array of characters&quot; which may be stored in the same array but is often not null terminated.
Using C string handling functions on such an array of characters often seems to work, but later leads to security problems.

== String processing algorithms ==

There are many algorithms for processing strings, each with various trade-offs. Competing algorithms can be analyzed with respect to run time, storage requirements, and so forth. The name stringology was coined in 1984 by computer scientist Zvi Galil for the theory of algorithms and data structures used for string processing.

Some categories of algorithms include:
* String searching algorithms for finding a given substring or pattern
* String manipulation algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
* Regular expression algorithms
* Parsing a string
* Sequence mining

Advanced string algorithms often employ complex mechanisms and data structures, among them suffix trees and finite-state machines.

== Character string-oriented languages and utilities ==
Character strings are such a useful datatype that several languages have been designed in order to make string processing applications easy to write. Examples include the following languages:
* AWK
* Icon
* MUMPS
* Perl
* Rexx
* Ruby
* sed
* SNOBOL
* Tcl
* TTM

Many Unix utilities perform simple string manipulations and can be used to easily program some powerful string processing algorithms. Files and finite streams may be viewed as strings.

Some APIs like Multimedia Control Interface, embedded SQL or printf use strings to hold commands that will be interpreted.

Many scripting programming languages, including Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl employ regular expressions to facilitate text operations. Perl is particularly noted for its regular expression use, and many other languages and applications implement Perl compatible regular expressions.

Some languages such as Perl and Ruby support string interpolation, which permits arbitrary expressions to be evaluated and included in string literals.

== Character string functions ==
String functions are used to create strings or change the contents of a mutable string. They also are used to query information about a string. The set of functions and their names varies depending on the computer programming language.

The most basic example of a string function is the string length function – the function that returns the length of a string (not counting any terminator characters or any of the string&#x27;s internal structural information) and does not modify the string. This function is often named codice_13 or codice_14. For example, codice_15 would return 11. Another common function is concatenation, where a new string is created by appending two strings, often this is the + addition operator.

Some microprocessor&#x27;s instruction set architectures contain direct support for string operations, such as block copy (e.g. In intel x86m codice_16).

== Formal theory ==
Let Σ be a finite set of distinct, unambiguous symbols (alternatively called characters), called the alphabet. A string (or word or expression) over Σ is any finite sequence of symbols from Σ. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then &quot;01011&quot; is a string over Σ.

The &quot;length&quot; of a string &quot;s&quot; is the number of symbols in &quot;s&quot; (the length of the sequence) and can be any non-negative integer; it is often denoted as |&quot;s&quot;|. The &quot;empty string&quot; is the unique string over Σ of length 0, and is denoted &quot;ε&quot; or &quot;λ&quot;.

The set of all strings over Σ of length &quot;n&quot; is denoted Σ&quot;n&quot;. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}. We have Σ0 = {ε} for every alphabet Σ.

The set of all strings over Σ of any length is the Kleene closure of Σ and is denoted Σ*. In terms of Σ&quot;n&quot;,
:formula_1
For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then Σ* = {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 010, 011, ...}. Although the set Σ* itself is countably infinite, each element of Σ* is a string of finite length.

A set of strings over Σ (i.e. any subset of Σ*) is called a &quot;formal language&quot; over Σ. For example, if Σ = {0, 1}, the set of strings with an even number of zeros, {ε, 1, 00, 11, 001, 010, 100, 111, 0000, 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111, ...}, is a formal language over Σ.

=== Concatenation and substrings ===
&quot;Concatenation&quot; is an important binary operation on Σ*. For any two strings &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in Σ*, their concatenation is defined as the sequence of symbols in &quot;s&quot; followed by the sequence of characters in &quot;t&quot;, and is denoted &quot;st&quot;. For example, if Σ = {a, b, ..., z}, &quot;s&quot; = , and &quot;t&quot; = , then &quot;st&quot; =  and &quot;ts&quot; = .

String concatenation is an associative, but non-commutative operation. The empty string ε serves as the identity element; for any string &quot;s&quot;, ε&quot;s&quot; = &quot;s&quot;ε = &quot;s&quot;. Therefore, the set Σ* and the concatenation operation form a monoid, the free monoid generated by Σ. In addition, the length function defines a monoid homomorphism from Σ* to the non-negative integers (that is, a function formula_2, such that formula_3).

A string &quot;s&quot; is said to be a &quot;substring&quot; or &quot;factor&quot; of &quot;t&quot; if there exist (possibly empty) strings &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;t&quot; = &quot;usv&quot;. The relation &quot;is a substring of&quot; defines a partial order on Σ*, the least element of which is the empty string.

=== Prefixes and suffixes ===
A string &quot;s&quot; is said to be a prefix of &quot;t&quot; if there exists a string &quot;u&quot; such that &quot;t&quot; = &quot;su&quot;. If &quot;u&quot; is nonempty, &quot;s&quot; is said to be a &quot;proper&quot; prefix of &quot;t&quot;. Symmetrically, a string &quot;s&quot; is said to be a suffix of &quot;t&quot; if there exists a string &quot;u&quot; such that &quot;t&quot; = &quot;us&quot;. If &quot;u&quot; is nonempty, &quot;s&quot; is said to be a &quot;proper&quot; suffix of &quot;t&quot;. Suffixes and prefixes are substrings of &quot;t&quot;. Both the relations &quot;is a prefix of&quot; and &quot;is a suffix of&quot; are prefix orders.

=== Reversal ===
The reverse of a string is a string with the same symbols but in reverse order. For example, if &quot;s&quot; = abc (where a, b, and c are symbols of the alphabet), then the reverse of &quot;s&quot; is cba. A string that is the reverse of itself (e.g., &quot;s&quot; = madam) is called a palindrome, which also includes the empty string and all strings of length 1.

=== Rotations ===
A string &quot;s&quot; = &quot;uv&quot; is said to be a rotation of &quot;t&quot; if &quot;t&quot; = &quot;vu&quot;. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} the string 0011001 is a rotation of 0100110, where &quot;u&quot; = 00110 and &quot;v&quot; = 01. As another example, the string abc has three different rotations, viz. abc itself (with &quot;u&quot;=abc, &quot;v&quot;=ε), bca (with &quot;u&quot;=bc, &quot;v&quot;=a), and cab (with &quot;u&quot;=c, &quot;v&quot;=ab).

=== Lexicographical ordering ===
It is often useful to define an ordering on a set of strings. If the alphabet Σ has a total order (cf. alphabetical order) one can define a total order on Σ* called lexicographical order. The lexicographical order is total if the alphabetical order is, but is not well-founded for any nontrivial alphabet, even if the alphabetical order is. For example, if Σ = {0, 1} and 0 &lt; 1, then the lexicographical order on Σ* includes the relationships ε &lt; 0 &lt; 00 &lt; 000 &lt; ... &lt; 0001 &lt; ... &lt; 001 &lt; ... &lt; 01 &lt; 010 &lt; ... &lt; 011 &lt; 0110 &lt; ... &lt; 01111 &lt; ... &lt; 1 &lt; 10 &lt; 100 &lt; ... &lt; 101 &lt; ... &lt; 111 &lt; ... &lt; 1111 &lt; ... &lt; 11111 ... With respect to this ordering, e.g. the infinite set { 1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, 000001, ... } has no minimal element.

See Shortlex for an alternative string ordering that preserves well-foundedness.
For the example alphabet, the shortlex order is ε &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 00 &lt; 01 &lt; 10 &lt; 11 &lt; 000 &lt; 001 &lt; 010 &lt; 011 &lt; 100 &lt; 101 &lt; 0110 &lt; 111 &lt; 0000 &lt; 0001 &lt; 0010 &lt; 0011 &lt; ... &lt; 1111 &lt; 00000 &lt; 00001 ...

=== String operations ===
A number of additional operations on strings commonly occur in the formal theory. These are given in the article on string operations.

=== Topology ===

Strings admit the following interpretation as nodes on a graph, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of symbols in Σ:
* Fixed-length strings of length &quot;n&quot; can be viewed as the integer locations in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube with sides of length &quot;k&quot;-1.
* Variable-length strings (of finite length) can be viewed as nodes on a perfect &quot;k&quot;-ary tree.
* Infinite strings (otherwise not considered here) can be viewed as infinite paths on a &quot;k&quot;-node complete graph.

The natural topology on the set of fixed-length strings or variable-length strings is the discrete topology, but the natural topology on the set of infinite strings is the limit topology, viewing the set of infinite strings as the inverse limit of the sets of finite strings. This is the construction used for the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers and some constructions of the Cantor set, and yields the same topology.

Isomorphisms between string representations of topologies can be found by normalizing according to the lexicographically minimal string rotation.

<text>Satanism refers to a group of religious, ideological, or philosophical beliefs based on Satan—particularly his worship or veneration. Satan is associated with the Devil in Christianity, a fallen angel regarded as chief of the demons who tempt humans into sin. The phenomenon of Satanism shares &quot;historical connections and family resemblances&quot; with the Left Hand Path milieu of other occult figures such as Beelzebub, Hecate, Lilith, Lucifer, and Set. Self-identified Satanism is a relatively modern phenomenon, largely attributed to the 1966 founding of the Church of Satan by Anton LaVey in the United States—an atheistic group that does not believe in a supernatural Satan.

Accusations of groups engaged in &quot;devil worship&quot; have echoed throughout much of Christian history. During the Middle Ages, the Inquisition led by the Catholic Church alleged that various heretical Christian sects and groups, such as the Knights Templar and the Cathars, performed secret Satanic rituals. In the subsequent Early Modern period, belief in a widespread Satanic conspiracy of witches resulted in the trials and executions of tens of thousands of alleged witches across Europe and the North American colonies, peaking between 1560 and 1630 CE. The terms &quot;Satanist&quot; and &quot;Satanism&quot; emerged during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation (1517–1700 CE), as both Catholics and Protestants accused each other of intentionally being in league with Satan.

Since the 19th century various small religious groups have emerged that identify as Satanist or use Satanic iconography. While the groups that appeared after the 1960s differed greatly, they can be broadly divided into theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism. Those venerating Satan as a supernatural deity are unlikely to ascribe omnipotence, instead relating to Satan as a patriarch. Atheistic Satanists regard Satan as a symbol of certain human traits, a useful metaphor without ontological reality. Contemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon, although the rise of globalization and the Internet have seen these ideas spread to other parts of the world.

==Devil in society==
Historical and anthropological research suggests that nearly all societies have developed the idea of a sinister and anti-human force that can hide itself within society. This commonly involves a belief in witches, a group of individuals who invert the norms of their society and seek to harm their community, for instance by engaging in incest, murder, and cannibalism. Allegations of witchcraft may have different causes and serve different functions within a society. For instance, they may serve to uphold social norms, to heighten the tension in existing conflicts between individuals, or to scapegoat certain individuals for various social problems.

Another contributing factor to the idea of Satanism is the concept that there is an agent of misfortune and evil who operates on a cosmic scale, something usually associated with a strong form of ethical dualism that divides the world clearly into forces of good and forces of evil. The earliest such entity known is Angra Mainyu, a figure that appears in the Persian religion of Zoroastrianism. This concept was also embraced by Judaism and early Christianity, and although it was soon marginalized within Jewish thought, it gained increasing importance within early Christian understandings of the cosmos.

The Native South American terrible god Tiw is traditionally honored with the syncretic dance and parade &quot;Diablada&quot; (&#x27;Dance of the Devils&#x27;) that was opposed to the Catholic Church in origin.

== Etymology and definitions ==

===Etymology===

The term &quot;Satan&quot; has evolved from a Hebrew term for &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;to oppose&quot;, into the Christian figure of a fallen angel who tempts mortals into sin. The word &quot;Satan&quot; was not originally a proper name, but rather an ordinary noun that means &quot;adversary&quot;. In this context, it appears at several points in the Old Testament. For instance, in the Book of Samuel, David is presented as the satan (&quot;adversary&quot;) of the Philistines, while in the Book of Numbers, the term appears as a verb, when Jehovah sent an angel to satan (&quot;to oppose&quot;) Balaam.

Prior to the composition of the New Testament, the idea developed within Jewish communities that Satan was the name of an angel who had rebelled against Jehovah and had been cast out of Heaven along with his followers; this account would be incorporated into contemporary texts such as the Book of Enoch. This Satan was then featured in parts of the New Testament, where he was presented as a figure who tempts humans to commit sin; in the Book of Matthew and the Book of Luke, he attempted to tempt Jesus of Nazareth as the latter fasted in the wilderness.

While the early Christian idea of the Devil was not well developed, it gradually adapted and expanded through the creation of folklore, art, theological treatises, and morality tales, thus providing the character with a range of extra-Biblical associations. Beginning in the early middle ages, the concept developed in Christianity of the devil as &quot;archrepresentative of evil&quot;, and of the Satanist &quot;as malign mirror image of the good Christian&quot;.

The word &quot;Satanism&quot; was adopted into English from the French &quot;satanisme&quot;. The terms &quot;Satanism&quot; and &quot;Satanist&quot; are first recorded as appearing in the English and French languages during the 16th century, when they were used by Christian groups to attack other, rival Christian groups. In a Roman Catholic tract of 1565, the author condemns the &quot;heresies, blasphemies, and sathanismes [sic]&quot; of the Protestants. In an Anglican work of 1559, Anabaptists and other Protestant sects are condemned as &quot;swarmes of Satanistes [sic]&quot;. As used in this manner, the term &quot;Satanism&quot; was not used to claim that people literally worshipped Satan, but instead that they deviated from true Christianity, and thus were serving the will of Satan. During the 19th century, the term &quot;Satanism&quot; began to be used to describe those considered to lead a broadly immoral lifestyle, and it was only in the late 19th century that it came to be applied in English to individuals who were believed to consciously and deliberately venerate Satan. This latter meaning had appeared earlier in the Swedish language; the Lutheran Bishop Laurentius Paulinus Gothus had described devil-worshipping sorcerers as &quot;Sathanister&quot; in his &quot;Ethica Christiana&quot;, produced between 1615 and 1630.

=== Definitions ===
Some definitions of Satanism offered/suggested by scholars include:
* the worship or veneration of the figure from Christian belief known as Satan, the Devil or Lucifer (Ethan Doyle White);
* the &quot;intentional, religiously motivated veneration of Satan&quot; (Religion scholar Ruben van Luijk);
* &quot;a system in which Satan is celebrated in a prominent position&quot; (Satanism scholar Per Faxneld). (This definition has the advantage of avoiding &quot;assumptions about the nature of religion&quot;).
*the simultaneous presence of three characteristics:
::1) the worship of the character in the Bible whose name is Satan or Lucifer, 
::2) the organization of these &quot;Satanists&quot; into a group with at least some kind of organization and hierarchy, and ... 
::3) and has some kind of ritual or liturgical practices [...] 
:whether the group with these characteristics perceives Satan as personal or impersonal, real or symbolic, does not matter. (Italian sociologist Massimo Introvigne writing in 1994).

But these definitions of Satanism are limited to 
* figures and groups who &quot;identify&quot; as Satanists or at least admirers of Satan (Romantic Satanists, hellfire clubs and modern Satanists). 
... excluding 
* figures and groups &quot;accused&quot; of worshipping Satan and in the process committing horrible crimes (in the middle ages, during the 1980–1994 Satanic ritual abuse moral panic, etc.) but who either appear to have not been satanists or to not have actually existed.
And by excluding the second group, you leave out most of the history of Satanism, (Joseph P. Laycock argues).

If you &quot;do&quot; include both groups, you have two sides with very different views on who or what Satan was/is and represented. The accusers usually follow the Christian idea of Satan as an irredeemably evil fallen angel who seeks the destruction of both God and humanity, but who (along with his followers) is doomed to fail and to suffer eternal punishment. While the self-identified Satanists often do not believe that Satan actually exists as a being (they believe he is a symbol and a &quot;Promethean figure&quot;, &quot;an esoteric symbol of a vital force that permeates the universe&quot;), let alone is trying to destroy humanity.

A definitions/descriptions that would include the &quot;satanism&quot; of heresy crusades and moral panics is:
* an invention of Christianity, relying on a character deriving from Christian mythology, i.e. Satan, (another description of Satanism by Ruben van Luijk).

In their study of Satanism, the religious studies scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aa. Petersen stated that the term &quot;Satanism&quot; &quot;has a history of being a designation made by people against those whom they dislike; it is a term used for &#x27;othering&#x27;&quot;. 
Eugene Gallagher noted that Satanism was usually &quot;a polemical, not a descriptive term&quot;.

Similar to the way certain Christian denominations accuse each other of heresy, different satanic groups—mainly the Church of Satan (CoS), the Temple of Set (ToS), the Order of Nine Angles (ONA), and The Satanic Temple (TST)—often accuse one another of being fraudulent Satanists and/or ignorant of true Satanism.

===Related terms===
Because the original concept of Satan came from Judaism and was embraced by Christianity, and because Satanists, almost by definition, oppose the teachings of those religions, people drawn to Satanism will often move on to &quot;post-Satanism&quot;, i.e. to a religion that does not declare itself &quot;Satanic&quot;, but includes elements of Satanism (e.g. Temple of Set). Others may regards themselves as Satanists but promote mythological figures and traditions outside of Christianity or Judaism. These religions are sometimes called Satanic and sometimes post-Satanic.

Diane E. Taub and Lawrence D. Nelson complain that Satanism &quot;is frequently defined either too broadly or too narrowly&quot;, with accusers sometimes including non-satanic groups such as Santeria, Witchcraft, Eastern religions as well as Freemasonry; and academics (for example Carlson and Larue) and others sometimes restricting its definition to &quot;recognized Satanic churches and their members&quot;, excluding those who &quot;believes in a literal Satan&quot;. Taub and Nelson define Satanism as &quot;the literal or symbolic worship of Satan, the enemy of the Judeo-Christian God&quot;.

==Accusations of Satanism==

According to author Arthur Lyons, &quot;Satanic religions are as old as monotheism and have their origins in Persia of the sixth century&quot;,
and Joe Carter of the conservative ecumenical journal &quot;First Things&quot; writes that &quot;real satanism has been around since the beginning of history, selling an appealing message: Your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God.&quot;

On the other hand, religious scholar Joseph Laycock writes that the &quot;available evidence suggests&quot; that Satanism began as &quot;an imaginary religion Christians invented to demonize their opponents&quot;.
Confessions of worship of Satan came only after torture or other forms of coercion in early modern Europe. While early stories of satanic activity have been commonly labeled and regarded as propaganda based on falsehood, they also partially shaped the beliefs of what would become modern religious Satanism. Those who absorbed and accepted the tales sometimes began to imitate them (celebrating Black Masses for example), a process known to folklorists as &quot;ostension&quot;.

===Medieval and Early Modern Christendom===

As Christianity expanded throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, it came into contact with a variety of other religions, which it regarded as &quot;pagan&quot;. Christianity being a monotheist religion, Christian theologians believed that since there was only one God (the God of Christianity) the gods and goddesses with supernatural powers venerated by these &quot;pagans&quot; could not be genuine divinities but must actually be demons. However, they did not believe that &quot;pagans&quot; were deliberately worshipping devils, but were instead simply misguided and unaware of the &quot;true&quot; God.
Those Christian groups regarded as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church were treated differently, with theologians arguing that they were deliberately worshipping the Devil. This was accompanied by claims that such individuals engaged in acts of evil—incestuous sexual orgies, the murder of infants, and cannibalism—all stock accusations that had previously been leveled at Christians themselves in the Roman Empire. In Christian iconography, the Devil and demons were given the physical traits of figures from classical mythology, such as the god Pan, fauns, and satyrs.

The first recorded example of such an accusation being made within Western Christianity took place in Toulouse in 1022, when two clerics were tried for allegedly venerating a demon. Throughout the Middle Ages, this accusation would be applied to a wide range of Christian heretical groups, including the Paulicians, Bogomils, Cathars, Waldensians, and the Hussites. The Knights Templar were accused of worshipping an idol known as Baphomet, with Lucifer having appeared at their meetings in the form of a cat. As well as these Christian groups, these claims were also made about Europe&#x27;s Jewish community. In the 13th century, there were also references made to a group of &quot;Luciferians&quot; led by a woman named Lucardis which hoped to see Satan rule in Heaven. References to this group continued into the 14th century, although historians studying the allegations concur that these Luciferians were probably a fictitious invention.

Within Christian thought, the idea developed that certain individuals could make a pact with Satan. This may have emerged after observing that pacts with gods and goddesses played a role in various pre-Christian belief systems, or that such pacts were also made as part of the Christian cult of saints. Another possibility is that it derives from a misunderstanding of Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s condemnation of augury in his &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;, written in the late 4th century. Here, he stated that people who consulted augurs were entering &quot;quasi pacts&quot; (covenants) with demons. The idea of the diabolical pact made with demons was popularized across Europe in the story of Faust, probably based in part on the real life Johann Georg Faust.

As the late medieval gave way to the early modern period, European Christendom experienced a schism between the established Roman Catholic Church and the breakaway Protestant movement. In the ensuing Reformation and Counter-Reformation (1517–1700 CE), both Catholics and Protestants accused each other of deliberately being in league with Satan. It was in this context that the terms &quot;Satanist&quot; and &quot;Satanism&quot; emerged.

====Witch trials====
The early modern period also saw fear of Satanists reach its &quot;historical apogee&quot; in the form of the witch trials of the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, when between 30,000 and 50,000 alleged witches were executed. This came about as the accusations which had been leveled at medieval heretics, among them that of devil-worship, were applied to the pre-existing idea of the witch, or practitioner of malevolent magic. The idea of a conspiracy of Satanic witches was developed by educated elites, although the concept of malevolent witchcraft was a widespread part of popular belief, and folkloric ideas about the night witch, the wild hunt, and the dance of the fairies were incorporated into it. The earliest trials took place in Northern Italy and France, before spreading it out to other areas of Europe and to Britain&#x27;s North American colonies, being carried out by the legal authorities in both Catholic and Protestant regions.

Most historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship. Historian Darren Eldridge writes that claims that there actually was a cult of devil-worshippers being pursued by witch hunters &quot;have not survived the scrutiny of surviving trial records&quot; done by historians from 1962 to 2012.
However, in their summary of the evidence for the trials, the historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow thought it &quot;without doubt&quot; that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.

====Affair of the Poisons====

In a scandal starting with the poisoning of three people, prominent members of the French aristocracy, including members of the king&#x27;s inner circle, were implicated and sentenced on charges of poisoning and witchcraft. Between 1677 and 1682, during the reign of King Louis XIV, 36 people were executed in Satanic panic known to history as the Affair of the Poisons. At least some of the accusers were implicated others under torture and in hopes of saving their lives. These highly unreliable reports include what &quot;may be the first report of a satanic mass using a woman as an altar&quot;.

===18th- to 20th-century Christendom===

The Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution changed humanity&#x27;s understanding of the world. The mathematics of Isaac Newton and psychology of John Locke &quot;left little space for the intervention of supernatural beings&quot;. Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution undermined the doctrine of the Fall in the Garden of Eden and the role of the diabolical serpent, while also providing an &quot;alternative account of human evil&quot; in the form of &quot;a residual effect of our animal nature&quot;. The Industrial Revolution and urbanization disturbed traditional social relations and folk ideas to undermine belief in witchcraft and the devil. Understanding of disorders of the mind undercut demonic possession. But while the hunting and killing of alleged witches waned, belief in Satan did not disappear.

During the 18th century, gentleman&#x27;s social clubs became increasingly prominent in Britain and Ireland, among the most secretive of which were the Hellfire Clubs, which were first reported in the 1720s. The most famous of these groups was the Order of the Knights of Saint Francis, which was founded circa 1750 by the aristocrat Sir Francis Dashwood and which assembled first at his estate at West Wycombe and later in Medmenham Abbey. A number of contemporary press sources portrayed these as gatherings of atheist rakes where Christianity was mocked, and toasts were made to the Devil. Beyond these sensationalist accounts, which may not be accurate portrayals of actual events, little is known about the activities of the Hellfire Clubs. Introvigne suggested that they may have engaged in a form of &quot;playful Satanism&quot; in which Satan was invoked &quot;to show a daring contempt for conventional morality&quot; rather than to pay homage to him.

The French Revolution of 1789 dealt a blow to the hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church in parts of Europe, and soon a number of Catholic authors began making claims that it had been masterminded by a conspiratorial group of Satanists. Among the first to do so was French Catholic priest Jean-Baptiste Fiard, who publicly claimed that a wide range of individuals, from the Jacobins to tarot card readers, were part of a Satanic conspiracy. Fiard&#x27;s ideas were furthered by Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier de Terre-Neuve du Thym (1765–1851), who devoted a lengthy book to this conspiracy theory; he claimed that Satanists had supernatural powers allowing them to curse people and to shapeshift into both cats and fleas. Although most of his contemporaries regarded Berbiguier as suffering from mental illness, his ideas gained credence among many occultists, including Stanislas de Guaita, a Cabalist who used them for the basis of his book, &quot;The Temple of Satan&quot;.

A reaction to this was the Taxil hoax in 1890s France, where an anti-clerical writer Léo Taxil (aka Marie Joseph Gabriel Antoine Jogand-Pagès), publicly converted to Catholicism and then published several works alleging to expose the Satanic doings of Freemasons. In 1897, Taxil called a press conference promising to introduce a key character of his stories but instead announced that his revelations about the Freemasons were made up, and thanked the Catholic clergy for helping to publicize his stories. Nine years later he told an American magazine that at first he thought readers would recognize his tales as obvious nonsense, &quot;amusement pure and simple&quot;, but when he realized they believed his stories and that there was &quot;lots of money&quot; to be made in publishing them, he continued to perpetrate the hoax. Around the same time, another convert to Catholicism Joris-Karl Huysmans, also helped promote the concept of active Satanist groups in his 1891 work &quot;Là-bas&quot; (Down There). Huysmans &quot;helped to cement&quot; the idea the black mass as Satanic rite and inversion of the Roman Catholic mass, with a naked woman for an altar. (Unlike Taxil, his conversion was apparently genuine and his book was published as fiction.)

In the early 20th century, the British novelist Dennis Wheatley produced a range of influential novels in which his protagonists battled Satanic groups. At the same time, non-fiction authors such as Montague Summers and Rollo Ahmed published books claiming that Satanic groups practicing black magic were still active across the world, although they provided no evidence that this was the case. During the 1950s, various British tabloid newspapers repeated such claims, largely basing their accounts on the allegations of one woman, Sarah Jackson, who claimed to have been a member of such a group. In 1973, the British Christian Doreen Irvine published &quot;From Witchcraft to Christ&quot;, in which she claimed to have been a member of a Satanic group that gave her supernatural powers, such as the ability to levitate, before she escaped and embraced Christianity.

In the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, various Christian preachers—the most famous being Mike Warnke in his 1972 book &quot;The Satan-Seller&quot;—claimed that they had been members of Satanic groups who carried out sex rituals and animal sacrifices before discovering Christianity. According to Gareth Medway in his historical examination of Satanism, these stories were &quot;a series of inventions by insecure people and hack writers, each one based on a previous story, exaggerated a little more each time&quot;.

Other publications made allegations of Satanism against historical figures. The 1970s saw the publication of the Romanian Protestant preacher Richard Wurmbrand&#x27;s book in which he argued—without corroborating evidence—that the socio-political theorist Karl Marx had been a Satanist.

===Ritual abuse hysteria===

At the end of the 20th century, a moral panic arose from claims that a Devil-worshipping cult was committing sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism in its rituals, and including children among the victims of its rites. Initially, the alleged perpetrators of such crimes were labeled &quot;witches&quot;, although the term &quot;Satanist&quot; was soon adopted as a favored alternative, and the phenomenon itself came to be called &quot;the Satanism Scare&quot;. Those active in the scare alleged that there was a conspiracy of organized Satanists who occupied prominent positions throughout society, from the police to politicians, and that they had been powerful enough to cover up their crimes.

One of the primary sources for the scare was &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot;, a 1980 book by the Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder in which he detailed what he claimed were the repressed memories of his patient (and wife) Michelle Smith. Smith had claimed that as a child she had been abused by her family in Satanic rituals in which babies were sacrificed and Satan himself appeared. In 1983, allegations were made that the McMartin family—owners of a preschool in California—were guilty of sexually abusing the children in their care during Satanic rituals. The allegations resulted in a lengthy and expensive trial, in which all of the accused would eventually be cleared. The publicity generated by the case resulted in similar allegations being made in various other parts of the United States.

A key claim by the &quot;anti-Satanists&quot; of the Satanic Scare was that any child&#x27;s claim about Satanic ritual abuse must be true, because children do not lie. Although some involved in the anti-Satanism movement were from Jewish and secular backgrounds, a central part was played by fundamentalist and evangelical Christians, in particular Pentecostalist Christians, with Christian groups holding conferences and producing books and videotapes to promote belief in the conspiracy. Various figures in law enforcement also came to be promoters of the conspiracy theory, with such &quot;cult cops&quot; holding various conferences to promote it. The scare was later imported to the United Kingdom through visiting evangelicals and became popular among some of the country&#x27;s social workers, resulting in a range of accusations and trials across Britain.

In the late 1980s, the Satanic Scare had lost its impetus following increasing skepticism about such allegations, and a number of those who had been convicted of perpetrating Satanic ritual abuse saw their convictions overturned. In 1990, an agent of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Ken Lanning, revealed that he had investigated 300 allegations of Satanic ritual abuse and found no evidence for Satanism or ritualistic activity in any of them. In the UK, the Department of Health commissioned the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine to examine the allegations of SRA. She noted that while approximately half did reveal evidence of genuine sexual abuse of children, none revealed any evidence that Satanist groups had been involved or that any murders had taken place. She noted three examples in which lone individuals engaged in child molestation had created a ritual performance to facilitate their sexual acts, with the intent of frightening their victims and justifying their actions, but that none of these child molesters were involved in wider Satanist groups.

By 1994, the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria had died down in the US and UK, and by the 21st century, hysteria about Satanism has waned in most Western countries, although allegations of Satanic ritual abuse continued to surface in parts of continental Europe and Latin America. In the United States SRA ideas persisted among much of the public even as law enforcement had grown tired of false leads. A 1994 survey for the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Redbook&quot; reported in 1994, 
*70 percent of those polled &quot;believe that at least some people who claim that they were abused by satanic cults as children, but repressed the memories for years, are telling the truth&quot;
*32 percent agreed with the statement, &quot;The FBI and the police ignore evidence because they don&#x27;t want to admit the cults exist&quot;, and
*22 percent agreed that cult leaders use brainwashing to ensure that the victims would not tell.

===QAnon===

Another Satanic conspiracy theory arose in the United States by 2017, with unsubstantiated allegations of organized Devil-worshippers in prominent positions committing sexual abuse, murder, and cannibalism. The source of such claims began within a far-right political movement, made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as &quot;Q&quot;, which were relayed and developed by online communities and influencers. The central QAnon claim purports that a global child sex trafficking ring made up of Democratic politicians, Hollywood actors, high-ranking government officials, business tycoons, and medical experts, were kidnapping, sexually abusing and eating children, but that (then-President) Donald Trump would round up the cabal and bring them to justice in a climactic event known to supporters as &quot;the storm&quot;. With the lack of any evidence of child abuse or harm, and failure of the prophesized &quot;storm&quot; to appear before the inauguration of a new president, the conspiracy has waned but not entirely disappeared.

==Precursors of modern Satanism==

=== Literary ===

From the late 1600s through to the 1800s, the character of Satan was increasingly rendered unimportant in western philosophy, and ignored in Christian theology, while in folklore he came to be seen as a foolish rather than a menacing figure. The development of new values in the Age of Enlightenment (in particular, those of reason and individualism) contributed to a shift in many Europeans&#x27; concept of Satan. In this context, a number of individuals took Satan out of the traditional Christian narrative and reread and reinterpreted him in light of their own time and their own interests, in turn generating new and different portraits of Satan.

The shifting concept of Satan owes many of its origins to John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1667), in which Satan features as the protagonist. Milton was a Puritan and had never intended for his depiction of Satan to be a sympathetic one. However, in portraying Satan as a victim of his own pride who rebelled against the Judeo-Christian god, Milton humanized him and also allowed him to be interpreted as a rebel against tyranny. In this vein, the 19th century saw the emergence of what has been termed &quot;literary Satanism&quot; or &quot;romantic Satanism&quot;, where in poetry, plays, and novels, God is portrayed not as benevolent but using His omnipotent power for tyranny. Whereas in Christian doctrine Satan was an enemy of not only god but humanity, in the romantic portrayal he was a brave, noble, rebel against tyranny, a friend to other victims of the all powerful bully, i.e. humans. These writers saw Satan as a metaphor to criticize the power of churches and state and to champion the values of reason and liberty.

This was how Milton&#x27;s Satan was understood by John Dryden and later readers such as the publisher Joseph Johnson, and the anarchist philosopher William Godwin, who reflected it in his 1793 book &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;. &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; gained a wide readership in the 18th century, both in Britain and in continental Europe, where it had been translated into French by Voltaire. Milton thus became &quot;a central character in rewriting Satanism&quot; and would be viewed by many later religious Satanists as a &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; Satanist&quot;.

According to Ruben van Luijk, this cannot be seen as a &quot;coherent movement with a single voice, but rather as a &quot;post factum&quot; identified group of sometimes widely divergent authors among whom a similar theme is found&quot;. For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as a benevolent and sometimes heroic figure, with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many romanticist and decadent figures. For these individuals, Satanism was not a religious belief or ritual activity, but rather a &quot;strategic use of a symbol and a character as part of artistic and political expression&quot;.
Among the romanticist poets to adopt this concept of Satan was the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had been influenced by Milton. In his poem &quot;Laon and Cythna&quot;, Shelley praised the &quot;serpent&quot;, a reference to Satan, as a force for good in the universe.
Another was Shelley&#x27;s fellow British poet Lord Byron, who included Satanic themes in his 1821 play &quot;Cain&quot;, which was a dramatization of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work &quot;Eloa&quot; by Alfred de Vigny. Satan was also adopted by the French poet Victor Hugo, who made the character&#x27;s fall from Heaven a central aspect of his &quot;La Fin de Satan&quot;, in which he outlined his own cosmogony.
Although the likes of Shelley and Byron promoted a positive image of Satan in their work, there is no evidence that any of them performed religious rites to venerate him, and thus they cannot be considered to be religious Satanists.

Radical left-wing political ideas had been spread by the American Revolution of 1775–83 and the French Revolution of 1789–99. The figure of Satan, who was seen as having rebelled against the tyranny imposed by Jehovah, was appealing to many of the radical leftists of the period. For them, Satan was &quot;a symbol for the struggle against tyranny, injustice, and oppression... a mythical figure of rebellion for an age of revolutions, a larger-than-life individual for an age of individualism, a free thinker in an age struggling for free thought&quot;. The French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who was a staunch critic of Christianity, embraced Satan as a symbol of liberty in several of his writings. Another prominent 19th century anarchist, the Russian Mikhail Bakunin, similarly described the figure of Satan as &quot;the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds&quot; in his book &quot;God and the State&quot;. These ideas probably inspired the American feminist activist Moses Harman to name his anarchist periodical &quot;Lucifer the Lightbearer&quot;. The idea of this &quot;Leftist Satan&quot; declined during the 20th century.

=== Occult ===
In 17th-century Sweden, a number of highway robbers and other outlaws living in the forests informed judges that they venerated Satan because he provided more practical assistance than Jehovah, practices now regarded as &quot;folkloric Satanism&quot;.

The figure of &quot;Lucifer&quot; was taken up by the French ceremonial magician Éliphas Lévi (1810–1875), who shocked convention by turning the traditional figure of evil into a brave rebel against tyranny. Lévi has been described as a &quot;Romantic Satanist&quot;, a Romantic literary movement that formed no organizations and did not worship Satan, but did make a crucial break away from the traditional Christian figure of the &quot;Lord of Darkness&quot; doomed to failure and punishment for his wickedness. They reimagined Satan as an enemy of God the powerful, but not of the weak and mortal human race. In other words, a figure humans could sympathize with.
As Lévi moved toward political conservatism in later life, he retained the use of the term, but instead applied it to what he believed was a morally neutral facet of &quot;the absolute&quot;.

Lévi was not the only occultist who used the term &quot;Lucifer&quot; without adopting the term &quot;Satan&quot; in a similar way. The early Theosophical Society believed that &quot;Lucifer&quot; was a force that aided humanity&#x27;s awakening to its own spiritual nature; the Society began publishing the journal &quot;Lucifer&quot; in 1887.

The first person to promote an explicitly &quot;Satanic&quot; philosophy was the Polish writer Stanisław Przybyszewski (1868–1927), a &quot;decadent Bohemian&quot; who based his ideology on Social Darwinism of the 1890s, publishing &quot;The Synagogue of Satan&quot; in 1897.

Danish occultist Carl William Hansen (1872–1936), who used the pen name Ben Kadosh, listed &quot;Luciferian&quot; as his religious affiliation in answer to the Danish national census (his wife and children were listed as Lutheran), making him among the earliest &quot;self-declared Satanists&quot;. 
Hansen sought to spread a cult of Satan/Lucifer, and was involved in a variety of esoteric groups, including Martinism, Freemasonry, and Ordo Templi Orientis, drawing on their ideas to establish his own philosophy. He provided a Luciferian interpretation of Freemasonry in a 1906 pamphlet, although his work had little influence outside of Denmark.

Throughout his life British occultist Aleister Crowley (1875–1947) was widely described as a Satanist, usually by detractors. Crowley did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship Satan, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless used imagery considered satanic, for instance, describing himself as &quot;the Beast 666&quot; and referring to the Whore of Babylon in his work, sending &quot;Antichristmas cards&quot; to his friends later in life. Crowley &quot;in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy&quot;, with his &quot;image and thought&quot; becoming an &quot;important influence&quot; on the later development of religious Satanism. Both Crowley and LaVey &quot;cultivated a sinister public image and sported shaved heads&quot;.

In 1928, the Fraternitas Saturni (FS) was established in Germany; its founder, Eugen Grosche, published &quot;Satanische Magie&quot; (&quot;Satanic Magic&quot;) that same year. The group connected Satan to Saturn, claiming that the planet related to the Sun in the same manner that Lucifer relates to the human world.

Maria de Naglowska, a Russian occultist who had fled to France following the Russian Revolution, established the esoteric group Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow in Paris in 1932. She promoted a theology centered on what she called the Third Term of the Trinity consisting of Father, Son, and Sex, the last of which she deemed to be most important. Her early disciples, who underwent what she called &quot;Satanic Initiations&quot;, included models and art students recruited from bohemian circles. The Golden Arrow disbanded after Naglowska abandoned it in 1936. Hers was &quot;a quite complicated Satanism, built on a complex philosophical vision of the world, of which little would survive its initiator&quot;.

Herbert Sloane claims Our Lady of Endor Coven, a Satanic group based in Toledo, Ohio, was founded in 1948. Describing his Satanic tradition as the Ophite Cultus Sathanas, the group first came to public attention in 1969. The group had a Gnostic doctrine about the world, in which the Judeo-Christian creator god is regarded as evil, and the Biblical serpent is presented as a force for good, who had delivered salvation to humanity in the Garden of Eden. Sloane&#x27;s claim of a 1940s origin remain unproven: potentially fabricated to make his group appear older than the (1966) establishment of the Church of Satan.

==Contemporary tendencies and groups==
&quot;The intentional, religiously motivated veneration of Satan&quot; (the &quot;working definition&quot; of Satanism of historian of religion Ruben van Luijk), comes in different forms. Satanism has been called a &quot;new religious movement&quot;, and other times judged too diffuse to merit that description and been called instead a &quot;milieu&quot; (Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen), united by &quot;family resemblance&quot;, and the fact that most of them were self religions. Some of the resemblances in this Satanic milieu are: 
* the positive use of the term &quot;Satanist&quot; as a designation, 
* an emphasis on individualism, 
* a genealogy that connects them to other Satanic groups, 
* a transgressive and antinomian stance, 
* a self-perception as an elite, and 
* an embrace of values such as pride, self-reliance, and productive non-conformity. 
A minority of Satanists have some type of association with the political far-right.

Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen argue that the groups within the Satanic milieu can be divided into three groups: reactive Satanists, rationalist Satanists, and esoteric Satanists. 
*Reactive Satanism (they believe) encompass &quot;popular Satanism, inverted Christianity, and symbolic rebellion&quot; and situates itself in opposition to society while at the same time conforming to society&#x27;s perspective of evil. 
*Rationalist Satanism is used to describe the trend in the Satanic milieu which is atheistic, skeptical, materialistic, and epicurean. According to Joseph Laycock, &quot;most contemporary Satanists&quot; are nontheistic. 
*Esoteric Satanism applied to those forms which are theistic and draw upon ideas from other forms of Western esotericism, Modern Paganism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.

Diane E. Taub and Lawrence D. Nelson (publishing in 1993, at the end of the &quot;Satanic panic&quot;) divide Satanism into two: 
* &quot;Establishment&quot; Satanism, or the &quot;respectable&quot; form of Satanism that is &quot;usually highly visible and structured&quot;, and emphasizes its law-abiding nature. (This may include both Rationalist Satanism and Esoteric Satanism.) An example of &quot;Establishment Satanism&quot; is the Church of Satan, which &quot;officially condemns illegal activity&quot;. (Other Establishment Satanists are the Church of Satanic Brotherhood or the Temple of Set.) It is the variety of Satanism most studied by academic sociologists, who also represent Satanism in their &quot;discourse&quot; as &quot;harmless, law-abiding alternative religions&quot;, ignoring the second type of Satanism ...
* &quot;Underground&quot; Satanism, the Satanism of &quot;reputed criminal elements&quot;, and the variety that lay groups and the media tend to focus on (especially during the Satanic Panic of the 1980s). (Satanic Underground may be similar to Reactive Satanism.) Information on the underground is often less than reliable, as reports are sensational and the Satanists themselves are secretive. Establishment and Underground Satanism conflict, the first wanting to preserve its social acceptance and tax-exempt status that the sensational crimes or alleged crimes of the underground put in jeopardy. How much cause and effect there is a between Underground Satanism and crime comes into question because according to at least one report, &quot;nearly worshipping criminal has had a history of anti-social behavior ... long before taking up occult trappings.&quot;) On the other hand, evidence of personality disorders does not mean the disorder sufferer does not have sincere Satanic beliefs.

Contemporary religious Satanism is predominantly an American phenomenon but has spread elsewhere via globalization and the Internet, allowing for intra-group communication and creation of a forum for Satanist disputes. Satanism started to reach Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s—in time with the fall of the Communist Bloc—and most noticeably in Poland and Lithuania, predominantly Roman Catholic countries.

===Atheistic Satanism===

====Church of Satan and Anton LaVey====
Satanism as &quot;a self-declared religion&quot; is said (by most scholars of Satanism), to have &quot;truly&quot; begun in 1966 with the founding of the Church of Satan (CoS) by Anton Szandor LaVey. Religious scholars have called the Church not only the oldest, continuous satanic organization (Joseph Laycock), (James R. Lewis), (Asprem, Granholm), (Faxneld and Petersen), but the most influential, with &quot;numerous imitator and breakaway groups&quot; (Laycock), (R. Van Luijk).

Founded in San Francisco, California, in an era when there was much public interest in the occult, witchcraft, and Satanism, the church enjoyed a heyday for several years after its founding, when a &quot;gigantic media circus&quot; developed around &quot;the Father of Satanism&quot; and his Satanic aesthetics—LaVey shaved his head and wore a goatee, performing Black Masses with nude women serving as altars, was invited on national talk shows, and mingled with celebrities attending his satanic parties. As an entrepreneur, he saw an opening for a new religion in the spiritual void of a secularizing post-Christian West.

But LaVey also promoted his ideas, and his 1969 &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; (&quot;the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology&quot; sold nearly a million copies. These had &quot;very little&quot; connection with &quot;either Satan or the worship of Satan&quot;, but were based on the Romantic literary concept of Satan, not as a symbol of evil, but as a rebel anti-hero, defying God’s tyranny with charisma and bravery. Together with the romanticism, &quot;humanism, hedonism, aspects of pop psychology and the human potential movement&quot; were woven together by LaVey, and publicized with &quot;a lot of showmanship&quot;. Philosopher Ayn Rand, who argued that &quot;selfishness&quot; is a virtue (&quot;unfettered self-interest is good and altruism is destructive&quot;), was a major influence. According to both LaVey and sociologist of religion James R. Lewis, Ayn Rand&#x27;s thought was a cornerstone of his philosophy (along with &quot;ceremony and ritual&quot; or &quot;ritual magic&quot;).

Other influences were Friedrich Nietzsche (who celebrated the Ubermensch, proclaimed &quot;God is dead&quot;, and preached against the &#x27;slave&#x27;s morality&#x27; of mercy, charity, and helping the weak); English occultist Aleister Crowley (famous for the axiom &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the [moral] Law&quot;); and Arthur Desmond (strongly associated with Social Darwinism and the expression &quot;the survival of the fittest&quot;).

LaVey used Christianity as a &quot;negative mirror&quot; for his new faith, rejecting the basic principles, theology and values of Christian belief, along with other major religions and philosophies such as humanitarianism and liberal democracy—which he saw as negative forces. Instead of idealism, humility, abstinence, (self-denigration), obedience, (herd behavior), spirituality, and irrationality; he praised the seven deadly sins (pride, greed, wrath, envy, lust, gluttony and sloth), as virtues not vices. LaVey went beyond discouraging sexual inhibitions and feelings of guilt and shame over fetishes, calling for a celebration of, and indulgence in, humanity&#x27;s animal nature and its desires, which Christianity sought to suppress. Human beings should seek out the carnal rather than the spiritual; satisfying the ego&#x27;s desires enhanced an individual&#x27;s pride, self-respect, and self-realization. Hate, and aggression were necessary and advantageous for survival, victims should not &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; but take an &quot;eye for an eye&quot;.

Satanists should be individualistic, non-conformist, contemptuous of &quot;colorless&quot; mainstream society. LaVey saw Satanism as something like a personality type as much as a belief, since Satanists &quot;are outsiders by their nature&quot;, and &quot;born, not made&quot;. Since gods are actually a creation of man and not the other way around, LaVey asked, &quot;&#x27;Why not really be honest and if you are going to create a god in your image, why not create that god as yourself&#x27;... every man is a god if he chooses to recognize himself as one.&quot; Not everyone would measure up to being a god however. Human social equality was a &quot;myth&quot;, leading to &quot;mediocrity&quot; and support of the weak at the expense of the strong. &quot;Social stratification&quot; was part of LaVey and the Church&#x27;s &quot;Five Point Program&quot;.

A &quot;true Satanic society&quot; was described in Lavey&#x27;s church&#x27;s periodical &quot;The Black Flame&quot; and highlighted by anthropologist Jean La Fontaine; it would be one in which the population consists of &quot;free-spirited, well-armed, fully-conscious, self-disciplined individuals, who will neither need nor tolerate any external entity &#x27;protecting&#x27; them or telling them what they can and cannot do&quot;. Another version of the Satanic society envisioned by LaVey was the breeding of an elite people &quot;superior&quot; in their creativity and nonconformity. These would live apart from the rest of the human &quot;herd&quot;—who would be relegated into ghettoes, ideally &quot;space ghettoes&quot; located on other planets.

LaVey&#x27;s ideas were also said to &quot;seem &quot;contradictory&quot; (according to Joseph Laycock). According to one CoS priest (Gavin Baddeley), LaVey&#x27;s church combined &quot;a love of life garbed in the symbols of death and fear&quot;, and while LaVey himself pontificated on personal freedom, he &quot;micromanaged the lives of his followers&quot;. Some (Lucien Greaves) doubted his atheist naturalism. LaVey insisted the church scoffed at the supernatural, but also told an interviewer he considered &quot;curses and hexes&quot; against enemies a form of human sacrifice &quot;by proxy&quot;.

Contradictions in his thought have been explained by his wanting it to have as wide appeal as possible, balancing (in his words) &quot;nine parts&quot; of &quot;respectability&quot; to &quot;one part&quot; of &quot;outrageousness&quot;. If Satanism was to be Satanic, it required some outrageous/anti-social elements, but if it was going to be a viable organization, these could not be allowed to frighten off potential congregants and attract unwanted attention.

One &quot;outrageous&quot; issue that LaVey was criticized for was his &quot;ambivalent relationship&quot; with far-right groups (United Klans of America, National Renaissance Party, and the American Nazi Party) that he neither endorsed nor rejected.

LaVey died in 1997, but the church maintains a purist approach to his thought, insisting he and the church have &quot;codified&quot; Satanism as &quot;a religion and philosophy&quot;, and dismisses other Satanist groups (atheistic or otherwise), as reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers.

==== The Satanic Temple ====

The Satanic Temple (TST), has been called the &quot;most prominent&quot; satanic organization &quot;in terms of both size and public activity&quot; (as of late 2023). Based in Salem, Massachusetts and active since 2012, it claims 700,000 members worldwide. Like the older Church of Satan, its congregants do not believe in a supernatural Satan, but if the CoS saw Satanism as a &quot;negative mirror&quot; of Christianity, reversing Christian principles of altruism (helping the downtrodden and community-mindedness), the Christian principles TST wants to reverse are politically conservative activist ones—the elimination of the right to abortion, the teaching of evolution, the separation of church and state, etc. This &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;socially engaged Satanism&quot;, involves activism, rather than the individualism and right-wing-oriented, &quot;getting what you want for yourself&quot;, of the CoS.

They have been called &quot;rationalist, political pranksters&quot; (by Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen), with pranks designed to highlight religious hypocrisy and advance the cause of secularism. One such prank was performing a &quot;Pink Mass&quot; over the grave of the mother of the evangelical Christian and prominent anti-LGBT preacher Fred Phelps and claiming that the mass converted the spirit of Phelps&#x27; mother into a lesbian. The &quot;Seven Fundamental&quot; tenets of the temple on its website mention compassion, justice, freedom, inviolability of the human body, conforming to scientific understanding, human fallibility—but say nothing about Satan. The Temple has been described as using the literary Satan as metaphor to promote pragmatic skepticism, rational reciprocity, personal autonomy, and curiosity; and as a symbol to represent &quot;the eternal rebel&quot; against arbitrary authority and social norms.

The temple has also demanded the privileges the government affords Christians, such as giving prayers before city council meetings, erecting (satanic) statues on government property, distributing it is materials in public schools. As the movement became bigger, its congregations volunteered to clean highways and help the homeless, at least in part to demonstrate they were civic minded and not evil. It has made efforts at lobbying, with a focus on the separation of church and state and using satire against Christian groups that it believes interfere with personal freedom.

Lucien Greaves has described the Temple as being a progressive and updated version of LaVey&#x27;s Satanism, posted a fairly detailed refutation of LaVey&#x27;s doctrines, accusing the Church of fetishizing authoritarianism, and explaining how elements of Social Darwinism and Nietzscheanism within LaVeyan Satanism are incongruent with game theory, reciprocal altruism, and cognitive science. The Church of Satan, on the other hand, has declared the TST members as only &quot;masquerading&quot; as Satanists, being in violation of the &quot;five decades of a clearly defined belief system called Satanism expounded by a worldwide organization&quot; (i.e. LaVeyan Satanism).

==== First Satanic Church ====

After LaVey&#x27;s death in 1997, the Church of Satan was taken over by a new administration and its headquarters were moved to New York City. LaVey&#x27;s daughter, the High Priestess Karla LaVey re-founded The First Satanic Church on 1999 in San Francisco. This church has been called &quot;a lot more exclusive&quot; than the original and as of late 2023 was known for producing a &quot;Black X-Mass concert&quot; in San Francisco &quot;every year for the last couple decades&quot;.

=== Theistic Satanism ===

Theistic Satanism (also known as traditional Satanism, spiritual Satanism or Devil worship) is a form of Satanism with the primary belief that Satan is an actual deity or force to revere or worship. Other characteristics of theistic Satanism may include a belief in magic, which is manipulated through ritual, although that is not a defining criterion, and theistic Satanists may focus solely on devotion.

==== Temple of Set ====
The Temple of Set (ToS) is an initiatory occult left-hand path religious organization. It was founded in 1975 when Michael Aquino, the founder of a Church of Satan Grotto in Louisville, Kentucky, and editor of the Church&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;The Cloven Hoof&quot;, left the church, taking 28 members with him. Aquino&#x27;s anger that LaVey had devalued his high level grade of &quot;magister&quot; in the church may have initiated his break, but Aquino also disagreed with LaVey&#x27;s materialist philosophy, arguing that while the church might publicly be materialist, Satan as symbol was &quot;only part of the truth&quot;. Aquino held a ritual to ask Satan &quot;where to lead&quot; his CoS defectors and, on the night of 21–22 June 1975, Satan allegedly told him to &quot;Reconsecrate my Temple and my Order in the true name of Set. No longer will I accept the bastard title of a Hebrew fiend.&quot; Thus Aquino came to believe that the name &quot;Satan&quot; was a corruption of the name &quot;Set&quot;, the Egyptian god of darkness. The philosophy of the Temple of Set may be summed up as &quot;enlightened individualism&quot;—enhancement and improvement of oneself by personal education, experiment, and initiation. This process is necessarily different and distinctive for each individual. The members do not agree on whether Set is real or symbolic, and they&#x27;re not expected to.

The Temple teaches that Set is a real entity, and the only real god in existence, with all other gods being created by the human imagination. Set is described as having given humanity—through the means of non-natural evolution—the &quot;Black Flame&quot; or the &quot;Gift of Set&quot;, which is a questioning intellect that sets humans apart from other animals. While Setians are expected to revere Set, they do not worship him. Central to Setian philosophy is the human individual, with self-deification presented as the ultimate goal.

Estimates of the Temple&#x27;s total are between 300 and 500 as of 2005 (Petersen); and approximately 200 as of 2007 (Granholm). Members must remain active. New members have one year to join a pylon (a Local chapter) and must reach the second degree of adept by showing proficiency in magic within two years, or have their memberships revoked.

Aquino died in September 2019 at the age of 72. High priests after Aquino were Don Webb starting in 1996, Zeena Schreck starting in 2002 (who lasted only six weeks when Aquino took over again), Patricia Hardy starting in 2004.

==== Joy of Satan ====
Joy of Satan is a western esoteric occult organization that combines Satanism, the ancient alien astronaut &quot;hypothesis&quot;, and antisemitism. It was founded in the early 2000s by Maxine Dietrich (pseudonym of Andrea Maxine Dietrich), wife of the American National Socialist Movement&#x27;s co-founder and former leader Clifford Herrington. With its inception, spiritual Satanism was born—a current that until recently was regarded only as &quot;theist&quot;, but then defined into &quot;Spiritual Satanism&quot; by theistic Satanists who concluded that the term &quot;spiritual&quot; in Satanism represented the best answer to the world, considering it a &quot;moral slap&quot; toward the earlier carnal and materialistic LaVeyan Satanism, and instead focusing its attention upon spiritual evolution. Joy of Satan presents a unique synthesis of theistic Satanism, Nazism, Gnosticism, Paganism, Western esotericism, UFO conspiracy theories, and extraterrestrial hypotheses similar to those popularized by Zecharia Sitchin and David Icke.

Members of Joy of Satan are generally polytheists, believing that Satan is one of many deities. While Satan and demons are considered deities within JoS, the deities themselves are understood to be highly evolved, un-aging, sentient, and powerful humanoid extraterrestrial beings. Satan and many demons are equated with gods from ancient cultures, some of which include the Sumerian god Enki, and the Yazidi angel Melek Taus being seen as Satan, borrowing their theistic Satanist interpretations of Enki from the writings of Zecharia Sitchin, and Melek Taus partially deriving from the writings of Anton LaVey. Satan is seen not only as an important deity but a powerful and sentient being responsible for the creation of humanity. Satan is also revered by JoS as &quot;the true father and creator God of humanity&quot;, the bringer of knowledge, and whose desire is for his creations, humans, to elevate themselves through knowledge and understanding.

In their beliefs, Yazidism (a pre-Islamic religion of about one million members found mainly in northern Iraq, that holds that Melek Taûs/&quot;Tawûsî Melek&quot;, &quot;the Peacock Angel&quot;, is the leader of the archangels and functions as the ruler of the world; but who Muslims believe is a fallen angel), is in juxtaposition with Satanism as they consider the two share similar elements, such as Yazidi devotees being defined by Muslims as &quot;devotees to Shaytan&quot; and regarded as Satanists. It is also believed that the figure of Melek Taus, the peacock angel, may derive from much older pagan deities, such as Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of wisdom who rides a peacock, or even the god Indra, who transforms into a peacock. The story of Melek Taus itself is also considered by JoS to have many satanic elements, such as being described as the angel who rebelled against the Abrahamic god. The sacred text of the Yazidis, the Al-Jilwah, is claimed by the JoS as the word of Satan.

While maintaining some popularity as a theistic Satanist sect, the group has been widely criticized for its association with the National Socialist Movement and its racial anti-Jewish, anti-Judaic, and anti-Christian sentiment, as well as its anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. Much of their beliefs on aliens, meditation, and telepathic contacts with demons have become popular in a larger milieu within the currents of recent non-LaVeyan theistic Satanism. According to Petersen&#x27;s survey (2014), Joy of Satan&#x27;s angelfire network has a surprising prominence among theistic Satanist websites on the internet. In addition, James R. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Satan census&quot; (2009) also revealed a presence of respondents to Joy of Satan.

==== The &quot;sinister tradition&quot; and the Order of Nine Angles ====

During the 1990s, the idea that groups like Church of Satan and Temple of Set were &quot;too benevolent and law-abiding&quot; to be true Satanists grew, particularly among musicians and fans in extreme heavy metal music, where being more extreme meant being more authentic. These antinomian and amoral Satanic (or post-Satanic) groups are sometimes called the &quot;sinister tradition&quot; of Satanism.
The Order of Nine Angles has been called &quot;the ur-type that defines the sinister tradition&quot; and is connected to multiple killings, rapes, and cases of child abuse and right-wing terrorism.
According to the group&#x27;s own claims, the Order of Nine Angles (O9A or ONA) was established in Shropshire, England, during the late 1960s, when a Grand Mistress united a number of ancient pagan groups active in the area. This account states that when the Order&#x27;s Grand Mistress migrated to Australia, a man known as &quot;Anton Long&quot; took over as the new Grand Master. From 1976 onward, he authored an array of texts for the tradition, codifying and extending its teachings, mythos, and structure. Various academics have argued that Long is the pseudonym of British National Socialist Movement activist David Myatt, (Myatt denies it but Religion scholar Jacob Senholt &quot;copies of ONA documents from 1978 with Myatt’s name on them&quot; have been found and &quot;early ONA texts were published&quot; by a press that &quot;Myatt owned&quot;). The O9A arose to public attention in the early 1980s, spreading its message through magazine articles over the following two decades. In 2000, it established a presence on the internet, later adopting social media to promote its message.

O9A consists largely of secretive, autonomous cells known as &quot;nexions&quot;, operating as a network of allied Satanic practitioners, which it terms the &quot;kollective&quot;. The majority of these are located in Britain, Ireland, and Germany, although others are located elsewhere in Europe, and in Russia, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and the United States. In recent decades up to 2023, O9A has caught the attention of &quot;white supremacist groups and troubled young men&quot; through its material online, and as of 2013 2,000 people &quot;may be associated with the ONA in one form or another&quot;, according to one estimate.

The O9A describe their occultism as &quot;Traditional Satanism&quot;. The O9A&#x27;s writings not only encourage human sacrifice, but insist it is required in Satanism, referring to their victims as &quot;opfers&quot;. According to the Order&#x27;s teachings, such opfers must demonstrate character faults that mark them out as being worthy of death. No O9A cell has admitted to carrying out a sacrifice in a ritualized manner, but rather, Order members have joined the police and military to carry out such killings. Faxneld described the Order as &quot;a dangerous and extreme form of Satanism&quot;, while religious studies scholar Graham Harvey wrote that the O9A fit the stereotype of the Satanist &quot;better than other groups&quot; by embracing &quot;deeply shocking&quot; and illegal acts. Several British politicians, including the Labour Party&#x27;s Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, have pushed for the group to be banned as a terror organization, and according to the BBC News, &quot;the authorities are concerned by the number of paedophiles associated with the ONA.&quot; Additionally, there are various followers of the O9A paradigm who are (or were) also members of banned militant national-socialist groups, namely the Atomwaffen Division, Combat 18, and Nordic Resistance Movement, the first of which even openly aims to perpetrate terror attacks.

==== Luciferianism ====
Luciferians reportedly revere Lucifer not as the devil, but as a destroyer, guardian, liberator, light bringer, and/or guiding spirit to darkness, or even as the true god, as opposed to Jehovah. The Greater Church of Lucifer of Houston lost its place of worship in 2017 after vandalism and death threats to its landlord caused him to refuse to renew the church&#x27;s lease.

== Personal Satanism ==

In contrast to the organized and doctrinal Satanist groups is the personal Satanism of individuals, who identify as Satanists due to their affinity for the general idea of Satan, including such characteristics as viciousness and/or subversion.

Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen used the term &quot;reactive Satanism&quot; to describe one form of modern Satanism. They described this as an adolescent and anti-social means of rebelling in a Christian society, by which an individual transgresses cultural boundaries. which tends to fall into two tendencies: 
*&quot;Satanic tourism&quot;—characterized by the brief period of time in which an individual was involved; 
*&quot;Satanic quest&quot;—typified by a longer and deeper involvement.

The researcher Gareth Medway noted that in 1995 he encountered a British woman who stated that she had been a practicing Satanist during her teenage years. She had grown up in a small mining village and had come to believe that she had psychic powers. After hearing about Satanism in some library books, she declared herself a Satanist and formulated a belief that Satan was the true god. After her teenage years she abandoned Satanism and became a chaos magickian.

Some personal Satanists are teenagers or mentally disturbed individuals who have engaged in criminal activities. During the 1980s and 1990s, several groups of teenagers were apprehended after sacrificing animals and vandalizing both churches and graveyards with Satanic imagery. Introvigne stated that these incidents were &quot;more a product of juvenile deviance and marginalization than Satanism&quot;. In a few cases, the crimes of these personal Satanists have included murder. 
*In 1970, two separate groups of teenagers—one led by Stanley Baker in Big Sur, and the other by Steven Hurd in Los Angeles, killed a total of three people and consumed parts of their corpses in what they later claimed were sacrifices devoted to Satan. 
*The American serial killer Richard Ramirez claimed that he was a (theistic) Satanist; during his 1980s killing spree he left an inverted pentagram at the scene of each murder and at his trial called out &quot;Hail Satan!&quot;. 
*In 1984 on Long Island, a group allegedly called the Knights of the Black Circle killed one of its own members, Gary Lauwers, over a disagreement regarding the group&#x27;s illegal drug dealing; group members later related that Lauwers&#x27; death was a sacrifice to Satan. In particular, self-declared Satanist and alleged member of the Knights of the Black Circle, Ricky &quot;the Acid King&quot; Kasso, became notorious for torturing and murdering Lauwers while attempting to force Lauwers to declare &quot;I love Satan&quot; during the murder. 
*Nikolai Ogolobyak, who confessed to being a member of a Satanic cult, was sentenced to 20 years in 2010 for the ritual killing of four teenagers in Russia&#x27;s Yaroslavl region.

==Demographics==
A survey in the Encyclopedia of Satanism found that people became involved with Satanism in many diverse ways and were found in many countries. The survey found that more Satanists were raised as Protestant Christians than Catholic.

Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen observed that from surveys of Satanists conducted in the early 21st century, it was clear that the Satanic milieu was &quot;heavily dominated by young males&quot;. They nevertheless noted that census data from New Zealand suggested that there may be a growing proportion of women becoming Satanists. In comprising more men than women, Satanism differs from most other religious communities, including most new religious communities. Most Satanists came to their religion through reading, either online or books, rather than through being introduced to it through personal contacts. Many practitioners do not claim that they converted to Satanism, but rather state that they were born that way, and only later in life confirmed that Satanism served as an appropriate label for their pre-existing worldviews. Others have stated that they had experiences with supernatural phenomena that led them to embracing Satanism.

The surveys revealed that atheistic Satanists appeared to be in the majority, although the numbers of theistic Satanists appeared to grow over time. Beliefs in the afterlife varied, although the most common beliefs about the afterlife were reincarnation and the idea that consciousness survives bodily death. The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic, although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological. A number of Satanists described performing cursing, in most cases as a form of vigilante justice. Most practitioners conduct their religious observances in a solitary manner, and never or rarely meet fellow Satanists for rituals. Rather, the primary interaction that takes place between Satanists is online, on websites or via email. From their survey data, Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen noted that the average length of involvement in the Satanic milieu was seven years. A Satanist&#x27;s involvement in the movement tends to peak in their early twenties and drops off sharply in their thirties. A small proportion retain their allegiance to the religion into their elder years. When asked about their ideology, the largest proportion of Satanists identified as apolitical or non-aligned, while only a small percentage identified as conservative. A small minority of Satanists expressed support for Nazism; conversely, over two-thirds expressed opposition or strong opposition to it.

=== 2021 Canadian census ===
The 2021 Canadian census states that 5,890 Canadians identify as Satanist, representing 0.02% of the population.

Compared to the general population, Satanists are more likely to be male, aged in their 20s or 30s, and not a member of any recognized minority group, although the Japanese are an exception (with the Japanese comprising 0.3% of both Satanists and the population as a whole).
==Legal recognition==

In 2004, it was claimed that Satanism was allowed in the Royal Navy of the British Armed Forces, despite opposition from Christians. In 2016, under a Freedom of Information request, the Navy Command Headquarters stated that, &quot;we do not recognise satanism as a formal religion, and will not grant facilities or make specific time available for individual &#x27;worship&#x27;.&quot;

In 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States debated in the case of &quot;Cutter v. Wilkinson&quot; over protecting minority religious rights of prison inmates after a lawsuit challenging the issue was filed to them. The court ruled that facilities that accept federal funds cannot deny prisoners accommodations that are necessary to engage in activities for the practice of their own religious beliefs.

In 2019, The Satanic Temple was granted religious IRS 501(c)(3) status.

==Metal and rock music ==

During the 1960s and 1970s, several rock bands— namely the American band Coven and the British band Black Widow, employed the imagery of Satanism and witchcraft in their work. References to Satan also appeared in the work of those rock bands which were pioneering the heavy metal genre in Britain during the 1970s. For example, the band Black Sabbath made mention of Satan in their lyrics, although some of the band&#x27;s members were practicing Christians, and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian god over Satan. In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands such as Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction. Bands active in the subgenre of death metal—among them Morbid Angel and Entombed, also adopted Satanic imagery, combining it with other morbid and dark imagery, such as that of zombies and serial killers.

Satanism would come to be more closely associated with the subgenre of black metal, in which it was foregrounded over the other themes that had been used in death metal. A number of black metal performers incorporated self-injury into their act, framing this as a manifestation of Satanic devotion. The first black metal band, Venom, proclaimed themselves to be Satanists, although this was more an act of provocation than an expression of genuine devotion to the Devil. Satanic themes were also used by the black metal bands Bathory and Hellhammer. However, the first black metal act to more seriously adopt Satanism was Mercyful Fate, whose vocalist, King Diamond, joined the Church of Satan. More often than not musicians associating themselves with black metal say they do not believe in legitimate Satanic ideology and often profess to being atheists, agnostics, or religious skeptics.

In contrast to King Diamond, various black metal Satanists sought to distance themselves from LaVeyan Satanism, for instance by referring to their beliefs as &quot;devil worship&quot;. These individuals regarded Satan as a literal entity, and in contrast to Anton LaVey, they associated Satanism with criminality, suicide, and terror. For them, Christianity was regarded as a plague which required eradication. Many of these individuals, most prominently Varg Vikernes and Euronymous, were involved in the early Norwegian black metal scene. Between 1992 and 1996, such people destroyed around fifty Norwegian churches in arson attacks. Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from Heathenry, a form of modern Paganism.

<text>Socialist law or Soviet law are terms used in comparative legal studies for the general type of legal system which has been (and continues to be) used in socialist and formerly socialist states. It is based on the civil law system, with major modifications and additions from Marxist–Leninist ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not. If so, prior to the end of the Cold War, &quot;socialist law&quot; would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.

While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of private property, how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the state or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.

Many scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification. Although the command economy approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the Soviet Union always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the French or German civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of common law into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).

An article published in 2016 suggests that socialist law, at least from the perspective of public law and constitutional design, is a useful category. In the NYU &quot;Journal of International Law and Policy&quot;, William Partlett and Eric Ip argue that socialist law helps to understand the &quot;Russo-Leninist transplants&quot; that currently operate in China&#x27;s socialist law system. This helps to understand the &quot;distinctive public law institutions and approaches in China that have been ignored by many scholars&quot;.

==Soviet legal theory==
Soviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected Marxist–Leninist ideology. Vladimir Lenin accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality and proletarian law in this early phase was Pēteris Stučka. Other proponents of proletarian law included Dmitry Kursky and Nikolai Krylenko. 

Alongside this trend was one more critical of the concept of &quot;proletarian justice&quot;, represented by Evgeny Pashukanis. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under Joseph Stalin with the ascendancy of Andrey Vyshinsky, when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in special tribunals.

During the de-Stalinization of the Nikita Khrushchev era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to decriminalize lesser offenses by handing them over to people&#x27;s courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration. By late 1986, the Mikhail Gorbachev era was stressing anew the importance of individual rights in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated procedural law in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.

==Characteristic traits==
Socialist law is similar to the civil law but with a greatly increased public law sector and decreased private law sector.

* extensive social warrants of the state (the rights to a job, free education, free healthcare, retirement at 60 for men and 55 for women, maternity leave, free disability benefits and sick leave compensation, subsidies to multichildren families, ...) in return for a high degree of social mobilization.
* the judicial process lacks an adversarial character; public prosecution is considered as &quot;provider of justice.&quot;
* partial or total expulsion of the former ruling classes from the public life at early stages of existence of each socialist state; however, in all socialist states this policy gradually changed into the policy of &quot;one socialist nation without classes&quot;
* diversity of political views directly discouraged.
* the ruling Communist party was eventually subject to prosecution through party committees in first place.
* abolition of private property, thus near total collectivization and nationalization of the means of production;
* subordination of the judiciary to the Communist Party
* low respect for intellectual property as knowledge and culture was considered a right for human kind, and not a privilege as in the free market economies.

A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called burlaw court (or, verbally, &quot;court of comrades&quot;, Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.

== Socialist rule of law ==
After China&#x27;s Reform and Opening Up, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) emphasized the rule of law as a basic strategy and method for state management of society. Jiang Zemin first called for establishing a socialist rule of law at the Fifteenth Party Congress in 1997. In 2014, the CCP formally adopted a policy of constructing a &quot;socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics.&quot;

In his writings on socialist rule of law, Xi Jinping has emphasized traditional Chinese concepts including people as the root of the state (&quot;mingben&quot;), &quot;the ideal of no lawsuit&quot; (&quot;tianxia wusong&quot;), &quot;respecting rite and stressing law&quot; (&quot;longli zhongfa&quot;), &quot;virtue first, penalty second&quot; (&quot;dezhu xingfu&quot;), and &quot;promoting virtue and being prudent in punishment&quot; (&quot;mingde shenfa&quot;). Xi states that the two fundamental aspects of the socialist rule of law are: (1) that the political and legal organs (including courts, the police, and the procuratorate) must believe in the law and uphold the law, and (2) all political and legal officials must follow the CCP.

<text>A semiconductor is a material that is between the conductor and insulator in ability to conduct electrical current. In many cases their conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (&quot;doping&quot;) into the crystal structure. When two differently doped regions exist in the same crystal, a semiconductor junction is created. The behavior of charge carriers, which include electrons, ions, and electron holes, at these junctions is the basis of diodes, transistors, and most modern electronics. Some examples of semiconductors are silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, and elements near the so-called &quot;metalloid staircase&quot; on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium arsenide is the second-most common semiconductor and is used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits, and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits.

Semiconductor devices can display a range of different useful properties, such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and having sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping and by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and energy conversion. The term semiconductor is also used to describe materials used in high capacity, medium- to high-voltage cables as part of their insulation, and these materials are often plastic XLPE (Cross-linked polyethylene) with carbon black.

The conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount (of the order of 1 in 108) of pentavalent (antimony, phosphorus, or arsenic) or trivalent (boron, gallium, indium) atoms. This process is known as doping, and the resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of a semiconductor can be improved by increasing its temperature. This is contrary to the behavior of a metal, in which conductivity decreases with an increase in temperature.

The modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a crystal lattice. Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a semiconductor is doped by Group V elements, they will behave like donors creating free electrons, known as &quot;n-type&quot; doping. When a semiconductor is doped by Group III elements, they will behave like acceptors creating free holes, known as &quot;p-type&quot; doping. The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor device crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the p–n junctions between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior. Using a hot-point probe, one can determine quickly whether a semiconductor sample is p- or n-type.

A few of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid-19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the cat&#x27;s-whisker detector, a primitive semiconductor diode used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics led in turn to the invention of the transistor in 1947 and the integrated circuit in 1958.

== Properties ==

=== Variable electrical conductivity ===
Semiconductors in their natural state are poor conductors because a current requires the flow of electrons, and semiconductors have their valence bands filled, preventing the entire flow of new electrons. Several developed techniques allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as doping or gating. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. A balanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow throughout the material.

=== Homojunctions ===
Homojunctions occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped germanium. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until an equilibrium is reached by a process called recombination, which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. The result of this process is a narrow strip of immobile ions, which causes an electric field across the junction.

=== Excited electrons ===
A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called ambipolar diffusion. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or photons, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes. The processes that create or annihilate electrons and holes are called generation and recombination, respectively.

=== Light emission ===
In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat. Controlling the semiconductor composition and electrical current allows for the manipulation of the emitted light&#x27;s properties. These semiconductors are used in the construction of light-emitting diodes and fluorescent quantum dots.

===High thermal conductivity===
Semiconductors with high thermal conductivity can be used for heat dissipation and improving thermal management of electronics. They play a crucial role in electric vehicles, high-brightness LEDs and power modules, among other applications.

=== Thermal energy conversion ===
Semiconductors have large thermoelectric power factors making them useful in thermoelectric generators, as well as high thermoelectric figures of merit making them useful in thermoelectric coolers.

== Materials ==


A large number of elements and compounds have semiconducting properties, including:
* Certain pure elements are found in group 14 of the periodic table; the most commercially important of these elements are silicon and germanium. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell, which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.
* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in groups 13 and 15, such as gallium arsenide, groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group-14 elements, e.g. silicon carbide.
* Certain ternary compounds, oxides, and alloys.
* Organic semiconductors, made of organic compounds.
* Semiconducting metal–organic frameworks.

The most common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but amorphous and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and mixtures of arsenic, selenium, and tellurium in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better-known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional negative resistance. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in thin film structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.

=== Preparation of semiconductor materials ===
Almost all of today&#x27;s electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the integrated circuit (IC), which are found in desktops, laptops, scanners, cell-phones, and other electronic devices. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.

A high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in the crystal structure (such as dislocations, twins, and stacking faults) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal ingots between in diameter, grown as cylinders and sliced into wafers. The round shape characteristic of these wafers comes from single-crystal ingots usually produced using the Czochralski method. Silicon wafers were first introduced in the 1940s.

There is a combination of processes that are used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called thermal oxidation, which forms silicon dioxide on the surface of the silicon. This is used as a gate insulator and field oxide. Other processes are called photomasks and photolithography. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuit in the integrated circuit. Ultraviolet light is used along with a photoresist layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.

The etching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the photoresist layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called plasma etching. Plasma etching usually involves an etch gas pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create plasma. A common etch gas is chlorofluorocarbon, or more commonly known Freon. A high radio-frequency voltage between the cathode and anode is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The silicon wafer is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The result is silicon that is etched anisotropically.

The last process is called diffusion. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as doping. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the p–n junction. To get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting wafer is almost prepared.

== Physics of semiconductors ==

=== Energy bands and electrical conduction ===

Semiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior, somewhere between that of a conductor and an insulator. The differences between these materials can be understood in terms of the quantum states for electrons, each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the Pauli exclusion principle). These states are associated with the electronic band structure of the material. Electrical conductivity arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are delocalized (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be &quot;partially filled&quot;, containing an electron only part of the time. If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state. The energies of these quantum states are critical since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the Fermi level (see Fermi–Dirac statistics).

High conductivity in material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.
Metals are good electrical conductors and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.
Insulators, by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within band gaps with few energy states to occupy. Importantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap (valence band) and the band of states above the band gap (conduction band). An (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature, significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.

A pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.
However, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as &quot;semi-insulators&quot;) is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by doping with impurities and gating with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.

Some wider-bandgap semiconductor materials are sometimes referred to as semi-insulators. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for HEMT. An example of a common semi-insulator is gallium arsenide. Some materials, such as titanium dioxide, can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.

=== Charge carriers (electrons and holes) ===
The partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band. The electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal recombination) but they can move around for some time. The actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical ideal gas, where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. In most semiconductors, the conduction bands have a parabolic dispersion relation, and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much as they would in a vacuum, though with a different effective mass. Because the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the Drude model, and introduce concepts such as electron mobility.

For partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an electron hole. Although the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current. If an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge. For the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron. Combined with the &quot;negative&quot; effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in a vacuum, again with some positive effective mass. This particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).

==== Carrier generation and recombination ====
When ionizing radiation strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as &quot;electron-hole pair generation&quot;. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from thermal energy as well, in the absence of any external energy source.

Electron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. Conservation of energy demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of energy larger than the band gap, be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of phonons) or radiation (in the form of photons).

In some states, the generation and recombination of electron–hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the steady state at a given temperature is determined by quantum statistical mechanics. The precise quantum mechanical mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by the conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

As the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their numbers, the product is in the steady-state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might &quot;flush&quot; carriers of both types, or move them from neighbor regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately , where &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature and &quot;E&quot;G is bandgap.

The probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps – impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady-state.

=== Doping ===
The conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their crystal lattice. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as doping. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an &quot;intrinsic&quot; (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as &quot;extrinsic&quot;. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.

A 1 cm3 specimen of a metal or semiconductor has the order of 1022 atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1 cm3 of metal contains on the order of 1022 free electrons, whereas a 1 cm3 sample of pure germanium at 20°C contains about atoms, but only free electrons and holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 1017 free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.

The materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron acceptors or donors. Semiconductors doped with &quot;donor&quot; impurities are called &quot;n-type&quot;, while those doped with &quot;acceptor&quot; impurities are known as &quot;p-type&quot;. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material&#x27;s majority carrier. The opposite carrier is called the minority carrier, which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.

For example, the pure semiconductor silicon has four valence electrons that bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are group III and group V elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state (an electron &quot;hole&quot;) is created, which can move around the lattice and function as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with boron creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with phosphorus results in an n-type material.

During manufacture, dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or ion implantation can be used to accurately position the doped regions.

=== Amorphous semiconductors ===
Some materials, when rapidly cooled to a glassy amorphous state, have semiconducting properties. These include B, Si, Ge, Se, and Te, and there are multiple theories to explain them.

== Early history of semiconductors ==
The history of the understanding of semiconductors begins with experiments on the electrical properties of materials. The properties of the time-temperature coefficient of resistance, rectification, and light-sensitivity were observed starting in the early 19th century.

Thomas Johann Seebeck was the first to notice that semiconductors exhibit special feature such that experiment concerning an Seebeck effect emerged with much stronger result when applying semiconductors, in 1821. In 1833, Michael Faraday reported that the resistance of specimens of silver sulfide decreases when they are heated. This is contrary to the behavior of metallic substances such as copper. In 1839, Alexandre Edmond Becquerel reported observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte, when struck by light, the photovoltaic effect. In 1873, Willoughby Smith observed that selenium resistors exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In 1874, Karl Ferdinand Braun observed conduction and rectification in metallic sulfides, although this effect had been discovered earlier by Peter Munck af Rosenschöld (sv) writing for the &quot;Annalen der Physik und Chemie&quot; in 1835; Rosenschöld&#x27;s findings were ignored. Simon Sze stated that Braun&#x27;s research was the earliest systematic study of semiconductor devices. Also in 1874, Arthur Schuster found that a copper oxide layer on wires had rectification properties that ceased when the wires are cleaned. William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day observed the photovoltaic effect in selenium in 1876.

A unified explanation of these phenomena required a theory of solid-state physics, which developed greatly in the first half of the 20th century. In 1878 Edwin Herbert Hall demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the Hall effect. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. Karl Baedeker, by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. classified solid materials like metals, insulators, and &quot;variable conductors&quot; in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term Halbleiter (a semiconductor in modern meaning) in his Ph.D. thesis in 1910. Felix Bloch published a theory of the movement of electrons through atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by Alan Herries Wilson and the concept of band gaps had been developed. Walter H. Schottky and Nevill Francis Mott developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a metal–semiconductor junction. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the p–n junction and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.

Agreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later explained by John Bardeen as due to the extreme &quot;structure sensitive&quot; behavior of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts of impurities. Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.

Devices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical knowledge before semiconductor theory provided a guide to the construction of more capable and reliable devices.

Alexander Graham Bell used the light-sensitive property of selenium to transmit sound over a beam of light in 1880. A working solar cell, of low efficiency, was constructed by Charles Fritts in 1883, using a metal plate coated with selenium and a thin layer of gold; the device became commercially useful in photographic light meters in the 1930s. Point-contact microwave detector rectifiers made of lead sulfide were used by Jagadish Chandra Bose in 1904; the cat&#x27;s-whisker detector using natural galena or other materials became a common device in the development of radio. However, it was somewhat unpredictable in operation and required manual adjustment for best performance. In 1906, H.J. Round observed light emission when electric current passed through silicon carbide crystals, the principle behind the light-emitting diode. Oleg Losev observed similar light emission in 1922, but at the time the effect had no practical use. Power rectifiers, using copper oxide and selenium, were developed in the 1920s and became commercially important as an alternative to vacuum tube rectifiers.

The first semiconductor devices used galena, including German physicist Ferdinand Braun&#x27;s crystal detector in 1874 and Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose&#x27;s radio crystal detector in 1901.

In the years preceding World War II, infrared detection and communications devices prompted research into lead-sulfide and lead-selenide materials. These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000 MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors. Considerable research and development of silicon materials occurred during the war to develop detectors of consistent quality.

Detector and power rectifiers could not amplify a signal. Many efforts were made to develop a solid-state amplifier and were successful in developing a device called the point contact transistor which could amplify 20 dB or more. In 1922, Oleg Losev developed two-terminal, negative resistance amplifiers for radio, but he died in the Siege of Leningrad after successful completion. In 1926, Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented a device resembling a field-effect transistor, but it was not practical. and in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a cut-off frequency of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory. At Bell Labs, William Shockley and A. Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p–n junction in silicon was observed by Russell Ohl about 1941 when a specimen was found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the p–n boundary developed a voltage when exposed to light.

The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947. Shockley had earlier theorized a field-effect amplifier made from germanium and silicon, but he failed to build such a working device, before eventually using germanium to invent the point-contact transistor. In France, during the war, Herbert Mataré had observed amplification between adjacent point contacts on a germanium base. After the war, Mataré&#x27;s group announced their &quot;Transistron&quot; amplifier only shortly after Bell Labs announced the &quot;transistor&quot;.

In 1954, physical chemist Morris Tanenbaum fabricated the first silicon junction transistor at Bell Labs. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialised applications.

<doc id="27711" wikidata="Q41534" url="?curid=27711" title="Starch">
<text>Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of numerous glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by most green plants for energy storage. Worldwide, it is the most common carbohydrate in human diets, and is contained in large amounts in staple foods such as wheat, potatoes, maize (corn), rice, and cassava (manioc).

Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight. Glycogen, the energy reserve of animals, is a more highly branched version of amylopectin.

In industry, starch is often converted into sugars, for example by malting. These sugars may be fermented to produce ethanol in the manufacture of beer, whisky and biofuel. In addition, sugars produced from processed starch are used in many processed foods.

Mixing most starches in warm water produces a paste, such as wheatpaste, which can be used as a thickening, stiffening or gluing agent. The principal non-food, industrial use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process. A similar paste, clothing or laundry starch, can be applied to certain textile goods before ironing to stiffen them.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;starch&quot; is from a Germanic root with the meanings &quot;strong, stiff, strengthen, stiffen&quot;. 

Modern German &quot;Stärke&quot; (strength, starch) is related and refers to the main historical applications, its uses in textiles: sizing yarn for weaving, and starching linen. 

The Greek term for starch, &quot;amylon&quot; (ἄμυλον), which means &quot;not milled&quot;, is also related. It provides the root , which is used as a prefix for several carbon compounds related to or derived from starch (e.g. amyl alcohol, amylose, amylopectin).

==History==
Starch grains from the rhizomes of &quot;Typha&quot; (cattails, bullrushes) as flour have been identified from grinding stones in Europe dating back to 30,000 years ago. Starch grains from sorghum were found on grind stones in caves in Ngalue, Mozambique dating up to 100,000 years ago.

Pure extracted wheat starch paste was used in Ancient Egypt, possibly to glue papyrus. The extraction of starch is first described in the &quot;Natural History&quot; of Pliny the Elder around 77–79 CE. Romans used it also in cosmetic creams, to powder the hair and to thicken sauces. Persians and Indians used it to make dishes similar to gothumai wheat halva. Rice starch as surface treatment of paper has been used in paper production in China since 700 CE. In the mid eighth century production of paper that was with wheat starch started in the Arabic world. Laundry starch was first described in England in the beginning of the 15th century and was essential to make 16th century ruffed collars.

==Energy store of plants==
Plants produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. The glucose is used to generate the chemical energy required for general metabolism as well as a precursor to myriad organic building blocks such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose. Most green plants store any extra glucose in the form of starch, which is packed into semicrystalline granules called starch granules or amyloplasts. Toward the end of the growing season, starch accumulates in twigs of trees near the buds. Fruit, seeds, rhizomes, and tubers store starch to prepare for the next growing season. Young plants live on this stored energy in their roots, seeds, and fruits until they can find suitable soil in which to grow. The starch is also consumed at night when photosynthesis is not occurring.

Green algae and land-plants store their starch in the plastids, whereas red algae, glaucophytes, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates and the parasitic apicomplexa store a similar type of polysaccharide called floridean starch in their cytosol or periplast.

Especially when hydrated, glucose takes up much space and is osmotically active. Starch, on the other hand, being insoluble and therefore osmotically inactive, can be stored much more compactly. The semicrystalline granules generally consist of concentric layers of amylose and amylopectin which can be made bioavailable upon cellular demand in the plant.

Amylose consists of long chains derived from glucose molecules connected by α-1,4-glycosidic linkage. Amylopectin is highly branched but also derived from glucose interconnected by α-1,6-glycosidic linkages. The same type of linkage is found in the animal reserve polysaccharide glycogen. By contrast, many structural polysaccharides such as chitin, cellulose, and peptidoglycan are linked by β-glycosidic bonds, which are more resistant to hydrolysis.

===Structure of starch particles===
Within plants, starch is stored in semi-crystalline granules. Each plant species has a distinctive starch granular size: rice starch is relatively small (about 2 μm), potato starches have larger granules (up to 100 μm) while wheat and tapioca fall in-between. Unlike other botanical sources of starch, wheat starch has a bimodal size distribution, with both smaller and larger granules ranging from 2 to 55 μm.

Some cultivated plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as &quot;waxy starches&quot;. The most used is waxy maize, others are glutinous rice and waxy potato starch. Waxy starches undergo less retrogradation, resulting in a more stable paste. A maize cultivar with a relatively high proportion of amylose starch, amylomaize, is cultivated for the use of its gel strength and for use as a resistant starch (a starch that resists digestion) in food products.

===Biosynthesis===
Plants synthesize starch in two types of tissues. The first type is storage tissues, for example, cereal endosperm, and storage roots and stems such as cassava and potato. The second type is green tissue, for example, leaves, where many plant species synthesize transitory starch on a daily basis. In both tissue types, starch is synthesized in a plastids (amyloplasts and chloroplasts).

The biochemical pathway involves conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to ADP-glucose using the enzyme glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase. This step requires energy in the form of ATP. A number of starch synthases available in plastids then adds the ADP-glucose via α-1,4-glycosidic bond to a growing chain of glucose residues, liberating ADP. The ADP-glucose is almost certainly added to the non-reducing end of the amylose polymer, as the UDP-glucose is added to the non-reducing end of glycogen during glycogen synthesis. The small glucan chain, further agglomerate to form initials of starch granules. 

The biosynthesis and expansion of granules represent a complex molecular event that can be subdivided into four major steps, namely, granule initiation, coalescence of small granules, phase transition, and expansion. Several proteins have been characterized for their involvement in each of these processes. For instance, a chloroplast membrane-associated protein, MFP1, determines the sites of granule initiation. Another protein named PTST2 binds to small glucan chains and agglomerates to recruit starch synthase 4 (SS4). Three other proteins, namely, PTST3, SS5, and MRC, are also known to be involved in the process of starch granule initiation. Furthermore, two proteins named ESV and LESV play a role in the aqueous-to-crystalline phase transition of glucan chains. Several catalytically active starch synthases, such as SS1, SS2, SS3, and GBSS, are critical for starch granule biosynthesis and play a catalytic role at each step of granule biogenesis and expansion.

In addition to above proteins, starch branching enzymes (BEs) introduces α-1,6-glycosidic bonds between the glucose chains, creating the branched amylopectin. The starch debranching enzyme (DBE) isoamylase removes some of these branches. Several isoforms of these enzymes exist, leading to a highly complex synthesis process.

===Degradation===
The starch that is synthesized in plant leaves during the day is transitory: it serves as an energy source at night. Enzymes catalyze release of glucose from the granules. The insoluble, highly branched starch chains require phosphorylation in order to be accessible for degrading enzymes. The enzyme glucan, water dikinase (GWD) installs a phosphate at the C-6 position of glucose, close to the chain&#x27;s 1,6-alpha branching bonds. A second enzyme, phosphoglucan, water dikinase (PWD) phosphorylates the glucose molecule at the C-3 position. After the second phosphorylation, the first degrading enzyme, beta-amylase (BAM) attacks the glucose chain at its non-reducing end. Maltose is the main product released. If the glucose chain consists of three or fewer molecules, BAM cannot release maltose. A second enzyme, disproportionating enzyme-1 (DPE1), combines two maltotriose molecules. From this chain, a glucose molecule is released. Now, BAM can release another maltose molecule from the remaining chain. This cycle repeats until starch is fully degraded. If BAM comes close to the phosphorylated branching point of the glucose chain, it can no longer release maltose. In order for the phosphorylated chain to be degraded, the enzyme isoamylase (ISA) is required.

The products of starch degradation are predominantly maltose and smaller amounts of glucose. These molecules are exported from the plastid to the cytosol, maltose via the maltose transporter and glucose by the plastidic glucose translocator (pGlcT). These two sugars are used for sucrose synthesis. Sucrose can then be used in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in the mitochondria, to generate ATP at night.

==Starch industry==

In addition to starchy plants consumed directly, 66 million tonnes of starch were processed industrially in 2008. By 2011, production had increased to 73 million tons.

In the EU the starch industry produced about 11 million tonnes in 2011, with around 40% being used for industrial applications and 60% for food uses, most of the latter as glucose syrups. In 2017 EU production was 11 million ton of which 9,4 million ton was consumed in the EU and of which 54% were starch sweeteners.

The US produced about 27.5 million tons of starch in 2017, of which about 8.2 million tons was high fructose syrup, 6.2 million tons was glucose syrups, and 2.5 million tons were starch products. The rest of the starch was used for producing ethanol (1.6 billion gallons).

===Industrial processing===
The starch industry extracts and refines starches from crops by wet grinding, washing, sieving and drying. Today, the main commercial refined starches are cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot, and wheat, rice, and potato starches. To a lesser extent, sources of refined starch are sweet potato, sago and mung bean. To this day, starch is extracted from more than 50 types of plants.

Crude starch is processed on an industrial scale to maltodextrin and glucose syrups and fructose syrups. These massive conversions are mediated by a variety of enzymes, which break down the starch to varying extents. Here breakdown involves hydrolysis, i.e. cleavage of bonds between sugar subunits by the addition of water. Some sugars are isomerized. The processes have been described as occurring in two phases: liquefaction and saccharification. The liquefaction converts starch into dextrins. Amylase is a key enzyme for producing dextrin. The saccharification converts dextrin into maltoses and glucose. Diverse enzymes are used in this second phase, including pullanase and other amylases.


===Dextrinization===
If starch is subjected to dry heat, it breaks down to form dextrins, also called &quot;pyrodextrins&quot; in this context. This break down process is known as dextrinization. (Pyro)dextrins are mainly yellow to brown in color and dextrinization is partially responsible for the browning of toasted bread.

==Food==
Starch is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet and is contained in many staple foods. The major sources of starch intake worldwide are the cereals (rice, wheat, and maize) and the root vegetables (potatoes and cassava). Many other starchy foods are grown, some only in specific climates, including acorns, arrowroot, arracacha, bananas, barley, breadfruit, buckwheat, canna, colocasia, cuckoo-pint, katakuri, kudzu, malanga, millet, oats, oca, polynesian arrowroot, sago, sorghum, sweet potatoes, rye, taro, chestnuts, water chestnuts, and yams, and many kinds of beans, such as favas, lentils, mung beans, peas, and chickpeas.

Before processed foods, people consumed large amounts of uncooked and unprocessed starch-containing plants, which contained high amounts of resistant starch. Microbes within the large intestine ferment or consume the starch, producing short-chain fatty acids, which are used as energy, and support the maintenance and growth of the microbes. Upon cooking, starch is transformed from an insoluble, difficult-to-digest granule into readily accessible glucose chains with very different nutritional and functional properties.

In current diets, highly processed foods are more easily digested and release more glucose in the small intestine—less starch reaches the large intestine and more energy is absorbed by the body. It is thought that this shift in energy delivery (as a result of eating more processed foods) may be one of the contributing factors to the development of metabolic disorders of modern life, including obesity and diabetes.

The amylose/amylopectin ratio, molecular weight and molecular fine structure influences the physicochemical properties as well as energy release of different types of starches. In addition, cooking and food processing significantly impacts starch digestibility and energy release. Starch has been classified as rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch, depending upon its digestion profile. Raw starch granules resist digestion by human enzymes and do not break down into glucose in the small intestine - they reach the large intestine instead and function as prebiotic dietary fiber. When starch granules are fully gelatinized and cooked, the starch becomes easily digestible and releases glucose quickly within the small intestine. When starchy foods are cooked and cooled, some of the glucose chains re-crystallize and become resistant to digestion again. Slowly digestible starch can be found in raw cereals, where digestion is slow but relatively complete within the small intestine. Widely used prepared foods containing starch are bread, pancakes, cereals, noodles, pasta, porridge and tortilla.

During cooking with high heat, sugars released from starch can react with amino acids via the Maillard reaction, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), contributing aromas, flavors and texture to foods. One example of a dietary AGE is acrylamide. Recent evidence suggests that the intestinal fermentation of dietary AGEs may be associated with insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, diabetes and other inflammatory diseases. This may be due to the impact of AGEs on intestinal permeability.

Starch gelatinization during cake baking can be impaired by sugar competing for water, preventing gelatinization and improving texture.
===Starch sugars===

Starch can be hydrolyzed into simpler carbohydrates by acids, various enzymes, or a combination of the two. The resulting fragments are known as dextrins. The extent of conversion is typically quantified by dextrose equivalent (DE), which is roughly the fraction of the glycosidic bonds in starch that have been broken.

These starch sugars are by far the most common starch based food ingredient and are used as sweeteners in many drinks and foods. They include:

* Maltodextrin, a lightly hydrolyzed (DE 10–20) starch product used as a bland-tasting filler and thickener.
* Various glucose syrups (DE 30–70), also called corn syrups in the US, viscous solutions used as sweeteners and thickeners in many kinds of processed foods.
* Dextrose (DE 100), commercial glucose, prepared by the complete hydrolysis of starch.
* High fructose syrup, made by treating dextrose solutions with the enzyme glucose isomerase, until a substantial fraction of the glucose has been converted to fructose. In the U.S. high-fructose corn syrup is significantly cheaper than sugar, and is the principal sweetener used in processed foods and beverages. Fructose also has better microbiological stability. One kind of high fructose corn syrup, HFCS-55, is sweeter than sucrose because it is made with more fructose, while the sweetness of HFCS-42 is on par with sucrose.
* Sugar alcohols, such as maltitol, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol and hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, are sweeteners made by reducing sugars.

===Modified starches===
The modified food starches are E coded according to European Food Safety Authority and INS coded Food Additives according to the Codex Alimentarius:
* 1400 Dextrin 
* 1401 Acid-treated starch
* 1402 Alkaline-treated starch
* 1403 Bleached starch
* 1404 Oxidized starch
* 1405 Starches, enzyme-treated
* 1410 Monostarch phosphate
* 1412 Distarch phosphate
* 1413 Phosphated distarch phosphate
* 1414 Acetylated distarch phosphate
* 1420 Acetylated starch
* 1422 Acetylated distarch adipate
* 1440 Hydroxypropyl starch
* 1442 Hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate
* 1443 Hydroxypropyl distarch glycerol
* 1450 Starch sodium octenyl succinate
* 1451 Acetylated oxidized starch

INS 1400, 1401, 1402, 1403 and 1405 are in the EU food ingredients without an E-number. Typical modified starches for technical applications are cationic starches, hydroxyethyl starch, carboxymethylated starches and thiolated starches.

===Use as food additive===
As an additive for food processing, food starches are typically used as thickeners and stabilizers in foods such as puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and salad dressings, and to make noodles and pastas. They function as thickeners, extenders, emulsion stabilizers and are exceptional binders in processed meats.

Gummed sweets such as jelly beans and wine gums are not manufactured using a mold in the conventional sense. A tray is filled with native starch and leveled. A positive mold is then pressed into the starch leaving an impression of 1,000 or so jelly beans. The jelly mix is then poured into the impressions and put onto a stove to set. This method greatly reduces the number of molds that must be manufactured.

===Resistant starch===
Resistant starch is starch that escapes digestion in the small intestine of healthy individuals. High-amylose starch from wheat or corn has a higher gelatinization temperature than other types of starch, and retains its resistant starch content through baking, mild extrusion and other food processing techniques. It is used as an insoluble dietary fiber in processed foods such as bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels and other low moisture foods. It is also utilized as a dietary supplement for its health benefits. Published studies have shown that resistant starch helps to improve insulin sensitivity, reduces pro-inflammatory biomarkers interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha and improves markers of colonic function.
It has been suggested that resistant starch contributes to the health benefits of intact whole grains.

=== Synthetic starch ===
A cell-free chemoenzymatic process has been demonstrated to synthesize starch from CO2 and hydrogen.y. The chemical pathway of 11 core reactions was drafted by computational pathway design and converts CO2 to starch at a rate that is ~8.5-fold higher than starch synthesis in maize.

==Non-food applications==
===Papermaking===
Papermaking is the largest non-food application for starches globally, consuming many millions of metric tons annually. In a typical sheet of copy paper for instance, the starch content may be as high as 8%. Both chemically modified and unmodified starches are used in papermaking. In the wet part of the papermaking process, generally called the &quot;wet-end&quot;, the starches used are cationic and have a positive charge bound to the starch polymer. These starch derivatives associate with the anionic or negatively charged paper fibers / cellulose and inorganic fillers. Cationic starches together with other retention and internal sizing agents help to give the necessary strength properties to the paper web formed in the papermaking process (wet strength), and to provide strength to the final paper sheet (dry strength).

In the dry end of the papermaking process, the paper web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called surface sizing. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized at the paper mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or &quot;size&quot; for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings as one of the binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners. Coated paper has improved smoothness, hardness, whiteness and gloss and thus improves printing characteristics.

===Adhesives===
Corrugated board adhesives are the next largest application of non-food starches globally. Starch glues are mostly based on unmodified native starches, plus some additive such as borax and caustic soda. Part of the starch is gelatinized to carry the slurry of uncooked starches and prevent sedimentation. This opaque glue is called a SteinHall adhesive. The glue is applied on tips of the fluting. The fluted paper is pressed to paper called liner. This is then dried under high heat, which causes the rest of the uncooked starch in glue to swell/gelatinize. This gelatinizing makes the glue a fast and strong adhesive for corrugated board production.

Starch is used in the manufacture of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, paper sack production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the starch solution at to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.

A related large non-food starch application is in the construction industry, where starch is used in the gypsum wall board manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily gypsum. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid wall board. The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.

===Other===
* Clothing or laundry starch is used in the laundering of clothes. It was widely used in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries.
* Textile chemicals from starch: warp sizing agents are used to reduce breaking of yarns during weaving. Starch is mainly used to size cotton based yarns. Modified starch is also used as textile printing thickener.
* In oil exploration, starch is used to adjust the viscosity of drilling fluid, which is used to lubricate the drill head and suspend the grinding residue in petroleum extraction.
* Starch is also used to make some packing peanuts, and some drop ceiling tiles.
* In the printing industry, food grade starch is used in the manufacture of anti-set-off spray powder used to separate printed sheets of paper to avoid wet ink being set off.
* For body powder, powdered corn starch is used as a substitute for talcum powder, and similarly in other health and beauty products.
* Starch is used to produce various bioplastics, synthetic polymers that are biodegradable. An example is polylactic acid based on glucose from starch.
* Glucose from starch can be further fermented to biofuel corn ethanol using the so-called wet milling process. Today most bioethanol production plants use the dry milling process to ferment corn or other feedstock directly to ethanol.
*In the pharmaceutical industry, starch is also used as an excipient, as tablet disintegrant, and as binder. Synthetic amylose made from cellulose has a well-controlled degree of polymerization. Therefore, it can be used as a potential drug deliver carrier.

==Chemical tests==
A solution of triiodide (I3−) (formed by mixing iodine and potassium iodide) can be used to test for starch. The colorless solution turns dark blue in the presence of starch. The strength of the resulting blue color depends on the amount of amylose present. Waxy starches with little or no amylose present will color red. Benedict&#x27;s test and Fehling&#x27;s test is also done to indicate the presence of starch.

== Safety==
In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for starch exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday.

<text>Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two bonded monosaccharides; common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose). White sugar is a refined form of sucrose. In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars.

Longer chains of monosaccharides (&gt;2) are not regarded as sugars and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides. Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, the most abundant source of energy in human food. Some other chemical substances, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste but are not classified as sugar.
Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants. Honey and fruits are abundant natural sources of simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes. Maltose may be produced by malting grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products. A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.
Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g., cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available ultra-processed food and beverages, and is sometimes used as a sweetener for foods (e.g., toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g., coffee and tea). The average person consumes about of sugar each year. North and South Americans consume up to , and Africans consume under .
As free sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in free sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health. In 2015, the World Health Organization strongly recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake and encouraged a reduction to below 5%. In general, high sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefit and is associated with a risk of cardiometabolic and other health detriments.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &quot;sugar&quot; reflects the commodity&#x27;s spread. From Sanskrit &#x27;, meaning &quot;ground or candied sugar&quot;, came Persian &#x27; and Arabic &quot;sukkar&quot;. The Arabic word was borrowed in Medieval Latin as &quot;succarum&quot;, whence came the 12th century French &quot;sucre&quot; and the English &quot;sugar&quot;. Sugar was introduced into Europe by the Arabs in Sicily and Spain.

The English word &quot;jaggery&quot;, a coarse brown sugar made from date palm sap or sugarcane juice, has a similar etymological origin: Portuguese &#x27; from the Malayalam &#x27;, which is from the Sanskrit &quot;&quot;.

== History ==

=== Ancient world to Renaissance ===

==== Asia ====

Sugar has been produced in the Indian subcontinent for thousands of years. Sugarcane cultivation spread from there into China via the Khyber Pass and caravan routes. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times, and in most parts of the world, honey was more often used for sweetening. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its sweetness. Even after refined sugarcane became more widely available during the European colonial era, palm sugar was preferred in Java and other sugar producing parts of southeast Asia, and along with coconut sugar, is still used locally to make desserts today.

Sugarcane is native of tropical areas such as the Indian subcontinent (South Asia) and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations; &quot;Saccharum barberi&quot; originated in India, and &quot;S. edule&quot; and &quot;S. officinarum&quot; came from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating to the 8th century BCE, which state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.

In the tradition of Indian medicine (āyurveda), sugarcane is known by the name &quot;Ikṣu&quot;, and sugarcane juice is known as &quot;Phāṇita&quot;. Its varieties, synonyms and characteristics are defined in nighaṇṭus such as the Bhāvaprakāśa (1.6.23, group of sugarcanes).
Sugar remained relatively unimportant until the Indians discovered methods of turning sugarcane juice into granulated crystals that were easier to store and transport. At around 350 AD, Indian figure out a way to create crystalized sugar from the sugarcane juice. It was then considered as &#x27;sweet spice&#x27; and Indian trader started trading suagr outside India. The Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides attested to the method in his 1st century CE medical treatise &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;: 
In the local Indian language, these crystals were called &quot;khanda&quot; (Devanagari: खण्ड, ), which is the source of the word &quot;candy&quot;. Indian sailors, who carried clarified butter and sugar as supplies, introduced knowledge of sugar along the various trade routes they travelled. Traveling Buddhist monks took sugar crystallization methods to China. During the reign of Harsha (r. 606–647) in North India, Indian envoys in Tang China taught methods of cultivating sugarcane after Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649) made known his interest in sugar. China established its first sugarcane plantations in the seventh century. Chinese documents confirm at least two missions to India, initiated in 647 CE, to obtain technology for sugar refining.

==== Europe ====

Nearchus, admiral of Alexander the Great, knew of sugar during the year 325 BC because of his participation in the campaign of India led by Alexander (&quot;Arrian, Anabasis&quot;). In addition to the Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, the Roman Pliny the Elder also described sugar in his 1st century CE Natural History: &quot;Sugar is made in Arabia as well, but Indian sugar is better. It is a kind of honey found in cane, white as gum, and it crunches between the teeth. It comes in lumps the size of a hazelnut. Sugar is used only for medical purposes.&quot; Crusaders brought sugar back to Europe after their campaigns in the Holy Land, where they encountered caravans carrying &quot;sweet salt&quot;. Early in the 12th century, the Republic of Venice acquired some villages near Tyre and set up estates to produce sugar for export to Europe. It supplemented the use of honey, which had previously been the only available sweetener. Crusade chronicler William of Tyre, writing in the late 12th century, described sugar as &quot;very necessary for the use and health of mankind&quot;. In the 15th century, Venice was the chief sugar refining and distribution center in Europe.

There was a drastic change in the mid-15th century, when Madeira and the Canary Islands were settled from Europe and sugar introduced there. After this an &quot;all-consuming passion for sugar ... swept through society&quot; as it became far more easily available, though initially still very expensive. By 1492, Madeira was producing over of sugar annually. Genoa, one of the centers of distribution, became known for candied fruit, while Venice specialized in pastries, sweets (candies), and sugar sculptures. Sugar was considered to have &quot;valuable medicinal properties&quot; as a &quot;warm&quot; food under prevailing categories, being &quot;helpful to the stomach, to cure cold diseases, and sooth lung complaints&quot;.

A feast given in Tours in 1457 by Gaston de Foix, which is &quot;probably the best and most complete account we have of a late medieval banquet&quot; includes the first mention of sugar sculptures, as the final food brought in was &quot;a heraldic menagerie sculpted in sugar: lions, stags, monkeys ... each holding in paw or beak the arms of the Hungarian king&quot;. Other recorded grand feasts in the decades following included similar pieces. Originally the sculptures seem to have been eaten in the meal, but later they become merely table decorations, the most elaborate called &quot;trionfi&quot;. Several significant sculptors are known to have produced them; in some cases their preliminary drawings survive. Early ones were in brown sugar, partly cast in molds, with the final touches carved. They continued to be used until at least the Coronation Banquet for Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1903; among other sculptures every guest was given a sugar crown to take away.

=== Modern history ===

In August 1492, Christopher Columbus collected sugar cane samples in La Gomera in the Canary Islands, and introduced it to the New World. The cuttings were planted and the first sugar-cane harvest in Hispaniola took place in 1501. Many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane-sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam. It took until 1600 for Brazilian sugar production to exceed that of São Tomé, which was the main center of sugar production in sixteenth century.
Sugar was a luxury in Europe until the early 19th century, when it became more widely available, due to the rise of beet sugar in Prussia, and later in France under Napoleon. Beet sugar was a German invention, since, in 1747, Andreas Sigismund Marggraf announced the discovery of sugar in beets and devised a method using alcohol to extract it. Marggraf&#x27;s student, Franz Karl Achard, devised an economical industrial method to extract the sugar in its pure form in the late 18th century. Achard first produced beet sugar in 1783 in Kaulsdorf, and in 1801, the world&#x27;s first beet sugar production facility was established in Cunern, Silesia (then part of Prussia, now Poland). The works of Marggraf and Achard were the starting point for the sugar industry in Europe, and for the modern sugar industry in general, since sugar was no longer a luxury product and a product almost only produced in warmer climates.

Sugar became highly popular and by the 19th century, was found in every household. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient resulted in major economic and social changes. Demand drove, in part, the colonization of tropical islands and areas where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing facilities could be successful. World consumption increased more than 100 times from 1850 to 2000, led by Britain, where it increased from about 2 pounds per head per year in 1650 to 90 pounds by the early 20th century. In the late 18th century Britain consumed about half the sugar which reached Europe.

After slavery was abolished, the demand for workers in European colonies in the Caribbean was filled by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent. Millions of enslaved or indentured laborers were brought to various European colonies in the Americas, Africa and Asia (as a result of demand in Europe for among other commodities, sugar), influencing the ethnic mixture of numerous nations around the globe.

Sugar also led to some industrialization of areas where sugar cane was grown. For example, in the 1790s Lieutenant J. Paterson, of the Bengal Presidency promoted to the British parliament the idea that sugar cane could grow in British India, where it had started, with many advantages and at less expense than in the West Indies. As a result, sugar factories were established in Bihar in eastern India. During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar-beet production increased in continental Europe because of the difficulty of importing sugar when shipping was subject to blockade. By 1880 the sugar beet was the main source of sugar in Europe. It was also cultivated in Lincolnshire and other parts of England, although the United Kingdom continued to import the main part of its sugar from its colonies.

Until the late nineteenth century, sugar was purchased in loaves, which had to be cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to produce sugar in cube form was Jakob Christof Rad, director of a sugar refinery in Dačice. In 1841, he produced the first sugar cube in the world. He began sugar-cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on 23 January 1843. Henry Tate of Tate &amp; Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar-cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.

Sugar was rationed during World War I, though it was said that &quot;No previous war in history has been fought so largely on sugar and so little on alcohol&quot;, and more sharply during World War II. Rationing led to the development and use of various artificial sweeteners.

== Chemistry ==

Scientifically, &quot;sugar&quot; loosely refers to a number of carbohydrates, such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or oligosaccharides. Monosaccharides are also called &quot;simple sugars&quot;, the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to with n between 3 and 7 (deoxyribose being an exception). Glucose has the molecular formula . The names of typical sugars end with -&quot;ose&quot;, as in &quot;glucose&quot; and &quot;fructose&quot;. Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of carbohydrates soluble in water. The acyclic mono- and disaccharides contain either aldehyde groups or ketone groups. These carbon-oxygen double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds with the resultant loss of a molecule of water () per bond.

Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch or cellulose). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.

=== Natural polymers ===

Biopolymers of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose () or (as in cane and beet) sucrose (). Monosaccharides may be further converted into structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and pectin for cell wall construction or into energy reserves in the form of storage polysaccharides such as starch or inulin. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical energy stored by cells, and can be converted to other types of energy. Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though ruminants can do so with the help of symbiotic bacteria in their gut. DNA and RNA are built up of the monosaccharides deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. Deoxyribose has the formula and ribose the formula .

=== Flammability and heat response ===

Because sugars burn easily when exposed to flame, the handling of sugars risks dust explosion. The risk of explosion is higher when the sugar has been milled to superfine texture, such as for use in chewing gum. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 36, and destroyed most of the refinery, was caused by the ignition of sugar dust.

In its culinary use, exposing sugar to heat causes caramelization. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.

== Types ==

=== Monosaccharides ===

Fructose, galactose, and glucose are all simple sugars, monosaccharides, with the general formula C6H12O6. They have five hydroxyl groups (−OH) and a carbonyl group (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in water. They each exist as several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left.

* Fructose, or fruit sugar, occurs naturally in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey and is the sweetest of the sugars. It is one of the components of sucrose or table sugar. It is used as a high-fructose syrup, which is manufactured from hydrolyzed corn starch that has been processed to yield corn syrup, with enzymes then added to convert part of the glucose into fructose.
* Galactose generally does not occur in the free state but is a constituent with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. It is less sweet than glucose. It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups.
* Glucose occurs naturally in fruits and plant juices and is the primary product of photosynthesis. Starch is converted into glucose during digestion, and glucose is the form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. Although in principle there are two enantiomers of glucose (mirror images one of the other), naturally occurring glucose is D-glucose. This is also called dextrose, or &quot;grape sugar&quot; because drying grape juice produces crystals of dextrose that can be sieved from the other components. Glucose syrup is a liquid form of glucose that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis. For example, corn syrup, which is produced commercially by breaking down maize starch, is one common source of purified dextrose. However, dextrose is naturally present in many unprocessed, whole foods, including honey and fruits such as grapes.

=== Disaccharides ===

Lactose, maltose, and sucrose are all compound sugars, disaccharides, with the general formula . They are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.

* Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is formed by the combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose.
* Maltose is formed during the germination of certain grains, the most notable being barley, which is converted into malt, the source of the sugar&#x27;s name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.
* Sucrose is found in the stems of sugarcane and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.

== Production ==

Due to rising demand, sugar production in general increased some 14% over the period 2009 to 2018. The largest importers were China, Indonesia, and the United States.

===Sugar===
In 2022–2023 world production of sugar was 186 million tonnes, and in 2023–2024 an estimated 194 million tonnes — a surplus of 5 million tonnes, according to Ragus.

=== Sugarcane ===

Sugar cane accounted for around 21% of the global crop production over the 2000–2021 period. The Americas was the leading region in the production of sugar cane (52% of the world total).
Global production of sugarcane in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, with Brazil producing 40% of the world total and India 20% (table).

Sugarcane is any of several species, or their hybrids, of giant grasses in the genus &quot;Saccharum&quot; in the family Poaceae. They have been cultivated in tropical climates in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia over centuries for the sucrose found in their stems.

Sugar cane requires a frost-free climate with sufficient rainfall during the growing season to make full use of the plant&#x27;s substantial growth potential. The crop is harvested mechanically or by hand, chopped into lengths and conveyed rapidly to the processing plant (commonly known as a sugar mill) where it is either milled and the juice extracted with water or extracted by diffusion. The juice is clarified with lime and heated to destroy enzymes. The resulting thin syrup is concentrated in a series of evaporators, after which further water is removed. The resulting supersaturated solution is seeded with sugar crystals, facilitating crystal formation and drying. Molasses is a by-product of the process and the fiber from the stems, known as bagasse, is burned to provide energy for the sugar extraction process. The crystals of raw sugar have a sticky brown coating and either can be used as they are, can be bleached by sulfur dioxide, or can be treated in a carbonatation process to produce a whiter product. About of irrigation water is needed for every of sugar produced.

=== Sugar beet ===

In 2020, global production of sugar beets was 253 million tonnes, led by Russia with 13% of the world total (table).

Sugar beet became a major source of sugar in the 19th century when methods for extracting the sugar became available. It is a biennial plant, a cultivated variety of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; in the family Amaranthaceae, the tuberous root of which contains a high proportion of sucrose. It is cultivated as a root crop in temperate regions with adequate rainfall and requires a fertile soil. The crop is harvested mechanically in the autumn and the crown of leaves and excess soil removed. The roots do not deteriorate rapidly and may be left in the field for some weeks before being transported to the processing plant where the crop is washed and sliced, and the sugar extracted by diffusion. Milk of lime is added to the raw juice with calcium carbonate. After water is evaporated by boiling the syrup under a vacuum, the syrup is cooled and seeded with sugar crystals. The white sugar that crystallizes can be separated in a centrifuge and dried, requiring no further refining.

=== Refining ===

Refined sugar is made from raw sugar that has undergone a refining process to remove the molasses. Raw sugar is sucrose which is extracted from sugarcane or sugar beet. While raw sugar can be consumed, the refining process removes unwanted tastes and results in refined sugar or white sugar.

The sugar may be transported in bulk to the country where it will be used and the refining process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners&#x27; molasses.

The International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis sets standards for the measurement of the purity of refined sugar, known as ICUMSA numbers; lower numbers indicate a higher level of purity in the refined sugar.

Refined sugar is widely used for industrial needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level of purity associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher purity of sugar.

== Forms and uses ==

=== Crystal size ===

* Coarse-grain sugar, also known as sanding sugar, composed of reflective crystals with grain size of about 1 to 3 mm, similar to kitchen salt. Used atop baked products and candies, it will not dissolve when subjected to heat and moisture.
* Granulated sugar (about 0.6 mm crystals), also known as table sugar or regular sugar, is used at the table, to sprinkle on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). It is also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.
* Milled sugars such as powdered sugar (icing sugar) are ground to a fine powder. They are used for dusting foods and in baking and confectionery.
* Screened sugars such as caster sugar are crystalline products separated according to the size of the grains. They are used for decorative table sugars, for blending in dry mixes and in baking and confectionery.

=== Shapes ===

* Cube sugar (sometimes called sugar lumps) are white or brown granulated sugars lightly steamed and pressed together in block shape. They are used to sweeten drinks.
* Sugarloaf was the usual cone-form in which refined sugar was produced and sold until the late 19th century.

===Brown sugars===

Brown sugars are granulated sugars, either containing residual molasses, or with the grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light- or dark-colored sugar such as muscovado and turbinado. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and toffees. Their darkness is due to the amount of molasses they contain. They may be classified based on their darkness or country of origin.

=== Liquid sugars ===

* Syrups are thick, viscous liquids consisting primarily of a solution of sugar in water. They are used in the food processing of a wide range of products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.
** Inverted sugar syrup, commonly known as invert syrup or invert sugar, is a mixture of two simple sugars—glucose and fructose—that is made by heating granulated sugar in water. It is used in breads, cakes, and beverages for adjusting sweetness, aiding moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars.
* Molasses and treacle are obtained by removing sugar from sugarcane or sugar beet juice, as a byproduct of sugar production. They may be blended with the above-mentioned syrups to enhance sweetness and used in a range of baked goods and confectionery including toffees and licorice.
* In winemaking, fruit sugars are converted into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit has a low sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.

=== Other sweeteners ===

* Low-calorie sweeteners are often made of maltodextrin with added sweeteners. Maltodextrin is an easily digestible synthetic polysaccharide consisting of short chains of three or more glucose molecules and is made by the partial hydrolysis of starch. Strictly, maltodextrin is not classified as sugar as it contains more than two glucose molecules, although its structure is similar to maltose, a molecule composed of two joined glucose molecules.
* Polyols are sugar alcohols and are used in chewing gums where a sweet flavor is required that lasts for a prolonged time in the mouth.

== Consumption ==

Worldwide sugar provides 10% of the daily calories (based on a 2000 kcal diet). In 1750, the average Briton got 72 calories a day from sugar. In 1913, this had risen to 395. In 2015, sugar still provided around 14% of the calories in British diets. According to one source, per capita consumption of sugar in 2016 was highest in the United States, followed by Germany and the Netherlands.

== Nutrition and flavor ==


Brown and white granulated sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, with less than 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar contains a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.

== Health effects ==

=== Genera ===

High sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefit, and in particular is associated with a risk of cardiometabolic health detriments.

=== Sugar industry funding and health information ===

Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have sought to influence medical research and public health recommendations, with substantial and largely clandestine spending documented from the 1960s to 2016. The results of research on the health effects of sugary food and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has financial ties to the food and drink industry. A 2013 medical review concluded that &quot;unhealthy commodity industries should have no role in the formation of national or international NCD [non-communicable disease] policy&quot;. Similar efforts to steer coverage of sugar-related health information have been made in popular media, including news media and social media.

=== Obesity and metabolic syndrome ===

A 2003 technical report by the World Health Organization (WHO) provides evidence that high intake of sugary drinks (including fruit juice) increases the risk of obesity by adding to overall energy intake. By itself, sugar is doubtfully a factor causing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Meta-analysis showed that excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome – including weight gain and obesity – in adults and children.

=== Cancer ===

Sugar consumption does not directly cause cancer. Cancer Council Australia have stated that &quot;there is no evidence that consuming sugar makes cancer cells grow faster or cause cancer&quot;. There is an indirect relationship between sugar consumption and obesity-related cancers through increased risk of excess body weight.

The American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund recommend that people limit sugar consumption.

There is a popular misconception that cancer can be treated by reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake to supposedly &quot;starve&quot; tumours. In reality, the health of people with cancer is best served by maintaining a healthy diet.

=== Cognition ===

Despite some studies suggesting that sugar consumption causes hyperactivity, the quality of evidence is low and it is generally accepted within the scientific community that the notion of children&#x27;s &#x27;sugar rush&#x27; is a myth. A 2019 meta-analysis found that sugar consumption does not improve mood, but can lower alertness and increase fatigue within an hour of consumption. One review of low-quality studies of children consuming high amounts of energy drinks showed association with higher rates of unhealthy behaviors, including smoking and excessive alcohol use, and with hyperactivity and insomnia, although such effects could not be specifically attributed to sugar over other components of those drinks such as caffeine.

=== Tooth decay ===

The WHO, Action on Sugar and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) consider free sugars an essential dietary factor in the development of dental caries. WHO have stated that &quot;dental caries can be prevented by avoiding dietary free sugars&quot;.

A review of human studies showed that the incidence of caries is lower when sugar intake is less than 10% of total energy consumed. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with an increased risk of tooth decay.

=== Nutritional displacement ===

The &quot;empty calories&quot; argument states that a diet high in added (or &#x27;free&#x27;) sugars will reduce consumption of foods that contain essential nutrients. This nutrient displacement occurs if sugar makes up more than 25% of daily energy intake, a proportion associated with poor diet quality and risk of obesity. Displacement may occur at lower levels of consumption.

=== Recommended dietary intake ===

The WHO recommends that both adults and children reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, and suggests a reduction to below 5%. &quot;Free sugars&quot; include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods, and sugars found in fruit juice and concentrates, as well as in honey and syrups. According to the WHO, &quot;[t]hese recommendations were based on the totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight (low and moderate quality evidence) and dental caries (very low and moderate quality evidence).&quot;

On 20 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced changes to the Nutrition Facts panel displayed on all foods, to be effective by July 2018. New to the panel is a requirement to list &quot;added sugars&quot; by weight and as a percent of Daily Value (DV). For vitamins and minerals, the intent of DVs is to indicate how much should be consumed. For added sugars, the guidance is that 100% DV should not be exceeded. 100% DV is defined as 50 grams. For a person consuming 2000 calories a day, 50 grams is equal to 200 calories and thus 10% of total calories—the same guidance as the WHO. To put this in context, most cans of soda contain 39 grams of sugar. In the United States, a government survey on food consumption in 2013–2014 reported that, for men and women aged 20 and older, the average total sugar intakes—naturally occurring in foods and added—were, respectively, 125 and 99 g/day.

== Measurements ==

Various culinary sugars have different densities due to differences in particle size and inclusion of moisture. The &quot;Engineering Resources – Bulk Density Chart&quot; published in &quot;Powder and Bulk&quot; gives values for bulk densities:
* Beet sugar 0.80 g/mL
* Dextrose sugar 0.62 g/mL ( = 620 kg/m^3)
* Granulated sugar 0.70 g/mL
* Powdered sugar 0.56 g/mL
== Society and culture ==

Manufacturers of sugary products, such as soft drinks and candy, and the Sugar Research Foundation have been accused of trying to influence consumers and medical associations in the 1960s and 1970s by creating doubt about the potential health hazards of sucrose overconsumption, while promoting saturated fat as the main dietary risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. In 2016, the criticism led to recommendations that diet policymakers emphasize the need for high-quality research that accounts for multiple biomarkers on development of cardiovascular diseases.

<text>Salma Valgarma Hayek Pinault ( , ; ; born September 2, 1966) is a Mexican and American actress and film producer. She began her career in Mexico with starring roles in the telenovela &quot;Teresa&quot; (1989–1991) as well as the romantic drama &quot;Midaq Alley&quot; (1995). She soon established herself in Hollywood with appearances in films such as &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995), &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996), &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (1999), and &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999).

Hayek&#x27;s portrayal of painter Frida Kahlo in the biopic &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), which she also produced, made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In subsequent years, Hayek focused more on producing while starring in the action-centered pictures &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003), &quot;After the Sunset&quot; (2004) and &quot;Bandidas&quot; (2006). She achieved further commercial success with the comedies &quot;Grown Ups&quot; (2010), &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; (2017), and lent her voice for the animated &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011), &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016) and &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; (2022). She also earned critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; (2015), &quot;Beatriz at Dinner&quot; (2017) and &quot;House of Gucci&quot; (2021). She played Ajak in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Eternals&quot; (2021), which emerged as her highest-grossing live action film.

Hayek&#x27;s directing, producing and acting work on television has earned her four Emmy Awards nominations. She won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children Special for &quot;The Maldonado Miracle&quot; (2004) and received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations, one for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and the other for Outstanding Comedy Series, for her work on the ABC television comedy-drama &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; (2006–2010). She also produced and played Minerva Mirabal in the Showtime film &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot; (2001) and guest-starred on the NBC comedy series &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2009–2013).

As a public figure, Hayek has been cited as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most powerful and influential Latina actresses as well as one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women by various media outlets. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023. In 2021, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is married to business magnate François-Henri Pinault, with whom she has a daughter.

==Early life==
Salma Hayek was born in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. Her father, Sami Hayek Domínguez, is of Lebanese descent. His ancestors hail from the city of Baabdat, Lebanon, a city Salma and her father visited in 2015 to promote her movie &quot;Kahlil Gibran&#x27;s The Prophet&quot;. He owns an industrial-equipment firm and is an oil company executive in Mexico; he once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos. Her mother, Diana Jiménez Medina, is an opera singer and talent scout; she is of Spanish descent. While visiting Madrid in an interview in 2015 with &quot;Un Nuevo Día&quot;, Hayek described herself as fifty-percent Lebanese and fifty-percent Spanish saying that her grandmother/maternal great-grandparents were from Spain. Her younger brother, Sami, is a furniture designer.

Hayek was raised in a wealthy, devout Catholic family, and at age 12 opted to study at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grand Coteau, Louisiana. In school, she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She attended university at the Universidad Iberoamericana studying international relations. In a 2011 interview with &quot;V&quot; magazine, Hayek mentioned that she was once an illegal immigrant in the United States, although it was not for a long period of time.

==Career==
===Early roles in Mexico (1988–1994)===
Hayek&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the television series in &quot;Un Nuevo Amanecer&quot; (1988), which earned her the TVyNovelas Award for Best Debut Actress. Televisa subsequently selected Hayek, who was 23 at the time, to play the title role in &quot;Teresa&quot; (1989–1991), a successful Mexican telenovela that made her a star in Mexico. The series ran for two years and 125 episodes, and earned her the 1990 TVyNovelas Award for Best Female Revelation.

Determined to pursue a film career in Hollywood, Hayek moved to Los Angeles in 1991 following the conclusion of &quot;Teresa&quot;. With limited fluency in English and dyslexia, she soon enrolled in English lessons and studied acting under Stella Adler. Hayek initially struggled with the lack of acting job offers after moving to the United States, recalling that &quot;there was no industry or parts for Latin women&quot;, and was once even told that her accent would &quot;make moviegoers think of housekeepers&quot;. During this period, she secured guest-spots in television series such as &quot;Dream On&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Sinbad Show&quot; (1993) as well as supporting roles in the drama &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot; (1993), and the made-for-Showtime thriller &quot;Roadracers&quot; (1994), her first collaboration with director Robert Rodriguez.

In 1994, Hayek was cast as Alma, a poverty-stricken young woman who becomes a sex worker, in Jorge Fons&#x27;s drama &quot;El callejón de los milagros&quot; (&quot;Miracle Alley&quot;), which was based on the 1940s eponymous novel by Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz and translated from Cairo to Mexico City. The film was the subject of critical acclaim, reportedly won more awards than any other movie in the history of Mexican cinema, and earned Hayek a nomination for the Ariel Award for Best Actress.

===Hollywood breakthrough (1995–2001)===

In 1995, Robert Rodriguez and his co-producer and then-wife, Elizabeth Avellan, cast Hayek opposite Antonio Banderas in the starring role of self-confident and feisty Carolina in &quot;Desperado&quot;, her breakout film. Describing the film&#x27;s process as &quot;grueling&quot;, Hayek had to audition several times for Rodriguez before landing the part, and a love scene in the script proved particularly difficult for her to film because she did not want to be nude on camera. She once remarked: &quot;It took eight hours [to film] instead of an hour&quot;. Budgeted at $7 million, &quot;Desperado&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $25.4 million in the United States. A brief role as a vampire queen followed in Rodriguez&#x27;s cult horror film &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996), in which she performed an erotic table-top snake dance. She also appeared in the 1996 drama &quot;Follow Me Home&quot; and the cop comedy &quot;Fled&quot;.

Hayek next starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; (1997) as a photographer in an on-and-off relationship with a New York City architect, played by Matthew Perry. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and described it as &quot;a sweet, entertaining retread of an ancient formula&quot;, elevated by good performances (particularly Hayek&#x27;s) and an insightful &quot;level of observation and human comedy&quot;. &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; was a moderate commercial success and earned Hayek an ALMA Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film. In another romantic comedy, &quot;Breaking Up&quot; (also 1997), she and Russell Crowe portrayed a couple whose relationship leads to an out-of-the-blue marriage. Ken Eisner of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek make attractive leads, but they have neither the marquee power nor the requisite chemistry to keep &quot;Breaking Up&quot; from getting left at the altar of general distribution.&quot; Indeed, the film was distributed for selected markets in the United States only.

In 1998, Hayek played an aspiring young singer in the 1970s New York City nightlife scene in Mark Christopher&#x27;s drama &quot;54&quot;, a doughnut shop waitress in Dan Ireland&#x27;s dramedy &quot;The Velocity of Gary&quot; and a nurse in Rodriguez&#x27;s supernatural horror film &quot;The Faculty&quot;. In 1999, Hayek was unorthodoxly cast in Kevin Smith&#x27;s religious satire &quot;Dogma&quot; as Serendipity, &quot;the [Muse] who throughout history inspired all the geniuses of art and music, like Mozart and Michelangelo, and never got any of the credit&quot;. She also portrayed the alleged daughter of a kidnapped scientist alongside Will Smith in the period Western &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. &quot;Dogma&quot; was well received by critics and audiences, but &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; proved a commercial failure despite being one of the most expensive films ever made at the time of its release.

Hayek founded her production company, Ventanarosa, in 1999, through which she produces film and television projects. Her first feature as a producer was &quot;El Coronel No Tiene Quien Le Escriba&quot; (1999), Mexico&#x27;s official selection for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. In 2000, Hayek had an uncredited role in &quot;Traffic&quot;, and played an aspiring actress in Mike Figgis&#x27; experimental film &quot;Timecode&quot;, a waitress in the Spanish drama &quot;Living It Up&quot;, and a cop and Playboy model in the heist comedy &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;. She also produced and starred in the television film &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot; (2001), based on the book by Julia Álvarez book about the Mirabal sisters. Hayek played one of the sisters, Minerva, and Edward James Olmos played the Dominican dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, whom the sisters opposed.

===Worldwide recognition (2002–2009)===
In Julie Taymor&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Frida&quot; (2002), Hayek served as a producer and starred as surrealist painter Frida Kahlo. She became interested in the role several years prior to commencing production for the film, having &quot;been fascinated by Kahlo&#x27;s work from the time she was 13 or 14&quot;, although not immediately a fan: &quot;At that age I did not like her work [...] I found it ugly and grotesque. But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work. There was a lot of passion and depth. Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor. I think what draws me to her is what [husband] Diego saw in her. She was a fighter. Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego&#x27;s infidelities. But she wasn&#x27;t crushed by anything&quot;. She was so determined to play the role that she sought out Dolores Olmedo Patino, longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and, after his death, administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera&#x27;s art, which Rivera had &quot;willed [...] to the Mexican people&quot;, bequeathing the trust to Olmedo. Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo&#x27;s paintings from Kahlo and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. Upon its release, &quot;Frida&quot; was a critical darling and an arthouse success. In his review for the film, David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; concluded: &quot;Smart, willful, and perverse, this Frida is nobody&#x27;s servant, and the tiny Hayek plays her with head held high&quot;. Her portrayal of Kahlo made her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and earned her Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and British Academy Film Award nominations for Best Actress.

In 2003, Hayek produced and directed &quot;The Maldonado Miracle&quot;, a Showtime film based on the book of the same name, for which she won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Children Special, reunited with Robert Rodriguez for &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, and made an appearance in the documentary &quot;V-Day: Until the Violence Stops&quot;. &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, which made $98.2 million worldwide, was the final film of the &quot;Mariachi Trilogy&quot; and featured Hayek reprising her role from &quot;Desperado&quot;.

In Brett Ratner&#x27;s action comedy &quot;After the Sunset&quot; (2004), Hayek starred as the girlfriend of a master thief, with Pierce Brosnan. A box office flop, the film received largely negative reviews from critics. James Berardinelli found the film to be &quot;a mess, but [it&#x27;s] a fun, breezy mess&quot;, criticizing the overall heist and weak characterization but gave praise to the quick pacing chemistry between Brosnan and Hayek. In 2005, she served as a member of the 58th Cannes Film Festival jury, co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Julianne Moore in Oslo, Norway, and directed a music video for Prince, titled &quot;Te Amo Corazon&quot; (&quot;I love you, sweetheart&quot;) that featured Mía Maestro.

Hayek appeared alongside her good friend Penélope Cruz in the 2006 Western comedy &quot;Bandidas&quot;, portraying two women who become a bank robbing duo in an effort to combat a ruthless enforcer terrorizing their town. Randy Cordova of the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; said the film &quot;sports&quot; Hayek and her co-star Penélope Cruz as the &quot;lusty dream team&quot; and that they were the &quot;marketing fantasy&quot; for the film. &quot;Bandidas&quot; was followed by &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, a period romance set in Los Angeles based on a John Fante novel and co-starring Colin Farrell. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found &quot;something a little forced in both lead performances&quot;, and with a limited theatrical release, the film was not a financial success. Her last film of 2006 was &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot;, a neo-noir crime drama chronicling the notorious &quot;lonely hearts killers&quot; of the 1940s, Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, in which Hayek played Beck, with Jared Leto taking on the role of Fernandez. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but the cast garnered praise. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated: &quot;When Hayek and Leto are onscreen, you do not look away.&quot;

Hayek served as an executive producer for the American television series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; (2006–2010), after adapting the story for American television with Ben Silverman, who acquired the rights and scripts from the Colombian telenovela &quot;Yo Soy Betty La Fea&quot; in 2001. Originally intended as a half-hour sitcom for NBC in 2004, the project would later be picked up by ABC for the 2006–2007 season with Silvio Horta also producing. She guest-starred on the series as Sofia Reyes, a magazine editor. &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; was a success with critics and audiences, won a Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Series in 2007, and earned Hayek nominations for both Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Comedy Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. After finalizing negotiations with MGM to become the CEO of her own Latin-themed film production company, Ventanarosa, in 2007, Hayek signed a two-year deal with ABC for Ventanarosa to develop projects for the network.

In 2007, Hayek made a cameo appearance, as a nurse singing a cover of The Beatles song &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot;, in Julie Taymor&#x27;s jukebox musical romantic drama &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. The role of Madame Truska, a woman who can grow an indestructible beard, in &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot; (2009), was Hayek&#x27;s first acting project following the birth of her daughter. She characterized the film, which was an adaptation of the book series &quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot; by author Darren Shan, as &quot;a little bit of hard work. But it&#x27;s not like I have to be emotionally devastated for months&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Screen Rant felt that Hayek is &quot;fun as the bearded lady Madame Truska but [...] is unable to single-handedly elevate the material&quot;.

===Continued commercial success (2010–2017)===
In 2010, Hayek played a fashion designer and the wife of a Hollywood talent agent (Adam Sandler) in the comedy &quot;Grown Ups&quot; which, despite a negative critical reception, made $271.4 million globally. She is the voice of Kitty Softpaws, a street-savvy Tuxedo cat, alongside Antonio Banderas in &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011). A spin-off of the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; received positive reviews from critics, grossed $554.9 million at the box office, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 84th Academy Awards. In 2011, she also obtained Hispanic roles in two international productions —a dancer in the French drama &quot;Americano&quot; and the wife of a former advertising executive in the Spanish &quot;As Luck Would Have It&quot;— which earned her nominations for the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actress and the Goya Award for Best Actress, respectively.

In 2012, Hayek directed Jada Pinkett Smith in the music video &quot;Nada Se Compara&quot;, lent her voice for Peter Lord&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!&quot;, and played a cartel leader in Oliver Stone&#x27;s action film &quot;Savages&quot; and a school nurse in Frank Coraci&#x27;s comedy &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot;. She reprised her role in &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; (2013) which, like the first film, was a commercial success despite a negative critical response. 

Hayek served as a producer and provided her voice for the character of Kamila, a widowed mother, in &quot;The Prophet&quot; (2014), adapted from the 1923 book by Kahlil Gibran. Describing the film as a &quot;love letter to my heritage&quot;, Hayek said it helped her explore her relationship with her late grandfather, who was a fan of the book, and remarked: &quot;Between all the connections of our ancestors and the memories of the ones that are no longer with us, I hope they are proud of this film because I did it also for them&quot;. In 2014, she made a brief appearance in James Bobin’s comedy sequel &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, starred as a woman forced into sexual slavery in Joe Lynch&#x27;s action drama &quot;Everly&quot;, and reunited with Pierce Brosnam to play his love interest in Tom Vaughan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Some Kind of Beautiful&quot;. &quot;Everly&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Beautiful &quot; were both distributed for online markets and poorly received; while critics noted that the former &quot;benefits from Joe Lynch&#x27;s stylish direction and Salma Hayek&#x27;s starring work, but it&#x27;s too thinly written and sleazily violent to fully recommend&quot;, Rotten Tomatoes gave the latter a 6% rating based on 34 reviews.

In &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; (2015), a European fantasy film directed and written by Matteo Garrone, Hayek appeared as the 17th-century Queen of Longtrellis. A screen adaptation based on collections of tales by Italian poet and courtier Giambattista Basile, the film competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 68th Cannes Film Festival. In 2016, Hayek voiced the role of Teresa del Taco in &quot;Sausage Party&quot;, an adult animated film she described as &quot;the naughtiest thing I&#x27;ve ever done. I never thought I&#x27;d ever say some of those things out loud. But, I had a lot of fun [...] It&#x27;s a different kind of crazy&quot;. The highest grossing R-rated animated film of all time, &quot;Sausage Party&quot; grossed $140.4 million worldwide.

Hayek took on the role of a holistic medicine practitioner who attends a wealthy client&#x27;s dinner party in Miguel Arteta&#x27;s drama &quot;Beatriz at Dinner&quot; (2017), which Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; called a &quot;small-scale but elegantly deft squirmfest that features a luminous performance” by the actress. That role earned Hayek an Independent Spirit Film Award nomination for Best Female Lead. The comedy &quot;How to Be a Latin Lover&quot; (2017) was a sleeper hit upon its release and featured Hayek as the estranged sister of a man who has made a career of seducing rich older women. Her last film outing of 2017 was Patrick Hughes&#x27;s action comedy &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;, in which she starred as the wife of a convicted hitman, opposite Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. The film made an impressive $176.6 million globally.

===Recent roles (2018–present)===
Hayek was cast as Eva Torres, a high-frequency trading executive, alongside Jesse Eisenberg and Alexander Skarsgård, in Kim Nguyen&#x27;s tech drama &quot;The Hummingbird Project&quot; (2018), and as Nancy Teagarten, one half of a couple experiencing a series of financial crises, with Alec Baldwin, in Fred Wolf&#x27;s comedy &quot;Drunk Parents&quot; (2019). In 2020, Hayek appeared as a cosmetics mogul in Miguel Arteta&#x27;s comedy &quot;Like a Boss&quot;, with Rose Byrne and Tiffany Haddish, and the alternative wife of a man in Sally Potter’s drama &quot;The Roads Not Taken&quot;, with Javier Bardem and Elle Fanning.

The drama &quot;Bliss&quot; (2021), which starred Hayek as a homeless woman befriending a recently divorced man (Owen Wilson), was released on Amazon Prime Video. She next reunited with director Patrick Hughes and actors Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson in &quot;Hitman&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;, the sequel for the 2017 film &quot;The Hitman’s Bodyguard&quot;, which was released on June 16, 2021, to mediocre reviews. John Defore of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, however, praised Hayek’s &quot;foul-mouthed&quot; portrayal, writing: &quot;The one smart thing the film does is promote Salma Hayek, as the eponymous spouse of Samuel L. Jackson’s hitman, from the small but scene-stealing role she played in the first film. […] At least we can appreciate Hayek’s enthusiasm for the over-the-top role&quot;. Unlike the first film, &quot;Hitman&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; had lackluster box office returns.

Hayek portrayed Ajak, the wise and spiritual leader of the titular group, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe picture &quot;Eternals&quot;, directed by Chloé Zhao, who &quot;personally selected&quot; her for the role. Initially surprised by Marvel&#x27;s interest on her casting, Hayek described her involvement in the film as &quot;empowering&quot; and recalled getting &quot;emotional&quot; upon seeing her character&#x27;s superhero costume, stating: &quot;It was because it means so much to so many people that, to think that for a Mexican girl —a Mexican woman in her 50s— was able to be a superhero. I felt a lot of pride to have my superhero outfit on. It meant something&quot;. Hayek, who is of both Spanish and Lebanese descent, subsequently became the first Arab actress with a main role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film, released in the United States on November 5, 2021, generated a divergent critical response and made $401 million worldwide. She has since signed a deal to star in multiple Marvel Cinematic Universe projects. Her last film of 2021 was Ridley Scott&#x27;s biographical crime drama &quot;House of Gucci&quot;, in which she played the friend and confidante of Patrizia Reggiani, Giuseppina “Pina” Auriemma, alongside Lady Gaga as Reggiani, Adam Driver, and her &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot; co-star Jared Leto. Hayek then reprised her role as Kitty Softpaws in &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;, which received critical acclaim, grossed $485.3 million, and like its predecessor was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

In June 2022, Hayek was cast in Angelina Jolie’s upcoming film, &quot;Without Blood&quot;, based on the bestselling Italian novel by Alessandro Baricco. It was filmed in Rome, Apulia, and Basilicata. Hayek will star in the film alongside Demián Bichir.

In 2023, she appeared as herself in the episode &quot;Joan Is Awful&quot; of the Netflix anthology &quot;Black Mirror.&quot;

===Advocacy===
Hayek&#x27;s charitable work includes increasing awareness on violence against women and discrimination against immigrants. On July 19, 2005, Hayek testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary supporting reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. In February 2006, she donated $25,000 to a Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, shelter for battered women and another $50,000 to Monterrey based anti-domestic violence groups. She is a board member of V-Day, the charity founded by playwright Eve Ensler. While Hayek previously stated that she is not a feminist, she later revised her stance, stating: &quot;I am a feminist because a lot of amazing women have made me who I am today. [...] But – it should not be just because I am a woman&quot;.

Hayek also advocates breastfeeding. During a 2009 UNICEF fact-finding trip to Sierra Leone, she breastfed a hungry week-old baby whose mother could not produce milk. Hayek said she did it to reduce the stigma associated with breastfeeding and to encourage infant nutrition. In 2010, Hayek&#x27;s humanitarian work earned her a nomination for the VH1 Do Something Awards. In 2013, alongside Beyoncé and Frida Giannini, Hayek launched &quot;Chime for Change&quot;, a Gucci campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. For International Women&#x27;s Day 2014 Hayek was one of the artist signatories of Amnesty International&#x27;s letter, to then British Prime Minister David Cameron, campaigning for women&#x27;s rights in Afghanistan. Following her visit to Lebanon in 2015, Hayek criticized the discrimination against women there.

On December 13, 2017, Hayek published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating that she had been harassed and abused by film producer Harvey Weinstein during the production of &quot;Frida&quot;.

In 2019, the Pinault family pledged US$113 million to support the reconstruction efforts of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, following its destruction in a fire. In 2020, Hayek raised awareness through her Instagram for the disappearance of Vanessa Guillen.

Hayek has worked with the Procter &amp; Gamble Company and UNICEF to promote the funding (through disposable diaper sales) of vaccines against maternal and neonatal tetanus. She is a global spokesperson for the Pampers/UNICEF partnership to help raise awareness of the program. The partnership involves Procter &amp; Gamble donating the cost of one tetanus vaccination (approximately 24 cents) for every pack of Pampers sold.

In 2008, Hayek co-founded Juice Generation&#x27;s juice delivery program Cooler Cleanse. After writing the foreword to Juice Generation founder Eric Helms&#x27; 2014 book &quot;The Juice Generation: 100 Recipes for Fresh Juices and Superfood Smoothies&quot;, she and Helms launched the beauty subscription delivery service Blend It Yourself in 2017, based on Hayek&#x27;s personal beauty elixirs, which supplies subscribers with the prepared organic frozen smoothie and acai bowl ingredients.

In 2011, Hayek launched her own line of cosmetics, skincare, and haircare products called Nuance by Salma Hayek, to be sold at CVS stores in North America.

==Public image==

Early in her career, Hayek came to be regarded as a sex symbol, and most of her early films, it has been noted, such as the action-oriented &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;, and &quot;Fled&quot;, &quot;predominantly featured her in racy sex symbol type of roles&quot; and ultimately made Hayek a familiar face with mainstream audiences. Various media publications have cited her as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most beautiful actresses. &quot;People&quot; named her one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 1996, 2003 and 2008, &quot;Maxim&quot; ranked her 34th and 90th on their Hot 100 list in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and &quot;FHM&quot; included her on their 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2005 and 2006. A July 2007 poll by E-Poll Market Research found Hayek to be the &quot;sexiest celebrity&quot; among a group of 3,000 public figures, with 65 percent of respondents using the term &quot;sexy&quot; to describe her. The Armani dress Hayek wore to the 1997 Academy Awards was voted by E! Entertainment as one of the five most memorable in Oscar history.

From April 7 to June 18, 2006, the Blue Star Contemporary Art Center in San Antonio, Texas hosted an exhibition called &quot;Solamente Salma&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Only Salma&quot;), consisting of 16 portrait paintings by muralist George Yepes and filmmaker Robert Rodriguez of Hayek as the Aztec goddess Itzpapalotl. In July 2007, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked Hayek 4th in their Latino Power 50, a list of the most powerful Latin members of Hollywood. In 2008, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award, in recognition of her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked her 17th in their list of the 25 Smartest People in TV.

Throughout her career, Hayek has graced the covers of numerous international magazines, including North America&#x27;s &quot;InStyle&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;; Britain&#x27;s &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; and &quot;Total Film&quot;; and France&#x27;s &quot;Entrevue&quot; and &quot;Madame Figaro&quot;. She was one of fifteen women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of &quot;British Vogue&quot;, by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

==Personal life==
Hayek is a naturalized United States citizen. She has studied at Ramtha&#x27;s School of Enlightenment and practices yoga. Hayek, who was raised Catholic, stated in a 2007 interview that she was no longer devout and did not believe in the Church, in part because she disagreed with practices such as its campaign against condoms in Africa, where she said AIDS and overpopulation were rampant, though she clarified that she still believed in Jesus Christ and God.

On March 9, 2007, Hayek confirmed her engagement to French billionaire and Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault as well as her pregnancy. She gave birth to their daughter on September 21, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. They were married on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2009 in Paris. On April 25, 2009, they renewed their vows in Venice, Italy.
