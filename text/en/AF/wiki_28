<text>Quinine is a medication used to treat malaria and babesiosis. This includes the treatment of malaria due to &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; that is resistant to chloroquine when artesunate is not available. While sometimes used for nocturnal leg cramps, quinine is not recommended for this purpose due to the risk of serious side effects. It can be taken by mouth or intravenously. Malaria resistance to quinine occurs in certain areas of the world. Quinine is also used as an ingredient in tonic water and other beverages to impart a bitter taste.
Common side effects include headache, ringing in the ears, vision issues, and sweating. More severe side effects include deafness, low blood platelets, and an irregular heartbeat. Use can make one more prone to sunburn. While it is unclear if use during pregnancy carries potential for fetal harm, treating malaria during pregnancy with quinine when appropriate is still recommended. Quinine is an alkaloid, a naturally occurring chemical compound. How it works as a medicine is not entirely clear.
Quinine was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of a cinchona tree, which is native to Peru, and its molecular formula was determined by Adolph Strecker in 1854. The class of chemical compounds to which it belongs is thus called the cinchona alkaloids. Bark extracts had been used to treat malaria since at least 1632 and it was introduced to Spain as early as 1636 by Jesuit missionaries returning from the New World. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Treatment of malaria with quinine marks the first known use of a chemical compound to treat an infectious disease.
== Uses ==

=== Medical ===
As of 2006, quinine is no longer recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a first-line treatment for malaria, because there are other substances that are equally effective with fewer side effects. They recommend that it be used only when artemisinins are not available. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis.

Quinine was frequently prescribed as an off-label treatment for leg cramps at night, but this has become less common since 2010 due to a warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that such practice is associated with life-threatening side effects. Quinine can also act as a competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that removes neurotransmitters from the brain. As an MAO inhibitor, it has potential to serve as a treatment for individuals with psychological disorders, similar to antidepressants that inhibit MAO.

====Available forms====
Quinine is a basic amine and is usually provided as a salt. Various existing preparations include the hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate and gluconate. In the United States, quinine sulfate is commercially available in 324 mg tablets under the brand name Qualaquin.

All quinine salts may be given orally or intravenously (IV); quinine gluconate may also be given intramuscularly (IM) or rectally (PR). The main problem with rectal administration is that the dose can be expelled before it is completely absorbed; in practice, this is corrected by giving a further half dose. No injectable preparation of quinine is licensed in the US; quinidine is used instead.

===Beverages===
Quinine is a flavor component of tonic water and bitter lemon soft drinks. On the soda gun behind many bars, tonic water is designated by the letter &quot;Q&quot; representing quinine.

Tonic water was initially marketed as a means of delivering quinine to consumers in order to offer anti-malarial protection. According to tradition, because of the bitter taste of anti-malarial quinine tonic, British colonials in India mixed it with gin to make it more palatable, thus creating the gin and tonic cocktail, which is still popular today. While it is possible to drink enough tonic water to temporarily achieve quinine levels that offer anti-malarial protection, it is not a sustainable long-term means of protection.

In France, quinine is an ingredient of an known as , or &quot;Cap Corse&quot;, and the wine-based Dubonnet. In Spain, quinine (also known as &quot;Peruvian bark&quot; for its origin from the native cinchona tree) is sometimes blended into sweet Malaga wine, which is then called &quot;Malaga Quina&quot;. In Italy, the traditional flavoured wine Barolo Chinato is infused with quinine and local herbs, and is served as a . In Britain, the company A.G. Barr uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and caffeinated beverage Irn-Bru. In Uruguay and Argentina, quinine is an ingredient of a PepsiCo tonic water named Paso de los Toros. In Denmark, it is used as an ingredient in the carbonated sports drink Faxe Kondi made by Royal Unibrew.

As a flavouring agent in drinks, quinine is limited to 83 ppm () in the United States, and in the European Union.

===Scientific===
Quinine (and quinidine) are used as the chiral moiety for the ligands used in Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation as well as for numerous other chiral catalyst backbones. Because of its relatively constant and well-known fluorescence quantum yield, quinine is used in photochemistry as a common fluorescence standard.

==Contraindications==
Because of the narrow difference between its therapeutic and toxic effects, quinine is a common cause of drug-induced disorders, including thrombocytopenia and thrombotic microangiopathy. Even from minor levels occurring in common beverages, quinine can have severe adverse effects involving multiple organ systems, among which are immune system effects and fever, hypotension, hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, liver toxicity, and blindness. In people with atrial fibrillation, conduction defects, or heart block, quinine can cause heart arrhythmias, and should be avoided.

Quinine can cause hemolysis in G6PD deficiency (an inherited deficiency), but this risk is small and the physician should not hesitate to use quinine in people with G6PD deficiency when there is no alternative.

While not necessarily an absolute contraindication, concomitant administration of quinine with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 may lead to higher than expected plasma concentrations of the drug, due to quinine&#x27;s strong inhibition of the enzyme.

==Adverse effects==
Quinine can cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening blood and cardiovascular reactions including low platelet count and hemolytic–uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP), long QT syndrome and other serious cardiac arrhythmias including &quot;torsades de pointes&quot;, blackwater fever, disseminated intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, and neutropenia. Some people who have developed TTP due to quinine have gone on to develop kidney failure. It can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock, urticaria, serious skin rashes, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, facial edema, bronchospasm, granulomatous hepatitis, and itchiness.

The most common adverse effects involve a group of symptoms called cinchonism, which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception. More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many people will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets). Other drugs, such as Fansidar (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with atovaquone), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.

Quinine has diverse unwanted interactions with numerous prescription drugs, such as potentiating the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. It is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs.

==Mechanism of action==

Quinine is used for its toxicity to the malarial pathogen, &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, by interfering with its ability to dissolve and metabolize hemoglobin. As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the precise mechanism of action of quinine has not been fully resolved, although in vitro studies indicate it inhibits nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and inhibits glycolysis in &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. The most widely accepted hypothesis of its action is based on the well-studied and closely related quinoline drug, chloroquine. This model involves the inhibition of hemozoin biocrystallization in the heme detoxification pathway, which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing their deaths. Quinine may target the malaria purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme.

==Chemistry==
The UV absorption of quinine peaks around 350 nm (in UVA). Fluorescent emission peaks at around 460 nm (bright blue/cyan hue). Quinine is highly fluorescent (quantum yield ~0.58) in 0.1 M sulfuric acid solution.

===Synthesis===

Cinchona trees remain the only economically practical source of quinine. However, under wartime pressure during World War II, research towards its synthetic production was undertaken. A formal chemical synthesis was accomplished in 1944 by American chemists R.B. Woodward and W.E. Doering. Since then, several more efficient quinine total syntheses have been achieved, but none of them can compete in economic terms with isolation of the alkaloid from natural sources. The first synthetic organic dye, mauveine, was discovered by William Henry Perkin in 1856 while he was attempting to synthesize quinine.

===Biosynthesis===

In the first step of quinine biosynthesis, the enzyme strictosidine synthase catalyzes a stereoselective Pictet–Spengler reaction between tryptamine and secologanin to yield strictosidine. Suitable modification of strictosidine leads to an aldehyde. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation would initially remove one carbon from the iridoid portion and produce corynantheal. Then the tryptamine side-chain were cleaved adjacent to the nitrogen, and this nitrogen was then bonded to the acetaldehyde function to yield cinchonaminal. Ring opening in the indole heterocyclic ring could generate new amine and keto functions. The new quinoline heterocycle would then be formed by combining this amine with the aldehyde produced in the tryptamine side-chain cleavage, giving cinchonidinone. For the last step, hydroxylation and methylation gives quinine.

===Catalysis===
Quinine and other &quot;Cinchona&quot; alkaloids can be used as catalysts for stereoselective reactions in organic synthesis. For example, the quinine-catalyzed Michael addition of a malononitrile to α,β-enones gives a high degree of sterechemical control.

==History==

Quinine was used as a muscle relaxant by the Quechua people, who are indigenous to Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, to halt shivering. The Quechua would mix the ground bark of cinchona trees with sweetened water to offset the bark&#x27;s bitter taste, thus producing something similar to tonic water.

Spanish Jesuit missionaries were the first to bring cinchona to Europe. The Spanish had observed the Quechua&#x27;s use of cinchona and were aware of the medicinal properties of cinchona bark by the 1570s or earlier: Nicolás Monardes (1571) and Juan Fragoso (1572) both described a tree, which was subsequently identified as the cinchona tree, whose bark was used to produce a drink to treat diarrhea. Quinine has been used in unextracted form by Europeans since at least the early 17th century.

A popular story of how it was brought to Europe by the Countess of Chinchon was debunked by medical historian Alec Haggis around 1941. During the 17th century, malaria was endemic to the swamps and marshes surrounding the city of Rome. It had caused the deaths of several popes, many cardinals and countless common Roman citizens. Most of the Catholic priests trained in Rome had seen malaria patients and were familiar with the shivering brought on by the phase of the disease.

The Jesuit Agostino Salumbrino (1564–1642), an apothecary by training who lived in Lima (now in present-day Peru), observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree to treat such shivering. While its effect in treating malaria (and malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from rigors, it was a successful medicine against malaria. At the first opportunity, Salumbrino sent a small quantity to Rome for testing as a malaria treatment. In the years that followed, cinchona bark, known as Jesuit&#x27;s bark or Peruvian bark, became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe. When King Charles II was cured of malaria at the end of the 17th Century with quinine, it became popular in London. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs took over.

The form of quinine most effective in treating malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. In 1820, French researchers Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou first isolated quinine from the bark of a tree in the genus &quot;Cinchona&quot; – probably &quot;Cinchona pubescens&quot; – and subsequently named the substance. The name was derived from the original Quechua (Inca) word for the cinchona tree bark, &quot;quina&quot; or &quot;quina-quina&quot;, which means &quot;bark of bark&quot; or &quot;holy bark&quot;. Prior to 1820, the bark was dried, ground to a fine powder, and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) in order to be drunk. Large-scale use of quinine as a malaria prophylaxis started around 1850. In 1853 Paul Briquet published a brief history and discussion of the literature on &quot;quinquina&quot;.

Quinine played a significant role in the colonization of Africa by Europeans. The availability of quinine for treatment had been said to be the prime reason Africa ceased to be known as the &quot;white man&#x27;s grave&quot;. A historian said, &quot;it was quinine&#x27;s efficacy that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa&quot;.

To maintain their monopoly on cinchona bark, Peru and surrounding countries began outlawing the export of cinchona seeds and saplings in the early 19th century. In 1865, Manuel Incra Mamani collected seeds from a plant particularly high in quinine and provided them to Charles Ledger. Ledger sent them to his brother, who sold them to the Dutch government. Mamani was arrested on a seed collecting trip in 1871, and beaten so severely, likely because of providing the seeds to foreigners, that he died soon afterwards.

By the late 19th century the Dutch grew the plants in Indonesian plantations. Soon they became the main suppliers of the tree. In 1913 they set up the Kina Bureau, a cartel of cinchona producers charged with controlling price and production. By the 1930s Dutch plantations in Java were producing 22 million pounds of cinchona bark, or 97% of the world&#x27;s quinine production. U.S. attempts to prosecute the Kina Bureau proved unsuccessful.

During World War II, Allied powers were cut off from their supply of quinine when Germany conquered the Netherlands, and Japan controlled the Philippines and Indonesia. The US had obtained four million cinchona seeds from the Philippines and began operating cinchona plantations in Costa Rica. Additionally, they began harvesting wild cinchona bark during the Cinchona Missions. Such supplies came too late. Tens of thousands of US troops in Africa and the South Pacific died of malaria due to the lack of quinine. Despite controlling the supply, the Japanese did not make effective use of quinine, and thousands of Japanese troops in the southwest Pacific died as a result.

Quinine remained the antimalarial drug of choice until after World War II. Since then, other drugs that have fewer side effects, such as chloroquine, have largely replaced it.

&quot;Bromo Quinine&quot; were brand name cold tablets containing quinine, manufactured by Grove Laboratories. They were first marketed in 1889 and available until at least the 1960s.

Conducting research in central Missouri, John S. Sappington independently developed an anti-malaria pill from quinine. Sappington began importing cinchona bark from Peru in 1820. In 1832, using quinine derived from the cinchona bark, Sappington developed a pill to treat a variety of fevers, such as scarlet fever, yellow fever, and influenza in addition to malaria. These illnesses were widespread in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys. He manufactured and sold &quot;Dr. Sappington&#x27;s Anti-Fever Pills&quot; across Missouri. Demand became so great that within three years, Sappington founded a company known as Sappington and Sons to sell his pills nationwide.

==Society and culture==

===Natural occurrence===

The bark of &quot;Remijia&quot; contains 0.5–2% of quinine. The bark is cheaper than bark of &quot;Cinchona&quot;. As it has an intense taste, it is used for making tonic water.

=== Regulation in the US===

From 1969 to 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 157 reports of health problems related to quinine use, including 23 which had resulted in death. In 1994, the FDA banned the marketing of over-the-counter quinine as a treatment for nocturnal leg cramps. Pfizer Pharmaceuticals had been selling the brand name Legatrin for this purpose. It is also sold as a softgel (by SmithKlineBeecham) as Q-vel. Doctors may still prescribe quinine, but the FDA has ordered firms to stop marketing unapproved drug products containing quinine. The FDA is also cautioning consumers about off-label use of quinine to treat leg cramps. Quinine is approved for treatment of malaria, but was also commonly prescribed to treat leg cramps and similar conditions. Because malaria is life-threatening, the risks associated with quinine use are considered acceptable when used to treat that condition.

Though Legatrin was banned by the FDA for the treatment of leg cramps, the drug manufacturer URL Mutual has branded a quinine-containing drug named Qualaquin. It is marketed as a treatment for malaria and is sold in the United States only by prescription. In 2004, the CDC reported only 1,347 confirmed cases of malaria in the United States.

=== Termination of pregnancy ===
For much of the 20th century, women&#x27;s use of an overdose of quinine to deliberately terminate a pregnancy was a relatively common abortion method in various parts of the world, including China.

===Cutting agent===
Quinine is sometimes detected as a cutting agent in street drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

==Other animals==

Quinine is used as a treatment for &quot;Cryptocaryon irritans&quot; (commonly referred to as white spot, crypto or marine ich) infection of marine aquarium fish.

<text>Quail is a collective name for several genera of mid-sized birds generally placed in the order Galliformes. The collective noun for a group of quail is a flock, covey, or bevy. 

Old World quail are placed in the family Phasianidae, and New World quail are placed in the family Odontophoridae. The species of buttonquail are named for their superficial resemblance to quail, and form the family Turnicidae in the order Charadriiformes. The king quail, an Old World quail, often is sold in the pet trade, and within this trade is commonly, though mistakenly, referred to as a &quot;button quail&quot;. Many of the common larger species are farm-raised for table food or egg consumption, and are hunted on game farms or in the wild, where they may be released to supplement the wild population, or extend into areas outside their natural range. In 2007, 40 million quail were produced in the United States.

<text>A bolt or quarrel is a dart-like projectile used by crossbows. The word &quot;quarrel&quot; is from the Old French &quot;quarrel&quot; (&gt; French &quot;carreau&quot;) &quot;square thing&quot;, specialized use as &quot;quarrel d&#x27;arcbaleste&quot; (&gt; &quot;carreau d&#x27;arbalète&quot;) &quot;crossbow quarrel&quot;, referring to their typically square heads. Although their lengths vary, bolts are typically shorter and heavier than traditional arrows shot with longbows.

== Parts of the bolt ==
=== Point ===

The point, also called the &quot;head&quot; or the &quot;tip&quot;, is the pointed and weighted front end of the bolt, which is sharp and hard so that it can penetrate the target.

=== Shaft ===
The shaft is the main body of the bolt to which other parts of the bolt are attached. In modern times it is normally made of carbon fibre or aluminium alloy (or sometimes both aluminum and carbon fibre are used), and is very lightweight for its strength. Shafts come with varying degrees of stiffness — referred to as the &quot;spine&quot; of the bolt. The more resistant to bending a bolt is, the more &quot;spine&quot; it is said to have, and a crossbow with higher draw weight ideally needs to be paired with a heavier bolt point and higher spine specifications. The weight of a shaft is usually in grains, and product descriptions may provide the total weight in grains, or in grains per inch (GPI), for which the total weight of shaft can be calculated by multiplying the GPI value with length of shaft in inches.

=== Fletching ===

Fletchings, also referred to as &quot;vanes&quot;, are fins located at the rear end of the shaft just before the nock. The fletching is typically made from soft light materials such as feathers, plastic or silicone rubber. They stabilize the trajectory of the bolt via three different means: resisting pitching and yawing of the shaft by acting like a stabilizer fin (fin-stabilization); reducing deviation from the longitudinal axis by creating a back-pulling center of pressure behind the bolt&#x27;s center of mass (drag-stabilization); and in some particular cases, creating a rotation around the longitudinal axis (spin-stabilization) by having the fletchings mounted at a slight angle of attack.

There is no rule or formula for determining the length of fletching needed — generally the longer the shaft is, the longer the fletching needs to be, and vice versa.

=== Nock ===
A nock is a small notched piece that is attached to the rear end of the shaft, for engaging and receiving the propulsive push from the string during shooting. Nocks are made of either plastic or aluminum.

== Size and weight ==
There is not any hard and fast rule of bolt sizing. Generally, the bolts are 15 to 22 inches long but the standard length is 20 inches. Experts recommend longer bolts but they have certain disadvantages as well.

The weight of the bolt can have a serious effect on the range of the bolt. The bolt&#x27;s total weight includes the bolt&#x27;s weight, nock, insert, vanes, and broadhead or field point. Almost all bolt manufacturers will list how many grains each shaft weighs or how many grains are in each inch of the shaft. A more massive bolt, e.g. at least 400 grains, will have better downrange energy and offer better penetration but will travel more slowly and thus drop more due to gravity during its flight. A lighter bolt will fly quicker and give the shooter a longer range, but might not have the desired penetration.

<doc id="25308" wikidata="Q456225" url="?curid=25308" title="Quasispecies model">
<text>The quasispecies model is a description of the process of the Darwinian evolution of certain self-replicating entities within the framework of physical chemistry. A quasispecies is a large group or &quot;cloud&quot; of related genotypes that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent. This is in contrast to a species, which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.

It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as RNA or DNA or simple asexual organisms such as bacteria or viruses (see also viral quasispecies), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the origin of life. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster based on initial work done by Eigen.

==Simplified explanation==

When evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies. (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive &quot;fidelity&quot;.) In evolutionary terms, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.

Some organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations. A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless. Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other. For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again. Thus we can envision a &quot;cloud&quot; of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud. Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.

Quasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.

===Quasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection===
In a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes. If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species. Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype&#x27;s fitness.

In a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can&#x27;t amount to much because that genotype&#x27;s offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties. Instead, what matters is the &quot;connectedness&quot; of the cloud. For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on. If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud. If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.

When the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.

===Application to biological research===

Quasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as HIV and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms. Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and Emmanuel David Tannenbaum to model the evolution of sexual reproduction. Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the Gard model for abiogenesis) and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell&#x27;s replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.

==Formal background==

The model rests on four assumptions:
# The self-replicating entities can be represented as sequences composed of a small number of building blocks—for example, sequences of RNA consisting of the four bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil.
# New sequences enter the system solely as the result of a copy process, either correct or erroneous, of other sequences that are already present.
# The substrates, or raw materials, necessary for ongoing replication are always present in sufficient quantity. Excess sequences are washed away in an outgoing flux.
# Sequences may decay into their building blocks. The probability of decay does not depend on the sequences&#x27; age; old sequences are just as likely to decay as young sequences.

In the quasispecies model, mutations occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, selection arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.

Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational &quot;clouds&quot; of closely related sequences, referred to as &quot;quasispecies&quot;. In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate. Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in &quot;in vitro&quot; RNA replication.

The mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the error threshold, the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.

==Mathematical description==

A simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows: let there be formula_1 possible sequences and let there be formula_2 organisms with sequence &quot;i&quot;. Let&#x27;s say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to formula_3 offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence &quot;i&quot;, but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate formula_4 correspond to the probability that a &quot;j&quot; type parent will produce an &quot;i&quot; type organism. Then the expected fraction of offspring generated by &quot;j&quot; type organisms that would be &quot;i&quot; type organisms is formula_5,

where formula_6.

Then the total number of &quot;i&quot;-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as formula_7, is

:formula_8

Sometimes a death rate term formula_9 is included so that:

:formula_10

where formula_11 is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the &quot;n-th&quot; generation can be found by just taking the &quot;n-th&quot; power of W substituting it in place of W in the above formula.

This is just a system of linear equations. The usual way to solve such a system is to first diagonalize the W matrix. Its diagonal entries will be eigenvalues corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be eigenvectors of the W matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies. Assuming that the matrix W is a primitive matrix (irreducible and aperiodic), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.

=== Note about primitive matrices ===

W being primitive means that for some integer formula_12, that the formula_13 power of W is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive. If W is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of W) mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. W is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.

===Alternative formulations===

The quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state formula_7 and the old state formula_2 to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of formula_2 is given by this difference, formula_17 we can write:

:formula_18

The quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations formula_19 where

:formula_20.
:formula_21.

The above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:

:formula_22

or, for the continuum version:

:formula_23

===Simple example===
The quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let&#x27;s say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let&#x27;s say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, formula_24 replicas of themselves, and formula_25 of each of the other two types, where formula_26. The W matrix is then:

:formula_27.

The diagonalized matrix is:

:formula_28.

And the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:

Only the eigenvalue formula_29 is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be formula_30 and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive, the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It&#x27;s seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).

<text>The Qing dynasty ( ), officially the Great Qing, was a Manchu-led imperial dynasty of China and an early modern empire in East Asia. The last imperial dynasty in Chinese history, the Qing dynasty was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. At its height of power, the empire stretched from the Sea of Japan in the east to the Pamir Mountains in the west, and from the Mongolian Plateau in the north to the South China Sea in the south. Originally emerging from the Later Jin dynasty founded in 1616 and proclaimed in Shenyang in 1636, the dynasty seized control of the Ming capital Beijing and North China in 1644, traditionally considered the start of the dynasty&#x27;s rule. The dynasty lasted until the Xinhai Revolution of October 1911 led to the abdication of the last emperor in February 1912. The multi-ethnic Qing dynasty assembled the territorial base for modern China. The Qing controlled the most territory of any dynasty in Chinese history, and in 1790 represented the fourth-largest empire in world history to that point. With over 426 million citizens in 1907, it was the most populous country in the world at the time.

Nurhaci, leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens and House of Aisin-Gioro who was also a vassal of the Ming dynasty, unified Jurchen clans (known later as Manchus) and founded the Later Jin dynasty in 1616, renouncing the Ming overlordship. As the founding Khan of the Manchu state he established the Eight Banners military system, and his son Hong Taiji was declared Emperor of the Great Qing in 1636. As Ming control disintegrated, peasant rebels captured Beijing as the short-lived Shun dynasty, but the Ming general Wu Sangui opened the Shanhai Pass to the Qing army, which defeated the rebels, seized the capital, and took over the government in 1644 under the Shunzhi Emperor and his prince regent. While the Qing became a Chinese empire, resistance from Ming rump regimes and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories delayed the complete conquest until 1683, which marked the beginning of the High Qing era. As an emperor of Manchu ethnic origin, the Kangxi Emperor (1661–1722) consolidated control, relished the role of a Confucian ruler, patronised Buddhism (including Tibetan Buddhism), encouraged scholarship, population and economic growth. Han officials worked under or in parallel with Manchu officials.

To maintain prominence over its neighbors, the Qing leveraged and adapted the traditional tributary system employed by previous dynasties, enabling their continued predominance in affairs with countries on its periphery like Joseon Korea and the Lê dynasty in Vietnam, while extending its control over Inner Asia including Tibet, Mongolia, and Xinjiang. The Qing dynasty reached its apex during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1735–1796), who led the Ten Great Campaigns of conquest, and personally supervised Confucian cultural projects. After his death, the dynasty faced internal revolts, economic disruption, official corruption, foreign intrusion, and the reluctance of Confucian elites to change their mindset. With peace and prosperity, the population rose to 400 million, but taxes and government revenues were fixed at a low rate, soon leading to a fiscal crisis. Following China&#x27;s defeat in the Opium Wars, Western colonial powers forced the Qing government to sign unequal treaties, granting them trading privileges, extraterritoriality and treaty ports under their control. The Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in western China led to the deaths of over 20 million people, from famine, disease, and war.

The Tongzhi Restoration in the 1860s brought vigorous reforms and the introduction of foreign military technology in the Self-Strengthening Movement. Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) led to loss of suzerainty over Korea and cession of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan. The ambitious Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898 proposed fundamental change, but was poorly executed and terminated by the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) in the Wuxu Coup. In 1900, anti-foreign Boxers killed many Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries; in retaliation, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China and imposed a punitive indemnity. In response, the government initiated unprecedented fiscal and administrative reforms, including elections, a new legal code, and the abolition of the imperial examination system. Sun Yat-sen and revolutionaries debated reform officials and constitutional monarchists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao over how to transform the Manchu-ruled empire into a modernised Han state. After the deaths of the Guangxu Emperor and Cixi in 1908, Manchu conservatives at court blocked reforms and alienated reformers and local elites alike. The Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 led to the Xinhai Revolution. The abdication of the Xuantong Emperor on 12 February 1912 brought the dynasty to an end.

== Names ==
Hong Taiji proclaimed the &quot;Great Qing&quot; dynasty in 1636. There are competing explanations as to the meaning of the Chinese character in this context. One theory posits a purposeful contrast with the Ming: the character is associated with fire within the Chinese zodiacal system, while is associated with water, illustrating the triumph of the Qing as the conquest of fire by water. The name possibly also possessed Buddhist implications of perspicacity and enlightenment, as well as connection with the bodhisattva Manjusri.
Early European writers used the term &quot;Tartar&quot; indiscriminately for all the peoples of Northern Eurasia but in the 17th century Catholic missionary writings established &quot;Tartar&quot; to refer only to the Manchus and &quot;Tartary&quot; for the lands they ruled—i.e. Manchuria and the adjacent parts of Inner Asia, as ruled by the Qing before the Ming–Qing transition.

After conquering China proper, the Manchus identified their state as &quot;China&quot;, equivalently as in Chinese and in Manchu. The emperors equated the lands of the Qing state (including, among other areas, present-day Northeast China, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet) as &quot;China&quot; in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, and rejecting the idea that only Han areas were properly part of &quot;China&quot;. The government used &quot;China&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; interchangeably to refer to their state in official documents, including the Chinese-language versions of treaties and maps of the world. The term &#x27;Chinese people&#x27; (; Manchu: ) referred to all the Han, Manchu, and Mongol subjects of the Qing Empire. When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, it proclaimed within a Manchu-language memorial that the new land had been absorbed into &quot;China&quot;. The Qing government expounded an ideology that it was bringing the &quot;outer&quot; non-Han peoples—such as various populations of Mongolians, as well as the Tibetans—together with the &quot;inner&quot; Han Chinese into &quot;one family&quot;, united within the Qing state. Phraseology like and —both translatable as &#x27;home and abroad as one family&#x27;—was employed to convey this idea of Qing-mediated trans-cultural unity.

==History==

===Formation===

The Qing dynasty was founded not by Han Chinese, who constituted a majority of the population, but by Manchus, a sedentary farming people descended from the Jurchens, a Tungusic people who lived in the region now comprising the Chinese provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang.

====Nurhaci====

The early form of the Manchu state was founded by Nurhaci, the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribethe Aisin-Gioroin Jianzhou in the early 17th century. Nurhaci may have spent time in a Han household in his youth, and became fluent in Chinese and Mongolian languages and read the Chinese novels &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot;. As a vassal of the Ming emperors, he officially considered himself a guardian of the Ming border and a local representative of the Ming dynasty. Nurhaci embarked on an intertribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes. He also began organizing the Eight Banners military system which included Manchu, Han, and Mongol elements. By 1616, however, he had sufficiently consolidated Jianzhou so as to be able to proclaim himself Khan of the Later Jin dynasty in reference to the previous Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty.

Two years later, Nurhaci announced the &quot;Seven Grievances&quot; and openly renounced the sovereignty of Ming overlordship in order to complete the unification of those Jurchen tribes still allied with the Ming emperor. After a series of successful battles, he relocated his capital from Hetu Ala to successively bigger captured Ming cities in Liaodong: first Liaoyang in 1621, then Mukden (Shenyang) in 1625. Furthermore, the Khorchin proved a useful ally in the war, lending the Jurchens their expertise as cavalry archers. To guarantee this new alliance, Nurhaci initiated a policy of inter-marriages between the Jurchen and Khorchin nobilities, while those who resisted were met with military action. This is a typical example of Nurhaci&#x27;s initiatives that eventually became official Qing government policy. During most of the Qing period, the Mongols gave military assistance to the Manchus.

====Hong Taiji====
Nurhaci died in 1626, and was succeeded by his eighth son, Hong Taiji. Although Hong Taiji was an experienced leader and the commander of two Banners, the Jurchens suffered defeat in 1627, in part due to the Ming&#x27;s newly acquired Portuguese cannons. To redress the technological and numerical disparity, Hong Taiji in 1634 created his own artillery corps, who cast their own cannons in the European design with the help of defector Chinese metallurgists. One of the defining events of Hong Taiji&#x27;s reign was the official adoption of the name &quot;Manchu&quot; for the united Jurchen people in November 1635. In 1635, the Manchus&#x27; Mongol allies were fully incorporated into a separate Banner hierarchy under direct Manchu command. In April 1636, Mongol nobility of Inner Mongolia, Manchu nobility and the Han mandarin recommended that Hong as the khan of Later Jin should be the emperor of the Great Qing. When he was presented with the imperial seal of the Yuan dynasty after the defeat of the last Khagan of the Mongols, Hong Taiji renamed his state from &quot;Great Jin&quot; to &quot;Great Qing&quot; and elevated his position from Khan to Emperor, suggesting imperial ambitions beyond unifying the Manchu territories. Hong Taiji then proceeded to invade Korea again in 1636.
Meanwhile, Hong Taiji set up a rudimentary bureaucratic system based on the Ming model. He established six boards or executive level ministries in 1631 to oversee finance, personnel, rites, military, punishments, and public works. However, these administrative organs had very little role initially, and it was not until the eve of completing the conquest ten years later that they fulfilled their government roles.

Hong Taiji staffed his bureaucracy with many Han Chinese, including newly surrendered Ming officials, but ensured Manchu dominance by an ethnic quota for top appointments. Hong Taiji&#x27;s reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong according to how much grain they had. Due to a Han revolt in 1623, Nurhaci turned against them and enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them. He ordered that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally with Jurchens, not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji recognised the need to attract Han Chinese, explaining to reluctant Manchus why he needed to treat the defecting Ming general Hong Chengchou leniently. Hong Taiji incorporated Han into the Jurchen polity as citizens obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry.

===Claiming the Mandate of Heaven===
Hong Taiji died suddenly in September 1643. As Jurchen leaders were chosen by a council of nobles, there was no clear successor. The leading contenders for power were Hong Taiji&#x27;s oldest son Hooge and Hong Taiji&#x27;s half brother Dorgon. A compromise installed Hong Taiji&#x27;s five-year-old son, Fulin, as the Shunzhi Emperor, with Dorgon as regent and de facto leader of the Manchu nation.

Meanwhile, Ming government officials fought against fiscal collapse, against each other, and against a series of peasant rebellions. They were unable to capitalise on the Manchu succession dispute and the resulting boy emperor. In April 1644, Beijing was sacked by a contentious rebel coalition led by Li Zicheng, a former minor Ming official, who established a short-lived Shun dynasty. The last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor, committed suicide when the city fell to the rebels, marking the effective end of the dynasty.

Li Zicheng then led rebel forces numbering some 200,000 to confront Ming general Wu Sangui, stationed at Shanhai Pass of the Great Wall to defend the capital against the approaching Manchu-led armies. Wu, to survive, had to ally with one of his adversaries against the other; one was a Han Chinese peasant army twice his size, but he chose the other. Wu may have resented Li Zicheng&#x27;s attack on officials and the social order; Li had taken Wu&#x27;s father hostage and it was said that Li took Wu&#x27;s concubine for himself. On the other hand, the Manchus had adopted a Chinese-style form of government and promised stability. Wu and Dorgon allied to defeat Li Zicheng in the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May 1644.

The newly allied armies captured Beijing on 6 June. The Shunzhi Emperor was invested as the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; on 30 October 1644. The Manchus, who had positioned themselves as political heirs to the Ming, held a formal funeral for the Chongzhen Emperor. However, completing the conquest of China proper took another seventeen years of battling Ming loyalists, pretenders and rebels. The last Ming pretender, Prince Gui, sought refuge with Pindale Min, the king of Burma, but was turned over to a Qing expeditionary army commanded by Wu Sangui, who had him brought back to Yunnan and executed in early 1662.

The Qing had taken shrewd advantage of Ming civilian government discrimination against the military and encouraged the Ming military to defect by spreading the message that the Manchus valued their skills. Banners made up of Han Chinese who defected before 1644 were classed among the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges. Han defectors swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners so greatly that ethnic Manchus became a minorityonly 16% in 1648, with Han bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol bannermen making up the rest. Gunpowder weapons like muskets and artillery were wielded by the Chinese Banners. Normally, Han Chinese defector troops were deployed as the vanguard, while Manchu bannermen were used predominantly for quick strikes with maximum impact, so as to minimise ethnic Manchu losses.

This multi-ethnic force conquered Ming China for the Qing. The three Liaodong officers who played key roles in the conquest of southern China were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde, who governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing after the conquest. Han bannermen made up the majority of governors during the early Qing, stabilising their rule. To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or with the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Later in the dynasty the policies allowing intermarriage were done away with. The Qing&#x27;s depiction of itself as a Chinese empire was not hindered by the imperial house&#x27;s Manchu ethnicity, especially after 1644, when the name &quot;Chinese&quot; was given a multiethnic meaning.

The first seven years of the young Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign were dominated by Dorgon&#x27;s regency. Because of his own political insecurity, Dorgon followed Hong Taiji&#x27;s example by ruling in the name of the emperor at the expense of rival Manchu princes, many of whom he demoted or imprisoned. Dorgon&#x27;s precedents and example cast a long shadow. First, the Manchus had entered &quot;South of the Wall&quot; because Dorgon had responded decisively to Wu Sangui&#x27;s appeal, then, instead of sacking Beijing as the rebels had done, Dorgon insisted, over the protests of other Manchu princes, on making it the dynastic capital and reappointing most Ming officials. No major Chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor&#x27;s capital, but keeping the Ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country. Dorgon then drastically reduced the influence of the eunuchs and directed Manchu women not to bind their feet in the Han Chinese style.

However, not all of Dorgon&#x27;s policies were equally popular or as easy to implement. The controversial July 1645 Queue Order forced adult Han Chinese men to shave the front of their heads and comb the remaining hair into the queue hairstyle which was worn by Manchu men, on pain of death. The popular description of the order was: &quot;To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.&quot; To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The order triggered strong resistance in Jiangnan. In the ensuing unrest, some 100,000 Han were slaughtered.

On 31 December 1650, Dorgon died suddenly, marking the start of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s personal rule. Because the emperor was only 12 years old at that time, most decisions were made on his behalf by his mother, Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, who turned out to be a skilled political operator. Although his support had been essential to Shunzhi&#x27;s ascent, Dorgon had centralised so much power in his hands as to become a direct threat to the throne. So much so that upon his death he was bestowed the extraordinary posthumous title of Emperor Yi (), the only instance in Qing history in which a Manchu &quot;prince of the blood&quot; () was so honoured. Two months into Shunzhi&#x27;s personal rule, however, Dorgon was not only stripped of his titles, but his corpse was disinterred and mutilated. Dorgon&#x27;s fall from grace also led to the purge of his family and associates at court. Shunzhi&#x27;s promising start was cut short by his early death in 1661 at the age of 24 from smallpox. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who reigned as the Kangxi Emperor.

The Manchus sent Han bannermen to fight against Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists in Fujian. They removed the population from coastal areas in order to deprive Koxinga&#x27;s Ming loyalists of resources. This led to a misunderstanding that Manchus were afraid of water. Han bannermen carried out the fighting and killing, casting conquest of the Mingdoubt on the claim that fear of the water led to the coastal evacuation and ban on maritime activities. Even though a poem refers to the soldiers carrying out massacres in Fujian as &quot;barbarians&quot;, both Han Green Standard Army and Han bannermen were involved and carried out the worst slaughter. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories in addition to the 200,000 bannermen.

===Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s reign and consolidation===
The 61-year reign of the Kangxi Emperor was the longest of any emperor in Chinese history, and marked the beginning of the High Qing era, the zenith of the dynasty&#x27;s social, economic and military power. The early Manchu rulers established two foundations of legitimacy that help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture that they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. His attempts to discourage Chinese women from foot binding, however, were unsuccessful.

The second major source of stability was the Inner Asian aspect of their Manchu identity, which allowed them to appeal to the Mongol, Tibetan and Muslim subjects. Qing emperors adopted different images for these subjects in their multi-ethnic empire. The Qing used the title of Emperor (&quot;Huangdi&quot; or &quot;hūwangdi&quot;), along with Son of Heaven and &quot;Ejen&quot; in Chinese and Manchu. Like Kublai Khan of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty, Qing rulers like the Qianlong Emperor portrayed the image of themselves as Buddhist sage rulers (wheel-turning kings), patrons of Tibetan Buddhism to maintain legitimacy for Tibetan Buddhists. Mongol subjects also commonly referred to the Qing ruler as Bogda Khan, while Turkic Muslim subjects (now known as the Uyghurs) commonly referred to the Qing ruler as Chinese khagan.

Kangxi&#x27;s reign began when the young emperor was seven. To prevent a repeat of Dorgon&#x27;s monopolising of power, on his deathbed his father hastily appointed four regents who were not closely related to the imperial family and had no claim to the throne. However, through chance and machination, Oboi, the most junior of the four, gradually achieved such dominance as to be a potential threat. In 1669, Kangxi disarmed and imprisoned Oboi through trickerya significant victory for a fifteen-year-old emperor. The young emperor faced challenges in maintaining control of his kingdom, as well. Three Ming generals singled out for their contributions to the establishment of the dynasty had been granted governorships in southern China. They became increasingly autonomous, leading to the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, which lasted for eight years. Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China, which took several decades to recover.
To extend and consolidate the dynasty&#x27;s control in Central Asia, the Kangxi Emperor personally led a series of military campaigns against the Dzungars in Outer Mongolia. The Kangxi Emperor expelled Galdan&#x27;s invading forces from these regions, which were then incorporated into the empire. In 1683, Qing forces received the surrender of Formosa (Taiwan) from Zheng Keshuang, grandson of Koxinga, who had conquered Taiwan from the Dutch colonists as a base against the Qing. Winning Taiwan freed Kangxi&#x27;s forces for a series of battles over Albazin, the far eastern outpost of the Tsardom of Russia. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk was China&#x27;s first formal treaty with a European power and kept the border peaceful for the better part of two centuries. Galdan was ultimately killed in the Dzungar–Qing War; after his death, his Tibetan Buddhist followers attempted to control the choice of the next Dalai Lama. Kangxi dispatched two armies to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and installed a Dalai Lama sympathetic to the Qing.

===Reigns of the Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors===
The reigns of the Yongzheng Emperor () and his son, the Qianlong Emperor (), marked the height of Qing power. However, the historian Jonathan Spence notes that the empire at the end of Qianlong&#x27;s reign was &quot;like the sun at midday&quot;. Despite &quot;many glories&quot;, &quot;signs of decay and even collapse were becoming apparent&quot;.

After the death of the Kangxi Emperor in the winter of 1722, his fourth son, Prince Yong (), became the Yongzheng Emperor. He felt a sense of urgency about the problems that had accumulated in his father&#x27;s later years. In the words of one recent historian, he was &quot;severe, suspicious, and jealous, but extremely capable and resourceful&quot;, and in the words of another, he turned out to be an &quot;early modern state-maker of the first order&quot;. First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and cracked down on unorthodox sects. In 1723, he outlawed Christianity and expelled most Christian missionaries. He expanded his father&#x27;s system of Palace Memorials, which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and he created a small Grand Council of personal advisors, which eventually grew into the emperor&#x27;s de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realise the extent of the financial crisis, Yongzheng rejected his father&#x27;s lenient approach to local elites and enforced collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for &quot;money to nourish honesty&quot; among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangtze valley there were long-established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence. The fiscal crisis persisted.
Yongzheng also inherited diplomatic and strategic problems. A team made up entirely of Manchus drew up the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta to solidify the diplomatic understanding with Russia. In exchange for territory and trading rights, the Qing would have a free hand in dealing with the situation in Mongolia. Yongzheng then turned to that situation, where the Zunghars threatened to re-emerge, and to the southwest, where local Miao chieftains resisted Qing expansion. These campaigns drained the treasury but established the emperor&#x27;s control of the military and military finance.
When the Yongzheng Emperor died in 1735, his son Prince Bao () became the Qianlong Emperor. Qianlong personally led the Ten Great Campaigns to expand military control into present-day Xinjiang and Mongolia, putting down revolts and uprisings in Sichuan and southern China while expanding control over Tibet. The Qianlong Emperor launched several ambitious cultural projects, including the compilation of the &quot;Siku Quanshu&quot;, the largest collection of books in Chinese history. Nevertheless, Qianlong used the literary inquisition to silence opposition. Beneath outward prosperity and imperial confidence, the later years of Qianlong&#x27;s reign were marked by rampant corruption and neglect. Heshen, the emperor&#x27;s handsome young favorite, took advantage of the emperor&#x27;s indulgence to become one of the most corrupt officials in the history of the dynasty. Qianlong&#x27;s son, the Jiaqing Emperor (), eventually forced Heshen to commit suicide.
Populations in the first half of the 17th century did not recover from civil wars and epidemics, but the following years of prosperity and stability led to steady growth. The Qianlong Emperor bemoaned the situation by remarking, &quot;The population continues to grow, but the land does not.&quot; The introduction of new crops from the Americas such as the potato and peanut improved nutrition as well, so that the population during the 18th century ballooned from 100 million to 300 million people. Soon farmers were forced to work ever-smaller holdings more intensely.

In 1796, the White Lotus Society raised open rebellion, saying &quot;the officials have forced the people to rebel&quot;. Others blamed officials in various parts of the country for corruption, failing to keep the famine relief granaries full, poor maintenance of roads and waterworks, and bureaucratic factionalism. There soon followed uprisings of &quot;new sect&quot; Muslims against local Muslim officials, and Miao tribesmen in southwest China. The White Lotus Rebellion continued until 1804, when badly run, corrupt, and brutal campaigns finally ended it.

===Rebellion, unrest, and external pressure===

During the early Qing, China continued to be the hegemonic imperial power in East Asia. Although there was no formal ministry of foreign relations, the Lifan Yuan was responsible for relations with the Mongols and Tibetans in Inner Asia, while the tributary system, a loose set of institutions and customs taken over from the Ming, in theory governed relations with East and Southeast Asian countries. The 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk stabilised relations with the Tsardom of Russia. However, during the 18th century, European empires gradually expanded across the world and developed economies predicated on maritime trade, colonial extraction, and technological advances. The dynasty was confronted with newly developing concepts of the international system and state-to-state relations. European trading posts expanded into territorial control in what is now India and Indonesia. The Qing response was to establish the Canton System in 1756, which restricted maritime trade to Guangzhou and gave monopoly trading rights to private Chinese merchants. This was successful for a time, and the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company had long before been granted similar monopoly rights by their governments.

In 1793, the British East India Company, with the support of the British government, sent a diplomatic mission to China led by Lord Macartney in order to open trade and put relations on a basis of equality. The imperial court viewed trade as of secondary interest, whereas the British saw maritime trade as the key to their economy. The Qianlong Emperor told Macartney &quot;the kings of the myriad nations come by land and sea with all sorts of precious things&quot;, and &quot;consequently there is nothing we lack...&quot;
Since China had little demand for European goods, Europe paid in silver for Chinese goods, an imbalance that worried the mercantilist governments of Britain and France. The growing Chinese demand for opium provided the remedy. The British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year. The First Opium War revealed the outdated state of the Chinese military. The Qing navy, composed entirely of wooden sailing junks, was severely outclassed by the modern tactics and firepower of the British Royal Navy. British soldiers, using advanced muskets and artillery, easily outmaneuvered and outgunned Qing forces in ground battles. The Qing surrender in 1842 marked a decisive, humiliating blow. The Treaty of Nanjing, the first of the &quot;unequal treaties&quot;, demanded war reparations, forced China to open up the Treaty Ports of Canton, Amoy, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai to Western trade and missionaries, and to cede Hong Kong Island to Britain. It revealed weaknesses in the Qing government and provoked rebellions against the regime.

The Taiping Rebellion (1849–1864) was the first major anti-Manchu movement. Amid widespread social unrest and worsening famine, the rebellion not only posed the most serious threat to Qing rule, but during its 14-year course, between 20 and 30 million people died. The rebellion began under the leadership of Hong Xiuquan (1814–1864), a disappointed civil service examination candidate who, influenced by reading the Old Testament in translation, had a series of visions and announced himself to be the son of God, the younger brother of Jesus Christ, sent to reform China. In 1851, Hong launched an uprising in Guizhou and established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with himself as its king. Within this kingdom, slavery, concubinage, arranged marriage, opium smoking, footbinding, judicial torture, and the worship of idols were all banned. However, success led to internal feuds, defections and corruption. In addition, British and French troops, equipped with modern weapons, had come to the assistance of the Qing army. Nonetheless, it was not until 1864 that Qing forces under Zeng Guofan succeeded in crushing the revolt. After the outbreak of this rebellion, there were also revolts by the Muslims and Miao people of China against the Qing, most notably in the Miao Rebellion (1854–1873) in Guizhou, the Panthay Rebellion (1856–1873) in Yunnan, and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest.
The Western powers, largely unsatisfied with the Treaty of Nanjing, gave grudging support to the Qing government during the Taiping and Nian rebellions. China&#x27;s income fell sharply during the wars as vast areas of farmland were destroyed, millions of lives were lost, and countless armies were raised and equipped to fight the rebels. In 1854, Britain tried to re-negotiate the Treaty of Nanjing, inserting clauses allowing British commercial access to Chinese rivers and the creation of a permanent British embassy at Beijing.
In 1856, Qing authorities, in searching for a pirate, boarded a ship, the &quot;Arrow&quot;, which the British claimed had been flying the British flag, an incident which led to the Second Opium War. In 1858, facing no other options, the Xianfeng Emperor agreed to the Treaty of Tientsin, which contained clauses deeply insulting to the Chinese, such as a demand that all official Chinese documents be written in English and a proviso granting British warships unlimited access to all navigable Chinese rivers.

Ratification of the treaty in the following year led to a resumption of hostilities. In 1860, with Anglo-French forces marching on Beijing, the emperor and his court fled the capital for the imperial hunting lodge at Rehe. Once in Beijing, the Anglo-French forces looted and burned the Old Summer Palace and, in an act of revenge for the arrest, torture, and execution of the English diplomatic mission. Prince Gong, a younger half-brother of the emperor, who had been left as his brother&#x27;s proxy in the capital, was forced to sign the Convention of Beijing. The humiliated emperor died the following year at Rehe.

===Self-strengthening and frustration of reforms===
Following the death of the Xianfeng Emperor in 1861, and the accession of the 5-year-old Tongzhi Emperor, the Qing rallied. In the Tongzhi Restoration, Han Chinese officials such as Zuo Zongtang stood behind the Manchus and organised provincial troops. Zeng Guofan, in alliance with Prince Gong, sponsored the rise of younger officials such as Li Hongzhang, who put the dynasty back on its feet financially and instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement, which adopted Western military technology in order to preserve Confucian values.Their institutional reforms included China&#x27;s first unified ministry of foreign affairs in the Zongli Yamen, allowing foreign diplomats to reside in the capital, the establishment of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, the institution of modern navy and army forces including the Beiyang Army, and the purchase of armament factories from the Europeans.

The dynasty gradually lost control of its peripheral territories. In return for promises of support against the British and the French, the Russian Empire took large chunks of territory in the Northeast in 1860. The period of cooperation between the reformers and the European powers ended with the 1870 Tianjin Massacre, which was incited by the murder of French nuns set off by the belligerence of local French diplomats. Starting with the Cochinchina Campaign in 1858, France expanded control of Indochina. By 1883, France was in full control of the region and had reached the Chinese border. The Sino-French War began with a surprise attack by the French on the Chinese southern fleet at Fuzhou. After that the Chinese declared war on the French. A French invasion of Taiwan was halted and the French were defeated on land in Tonkin at the Battle of Bang Bo. However Japan threatened to enter the war against China due to the Gapsin Coup and China chose to end the war with negotiations. The war ended in 1885 with the Treaty of Tientsin and the Chinese recognition of the French protectorate in Vietnam. Some Russian and Chinese gold miners also established a short-lived proto-state known as the Zheltuga Republic (1883–1886) in the Amur River basin, which was however soon crushed by the Qing forces.

In 1884, Qing China obtained concessions in Korea, such as the Chinese concession of Incheon, but the pro-Japanese Koreans in Seoul led the Gapsin Coup. Tensions between China and Japan rose after China intervened to suppress the uprising. The Japanese prime minister Itō Hirobumi and Li Hongzhang signed the Convention of Tientsin, an agreement to withdraw troops simultaneously, but the First Sino-Japanese War of 1895 was a military humiliation. The Treaty of Shimonoseki recognised Korean independence and ceded Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan. The terms might have been harsher, but when a Japanese citizen attacked and wounded Li Hongzhang, an international outcry shamed the Japanese into revising them. The original agreement stipulated the cession of Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, but Russia, with its own designs on the territory, along with Germany and France, in the Triple Intervention, successfully put pressure on the Japanese to abandon the peninsula.
These years saw the participation of Empress Dowager Cixi in state affairs. Cixi initially entered the imperial palace in the 1850s as a concubine of the Xianfeng Emperor, and became the mother of the future Tongzhi Emperor. Following the his accession at the age of five, Cixi, Xianfeng&#x27;s widow Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, and Prince Gong (a son of the Daoguang Emperor), staged a coup that ousted several of the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s regents. Between 1861 and 1873, Cixi and Ci&#x27;an served as regents together; following the emperor&#x27;s death in 1875, Cixi&#x27;s nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, took the throne in violation of the custom that the new emperor be of the next generation, and another regency began. Ci&#x27;an suddenly died in the spring of 1881, leaving Cixi as sole regent.

From 1889, when Guangxu began to rule in his own right, until 1898, the Empress Dowager lived in semi-retirement, spending the majority of the year at the Summer Palace. In 1897, two German Roman Catholic missionaries were murdered in southern Shandong province (the Juye Incident). Germany used the murders as a pretext for a naval occupation of Jiaozhou Bay. The occupation prompted a Scramble for China in 1898, which included the German lease of Jiaozhou Bay, the Russian lease of Liaodong, the British lease of the New Territories of Hong Kong, and the French lease of Guangzhouwan.
In the wake of these external defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898. Newer, more radical advisers such as Kang Youwei were given positions of influence. The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganise the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she had been involved in the initial reforms, the Empress Dowager stepped in to call them off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform were implanted.
Drought in North China, combined with the imperialist designs of European powers and the instability of the Qing government, created background conditions for the Boxers. In 1900, local groups of Boxers proclaiming support for the Qing dynasty murdered foreign missionaries and large numbers of Chinese Christians, then converged on Beijing to besiege the Foreign Legation Quarter. A coalition of European, Japanese, and Russian armies (the Eight-Nation Alliance) then entered China without diplomatic notice, much less permission. Cixi declared war on all of these nations, only to lose control of Beijing after a short, but hard-fought campaign. She fled to Xi&#x27;an. The victorious allies then enforced their demands on the Qing government, including compensation for their expenses in invading China and execution of complicit officials, via the Boxer Protocol.

===Reform, revolution, collapse===
The defeat by Japan in 1895 created a sense of crisis which the failure of the 1898 reforms and the disasters of 1900 only exacerbated. Cixi in 1901 moved to mollify the foreign community, called for reform proposals, and initiated the Late Qing reforms. Over the next few years the reforms included the restructuring of the national education, judicial, and fiscal systems, the most dramatic of which was the abolition of the imperial examination system in 1905. The court directed a constitution to be drafted, and provincial elections were held, the first in China&#x27;s history. Sun Yat-sen and revolutionaries debated reform officials and constitutional monarchists such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao over how to transform the Manchu-ruled empire into a modernised Han Chinese state.
The Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, and Cixi died the following day. Puyi, the oldest son of Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and nephew to the childless Guangxu Emperor, was appointed successor at the age of two, leaving Zaifeng with the regency. Zaifeng forced Yuan Shikai to resign. The Qing dynasty became a constitutional monarchy on 8 May 1911, when Zaifeng created a &quot;responsible cabinet&quot; led by Yikuang, Prince Qing. However, it became known as the &quot;royal cabinet&quot;, as five of its thirteen members, were part of or related to the royal family.

The Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911 set off a series of uprisings. By November, 14 of the 22 provinces had rejected Qing rule. This led to the creation of the Republic of China, in Nanjing on 1 January 1912, with Sun Yat-sen as its provisional head. Seeing a desperate situation, the Qing court brought Yuan Shikai back to power. His Beiyang Army crushed the revolutionaries in Wuhan at the Battle of Yangxia. After taking the position of Prime Minister he created his own cabinet, with the support of Empress Dowager Longyu. However, Yuan Shikai decided to cooperate with Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionaries to overthrow the Qing dynasty.
On 12 February 1912, Longyu issued the abdication of the child emperor Puyi leading to the fall of the Qing dynasty under the pressure of Yuan Shikai&#x27;s Beiyang army despite objections from conservatives and royalist reformers. This brought an end to over 2,000 years imperial governance in China, and began a period of instability. In July 1917, there was an abortive attempt to restore the Qing led by Zhang Xun. Puyi was allowed to live in the Forbidden City after his abdication until 1924, when he moved to the Japanese concession in Tianjin. The Empire of Japan invaded Northeast China and founded Manchukuo there in 1932, with Puyi as its emperor. After the invasion of Northeast China to fight Japan by the Soviet Union, Manchukuo fell in 1945.

==Government==

The early Qing emperors adopted the bureaucratic structures and institutions from the Ming, but split rule between Han and Manchus, with some positions also given to Mongols. Like previous dynasties, the Qing recruited officials via the imperial examination system, until the system was abolished in 1905. The Qing divided the positions into civil and military positions, each having nine grades or ranks, each subdivided into a and b categories. Civil appointments ranged from an attendant to the emperor or a Grand Secretary in the Forbidden City (highest) to being a prefectural tax collector, deputy jail warden, deputy police commissioner, or tax examiner. Military appointments ranged from being a field marshal or chamberlain of the imperial bodyguard to a third class sergeant, corporal or a first or second class private.

While the Qing dynasty tried to maintain the traditional tributary system of China, by the 19th century Qing China had become part of a European-style community of sovereign states and established official diplomatic relations with more than twenty countries around the world before its downfall, and since the 1870s it established legations and consulates.

===Central government agencies===
The formal structure of the Qing government centred on the Emperor as the absolute ruler, who presided over six Boards (Ministries), each headed by two presidents and assisted by four vice presidents. In contrast to the Ming system, however, Qing ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations. The Grand Secretariat, which had been an important policy-making body under the Ming, lost its importance during the Qing and evolved into an imperial chancery. The institutions which had been inherited from the Ming formed the core of the Qing &quot;Outer Court&quot;, which handled routine matters and was located in the southern part of the Forbidden City.
In order not to let the routine administration take over the running of the empire, the Qing emperors made sure that all important matters were decided in the &quot;Inner Court&quot;, which was dominated by the imperial family and Manchu nobility and which was located in the northern part of the Forbidden City. The core institution of the inner court was the Grand Council. It emerged in the 1720s under the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor as a body charged with handling Qing military campaigns against the Mongols, but soon took over other military and administrative duties, centralising authority under the crown. The Grand Councillors served as a sort of privy council to the emperor.
From the early Qing, the central government was characterised by a system of dual appointments by which each position in the central government had a Manchu and a Han Chinese assigned to it. The Han Chinese appointee was required to do the substantive work and the Manchu to ensure Han loyalty to Qing rule. While the Qing government was established as an absolute monarchy like previous dynasties in China, by the early 20th century however the Qing court began to move towards a constitutional monarchy, with government bodies like the Advisory Council established and a parliamentary election to prepare for a constitutional government.

There was also another government institution called Imperial Household Department which was unique to the Qing dynasty. It was established before the fall of the Ming, but it became mature only after 1661, following the death of the Shunzhi Emperor and the accession of his son, the Kangxi Emperor. The department&#x27;s original purpose was to manage the internal affairs of the imperial family and the activities of the inner palace (in which tasks it largely replaced eunuchs), but it also played an important role in Qing relations with Tibet and Mongolia, engaged in trading activities (jade, ginseng, salt, furs, etc.), managed textile factories in the Jiangnan region, and even published books. Relations with the Salt Superintendents and salt merchants, such as those at Yangzhou, were particularly lucrative, especially since they were direct, and did not go through absorptive layers of bureaucracy. The department was manned by &quot;booi&quot;, or &quot;bondservants&quot;, from the Upper Three Banners. By the 19th century, it managed the activities of at least 56 subagencies.

=== Military ===

The Qing dynasty was established by conquest and maintained by armed force. The founding emperors personally organised and led the armies, and the continued cultural and political legitimacy of the dynasty depended on the ability to defend the country from invasion and expand its territory. Therefore, military institutions, leadership, and finance were fundamental to the dynasty&#x27;s initial success and ultimate decay. The early military system centred on the Eight Banners, a hybrid institution that also played social, economic, and political roles. The Banner system was developed on an informal basis as early as 1601, and formally established in 1615 by Jurchen leader Nurhaci (1559–1626), the retrospectively recognised founder of the Qing. His son Hong Taiji (1592–1643), who renamed the Jurchens &quot;Manchus,&quot; created eight Mongol banners to mirror the Manchu ones and eight &quot;Han-martial&quot; () banners manned by Chinese who surrendered to the Qing before the full-fledged conquest of China proper began in 1644. After 1644, the Ming Chinese troops that surrendered to the Qing were integrated into the Green Standard Army, a corps that eventually outnumbered the Banners by three to one.

The use of gunpowder during the High Qing can compete with the three gunpowder empires in western Asia. Manchu imperial princes led the Banners in defeating the Ming armies, but after lasting peace was established starting in 1683, both the Banners and the Green Standard Armies started to lose their efficiency. Garrisoned in cities, soldiers had few occasions to drill. The Qing nonetheless used superior armament and logistics to expand deeply into Central Asia, defeat the Dzungar Mongols in 1759, and complete their conquest of Xinjiang. Despite the dynasty&#x27;s pride in the Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796), the Qing armies became largely ineffective by the end of the 18th century. It took almost ten years and huge financial waste to defeat the badly equipped White Lotus Rebellion (1795–1804), partly by legitimizing militias led by local Han Chinese elites. The Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864), a large-scale uprising that started in southern China, marched within miles of Beijing in 1853. The Qing court was forced to let its Han Chinese governors-general, first led by Zeng Guofan, raise regional armies. This new type of army and leadership defeated the rebels but signaled the end of Manchu dominance of the military establishment.

The military technology of the European Industrial Revolution made China&#x27;s armament and military rapidly obsolete. In 1860 British and French forces in the Second Opium War captured Beijing and sacked the Summer Palace. The shaken court attempted to modernise its military and industrial institutions by buying European technology. This Self-Strengthening Movement established shipyards (notably the Jiangnan Arsenal and the Foochow Arsenal) and bought modern guns and battleships in Europe. The Qing navy became the largest in East Asia. But organisation and logistics were inadequate, officer training was deficient, and corruption widespread. The Beiyang Fleet was virtually destroyed and the modernised ground forces defeated in the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War. The Qing created a New Army, but could not prevent the Eight Nation Alliance from invading China to put down the Boxer Uprising in 1900. The revolt of a New Army corps in 1911 led to the fall of the dynasty.

===Administrative divisions===

The Qing reached its largest extent during the 18th century, when it ruled China proper (eighteen provinces) as well as the areas of present-day Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet, at approximately in size. There were originally 18 provinces, all in China proper, but this number was later increased to 22, with Manchuria and Xinjiang being divided or turned into provinces. Taiwan, originally part of Fujian, became a province of its own in the 19th century, but was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895.

===Territorial administration===

The Qing organisation of provinces was based on the fifteen administrative units set up by the Ming dynasty, later made into eighteen provinces by splitting for example, Huguang into Hubei and Hunan provinces. The provincial bureaucracy continued the Yuan and Ming practice of three parallel lines, civil, military, and censorate, or surveillance. Each province was administered by a governor and a provincial military commander. Below the province were prefectures operating under a prefect, followed by subprefectures under a subprefect. The lowest unit was the county, overseen by a county magistrate. The eighteen provinces are also known as &quot;China proper&quot;. The position of viceroy was the highest rank in the provincial administration. There were eight regional viceroys in China proper, each usually took charge of two or three provinces. The Viceroy of Zhili, who was responsible for the area surrounding Beijing, is usually considered as the most honourable and powerful viceroy among the eight.

By the mid-18th century, the Qing had successfully put outer regions under its control. Imperial commissioners and garrisons were sent to Mongolia and Tibet to oversee their affairs. These territories were also under supervision of a central government institution called Lifan Yuan. Qinghai was also put under direct control of the Qing court. Xinjiang, also known as Chinese Turkestan, was subdivided into the regions north and south of the Tian Shan mountains, also known today as Dzungaria and Tarim Basin respectively, but the post of Ili General was established in 1762 to exercise unified military and administrative jurisdiction over both regions. Dzungaria was fully opened to Han migration by the Qianlong Emperor from the beginning. Han migrants were at first forbidden from permanently settling in the Tarim Basin but were the ban was lifted after the invasion by Jahangir Khoja in the 1820s. Likewise, Manchuria was also governed by military generals until its division into provinces, though some areas of Xinjiang and Northeast China were lost to the Russian Empire in the mid-19th century. Manchuria was originally separated from China proper by the Inner Willow Palisade, a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han Chinese, as the area was off-limits to civilian Han Chinese until the government started colonising the area, especially since the 1860s.

With respect to these outer regions, the Qing maintained imperial control, with the emperor acting as Mongol khan, patron of Tibetan Buddhism and protector of Muslims. However, Qing policy changed with the establishment of Xinjiang province in 1884. During the Great Game, taking advantage of the Dungan revolt in northwest China, Yakub Beg invaded Xinjiang from Central Asia with support from the British Empire, and made himself the ruler of the kingdom of Kashgaria. The Qing court sent forces to defeat Yaqub Beg and Xinjiang was reconquered, and then the political system of China proper was formally applied onto Xinjiang. The Kumul Khanate, which was incorporated into the Qing dynasty as a vassal after helping Qing defeat the Zunghars in 1757, maintained its status after Xinjiang turned into a province through the end of the dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution up until 1930. In the early 20th century, Britain sent an expedition force to Tibet and forced Tibetans to sign a treaty. The Qing court responded by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, resulting in the 1906 Anglo-Chinese Convention signed between Britain and China. The British agreed not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet, while China engaged not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet. The Qing government also turned Manchuria into three provinces in the early 20th century, officially known as the &quot;Three Northeast Provinces&quot;, and established the post of Viceroy of the Three Northeast Provinces to oversee these provinces.

==Society==
===Population growth and mobility===
The population grew in numbers, density, and mobility. The population in 1700 was roughly 150 million, about what it had been a century before, then doubled over the next century, and reached a height of 450 million on the eve of the Taiping Rebellion in 1850. The spread of New World crops, such as maize, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes decreased the number of deaths from malnutrition.  Diseases such as smallpox were brought under control by an increase in inoculations. In addition, infant deaths were decreased due to campaigns against infanticide and improvements in birthing techniques performed by doctors and midwives and an increase in medical books available to the public. European population growth in this period was greatest in the cities, but in China there was only slow growth in cities and the lower Yangzi. The greatest growth was in the borderlands and the highlands, where farmers moved to take advantage of large tracts of marshlands and forests.

The population was remarkably mobile, perhaps more so than at any time in Chinese history. Millions of Han Chinese migrated to Yunnan and Guizhou in the 18th century, and also to Taiwan. After the conquests of the 1750s and 1760s, the court organised agricultural colonies in Xinjiang. This mobility also included the privately organised movement of Qing subjects overseas, largely to Southeast Asia, to pursue trade and other economic opportunities.

Manchuria, however, was formally closed to Han settlement by the Willow Palisade, with the exception of some bannermen. Nonetheless, by 1780, Han Chinese had become 80% of the population. The relatively sparse populatikon made the territory vulnerable to Russian annexation. In response, the Qing officials proposed in 1860 to open parts of Guandong to Chinese civilian farmer settlers. Late 19th century Manchuria was opened up to Han settlers, resulting in more extensive migration. By the dawn of the 20th century, largely in an attempt to counteract increasing Russian influence, the Qing had abolished the existing administrative system in Manchuria, reclassified all immigrants to the region as &quot;Han&quot; instead of &quot;civilians&quot;, and replaced provincial generals with provincial governors. From 1902 to 1911, 70 civil administrations were created in Manchuria, owing to the region&#x27;s growing population.

===Social status===
According to statute, Qing society was divided into relatively closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding scholar-officials, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They were divided into two categories: one of them, the good &quot;commoner&quot; people, the other &quot;mean&quot; people who were seen as debased and servile. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as &quot;liangmin&quot;, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to &quot;jianmin&quot; meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupations (scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants) were &quot;good&quot;, or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), tattooed criminals, and those low-level employees of government officials were the &quot;mean people&quot;. Mean people were legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, such as being forbidden to take the imperial examination. Furthermore, such people were usually not allowed to marry with free commoners and were even often required to acknowledge their abasement in society through actions such as bowing. However, throughout the Qing dynasty, the emperor and his court, as well as the bureaucracy, worked towards reducing the distinctions between the debased and free but did not completely succeed even at the end of its era in merging the two classifications together.

====Qing gentry====

Although there had been no powerful hereditary aristocracy since the Song dynasty, the gentry, like their British counterparts, enjoyed imperial privileges and managed local affairs. The status of scholar-officials was defined by passing at least the first level of civil service examinations and holding a degree, which qualified him to hold imperial office, although he might not actually do so. The gentry member could legally wear gentry robes and could talk to officials as equals. Informally, the gentry then presided over local society and could use their connections to influence the magistrate, acquire land, and maintain large households. The gentry thus included not only males holding degrees but also their wives and some of their relatives.
The gentry class was divided into groups. Not all who held office were literati, as merchant families could purchase degrees, and not all who passed the exams found employment as officials, since the number of degree-holders was greater than the number of openings. The gentry class also differed in the source and amount of their income. Literati families drew income from landholding, as well as from lending money. Officials drew a salary, which, as the years went by, were less and less adequate, leading to widespread reliance on &quot;squeeze&quot;, irregular payments. Those who prepared for but failed the exams, like those who passed but were not appointed to office, could become tutors or teachers, private secretaries to sitting officials, administrators of guilds or temples, or other positions that required literacy. Others turned to fields such as engineering, medicine, or law, which by the nineteenth century demanded specialised learning. By the nineteenth century, it was no longer shameful to become an author or publisher of fiction.

The Qing gentry were marked as much by their aspiration to a cultured lifestyle as by their legal status. They lived more refined and comfortable lives than the commoners and used sedan-chairs to travel any significant distance. They often showed off their learning by collecting objects such as scholars&#x27; stones,
porcelain or pieces of art for their beauty, which set them off from less cultivated commoners.

====Qing nobility====
===Family and kinship===

During the Qing, the building block of society was patrilineal kinship. A shift in marital practices, identity and loyalty had begun during the Song, when the civil service examination began to replace nobility and inheritance as a means for gaining status. Instead of intermarrying within aristocratic elites of the same social status, they tended to form marital alliances with nearby families of the same or higher wealth, and established the local people&#x27;s interests as first and foremost which helped to form intermarried townships. The neo-Confucian ideology, especially the Cheng-Zhu thinking favored by Qing social thought, emphasised patrilineal families and genealogy in society.

The emperors and local officials exhorted families to compile genealogies in order to stabilise local society. The genealogy was placed in the ancestral hall, which served as the lineage&#x27;s headquarters and a place for annual ancestral sacrifice. A specific Chinese character appeared in the given name of each male of each generation, often well into the future. These lineages claimed to be based on biological descent but when a member of a lineage gained office or became wealthy, he might use considerable creativity in selecting a prestigious figure to be &quot;founding ancestor&quot;. Such worship was intended to ensure that the ancestors remain content and benevolent spirits (&quot;shen&quot;) who would keep watch over and protect the family. Later observers felt that the ancestral cult focused on the family and lineage, rather than on more public matters such as community and nation.

Inner Mongols and Khalkha Mongols in the Qing rarely knew their ancestors beyond four generations and Mongol tribal society was not organised among patrilineal clans, contrary to what was commonly thought, but included unrelated people at the base unit of organisation. The Qing tried but failed to promote the Chinese Neo-Confucian ideology of organising society along patrimonial clans among the Mongols.

===Religion===

Manchu rulers presided over a multi-ethnic empire and the emperor, who was held responsible for &quot;all under heaven&quot;, patronised and took responsibility for all religions and belief systems. The empire&#x27;s &quot;spiritual centre of gravity&quot; was the &quot;religio-political state&quot;. Since the empire was part of the order of the cosmos, which conferred the Mandate of Heaven, the emperor as &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; was both the head of the political system and the head priest of the State Cult. The emperor and his officials, who were his personal representatives, took responsibility over all aspects of the empire, especially spiritual life and religious institutions and practices. The county magistrate, as the emperor&#x27;s political and spiritual representative, made offerings at officially recognised temples. The magistrate lectured on the Emperor&#x27;s Sacred Edict to promote civic morality; he kept close watch over religious organisations whose actions might threaten the sovereignty and religious prerogative of the state.

====Manchu and imperial religion====
The Manchu imperial family were especially attracted by Yellow Sect or Gelug Buddhism that had spread from Tibet into Mongolia. The Fifth Dalai Lama, who had gained power in 1642, just before the Manchus took Beijing, looked to the Qing court for support. The Kangxi and Qianlong emperors practiced this form of Tibetan Buddhism as one of their household religions and built temples that made Beijing one of its centres, and constructed a replica Lhasa&#x27;s Potala Palace at their summer retreat in Rehe.
Shamanism, the most common religion among Manchus, was a spiritual inheritance from their Tungusic ancestors that set them off from Han Chinese. State shamanism was important to the imperial family both to maintain their Manchu cultural identity and to promote their imperial legitimacy among tribes in the northeast. Imperial obligations included rituals on the first day of Chinese New Year at a shamanic shrine (tangse). Practices in Manchu families included sacrifices to the ancestors, and the use of shamans, often women, who went into a trance to seek healing or exorcism.

====Popular religion====
Chinese folk religion was centred around the patriarchal family and shen, or spirits. Common practices included ancestor veneration, filial piety, local gods and spirits. Rites included mourning, funeral, burial, practices. Since they did not require exclusive allegiance, forms and branches of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism were intertwined, for instance in the syncretic Three teachings. Chinese folk religion combined elements of the three, with local variations. County magistrates, who were graded and promoted on their ability to maintain local order, tolerated local sects and even patronised local temples as long as they were orderly, but were suspicious of heterodox sects that defied state authority and rejected imperial doctrines. Some of these sects indeed had long histories of rebellion, such as the Way of Former Heaven, which drew on Daoism, and the White Lotus Society, which drew on millennial Buddhism. The White Lotus Rebellion (1796–1804) confirmed official suspicions as did the Taiping Rebellion, which drew on millennial Christianity.

====Christianity, Judaism, and Islam====

The Abrahamic religions had arrived from Western Asia as early as the Tang dynasty but their insistence that they should be practised to the exclusion of other religions made them less adaptable than Buddhism, which had quickly been accepted as native. Islam predominated in Central Asian areas of the empire, while Judaism and Christianity were practiced in well-established but self-contained communities.

Several hundred Catholic missionaries arrived between the late Ming period and the proscription of Christianity in 1724. The Jesuits adapted to Chinese expectations, evangelised among the educated, adopted the robes and lifestyles of literati, became proficient in the Confucian classics, and did not challenge Chinese moral values. They proved their value to the early Manchu emperors with their work in gunnery, cartography, and astronomy, but fell out of favor for a time until the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s 1692 edict of toleration. In the countryside, the newly arrived Dominican and Franciscan clerics established rural communities that adapted to local folk religious practices by emphasising healing, festivals, and holy days rather than sacraments and doctrine. In 1724, the Yongzheng Emperor proscribed Christianity as a &quot;heterodox teaching&quot;. Since the European Catholic missionaries had kept control in their own hands and had not allowed the creation of a native clergy, however, the number of Catholics would grow more rapidly after 1724 because local communities could now set their own rules and standards. In 1811, Christian religious activities were further criminalised by the Jiaqing Emperor. The imperial ban was lifted by Treaty in 1846.

The first Protestant missionary to China, Robert Morrison (1782–1834) of the London Missionary Society (LMS), arrived at Canton on 6 September 1807. He completed a translation of the entire Bible in 1819. Liang Afa (1789–1855), a Morrison-trained Chinese convert, extended evangelisation into inner China. The two Opium Wars (1839–1860) marked the watershed of Protestant Christian missions. The series of treaties signed between the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing and the 1858 Treaty of Tianjin distinguished Christianity from local religions and granted it protected status.

In the late 1840s Hong Xiuquan read Morrison&#x27;s Chinese Bible, as well as Liang Afa&#x27;s evangelistic pamphlet, and announced to his followers that Christianity in fact had been the religion of ancient China before Confucius and his followers drove it out. He formed the Taiping Movement, which emerged in South China as a &quot;collusion of the Chinese tradition of millenarian rebellion and Christian messianism&quot;, &quot;apocalyptic revolution, Christianity, and &#x27;communist utopianism.

After 1860, enforcement of the treaties allowed missionaries to spread their evangelisation efforts outside Treaty Ports. Their presence created cultural and political opposition. Historian John K. Fairbank observed that &quot;[t]o the scholar-gentry, Christian missionaries were foreign subversives, whose immoral conduct and teaching were backed by gunboats&quot;. In the next decades, there were some 800 conflicts between village Christians and non-Christians mostly about non-religious issues, such as land rights or local taxes, but religious conflict often lay behind such cases. In the summer of 1900, as foreign powers contemplated the division of China, village youths, known as Boxers, who practiced Chinese martial arts and spiritual practices, attacked and murdered Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries in the Boxer Uprising. The imperialist powers once again invaded and imposed a substantial indemnity. This defeat convinced many among the educated elites that popular religion was an obstacle to China&#x27;s development as a modern nation, and some turned to Christianity as a spiritual tool to build one.

By 1900, there were about 1,400 Catholic priests and nuns in China serving nearly 1 million Catholics. Over 3,000 Protestant missionaries were active among the 250,000 Protestant Christians in China. Western medical missionaries established clinics and hospitals, and led medical training in China. Missionaries began establishing nurse training schools in the late 1880s, but nursing of sick men by women was rejected by local tradition, so the number of students was small until the 1930s.

==Economy==

By the end of the 17th century, the Chinese economy had recovered from the devastation caused by the wars in which the Ming dynasty were overthrown. In the following century, markets continued to expand, but with more trade between regions, a greater dependence on overseas markets and a greatly increased population. By the end of the 18th century the population had risen to 300 million from approximately 150 million during the late Ming dynasty. The dramatic rise in population was due to several reasons, including the long period of peace and stability in the 18th century and the import of new crops China received from the Americas, including peanuts, sweet potatoes and maize. New species of rice from Southeast Asia led to a huge increase in production. Merchant guilds proliferated in all of the growing Chinese cities and often acquired great social and even political influence. Rich merchants with official connections built up huge fortunes and patronised literature, theater and the arts. Textile and handicraft production boomed.

The government broadened land ownership by returning land that had been sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. To give people more incentives to participate in the market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are critiqued by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the West overtook China economically.

During the Ming–Qing period (1368–1911) the biggest development in the Chinese economy was its transition from a command to a market economy, the latter becoming increasingly more pervasive throughout the Qing&#x27;s rule. Between roughly 1550 and 1800, China proper experienced a second commercial revolution, developing naturally from the first commercial revolution during the Song, which saw the emergence of long-distance inter-regional trade of luxury goods. During the second commercial revolution, for the first time, a large percentage of farming households began producing crops for sale in the local and national markets rather than for their own consumption or barter in the traditional economy. Surplus crops were placed onto the national market for sale, integrating farmers into the commercial economy from the ground up. This naturally led to regions specialising in certain cash-crops for export as China&#x27;s economy became increasingly reliant on inter-regional trade of bulk staple goods such as cotton, grain, beans, vegetable oils, forest products, animal products, and fertiliser.

===Silver===

Silver entered in large quantities from mines in the New World after the Spanish conquered the Philippines in the 1570s. The re-opening of the southeast coast, which had been closed in the late 17th century, quickly revived trade, which expanded at 4% per annum throughout the latter part of the 18th century. China continued to export tea, silk and manufactures, creating a large, favorable trade balance with the West. The resulting expansion of the money supply supported competitive and stable markets. During the mid-Ming China had gradually shifted to silver as the standard currency for large scale transactions and by the late Kangxi period, the assessment and collection of the land tax was done in silver. Landlords began only accepting rent payments in silver rather than in crops themselves, which in turn incentivized farmers to produce crops for sale in local and national markets rather than for their own personal consumption or barter. Unlike the copper coins, &quot;qian&quot; or cash, used mainly for smaller transactions, silver was not reliably minted into a coin but rather was traded in units of weight: the &quot;liang&quot; or &quot;tael&quot;, which equaled roughly 1.3 ounces of silver. A third-party had to be brought in to assess the weight and purity of the silver, resulting in an extra &quot;meltage fee&quot; added on to the price of transaction. Furthermore, since the &quot;meltage fee&quot; was unregulated it was the source of corruption. The Yongzheng emperor cracked down on the corrupt &quot;meltage fees&quot;, legalizing and regulating them so that they could be collected as a tax. From this newly increased public coffer, the Yongzheng emperor increased the salaries of the officials who collected them, further legitimising silver as the standard currency of the Qing economy.

===Urbanisation and the proliferation of market-towns===
The second commercial revolution also had a profound effect on the dispersion of the Qing populace. Up until the late Ming there existed a stark contrast between the rural countryside and cities because extraction of surplus crops from the countryside was traditionally done by the state. However, as commercialisation expanded in the late-Ming and early-Qing, mid-sized cities began popping up to direct the flow of domestic, commercial trade. Some towns of this nature had such a large volume of trade and merchants flowing through them that they developed into full-fledged market-towns. Some of these more active market-towns even developed into small cities and became home to the new rising merchant class. The proliferation of these mid-sized cities was only made possible by advancements in long-distance transportation and communication. As more and more Chinese citizens were travelling the country conducting trade they increasingly found themselves in a far-away place needing a place to stay; in response the market saw the expansion of guild halls to house these merchants.

Full-fledged trade guilds emerged, which, among other things, issued regulatory codes and price schedules, and provided a place for travelling merchants to stay and conduct their business. Along with the &quot;huiguan&quot; trade guilds, guild halls dedicated to more specific professions, &quot;gongsuo&quot;, began to appear and to control commercial craft or artisanal industries such as carpentry, weaving, banking, and medicine. By the nineteenth century guild halls worked to transform urban areas into cosmopolitan, multi-cultural hubs, staged theatre performances open to general public, developed real estate by pooling funds together in the style of a trust, and some even facilitated the development of social services such as maintaining streets, water supply, and sewage facilities.

===Trade with the West===
In 1685, the Kangxi emperor legalised private maritime trade along the coast, establishing a series of customs stations in major port cities. The customs station at Guangzhou became by far the most active in foreign trade; by the late Kangxi reign, more than forty mercantile houses specialising in trade with the West had appeared. The Yongzheng emperor made a parent corporation comprising those forty individual houses in 1725 known as the Cohong system. Firmly established by 1757, the Canton Cohong was an association of thirteen business firms that had been awarded exclusive rights to conduct trade with Western merchants in Canton. Until its abolition after the Opium War in 1842, the Canton Cohong system was the only permitted avenue of Western trade into China, and thus became a booming hub of international trade. By the eighteenth century, the most significant export China had was tea. British demand for tea increased exponentially up until they figured out how to grow it for themselves in the hills of northern India in the 1880s. By the end of the eighteenth century, tea exports going through the Canton Cohong system amounted to one-tenth of the revenue from taxes collected from the British and nearly the entire revenue of the British East India Company; in fact, until the early nineteenth century tea comprised ninety percent of exports leaving Canton.

=== Revenue ===

The recorded revenues of the central Qing government increased little over the course of the 18th and early 19th century from 36,106,483 taels in 1725 to 43,343,978 taels in 1812 before declining to 38,600,570 taels in 1841, the land tax was the principal source of revenue for the central government with the salt, customs and poll taxes being important secondary sources. Following the Opium Wars and the opening of China to foreign trade and the mid-century rebellions, two further important sources of revenue were added: the foreign maritime customs revenue and the &quot;likin&quot; revenue though only 20% of the likin revenue was actually given by the provinces to Hu Pu (board of revenue) in Beijing the rest remaining in provincial hands, the Hu Pu also managed to raise some miscellaneous taxes and increased the rate of the salt tax these measures doubled revenue by the late 19th century, this however was insufficient for the central government which was facing numerous crises and wars during the period and 9 foreign loans amounting to 40mil taels were contracted by the Qing government prior to 1890.

It was estimated in the 1850s that wages around the capital of Beijing and the Yangtze delta region for a farmer was between 0.99 and 1.02 taels a month; assuming every day was worked, this would amount to roughly 12 taels a year with over 400,000,000 citizens in 1890 the level of taxation was extremely low.

The Financial Reorganisation bureau of the Dynasty (established in 1909) estimated total revenue to be 292,000,000 taels. H.B. Morse estimated in the early 1900s a total of 284,150,000 taels of which 99,062,000 taels was spent by the Central government, 142,374,000 taels by the provincial governments and the remainder by the local government. In 1911 the Consultative assembly estimated total revenue to be 301,910,297 taels. Included in this figure was over 44,000,000 taels from the Likin of which only 13,000,000 was reported to Beijing.

The Qing government during and following the First Sino-Japanese war increasingly took on loans to meet its expenditure requirements a total of 746,220,453 taels of which slightly over 330,000,000 taels was for Railway construction and the repayment to come from the revenues of the railways themselves thus these loans did not burden the central government finances. A relatively small sum of just over 25,500,000 taels was borrowed for industrial projects, over 5,000,000 taels for Telegraph lines with less than 1,000,000 taels for miscellaneous purposes. The remainder was primarily for the costs of the Sino-Japanese war and the indemnity in the Treaty of Shimonoseki amounting to over 382,000,000 taels.

Taizu noted that these figures for formal taxation only amounted to half of the total taxation and therefore revenue of the government with these surcharges being levied at a local level by local officials who found the level of taxation far too low to support even basic governance, despite the ability to levy surcharges belonging solely to the central government.

==Science and technology==

Chinese scholars, court academies, and local officials carried on late Ming dynasty strengths in astronomy, mathematics, and geography, as well as technologies in ceramics, metallurgy, water transport, printing. Contrary to stereotypes in some Western writing, 16th and 17th century Qing dynasty officials and literati eagerly explored the technology and science introduced by Jesuit missionaries. Manchu leaders employed Jesuits to use cannon and gunpowder to great effect in the conquest of China, and the court sponsored their research in astronomy. The aim of these efforts, however, was to reform and improve inherited science and technology, not to replace it. Scientific knowledge advanced during the Qing, but there was not a change in the way this knowledge was organised or the way scientific evidence was defined or its truth tested. Those who studied the physical universe shared their findings with each other and identified themselves as men of science, but they did not have a separate and independent professional role with its own training and advancement. They were still literati.

The Opium Wars, however, demonstrated the power of steam engine and military technology that had only recently been put into practice in the West. During the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s and 1870s Confucian officials in several coastal provinces established an industrial base in military technology. The introduction of railroads into China raised questions that were more political than technological. A British company built the Shanghai–Woosung line in 1876, obtaining the land under false pretenses, and it was soon torn up. Court officials feared local public opinion and that railways would help invaders, harm farmlands, and obstruct feng shui. To keep development in Chinese hands, the Qing government borrowed 34 billion taels of silver from foreign lenders for railway construction between 1894 and 1911. As late as 1900, only were in operation. Finally, of railway was completed. The British and French after 1905 opened lines to Burma and Vietnam.

Protestant missionaries by the 1830s translated and printed Western science and medical textbooks. The textbooks found homes in the rapidly enlarging network of missionary schools and universities. The textbooks opened learning open possibilities for the small number of Chinese students interested in science, and a very small number interested in technology. After 1900, Japan had a greater role in bringing modern science and technology to Chinese audiences but even then they reached chiefly the children of the rich landowning gentry.

==Arts and culture==

Under the Qing, inherited forms of art flourished and innovations occurred at many levels and in many types. High levels of literacy, a successful publishing industry, prosperous cities, and the Confucian emphasis on cultivation all fed a lively and creative set of cultural fields.

By the end of the 19th century, national artistic and cultural worlds had begun to come to terms with the cosmopolitan culture of the West and Japan. The decision to stay within old forms or welcome Western models was now a conscious choice. Classically trained Confucian scholars such as Liang Qichao and Wang Guowei read widely and broke aesthetic and critical ground later cultivated in the New Culture Movement.

===Fine arts===

The Qing emperors were generally adept at poetry and often skilled in painting, and offered their patronage to Confucian culture. The Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors, for instance, embraced Chinese traditions both to control them and to proclaim their own legitimacy. The Kangxi Emperor sponsored the &quot;Peiwen Yunfu&quot;, a rhyme dictionary published in 1711, and the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot; published in 1716, which remains to this day an authoritative reference. The Qianlong Emperor sponsored the largest collection of writings in Chinese history, the &quot;Complete Library of the Four Treasuries&quot;, completed in 1782. Court painters made new versions of the Song masterpiece, Zhang Zeduan&#x27;s &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot;, whose depiction of a prosperous and happy realm demonstrated the beneficence of the emperor. The emperors undertook tours of the south and commissioned monumental scrolls to depict the grandeur of the occasion. Imperial patronage also encouraged the industrial production of ceramics and Chinese export porcelain. Peking glassware became popular after European glass making processes were introduced by Jesuits to Beijing. During this period the European trend to imitate Chinese artistic traditions, known as chinoiserie also gained great popularity in Europe due to the rise in trade with China and the broader current of Orientalism.
Yet the most impressive aesthetic works were done among the scholars and urban elite. Calligraphy and painting remained a central interest to both court painters and scholar-officials who considered the four arts part of their cultural identity and social standing. The painting of the early years of the dynasty included such painters as the orthodox Four Wangs and the individualists Bada Shanren and Shitao. Court painting of the dynasty was also greatly influenced by some Western artists. The 19th century saw such innovations as the Shanghai School and the Lingnan School, which used the technical skills of tradition to set the stage for modern painting.

===Traditional learning and literature===
Traditional learning flourished, especially among Ming loyalists such as Dai Zhen and Gu Yanwu, but scholars in the school of evidential learning made innovations in skeptical textual scholarship. Scholar-bureaucrats, including Lin Zexu and Wei Yuan, developed a school of practical statecraft which rooted bureaucratic reform and restructuring in classical philosophy.
Philosophy and literature grew to new heights in the Qing period. Poetry continued as a mark of the cultivated gentleman, but women wrote in larger numbers and poets came from all walks of life. The poetry of the Qing dynasty is a lively field of research, being studied (along with the poetry of the Ming dynasty) for its association with Chinese opera, developmental trends of Classical Chinese poetry, the transition to a greater role for vernacular language, and for poetry by women. The Qing dynasty was a period of literary editing and criticism, and many of the modern popular versions of Classical Chinese poems were transmitted through Qing dynasty anthologies, such as the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot; and the &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;. Although fiction did not have the prestige of poetry, novels flourished. Pu Songling brought the short story to a new level in his &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot;, published in the mid-18th century, and Shen Fu demonstrated the charm of the informal memoir in &quot;Six Chapters of a Floating Life&quot;, written in the early 19th century but published only in 1877. The art of the novel reached a pinnacle in Cao Xueqin&#x27;s &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, but its combination of social commentary and psychological insight were echoed in highly skilled novels such as Wu Jingzi&#x27;s &quot;The Scholars&quot; (1750) and Li Ruzhen&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Mirror&quot; (1827).

===Cuisine===
Cuisine embodied cultural pride. The gentleman gourmet, such as Yuan Mei, applied aesthetic standards to the art of cooking, eating, and appreciation of tea at a time when New World crops and products entered everyday life. Yuan&#x27;s &quot;Suiyuan Shidan&quot; expounded culinary aesthetics and theory, along with a range of recipes. The Manchu–Han Imperial Feast originated at the court. Although this banquet was probably never common, it reflected an appreciation of Manchu culinary customs.

==Historiography==

The Confucian concept of the dynastic cycle was used by traditional Chinese historiography to organise China&#x27;s past in terms of consecutive ruling houses that arose and collapsed. The Qing dynasty was the closing chapter of the 2000-year history of Imperial China. John King Fairbank of Harvard University, a historian who is essentially credited with founding modern Chinese history in the United States, steadfastly maintained a perspective that split the history of China&#x27;s past half millennium around 1842. All that fell before remained part of &quot;traditional China&quot;, and with the Western &quot;shock&quot; of the First Opium War and the resulting Treaty of Nanking, &quot;modern China&quot; was born. The Qing dynasty was thus bifurcated in this manner. In contemporary China, there is also a similar view for such a division.

The New Qing History is a revisionist historiographical school that emerged in the mid-1990s and emphasises the particular Manchu character of the dynasty. Earlier historians had emphasised a pattern of Han sinicisation of various conquerors. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began learning the Manchu language, taking advantage of archival holdings in this and other non-Chinese languages that had long been held in Taipei and Beijing but had previously attracted little scholarly attention. This research concluded that the Manchu rulers &#x27;manipulated&#x27; their subjects by fostering a sense of Manchu identity, often adopting Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. The most prominent feature of the studies has been characterised by a renewed interest in the Manchus and their relationship to China and Chinese culture, as well as that of other non-Han groups ruled by Beijing.

William T. Rowe of Johns Hopkins University wrote that the name &quot;China&quot; (中國; 中華) was generally understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese during the Ming dynasty, and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty, and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the Ming-Qing transition. The Qing dynasty, however, &quot;came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also, nearly interchangeably, as China&quot; within a few decades of this development. Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state, this new Qing China was a &quot;self-consciously multi-ethnic state&quot;. Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this, but by the 19th century, the notion of China as a multinational state with new, significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers. Rowe noted that &quot;these were the origins of the China we know today&quot;.

<text>Quantum gravity (QG) is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics. It deals with environments in which neither gravitational nor quantum effects can be ignored, such as in the vicinity of black holes or similar compact astrophysical objects, as well as in the early stages of the universe moments after the Big Bang.

Three of the four fundamental forces of nature are described within the framework of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory: the electromagnetic interaction, the strong force, and the weak force; this leaves gravity as the only interaction that has not been fully accommodated. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity, which incorporates his theory of special relativity and deeply modifies the understanding of concepts like time and space. Although general relativity is highly regarded for its elegance and accuracy, it has limitations: the gravitational singularities inside black holes, the ad hoc postulation of dark matter, as well as dark energy and its relation to the cosmological constant are among the current unsolved mysteries regarding gravity, all of which signal the collapse of the general theory of relativity at different scales and highlight the need for a gravitational theory that goes into the quantum realm. At distances close to the Planck length, like those near the center of a black hole, quantum fluctuations of spacetime are expected to play an important role. Finally, the discrepancies between the predicted value for the vacuum energy and the observed values (which, depending on considerations, can be of 60 or 120 orders of magnitude) highlight the necessity for a quantum theory of gravity.

The field of quantum gravity is actively developing, and theorists are exploring a variety of approaches to the problem of quantum gravity, the most popular being M-theory and loop quantum gravity. All of these approaches aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field, which does not necessarily include unifying all fundamental interactions into a single mathematical framework. However, many approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, try to develop a framework that describes all fundamental forces. Such a theory is often referred to as a theory of everything. Some of the approaches, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces. Other lesser-known but no less important theories include causal dynamical triangulation, noncommutative geometry, and twistor theory.

One of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that direct observation of quantum gravitational effects is thought to only appear at length scales near the Planck scale, around 10−35 meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy particle accelerators. Therefore, physicists lack experimental data which could distinguish between the competing theories which have been proposed.

Thought experiment approaches have been suggested as a testing tool for quantum gravity theories. In the field of quantum gravity there are several open questions – e.g., it is not known how spin of elementary particles sources gravity, and thought experiments could provide a pathway to explore possible resolutions to these questions, even in the absence of lab experiments or physical observations.

In the early 21st century, new experiment designs and technologies have arisen which suggest that indirect approaches to testing quantum gravity may be feasible over the next few decades. This field of study is called phenomenological quantum gravity.

== Overview ==


Much of the difficulty in meshing these theories at all energy scales comes from the different assumptions that these theories make on how the universe works. General relativity models gravity as curvature of spacetime: in the slogan of John Archibald Wheeler, &quot;Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.&quot; On the other hand, quantum field theory is typically formulated in the &quot;flat&quot; spacetime used in special relativity. No theory has yet proven successful in describing the general situation where the dynamics of matter, modeled with quantum mechanics, affect the curvature of spacetime. If one attempts to treat gravity as simply another quantum field, the resulting theory is not renormalizable. Even in the simpler case where the curvature of spacetime is fixed &quot;a priori&quot;, developing quantum field theory becomes more mathematically challenging, and many ideas physicists use in quantum field theory on flat spacetime are no longer applicable.

It is widely hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would allow us to understand problems of very high energy and very small dimensions of space, such as the behavior of black holes, and the origin of the universe.

One major obstacle is that for quantum field theory in curved spacetime with a fixed metric, bosonic/fermionic operator fields supercommute for spacelike separated points. (This is a way of imposing a principle of locality.) However, in quantum gravity, the metric is dynamical, so that whether two points are spacelike separated depends on the state. In fact, they can be in a quantum superposition of being spacelike and not spacelike separated.

== Quantum mechanics and general relativity ==

=== Graviton ===

The observation that all fundamental forces except gravity have one or more known messenger particles leads researchers to believe that at least one must exist for gravity. This hypothetical particle is known as the &quot;graviton&quot;. These particles act as a force particle similar to the photon of the electromagnetic interaction. Under mild assumptions, the structure of general relativity requires them to follow the quantum mechanical description of interacting theoretical spin-2 massless particles. Many of the accepted notions of a unified theory of physics since the 1970s assume, and to some degree depend upon, the existence of the graviton. The Weinberg–Witten theorem places some constraints on theories in which the graviton is a composite particle. While gravitons are an important theoretical step in a quantum mechanical description of gravity, they are generally believed to be undetectable because they interact too weakly.

=== Nonrenormalizability of gravity ===

General relativity, like electromagnetism, is a classical field theory. One might expect that, as with electromagnetism, the gravitational force should also have a corresponding quantum field theory.

However, gravity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable. For a quantum field theory to be well defined according to this understanding of the subject, it must be asymptotically free or asymptotically safe. The theory must be characterized by a choice of &quot;finitely many&quot; parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in quantum electrodynamics these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.

On the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, &quot;infinitely many independent parameters&quot; (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the renormalization group tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then &quot;every one&quot; of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.

It is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal perturbation theory is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really &quot;is&quot; a UV fixed point for gravity. Since this is a question of non-perturbative quantum field theory, finding a reliable answer is difficult, pursued in the asymptotic safety program. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set. This is the route taken by string theory, where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.

=== Quantum gravity as an effective field theory ===

In an effective field theory, not all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects. Thus, at least in the low-energy regime, the model is a predictive quantum field theory. Furthermore, many theorists argue that the Standard Model should be regarded as an effective field theory itself, with &quot;nonrenormalizable&quot; interactions suppressed by large energy scales and whose effects have consequently not been observed experimentally.

By treating general relativity as an effective field theory, one can actually make legitimate predictions for quantum gravity, at least for low-energy phenomena. An example is the well-known calculation of the tiny first-order quantum-mechanical correction to the classical Newtonian gravitational potential between two masses. Another example is the calculation of the corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula.

=== Spacetime background dependence ===

A fundamental lesson of general relativity is that there is no fixed spacetime background, as found in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity; the spacetime geometry is dynamic. While simple to grasp in principle, this is a complex idea to understand about general relativity, and its consequences are profound and not fully explored, even at the classical level. To a certain extent, general relativity can be seen to be a relational theory, in which the only physically relevant information is the relationship between different events in spacetime.

On the other hand, quantum mechanics has depended since its inception on a fixed background (non-dynamic) structure. In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, Minkowski spacetime is the fixed background of the theory.

==== String theory ====

String theory can be seen as a generalization of quantum field theory where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamic way.
Although string theory had its origins in the study of quark confinement and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the graviton, and that &quot;condensation&quot; of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a perturbation theory that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the AdS/CFT correspondence) which is a weak form of background dependence.

==== Background independent theories ====
Loop quantum gravity is the fruit of an effort to formulate a background-independent quantum theory.

Topological quantum field theory provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including spin networks.

=== Semi-classical quantum gravity ===

Quantum field theory on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.

Phenomena such as the Unruh effect, in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds). The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).

=== Problem of time ===

A conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks. In quantum theories, time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, with the Hamiltonian operator acting as the generator of infinitesimal translations of quantum states through time. In contrast, general relativity treats time as a dynamical variable which relates directly with matter and moreover requires the Hamiltonian constraint to vanish. Because this variability of time has been observed macroscopically, it removes any possibility of employing a fixed notion of time, similar to the conception of time in quantum theory, at the macroscopic level.

== Candidate theories ==
There are a number of proposed quantum gravity theories. Currently, there is still no complete and consistent quantum theory of gravity, and the candidate models still need to overcome major formal and conceptual problems. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests, although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments become available.

=== String theory ===

The central idea of string theory is to replace the classical concept of a point particle in quantum field theory with a quantum theory of one-dimensional extended objects: string theory. At the energies reached in current experiments, these strings are indistinguishable from point-like particles, but, crucially, different modes of oscillation of one and the same type of fundamental string appear as particles with different (electric and other) charges. In this way, string theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions. The theory is successful in that one mode will always correspond to a graviton, the messenger particle of gravity; however, the price of this success is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three for space and one for time.

In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity. As presently understood, however, string theory admits a very large number (10500 by some estimates) of consistent vacua, comprising the so-called &quot;string landscape&quot;. Sorting through this large family of solutions remains a major challenge.

=== Loop quantum gravity ===
Loop quantum gravity seriously considers general relativity&#x27;s insight that spacetime is a dynamical field and is therefore a quantum object. Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.

The main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length. This is derived from the following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectra. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space. It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.

The quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called spin networks. Spin networks were initially introduced by Roger Penrose in abstract form, and later shown by Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity. Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.

The theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as Ashtekar variables, which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of electric and magnetic fields. In the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.

The dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions. One version starts with the canonical quantization of general relativity. The analogue of the Schrödinger equation is a Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which can be defined within the theory. In the covariant, or spinfoam formulation of the theory, the quantum dynamics is obtained via a sum over discrete versions of spacetime, called spinfoams. These represent histories of spin networks.

=== Other theories ===
There are a number of other approaches to quantum gravity. The theories differ depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and which features are modified. Such theories include:
== Experimental tests ==
As was emphasized above, quantum gravitational effects are extremely weak and therefore difficult to test. For this reason, the possibility of experimentally testing quantum gravity had not received much attention prior to the late 1990s. However, since the 2000s, physicists have realized that evidence for quantum gravitational effects can guide the development of the theory. Since theoretical development has been slow, the field of phenomenological quantum gravity, which studies the possibility of experimental tests, has obtained increased attention.

The most widely pursued possibilities for quantum gravity phenomenology include gravitationally mediated entanglement,
violations of Lorentz invariance, imprints of quantum gravitational effects in the cosmic microwave background (in particular its polarization), and decoherence induced by fluctuations in the space-time foam. The latter scenario has been searched for in light from gamma-ray bursts and both astrophysical and atmospheric neutrinos, placing limits on phenomenological quantum gravity parameters.

ESA&#x27;s INTEGRAL satellite measured polarization of photons of different wavelengths and was able to place a limit in the granularity of space that is less than 10−48 m, or 13 orders of magnitude below the Planck scale.

The BICEP2 experiment detected what was initially thought to be primordial B-mode polarization caused by gravitational waves in the early universe. Had the signal in fact been primordial in origin, it could have been an indication of quantum gravitational effects, but it soon transpired that the polarization was due to interstellar dust interference.

<text>Quality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network, or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc.

In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priorities to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow.

Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced Voice over IP technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as supporting new applications with even stricter network performance requirements.

==Definitions==
In the field of telephony, quality of service was defined by the ITU in 1994. Quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection, such as service response time, loss, signal-to-noise ratio, crosstalk, echo, interrupts, frequency response, loudness levels, and so on. A subset of telephony QoS is grade of service (GoS) requirements, which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network, for example guaranteed maximum blocking probability and outage probability.

In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, teletraffic engineering refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priorities to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required bit rate, delay, delay variation, packet loss or bit error rates may be guaranteed. Quality of service is important for real-time streaming multimedia applications such as voice over IP, multiplayer online games and IPTV, since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive. Quality of service is especially important in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.

A network or protocol that supports QoS may agree on a traffic contract with the application software and reserve capacity in the network nodes, for example during a session establishment phase. During the session it may monitor the achieved level of performance, for example the data rate and delay, and dynamically control scheduling priorities in the network nodes. It may release the reserved capacity during a tear down phase.

A best-effort network or service does not support quality of service. An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best-effort network by over-provisioning the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load. The resulting absence of network congestion reduces or eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms.

QoS is sometimes used as a quality measure, with many alternative definitions, rather than referring to the ability to reserve resources. Quality of service sometimes refers to the level of quality of service, i.e. the guaranteed service quality. High QoS is often confused with a high level of performance, for example high bit rate, low latency and low bit error rate.

QoS is sometimes used in application layer services such as telephony and streaming video to describe a metric that reflects or predicts the subjectively experienced quality. In this context, QoS is the acceptable cumulative effect on subscriber satisfaction of all imperfections affecting the service. Other terms with similar meaning are the quality of experience (QoE), mean opinion score (MOS), perceptual speech quality measure (PSQM) and perceptual evaluation of video quality (PEVQ).

==History==

A number of attempts for layer 2 technologies that add QoS tags to the data have gained popularity in the past. Examples are Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) (a technique between layer 2 and 3). Despite these network technologies remaining in use today, this kind of network lost attention after the advent of Ethernet networks. Today Ethernet is, by far, the most popular layer 2 technology. Conventional Internet routers and network switches operate on a best-effort basis. This equipment is less expensive, less complex and faster and thus more popular than earlier more complex technologies that provide QoS mechanisms.

Ethernet optionally uses 802.1p to signal the priority of a frame.

There were four &quot;type of service&quot; bits and three &quot;precedence&quot; bits originally provided in each IP packet header, but they were not generally respected. These bits were later re-defined as Differentiated services code points (DSCP).

With the advent of IPTV and IP telephony, QoS mechanisms are increasingly available to the end user.

==Qualities of traffic==
In packet-switched networks, quality of service is affected by various factors, which can be divided into human and technical factors. Human factors include: stability of service quality, availability of service, waiting times and user information. Technical factors include: reliability, scalability, effectiveness, maintainability and network congestion.

Many things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination, resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver:

; Goodput: Due to varying load from disparate users sharing the same network resources, the maximum throughput that can be provided to a certain data stream may be too low for real-time multimedia services.
; Packet loss: The network may fail to deliver (&quot;drop&quot;) some packets due to network congestion. The receiving application may ask for this information to be retransmitted, possibly resulting in congestive collapse or unacceptable delays in the overall transmission.
; Errors: Sometimes packets are corrupted due to bit errors caused by noise and interference, especially in wireless communications and long copper wires. The receiver has to detect this, and, just as if the packet was dropped, may ask for this information to be retransmitted.
; Latency: It might take a long time for each packet to reach its destination because it gets held up in long queues, or it takes a less direct route to avoid congestion. In some cases, excessive latency can render an application such as VoIP or online gaming unusable.
; Packet delay variation: Packets from the source will reach the destination with different delays. A packet&#x27;s delay varies with its position in the queues of the routers along the path between source and destination, and this position can vary unpredictably. Delay variation can be absorbed at the receiver, but in so doing increases the overall latency for the stream.
; Out-of-order delivery: When a collection of related packets is routed through a network, different packets may take different routes, each resulting in a different delay. The result is that the packets arrive in a different order than they were sent. This problem requires special additional protocols for rearranging out-of-order packets. The reordering process requires additional buffering at the receiver, and, as with packet delay variation, increases the overall latency for the stream.

==Applications==
A defined quality of service may be desired or required for certain types of network traffic, for example:
* Streaming media specifically
** Internet Protocol television (IPTV)
** Audio over Ethernet
** Audio over IP
* Voice over IP (VoIP)
* Videotelephony
* Telepresence
* Storage applications such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel over Ethernet
* Circuit emulation service
* Safety-critical applications such as remote surgery where availability issues can be hazardous
* Network operations support systems either for the network itself, or for customers&#x27; business critical needs
* Online games where real-time lag can be a factor
* Industrial control systems protocols such as EtherNet/IP which are used for real-time control of machinery

These types of service are called &quot;inelastic&quot;, meaning that they require a certain minimum bit rate and a certain maximum latency to function. By contrast, &quot;elastic&quot; applications can take advantage of however much or little bandwidth is available. Bulk file transfer applications that rely on TCP are generally elastic.

==Mechanisms==
Circuit switched networks, especially those intended for voice transmission, such as ATM or GSM, have QoS in the core protocol, resources are reserved at each step on the network for the call as it is set up, there is no need for additional procedures to achieve required performance. Shorter data units and built-in QoS were some of the unique selling points of ATM for applications such as video on demand.

When the expense of mechanisms to provide QoS is justified, network customers and providers can enter into a contractual agreement termed a service-level agreement (SLA) which specifies guarantees for the ability of a connection to give guaranteed performance in terms of throughput or latency based on mutually agreed measures.

===Over-provisioning===
An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over-provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates. This approach is simple for networks with predictable peak loads. This calculation may need to appreciate demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers, which is often possible for example in video streaming.

Over-provisioning can be of limited use in the face of transport protocols (such as TCP) that over time increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped. Such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users.

The amount of over-provisioning in interior links required to replace QoS depends on the number of users and their traffic demands. This limits usability of over-provisioning. Newer more bandwidth intensive applications and the addition of more users results in the loss of over-provisioned networks. This then requires a physical update of the relevant network links which is an expensive process. Thus over-provisioning cannot be blindly assumed on the Internet.

Commercial VoIP services are often competitive with traditional telephone service in terms of call quality even without QoS mechanisms in use on the user&#x27;s connection to their ISP and the VoIP provider&#x27;s connection to a different ISP. Under high load conditions, however, VoIP may degrade to cell-phone quality or worse. The mathematics of packet traffic indicate that network requires just 60% more raw capacity under conservative assumptions.

===IP and Ethernet efforts===
Unlike single-owner networks, the Internet is a series of exchange points interconnecting private networks. Hence the Internet&#x27;s core is owned and managed by a number of different network service providers, not a single entity. Its behavior is much more unpredictable.

There are two principal approaches to QoS in modern packet-switched IP networks, a parameterized system based on an exchange of application requirements with the network, and a prioritized system where each packet identifies a desired service level to the network.
*Integrated services (&quot;IntServ&quot;) implements the parameterized approach. In this model, applications use the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to request and reserve resources through a network.
*Differentiated services (&quot;DiffServ&quot;) implements the prioritized model. DiffServ marks packets according to the type of service they desire. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various scheduling strategies to tailor performance to expectations. Differentiated services code point (DSCP) markings use the first 6 bits in the ToS field (now renamed as the DS field) of the IP(v4) packet header.

Early work used the integrated services (IntServ) philosophy of reserving network resources. In this model, applications used RSVP to request and reserve resources through a network. While IntServ mechanisms do work, it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a larger service provider, Core routers would be required to accept, maintain, and tear down thousands or possibly tens of thousands of reservations. It was believed that this approach would not scale with the growth of the Internet, and in any event was antithetical to the end-to-end principle, the notion of designing networks so that core routers do little more than simply switch packets at the highest possible rates.

Under DiffServ, packets are marked either by the traffic sources themselves or by the edge devices where the traffic enters the network. In response to these markings, routers and switches use various queuing strategies to tailor performance to requirements. At the IP layer, DSCP markings use the 6 bit DS field in the IP packet header. At the MAC layer, VLAN IEEE 802.1Q can be used to carry 3 bit of essentially the same information. Routers and switches supporting DiffServ configure their network scheduler to use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from bandwidth constrained (e.g., wide area) interfaces. Router vendors provide different capabilities for configuring this behavior, to include the number of queues supported, the relative priorities of queues, and bandwidth reserved for each queue.

In practice, when a packet must be forwarded from an interface with queuing, packets requiring low jitter (e.g., VoIP or videoconferencing) are given priority over packets in other queues. Typically, some bandwidth is allocated by default to network control packets (such as Internet Control Message Protocol and routing protocols), while best-effort traffic might simply be given whatever bandwidth is left over.

At the medium access control (MAC) layer, VLAN IEEE 802.1Q and IEEE 802.1p can be used to distinguish between Ethernet frames and classify them. Queueing theory models have been developed on performance analysis and QoS for MAC layer protocols.

Cisco IOS NetFlow and the Cisco Class Based QoS (CBQoS) Management Information Base (MIB) are marketed by Cisco Systems.
One compelling example of the need for QoS on the Internet relates to congestive collapse. The Internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols, primarily as built into Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to congestive collapse. QoS applications, such as VoIP and IPTV, require largely constant bitrates and low latency, therefore they cannot use TCP and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion. Service-level agreements limit traffic that can be offered to the Internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded, and are hence an indispensable part of the Internet&#x27;s ability to handle a mix of real-time and non-real-time traffic without collapse.

===Protocols===
Several QoS mechanisms and schemes exist for IP networking.
*The type of service (ToS) field in the IPv4 header (now superseded by DiffServ)
*Differentiated services (DiffServ)
*Integrated services (IntServ)
*Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)
*RSVP-TE

QoS capabilities are available in the following network technologies.
*Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) provides eight QoS classes
*Frame Relay
*X.25
*Some DSL modems
*ATM
*Ethernet supporting IEEE 802.1Q with Audio Video Bridging and Time-Sensitive Networking
*Wi-Fi supporting IEEE 802.11e
*HomePNA home networking over coax and phone wires
*The G.hn home networking standard provides QoS by means of &quot;contention-free transmission opportunities&quot; (CFTXOPs) which are allocated to flows which require QoS and which have negotiated a contract with the network controller. G.hn also supports non-QoS operation by means of contention-based time slots.

==End-to-end quality of service==
End-to-end quality of service can require a method of coordinating resource allocation between one autonomous system and another. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defined the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) for bandwidth reservation as a proposed standard in 1997. RSVP is an end-to-end bandwidth reservation and admission control protocol. RSVP was not widely adopted due to scalability limitations. The more scalable traffic engineering version, RSVP-TE, is used in many networks to establish traffic-engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) label-switched paths. The IETF also defined Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) with QoS signalling as a target. NSIS is a development and simplification of RSVP.

Research consortia such as &quot;end-to-end quality of service support over heterogeneous networks&quot; (EuQoS, from 2004 through 2007) and fora such as the IPsphere Forum developed more mechanisms for handshaking QoS invocation from one domain to the next. IPsphere defined the Service Structuring Stratum (SSS) signaling bus in order to establish, invoke and (attempt to) assure network services. EuQoS conducted experiments to integrate Session Initiation Protocol, Next Steps in Signaling and IPsphere&#x27;s SSS with an estimated cost of about 15.6 million Euro and published a book.

A research project Multi Service Access Everywhere (MUSE) defined another QoS concept in a first phase from January 2004 through February 2006, and a second phase from January 2006 through 2007. Another research project named PlaNetS was proposed for European funding circa 2005.
A broader European project called &quot;Architecture and design for the future Internet&quot; known as 4WARD had a budget estimated at 23.4 million Euro and was funded from January 2008 through June 2010.
It included a &quot;Quality of Service Theme&quot; and published a book. Another European project, called WIDENS (Wireless Deployable Network System), proposed a bandwidth reservation approach for mobile wireless multirate adhoc networks.

==Limitations==
Strong cryptography network protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer, I2P, and virtual private networks obscure the data transferred using them. As all electronic commerce on the Internet requires the use of such strong cryptography protocols, unilaterally downgrading the performance of encrypted traffic creates an unacceptable hazard for customers. Yet, encrypted traffic is otherwise unable to undergo deep packet inspection for QoS.

Protocols like ICA and RDP may encapsulate other traffic (e.g. printing, video streaming) with varying requirements that can make optimization difficult.

The Internet2 project found, in 2001, that the QoS protocols were probably not deployable inside its Abilene Network with equipment available at that time. The group predicted that &quot;logistical, financial, and organizational barriers will block the way toward any bandwidth guarantees&quot; by protocol modifications aimed at QoS.
They believed that the economics would encourage network providers to deliberately erode the quality of best effort traffic as a way to push customers to higher priced QoS services. Instead they proposed over-provisioning of capacity as more cost-effective at the time.

The Abilene network study was the basis for the testimony of Gary Bachula to the US Senate Commerce Committee&#x27;s hearing on Network Neutrality in early 2006. He expressed the opinion that adding more bandwidth was more effective than any of the various schemes for accomplishing QoS they examined. Bachula&#x27;s testimony has been cited by proponents of a law banning quality of service as proof that no legitimate purpose is served by such an offering. This argument is dependent on the assumption that over-provisioning isn&#x27;t a form of QoS and that it is always possible. Cost and other factors affect the ability of carriers to build and maintain permanently over-provisioned networks.

==Mobile (cellular) QoS==

Mobile cellular service providers may offer mobile QoS to customers just as the wired public switched telephone network services providers and Internet service providers may offer QoS. QoS mechanisms are always provided for circuit switched services, and are essential for inelastic services, for example streaming multimedia.

Mobility adds complications to QoS mechanisms. A phone call or other session may be interrupted after a handover if the new base station is overloaded. Unpredictable handovers make it impossible to give an absolute QoS guarantee during the session initiation phase.

==Standards==
Quality of service in the field of telephony was first defined in 1994 in ITU-T Recommendation E.800. This definition is very broad, listing 6 primary components: Support, Operability, Accessibility, Retainability, Integrity and Security. In 1998 the ITU published a document discussing QoS in the field of data networking. X.641 offers a means of developing or enhancing standards related to QoS and provide concepts and terminology that should assist in maintaining the consistency of related standards.

Some QoS-related IETF Request for Comments (RFC)s are , and ; both these are discussed above. The IETF has also published two RFCs giving background on QoS: , and .

The IETF has also published as an informative or &quot;best practices&quot; document about the practical aspects of designing a QoS solution for a DiffServ network. The document tries to identify applications commonly run over an IP network, groups them into traffic classes, studies the treatment required by these classes from the network, and suggests which of the QoS mechanisms commonly available in routers can be used to implement those treatments.

<text>Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information. It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (&quot;modulating&quot;) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves are of the same frequency and are out of phase with each other by 90°, a condition known as orthogonality or quadrature. The transmitted signal is created by adding the two carrier waves together. At the receiver, the two waves can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality. Another key property is that the modulations are low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to the carrier frequency, which is known as the narrowband assumption.

Phase modulation (analog PM) and phase-shift keying (digital PSK) can be regarded as a special case of QAM, where the amplitude of the transmitted signal is a constant, but its phase varies. This can also be extended to frequency modulation (FM) and frequency-shift keying (FSK), for these can be regarded as a special case of phase modulation. 

QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital communications systems, such as in 802.11 Wi-Fi standards. Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel.  QAM is being used in optical fiber systems as bit rates increase; QAM16 and QAM64 can be optically emulated with a three-path interferometer.

== Demodulation ==

In a QAM signal, one carrier lags the other by 90°, and its amplitude modulation is customarily referred to as the in-phase component, denoted by The other modulating function is the quadrature component, So the composite waveform is mathematically modeled as:

:formula_1     or:
where is the carrier frequency.  At the receiver, a coherent demodulator multiplies the received signal separately with both a cosine and sine signal to produce the received estimates of and . For example:

:formula_2

Using standard trigonometric identities, we can write this as:

:formula_3

Low-pass filtering removes the high frequency terms (containing ), leaving only the term. This filtered signal is unaffected by showing that the in-phase component can be received independently of the quadrature component.  Similarly, we can multiply by a sine wave and then low-pass filter to extract 

The addition of two sinusoids is a linear operation that creates no new frequency components. So the bandwidth of the composite signal is comparable to the bandwidth of the DSB (double-sideband) components. Effectively, the spectral redundancy of DSB enables a doubling of the information capacity using this technique. This comes at the expense of demodulation complexity. In particular, a DSB signal has zero-crossings at a regular frequency, which makes it easy to recover the phase of the carrier sinusoid. It is said to be self-clocking. But the sender and receiver of a quadrature-modulated signal must share a clock or otherwise send a clock signal. If the clock phases drift apart, the demodulated &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; signals bleed into each other, yielding crosstalk. In this context, the clock signal is called a &quot;phase reference&quot;. Clock synchronization is typically achieved by transmitting a burst subcarrier or a pilot signal. The phase reference for NTSC, for example, is included within its colorburst signal.

Analog QAM is used in:
* NTSC and PAL analog color television systems, where the I- and Q-signals carry the components of chroma (colour) information. The QAM carrier phase is recovered from a special colorburst transmitted at the beginning of each scan line.
* C-QUAM (&quot;Compatible QAM&quot;) is used in AM stereo radio to carry the stereo difference information.

== Fourier analysis ==

Applying Euler&#x27;s formula to the sinusoids in , the positive-frequency portion of (or analytic representation) is:

:formula_4

where formula_5 denotes the Fourier transform, and and are the transforms of and This result represents the sum of two DSB-SC signals with the same center frequency. The factor of represents the 90° phase shift that enables their individual demodulations.

== Digital QAM ==
As in many digital modulation schemes, the constellation diagram is useful for QAM. In QAM, the constellation points are usually arranged in a square grid with equal vertical and horizontal spacing, although other configurations are possible (e.g. a hexagonal or triangular grid). In digital telecommunications the data is usually binary, so the number of points in the grid is typically a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, …), corresponding to the number of bits per symbol. The simplest and most commonly used QAM constellations consist of points arranged in a square, i.e. 16-QAM, 64-QAM and 256-QAM (even powers of two). Non-square constellations, such as Cross-QAM, can offer greater efficiency but are rarely used because of the cost of increased modem complexity.

By moving to a higher-order constellation, it is possible to transmit more bits per symbol. However, if the mean energy of the constellation is to remain the same (by way of making a fair comparison), the points must be closer together and are thus more susceptible to noise and other corruption; this results in a higher bit error rate and so higher-order QAM can deliver more data less reliably than lower-order QAM, for constant mean constellation energy. Using higher-order QAM without increasing the bit error rate requires a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by increasing signal energy, reducing noise, or both.

If data rates beyond those offered by 8-PSK are required, it is more usual to move to QAM since it achieves a greater distance between adjacent points in the I-Q plane by distributing the points more evenly. The complicating factor is that the points are no longer all the same amplitude and so the demodulator must now correctly detect both phase and amplitude, rather than just phase.

64-QAM and 256-QAM are often used in digital cable television and cable modem applications. In the United States, 64-QAM and 256-QAM are the mandated modulation schemes for digital cable (see QAM tuner) as standardised by the SCTE in the standard ANSI/SCTE 07 2013. In the UK, 64-QAM is used for digital terrestrial television (Freeview) whilst 256-QAM is used for Freeview-HD.

Communication systems designed to achieve very high levels of spectral efficiency usually employ very dense QAM constellations. For example, current Homeplug AV2 500-Mbit/s powerline Ethernet devices use 1024-QAM and 4096-QAM, as well as future devices using ITU-T G.hn standard for networking over existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines and power lines); 4096-QAM provides 12 bits/symbol. Another example is ADSL technology for copper twisted pairs, whose constellation size goes up to 32768-QAM (in ADSL terminology this is referred to as bit-loading, or bit per tone, 32768-QAM being equivalent to 15 bits per tone).

Ultra-high capacity microwave backhaul systems also use 1024-QAM. With 1024-QAM, adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) and XPIC, vendors can obtain gigabit capacity in a single 56 MHz channel.

== Interference and noise ==

In moving to a higher order QAM constellation (higher data rate and mode) in hostile RF/microwave QAM application environments, such as in broadcasting or telecommunications, multipath interference typically increases. There is a spreading of the spots in the constellation, decreasing the separation between adjacent states, making it difficult for the receiver to decode the signal appropriately. In other words, there is reduced noise immunity. There are several test parameter measurements which help determine an optimal QAM mode for a specific operating environment. The following three are most significant:
* Carrier/interference ratio
* Carrier-to-noise ratio
* Threshold-to-noise ratio

<text>Quetzalcoatlus () is a genus of azhdarchid pterosaur that lived during the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous in North America. The type specimen, recovered in 1971 from the Javelina Formation of Texas, United States, consists of several wing fragments and was described as Quetzalcoatlus northropi in 1975 by Douglas Lawson. The first part of the name refers to the Aztec serpent god of the sky, Quetzalcōātl, while the second part honors Jack Northrop, designer of a tailless fixed-wing aircraft. The remains of a second species were found between 1972 and 1974, also by Lawson, around from the &quot;Q. northropi&quot; locality. In 2021, these remains were assigned the name Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni by Brian Andres and (posthumously) Wann Langston Jr, as part of a series of publications on the genus. 

&quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot; has gained fame as a candidate for the largest flying animal ever discovered, though estimating its size has been difficult due to the fragmentary nature of the only known specimen. While wingspan estimates over the years have ranged from , more recent estimates hover around . The smaller and more complete &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; had a wingspan of around . Uniquely among azhdarchids, &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; had a small head crest, an extension of the premaxilla. Two different forms have been identified: one had a rectangular head crest and a taller nasoantorbital fenestra (a structure combining the naris and antorbital fenestra in many pterosaurs), and the other had a more rounded head crest and a shorter nasoantorbital fenestra. The proportions of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; behind the skull were typical of azhdarchids, with a very long neck and beak, shortened non-wing digits that were well adapted for walking, and a very short tail. 

Historical interpretations of the diet of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; have ranged from scavenging to skim-feeding like the modern skimmer bird. However, more recent research has found that it most likely hunted small prey on the ground, in a similar way to storks and ground hornbills. This has been dubbed the terrestrial stalking model and is thought to be a common feeding behavior among large azhdarchids. On the other hand, the second species, &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, appears to have been associated with alkaline lakes, and a diet of small aquatic invertebrates has been suggested. Similarly, while &quot;Q. northropi&quot; is speculated to have been fairly solitary, &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; appears to have been highly gregarious (social). Azhdarchids like &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; were highly terrestrial by pterosaur standards, though even the largest were nonetheless capable of flight. Based on the work of Mark P. Witton and Michael Habib in 2010, it now seems likely that pterosaurs, especially larger taxa such as &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;, launched quadrupedally (from a four-legged posture), using the powerful muscles of their forelimbs to propel themselves off the ground and into the air.

==Research history and taxonomy==
===Discovery and naming===

The genus &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; is based on fossils discovered in rocks pertaining to the Late Cretaceous Javelina Formation in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric life had been found in the area since the beginning of the 20th century. The first &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; fossils were discovered in 1971 by the graduate student Douglas A. Lawson while conducting field work for his Master&#x27;s degree project on the paleoecology of the Javelina Formation. This field work was supervised by Wann Langston Jr., an experienced paleontologist who had been doing field work in the region since 1938 and since 1963 led expeditions through his position as curator at the Texas Science and Natural History Museum. The two had first visited the park together in March 1970, with Lawson discovering the first &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; fossil from Texas. Returning in 1971, Lawson discovered a bone while investigating an arroyo on the western edge of the park, and returned to Austin with a section of it. He and Langston then identified it as a pterosaur fossil based on its hollow internal structure with thin walls. Returning in November 1971 for further excavations, they were struck by the unprecedented size of the remains compared to known pterosaurs. The initial material consisted of a giant radius and ulna, two fused wristbones known as syncarpals, and the end of the wing finger. Altogether, the material comprised a partial left wing from an individual (specimen number TMM 41450-3) later estimated at over in wingspan. Lawson described the remains in his 1972 thesis as &quot;Pteranodon gigas&quot;, and diagnosed it as being &quot;nearly twice as large as any previously described species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;&quot;. As a thesis is not recognized as a published worked by the International Code for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), &quot;Pteranodon gigas&quot; is not a valid name. Further field work at the site was conducted in March 1973, when fragments were found alongside a long and delicate bone connected to an apparently larger element. This fossil was left in the ground until April 1974, when they fully excavated the larger element, a humerus. Due to the close association of discovered remains, Langston felt confident there were nothing more to be found at the site. Several later excavations of the site have indeed been unsuccessful.

Lawson announced his discovery in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in March of 1975, with a depiction of the animal&#x27;s size compared to a large aircraft and a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; gracing the cover of the issue. Lawson wrote that it was &quot;without doubt the largest flying animal presently known&quot;. He illustrated and briefly described the remains known at the time, but did not offer a name and indicated that a more extensive description was in preparation that would diagnose the species. In May, he submitted a short response to his original paper to the journal, considering how such an enormous animal could have flown. Within the paper, he briefly established the name &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot;, but did still not provide a diagnosis or a more detailed description, which would later cause nomenclatural problems. Though not specified in the original publication, Lawson&#x27;s named the genus after the Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalcōātl, while the specific name honors John Knudsen Northrop, the founder of Northrop Corporation, who drove the development of large tailless Northrop YB-49 aircraft designs resembling &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. The discovery of the giant pterosaur left a strong impression on both the scientific community and the general public, and was reported on throughout the world. It was featured in Time Magazine and appeared on the cover of Scientific American in 1981 alongside an article on pterosaurs by Langston. The species would become referenced by over 500 scientific publications, with &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot; becoming the single most cited pterosaur species and &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; the fourth most cited pterosaur genus after &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, much older genera with many more species than &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;.

Prior to the announcement of the discovery, Langston had returned to Big Bend with a group of fossil preparators in February 1973, primarily aiming to excavate bones of the dinosaur &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;. One of the preparators, a young man named Bill Amaral who went on to be a respected field worker, had been skipping his lunches to conduct additional explorations of the area. He came across some additional fragments of pterosaur bone on a different portion of the ridge, around 40 kilometers away from the original site. Two more new sites quickly followed nearby, producing many fragments which the crew figured could be fit back together, in addition to a complete carpal and intact wing bone. Langston noted in his field notes that none of these bones suggested animals as large as Lawson&#x27;s original specimen. Further remains came from Amaral&#x27;s first site in April of 1974, after Lawson&#x27;s site had been exhausted; a long neck vertebra and a pair of jawbones appeared. Associated structures were initially hoped to represent filamentous pycnofibres, but were later confirmed to be conifer needles. Near the end of the 1974 season, Langston stumbled over a much more complete pterosaur skeleton; it consisted of a wing, multiple vertebrae, a femur and multiple other long bones. They lacked time to fully excavate it, leaving it in the ground until the next field season. This area, where many smaller specimens began to emerge, came to be known as Pterodactyl Ridge. Two of the smaller individuals were reported in the first 1975 paper by Lawson, presumed to belong to the same species, though Langston would begin to question the idea they belonged to &quot;Q. northropi&quot; by the early 1980s. Excavations continued in 1976, and eight new specimens emerged in 1977; in 1979, despite complications due to losing the field notes form 1977, Langston discovered another new site that would produce an additional ten specimens. Most importantly, a humerus of the smaller animal was finally found, which Langston considered of great importance to understanding &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. Several further new localities followed in 1980, but 1981 proved less successful and Langston began to suspect the ridge may have been mostly depleted of pterosaur fossils. There was similarly little success in 1982, and visits during 1983 and 1985 proved to provide the last substantive discoveries of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; fossils. Langston returned in 1989, 1991, 1992, and 1996, but only found isolated bones and fragments, though eventually a handful of additional specimens were discovered by former student Thomas Lehman. A visit to Lawson&#x27;s initial site during 1991 showed that all traces of excavation had by now eroded away. Langston would visit Big Bend for the last time in 1999, having concluded the pterosaur expeditions to focus on the excavation of two skulls of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot;, another famous fossil of the area.

===Later research===

The expected further description implicated by Lawson never came. For the next 50 years, the material would remain under incomplete study, and few concrete anatomical details were documented within the literature. Much confusion surrounded the smaller individuals from Pterodactyl Ridge. In a 1981 article on pterosaurs, Langston expressed reservations whether they were truly the same species as the immense &quot;Q. northropi&quot;. In the meantime, Langston focused on the animal&#x27;s publicity. He worked on a life-sized gliding replica of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot; with aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready between 1981 and 1985, promoting it in a dedicated IMAX film. The model was created to understand the flight of the animal — prior to Lawson&#x27;s discovery such a large flier wasn&#x27;t thought possible, and the subject remained controversial at the time. Furthermore, the model was intended to allow people to experience the animal in a more dynamic manner than a mere static display or film. Around this time he also created a skeletal mount of the genus that was exhibited at the Texas Memorial Museum. 

The next scientific effort of note was a 1996 paper by Langston and pterosaur specialist Alexander Kellner. By this time, Langston was confident the smaller animals were a separate species. A full publication establishing such a species was still in preparation at the time, but due to the importance of the skull material for the understanding of azhdarchid anatomy, the skull anatomy was published first. In this publication, he animal was referred to as &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; sp., a placeholder designation for material not assigned to any particularly valid species. Once again, the planned further publication failed to materialize for decades, and &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; sp. remained in limbo. A publication on the bioaeromechanics of the genus was also planned by Langston and James Cunningham, but this failed to materialize and the partially completed manuscript later became lost. Ultimately, a comprehensive publication on &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; sp. would not appear before Langston&#x27;s death in 2013. By this point he had produced many notes and individual descriptions, but had not begun writing any formal manuscript that could be published.

In 2021, a comprehensive description of the genus was finally published, the 19th entry in the Memoir series of special publications by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in the &quot;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&quot;. It consisted of five studies published together. Kevin Padian was the primary organizer of the project. A paper on the history of discoveries in Big Bend National Park was authored by Matthew J. Brown, Chris Sagebiel, and Brian Andres. It focused on curating a comprehensive list of specimens belonging to each species to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and the locality information of each within the Big Bend. Thomas Lehman contributed a study on the paleonvironment that &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; would have resided within, based upon work he had begun with Langston as early as 1993. Brian Andres published a study on the morphology and taxonomy of the genus, established the species &quot;Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni&quot; for the smaller animal that had gone for decades without a name. The specific name honoured Lawson, who discovered &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. Despite not contributing directly to the written manuscript, the authors of the memoir and Langston&#x27;s family agreed that he posthumously be considered a co-author of this paper due the basis of the work in the decades of research he dedicates to the subject. Also authored by Andres was a phylogenetic study of &quot;Quetzacoatlus&quot; and its relationships within Pterosauria, with a focus on the persistence of many lineages into the Late Cretaceous contra classical interpretations of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; as the last of a dying lineage. Finally, a study on the functional morphology of the genus was authored by Padian, James Cunningham, and John Conway (who contributed scientific illustrations and cover art to the Memoir), with Langston once again considered a posthumous co-author due to his foundational work on the subject. Brown and Padian prefaced the Memoir, who once again emphasized their gratitute to Langston for his decades of work on the animal leading up to the publication.

===Taxonomy and material===

The genus &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; consists of two valid species: the type species &quot;Q. northropi&quot; and the second species &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;. Though the name was introduced in 1975, uncertainty has surrounded the validity of the name due to the lack of a formal description. The oldest name for the species is &quot;Pteranodon&quot; &quot;gigas&quot;, from Lawon&#x27;s 1973 thesis. However, it is not considered a valid scientific name for the animal due to being named in a thesis, which the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) does not recognize consider a genuine publication. The name has not been used since. Regarding the genus &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and species &quot;Q. northropi&quot;, the establishment of both names were not associated with any kind of description of what distinguished the animal from others (as the material was described in a separate publication). As this is also a requirement for valid coining under the rules of the ICZN, it was argued that the genus was in a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;, an intended but invalid scientific name, though it had been argued that the name was valid due to the publication referencing the earlier descriptive publication. The species received a diagnosis, or list of traits dinstinguishing it from all other recorded species, in a 1991 paper by Lev Nessov; however, simply referencing an invalid with a diagnosis did not meet ICZN requirements either. Furthermore, a study by Mark Witton and colleagues in 2010 doubted whether &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; could be valid diagnosed at all. They notes the bones preserved in the holotype of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; were not typically considered to be taxonomically informative between close relatives, and that they appeared extremely similar to those of other giant azhdarchids such as the Romanian azhdarchid &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot;. They considered it possible &quot;Q. northropi&quot; as a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, a species that cannot be proven as distinct, or perhaps a synonym of &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot;, given the assumed ability of such large fliers to travel between continents. 

Both of these issues were settled in the 2021 redescription of the genus. Regarding the distinctiveness of the animal, they provided an updated diagnosis. The authors, however, agreed that the original paper did not constitute a valid establishment of the name. Though they noted their publication could serve as the a basis for the name, they felt it would be contrary to the intent of the code to chance the previously presumed authorship of the name. Thus, they submitted an application for exception to the ICZN, and had Lawson&#x27;s second 1975 paper retroactively declared the validy authority of the genus and species despite its failure to meet requirements. This also formalized &quot;Quetzalcoatlus nothropi&quot; as the type species due to being the only species associated with the genus in that original publication. This ICZN petition was approved in 2017.

Though Lawson originally considered all &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; remains to belong to one species, today two species are recognized: the large &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot; and the smaller &quot;Quetzalcoatlus lawsoni&quot;. Despite this distinction, the exact nature of what material belongs to each species is not entirely clear, due in part to the distribution of specimens across various localities and stratigraphic levels found at Big Bend, as well as the limited scope of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; material to compare to. The name-bearing type specimen of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; is TMM 41450-3, a partial wing. It includes a humerus, radius, ulna, wrist bones, finger bones, and many elements of the elongate wing finger, in addition to thousands of unidentifiable fragments. It is from the uppermost rocks of the Javelina Formation, making it one of the youngest pterosaur specimens known. Only a single other specimen can confidently be referred to the same species, a left ulna designated TMM 44036-1 known from the Black Peaks Formation, around three quarters the size of the type specimen and sharing distinctive anatomy. Four other specimens share a similarly giant size, but cannot be definitively assigned to &quot;Q. northropi&quot; in lack of overlapping material or distinguishing anatomical regions. TMM 41047-1 and TMM 41398-3, are both partial femurs, the former twice the size of that seen in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;. Their anatomy indicates they belonged to the same species, and is distinct from that of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;. Part of a wing finger, TMM 41398-4, is also of the correct size to belong to &quot;Q. northropi&quot; but does not preserve the essential anatomy to confirm its identity. This specimen and the smaller femur were the first two specimens Lawson discovered, prior to uncovering the type specimen. Finally, one of the oldest pterosaur specimens in Big Bend is a giant cervical vertebra not matching that of smaller species from the formation. Whilst conventional pterosaur research would assign all of these to &quot;Q. northropi&quot;, the 2021 redescription preferred to be cautious and merely assigned them to &quot;Q. cf. northropi&quot;, indicating uncertainty.

=== Reclassified or indeterminate fossils ===

In 1982, fragmentary azhdarchid remains, in the form of a wing phalanx, a partial femur, a vertebra and a tibia, were uncovered in strata from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada. While initially assigned to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;,&quot;&quot; the discovery of additional remains allowed its referral to a new genus and species, &quot;Cryodrakon boreas&quot;, in 2019. In 1986, jaws and cervical (neck) vertebrae from a pterosaur were uncovered in the Javelina Formation, from which the original specimens of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; originated. In his 1991 book on pterosaurs, Peter Wellnhofer assigned the remains to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; sp., leading to a reconstruction by illustrator John Sibbick of a &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; with a short beak. In 2021, Brian Andres and Wann Langston Jr. dubbed the short-beaked Javelina pterosaur &quot;Wellnhopterus brevirostris&quot;, after Wellnhofer and the shortness of its beak. The same remains were named &quot;Javelinadactylus sagebieli&quot; in a now-retracted paper by Hebert Campos. An azhdarchid cervical (neck) vertebra (BMR P2002.2), discovered in 2002 in strata from the Maastrichtian age Hell Creek Formation (alongside a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; specimen), was originally assigned to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. In 2021, Andres and Langston Jr. determined that BMR P2002.2 was a putative azhdarchiform. However, in 2025, BMR P2002.2 was assigned to a new genus and species, &quot;Infernodrakon hastacollis&quot;, more closely related to &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; than to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. A cervical vertebra (FSAC-OB 14) similar to that of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; is known from Morocco, and was described as aff. &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot; was among the largest azhdarchids, though was rivalled in size by &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; and &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot; (and possibly &quot;Cryodrakon&quot;). Azhdarchids were split into two primary categories: short-necked taxa with short, robust beaks (i.e. &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot; and &quot;Wellnhopterus&quot;), and long-necked taxa with longer, slenderer beaks (i.e. &quot;Zhejiangopterus&quot;). Of these, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; falls squarely into the latter. Based on the limb morphology of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, related azhdarchids such as &quot;Zhejiangopterus&quot;, and pterosaurs at large, in addition to azhdarchid tracks from South Korea, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; was likely quadrupedal. As a pterosaur, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; would have been covered in hair-like pycnofibres, and had extensive wing-membranes, which would have been distended by a long wing-finger. There have been various models of the morphology of pterodactyloid wings, though based on multiple well-preserved pterosaur specimens, it is likely that azhdarchids had broad wings, with a brachiopatagium extending down to the ankle. The aspect ratio of azhdarchid wings is 8.1, similar to that of storks and birds of prey that engage in static soaring (relying on air currents to gain altitude and remain aloft).

===Size===
&quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; is regarded as one of the largest pterosaurs, though its exact size has been difficult to determine. In 1975, Douglas Lawson compared the wing bones of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; to equivalent elements in &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; and &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and suggested that it represented an individual with a wingspan of around , or, alternatively, or . Estimates put forward in subsequent years varied dramatically, ranging from , owing to differences in methodology. From the 1980s onwards, estimates were narrowed down to . More recent estimates based on greater knowledge of azhdarchid proportions place its wingspan at . This would approach the maximum size possible for azhdarchids, estimated at around ; higher wingspans may be possible, though would require significant morphological changes. In one paper from the 2021 Memoir which redescribed &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;, &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; was estimated to have a wingspan of around . In 2022, Gregory S. Paul that it had a larger wingspan of around and a body length of . Large azhdarchids such as &quot;Q. northropi&quot; have been estimated to have a shoulder height of about , and the head may have been held at a similar height to that of an extant giraffe.

Body mass estimates for giant azhdarchids are problematic because no existing species shares a similar size or body plan, and in consequence, published results vary widely. Crawford Greenewalt gave mass estimates of between for &quot;Q. northropi&quot;, with the former figure assuming a small wingspan of , and the latter assuming a far larger wingspan of . A majority of estimates published since the 2000s have hovered around , due largely to a greater understanding of how aberrant the anatomy of azhdarchids was in comparison to other pterosaur clades. In 2021, Kevin Padian and his colleagues estimated that &quot;Q. northropi&quot; would have weighed around , and that &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; would have weighed , while a year later, Gregory S. Paul estimated a body mass of for the latter species.

===Skull===
Complete skulls are not known from either &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; species. Reconstructions of its skull anatomy must therefore draw from eight separate &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; specimens which preserve skull elements. Based on the length of the mandible (lower jaw), the skull of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; likely measured about in length. The distance between the condyloid (articular) processes of the mandible is around . The ratio between the length of the skull and the length of the average dorsal (back) vertebra is very high in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, and is surpassed only by &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and &quot;Tupuxuara&quot;. The nasoantorbital fenestra, a massive opening found in many pterosaurs which combined the nasal cavity (which housed the external nostril) and antorbital fenestra, was very large in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, occupying about a third of the total length of the skull. In the largest specimen, TMM 41961-1.1, it measured in length and in height. &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;&#x27;s choanae (internal nostrils) were and anteriorly expanded, meaning that they were essentially fused and expanded towards the front. The orbit was small and , resembling an inverted egg in shape. It was fairly low on the skull, similar to other azhdarchoids, like tapejarids. Like in other pterosaurs, the orbit was positioned in a way that would have allowed &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; to see both forwards and directly to the sides, giving it a degree of stereoscopic vision.

Like other azhdarchids, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; had a long, slender, toothless beak, with a gape of around 52 degrees. It was constructed from the premaxilla and maxilla on the upper jaw, and the dentary on the lower jaw. Beak tips are not preserved in any specimen, so it is not clear whether its tip was sharp or had some other morphology, such as a keel. The dentary had a slight curve, which is also observed in &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot;. The mandibular symphyses would have widened slightly as the jaw opened, slightly separating the mandibles, which has led to suggestions that some sort of gular pouch was present. At the base of the beak, formed from the premaxilla, was a crest, referred to by some authors as a sagittal crest. Its exact form has yet to be determined, due to the poor preservation of the rear half of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;″s skull. From what is known, two distinct morphotypes have been suggested: one with a square sagittal crest and a tall nasoantorbital fenestra, and one with a more semicircular sagittal crest and a shorter nasoantorbital fenestra. Additionally, one morphotype is larger than the other, and has a proportionally shorter beak. Despite their differences, both share the diagnostic traits of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, and are considered the same species. The reason for there being two morphotypes is unclear, though it may correlate to individual variation, ontogeny, or sexual dimorphism.

=== Skeleton ===

Like other pterosaurs, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; had light, hollow bones, supported internally by struts called trabeculae. The neck of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, measured from the third cervical (neck) vertebra to the seventh, has been estimated at . It consisted of nine elongated vertebrae, which were , meaning that they were concave at the front. All of them were compressed dorsoventrally (top to bottom), and were better suited for dorsoventral motion than lateral (side-to-side) motion. However, the lateral range of motion was still extensive, and the neck and head could swing left and right in an arc of about 180 degrees. Like in other azhdarchoids, the cervical vertebrae were low, with neural arches that were essentially inside the centrum. In most azhdarchids, the neural spine of the seventh cervical vertebra was fairly long. This was not the case in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, where the neural spine was shorter. Internally, the cervical vertebrae were supported by trabeculae that increased their buckling load substantially (about 90%). This may have been an adaptation for counteracting shear forces exerted on the neck while in flight, though may have also enabled agonistic neck-bashing behaviors like those seen in giraffes. While airborne, the neck of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; would have likely assumed a slight S-shaped curve, similar to swans. Similar to other azhdarchids, the torso was proportionally small, about half as long again as the humerus. In &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; specifically, the vertebrae at the base of the neck and the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle) are poorly known. The first four dorsal (back) vertebrae are fused into a notarium, as in some other pterosaurs and birds, particularly ornithocheiroids. The vertebral count of the notarium is unlike &quot;Zhejiangopterus&quot;, which had six notarial vertebrae, but like &quot;Azhdarcho&quot;. Most other dorsal vertebrae are absent, except for three which had been integrated into the sacrum. Around seven dorsal vertebrae were free of the notarium and sacrum. Four true sacral vertebrae are preserved, though there were likely seven in all. No caudal (tail) vertebrae are preserved.
&quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;&#x27; scapulocoracoid, a fusion of the scapula and coracoid, bones, was U-shaped and broad. Throughout azhdarchid evolution, the scapula had been reducing in length, and this reached its pinnacle in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, where the scapula was only slightly longer than the coracoid. The sternum, like that of other pterosaurs, was broad. It had a transverse ridge on its posterior (rear) portion, also observed in &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, albeit it is further forward in that genus. Like other pterosaurs, the bone walls of the sternum were very thin, and in the case of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, they were as little as thick. &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and other azhdarchids have forelimb and hind limb proportions more similar to modern running ungulate mammals than to members of other pterosaur clades, implying that they were uniquely suited to a terrestrial lifestyle. The humerus was short and robust, with considerable mobility. Its morphology differs somewhat between species, with &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;″s humerus having a proportionally shorter deltopectoral crest, and &quot;Q. northropi&quot;″s being shaped more like a twisted hourglass. The ulna of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; was relatively shorter than that of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, measuring 1.36 times the length of the humerus, as opposed to 1.52 times the length of the humerus in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; and other azhdarchiforms. Like all pterosaurs, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; had a specialised carpal (wrist) bone, the pteroid, which attached to the sesamoid bone of the wrist. It faced inwards, pointing towards the deltopectoral crest, and supported the propatagium. Specialised muscles allowed it to move slightly. The first digit is the smallest, and the third is the biggest, with the exception of the wing finger. As with all pterosaurs, the wing finger was considerably longer than the others. It did not contact the ground, as evidenced by footprints. Whilst on land, it may have been held between the elbow and the torso. The wings were short and broad, and forelimb musclature was extensive. Flapping power came from several muscle groups on the torso, forearm and manus (hand).

Typically for a pterosaur, the pelvis of &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; consists of an ilium, pubis and ischium that had fused into a single unit, articulating anteroventrally (towards the front, at the bottom) with the , a small bone that sat before the pubis and likely helped support the abdominal cavity during respiration. The pelvis of one &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; specimen (TMM 41954-57) is large compared to that of other specimens, with deep posterior emargination and no preserved symphisis. This suggests that &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; exhibited sexual dimorphism, similar to that suggested for other monofenestratans (i.e. &quot;Darwinopterus, Anhanguera&quot; and &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;). The femur was significantly more gracile than the humerus, though was still among the most robust bones in &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;″ skeleton, judging by &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;. Based on &quot;Zhejiangopterus&quot;, the humerus was around eighty percent of the length of the tibiotarsus. Azhdarchids overall had fairly narrow feet, no longer than 30% of the length of the tibia, which may have borne fleshy pads similar to those of tapejarids. They were plantigrade, meaning that they walked with the sole of the foot flat on the ground. &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; possessed well-developed pedal (foot) unguals, which supported moderately curved claws, shorter and slightly straighter than those of tapejarids.

==Classification==
When describing &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; in 1975, Douglas Lawson and Crawford Greenewalt opted not to assign it to a clade more specific than Pterodactyloidea, though comparisons with &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; (then &quot;Titanopteryx&quot;) from Jordan had been drawn earlier that year. In 1984, Lev Alexandrovich Nessov erected the subfamily Azhdarchinae within Pteranodontidae to contain &quot;Azhdarcho&quot;, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;, and &quot;Titanopteryx&quot;. Unaware of that subfamily, in the same year, Kevin Padian erected the family Titanopterygiidae to accommodate &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and &quot;Titanopteryx&quot;, defining it based on the length and general morphology of the cervical vertebrae. Two years later, in 1986, noting commonalities not only in contained genera but in diagnostic features, he rendered Titanopterygiidae a junior synonym of Azhdarchinae, elevating the latter to family level and forming the family Azhdarchidae. In 2003, the clade Azhdarchoidea was defined by David Unwin. Azhdarchids were determined to form a clade, Neoazhdarchia, with Tapejaridae. &quot;Montanazhdarcho&quot; from North America and &quot;Zhejiangopterus&quot; from China were incorporated into Azhdarchidae. In the supplementary material for their 2014 paper describing &quot;Kryptodrakon progenitor&quot;, Andres, James Clark and Xing Xu named a new subfamily, Quetzalcoatlinae, of which &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; is the type genus. 

The relationship between &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and other giant azhdarchids, like &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; and &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot;, is not certain. In 2021, Brian Andres recovered them as sister taxa, with &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; being the sister taxon of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot; being slightly more basal. However, Rodrigo V. Pêgas et al., in 2022, instead recovered &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; as part of one of two quetzalcoatline branches, alongside &quot;Cryodrakon&quot;; the other giant azhdarchid genera were recovered on the other branch. A similar dichotomy was recovered by Leonardo Ortiz David et al. that same year, with the inclusion of &quot;Thanatosdrakon&quot; as &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;″ sister genus.

The first of the below phylogenetic analyses shows the results of Andres (2021). The second shows the results of Ortiz David &quot;et al&quot;. (2022).

== Paleobiology ==

=== Feeding and ecological niche ===
In 1975, Douglas Lawson rejected the notion that &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; might have had a fish-eating (piscivorous) lifestyle like pteranodontids. The Big Bend site where the holotype was discovered is roughly removed from the coastline, and since Lawson believed that the river systems of the locality were too small to support an animal the size of &quot;Q. northropi&quot;, he instead suggested that it was a scavenger, similar to vultures. The holotype was found in close association with the skeletons of &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, a titanosaur sauropod, which Lawson cited as further evidence. However, David Martill dismissed this connection, noting that the association was nothing more than circumstantial evidence. Due to the light construction of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;&#x27; beak, it would have had to wait for other predators to open up a carcass before it could feed. Another issue is that, while many scavenging birds have extremely flexible necks allowing them to efficiently probe for meat, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; had a stiffer neck, and would not have had the same advantages. Since &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;&#x27;s beak was relatively weak and unhooked, being compared by Wann Langston Jr. to chopsticks, it is unlikely that it could have torn flesh from a carcass. In the coming decades, further hypotheses regarding &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;&#x27; ecology were put forward. Lev Alexandrovich Nesov, in 1984, suggested that &quot;Q. northropi&quot; and other azhdarchids were piscivorous after all, and that they were ecological analogs to modern skimmers, which feed by skimming the water&#x27;s surface. He did not, however, indicate any morphological indicators for this behavior, and indeed, azhdarchids lack many of the adaptations necessary for such a feeding method (such as robust, aerodynamic beaks with shock-absorbing structures, and the neck flexibility necessary for skimming). Thus, skimming is very unlikely. Another hypothesis, proposed by Langston, is that azhdarchids probed for burrowing invertebrates, using its beak to pluck them from the substrate. Among the evidence provided by Langston was extensive bioturbation of the strata around &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; fossils, indicative of extensive invertebrate activity; this evidence, however, may be circumstantial. Such a lifestyle has subsequently been suggested for &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;. However, wading animals tend to have large, long and broad feet, with a high surface area. This contrasts the morphology seen in &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; and other azhdarchids, which had small, narrow feet.The predominant model of azhdarchid feeding behavior is the &quot;terrestrial stalking&quot; hypothesis, which suggests that they fed upon small terrestrial prey. This hypothesis was first proposed by Gregory S. Paul in a 1987 correspondence published in the journal &quot;Nature.&quot; Paul suggested that &quot;Q. northropi&quot; was analogous to modern storks, specialising in plucking small vertebrates, such as frogs and turtles, from around watercourses. This initial iteration of the terrestrial stalking hypothesis was supported by Sankar Chatterjee and R. J. Templin, who believed that many pterodactyloids adopted such a lifestyle. Lifestyles analogous to modern herons were also proposed by Kevin Padian and Donna Braginetz in 1988, and by S. Christopher Bennett in 2001. In a 2008 paper on the paleoecology of azhdarchids, Mark Witton and Darren Naish reviewed previous models of their ecology and found the majority to be untenable. The anatomy possessed by azhdarchids was, to them, indicative of terrestrial prey capture. They argued that the family were ecologically closest to storks or ground hornbills, and coined the term &quot;terrestrial stalker&quot; to collectively describe them. Witton elaborated in a 2013 book that the proportions of azhdarchids would have been consistent with them striding through vegetated areas with their long limbs, and their downturned skull and jaws reaching the ground. Their long, stiffened necks would be an advantage as it would help lowering and raising the head and give it a vantage point when searching for prey, and enable them to grab small animals and fruit. The internal anatomy of &quot;Q. northropi&quot;″s cervical vertebrae suggests that it, and other giant azhdarchids, may have been able to pick up prey animals weighing at maximum, though prey size would have been further limited by the size of &quot;Q. northropi&quot;″s skull and gullet rather than body mass. &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;″s skull does not exhibit cranial kinesis, meaning that the skull was essentially a rigid unit, and as such, it was likely incapable of masticating hard objects.

&quot;Q. northropi&quot; is found in plains deposits, and due to the paucity and location of its remains, was speculated by Thomas Lehman to have been a solitary hunter that favored riparian environments. &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, however, is found in great numbers in facies that likely represent alkaline lakes. It may have lived like modern gregarious wading birds, feeding on small invertebrates such as annelids, crustaceans and insects that inhabit such environments, and using its beak to probe for burrowing invertebrates. The two species, if contemporaneous, were likely separated by such behavioral and ecological differences. In a 2021 study, Labita and Martill noted that azhdarchids might have been less terrestrial than suggested by Witton and Naish, since azhdarchid fossils were known from marine strata, such as &quot;Phosphatodraco&quot; from Morocco and &quot;Arambourgiania&quot; from the phosphates of Jordan. They noted that no azhdarchids had been found in truly terrestrial strata, and proposed they could instead have been associated with aquatic environments, such as rivers, lakes, marine and off-shore settings.

Pterosaurs were generally thought to have gone gradually extinct by decreasing in diversity towards the end of the Cretaceous, but Longrich and colleagues suggested this impression could be a result of the poor fossil records for pterosaurs (the Signor-Lipps Effect). Pterosaurs during this time had increased niche-partitioning compared to earlier faunas from the Santonian and Campanian ages, and they were able to outcompete birds in large size based niches, and birds therefore remained small, not exceeding wingspans during the Late Cretaceous (most pterosaurs during this time had larger wingspans, and thereby avoided the small-size niche). To these researchers, this indicated that the extinction of pterosaurs was abrupt instead of gradual, caused by the catastrophic Chicxulub impact. Their extinction freed up more niches that were then filled by birds, which led to their evolutionary radiation in the Early Cenozoic.

=== Terrestrial locomotion ===
Witton summarized ideas about azhdarchid flight abilities in 2013, and noted they had generally been considered adapted for soaring, although some have found it possible their musculature allowed flapping flight like in swans and geese. Their short and potentially broad wings may have been suited for flying in terrestrial environments, as this is similar to some large, terrestrially soaring birds. Albatross-like soaring has also been suggested, but Witton thought this unlikely due to the supposed terrestrial bias of their fossils and adaptations for foraging on the ground. Studies of azhdarchid flight abilities indicate they would have been able to fly for long and probably fast (especially if they had an adequate amount of fat and muscle as nourishment), so that geographical barriers would not present obstacles.

Azhdarchids are the only group of pterosaurs to which trackways have been confidently assigned, such as &quot;Haenamichnus&quot; from Korea, which matches this group in shape, age, and size. One long trackway of this kind shows that azhdarchids walked with their limbs held directly underneath their body, and along with the morphology of their feet indicates they were more proficient on the ground than other pterosaurs. Terrestrial locomotion in azhdarchids like &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; likely involved a pacing gait, wherein the limbs on one side of the body would move at roughly the same time, followed by those of the opposite side. For example, the forelimb on one side of the body would lift off the ground and move forward first, to avoid colliding with the hind foot, and the hind limb would follow suit. The forefoot would be planted in the ground just before the hind foot. Once the stride completed, the same process would repeat on the opposite side of the body.

===Flight===

The nature of flight in &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and other giant azhdarchids was poorly understood until serious biomechanical studies were conducted in the 21st century. A 1984 experiment by Paul MacCready used practical aerodynamics to test the flight of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;. MacCready constructed a model flying machine or, ornithopter, with a simple computer functioning as an autopilot. The model successfully flew with a combination of soaring and wing flapping. The model was based on a then-current weight estimate of around , far lower than more modern estimates of over . The method of flight in these pterosaurs depends largely on their weight, which has been controversial, and widely differing masses have been favored by different scientists. Some researchers have suggested that these animals employed slow, soaring flight, while others have concluded that their flight was fast and dynamic. In 2010, Donald Henderson argued that the mass of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; had been underestimated, even the highest estimates, and that it was too massive to have achieved powered flight. He estimated it in his 2010 paper as , and argued that it may have been flightless.

Other flight capability estimates have disagreed with Henderson&#x27;s research, suggesting instead an animal superbly adapted to long-range, extended flight. In 2010, Mike Habib, a professor of biomechanics at Chatham University, and Mark Witton, a British paleontologist, undertook further investigation into the claims of flightlessness in large pterosaurs. After factoring wingspan, body weight, and aerodynamics, computer modeling led the two researchers to conclude that &quot;Q. northropi&quot; was capable of flight up to for 7 to 10 days at altitudes of . Habib further suggested a maximum flight range of for &quot;Q. northropi&quot;. Henderson&#x27;s work was also further criticized by Witton and Habib in another study, which pointed out that, although Henderson used excellent mass estimations, they were based on outdated pterosaur models, which caused Henderson&#x27;s mass estimations to be more than double what Habib used in his estimations and that anatomical study of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; and other big pterosaur forelimbs showed a higher degree of robustness than would be expected if they were purely quadrupedal. This study proposed that large pterosaurs most likely utilized a short burst of powered flight to then transition to thermal soaring. However, a study from 2022 suggests that they would only have flown occasionally and for short distances, like the Kori bustard (the world&#x27;s heaviest bird that actively flies) and that they were not able to soar at all. Studies of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; and &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot; published in 2021 by Kevin Padian &quot;et al&quot;. instead suggested that &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; was a very powerful flier. While Padian himself also suggested that the legs and feet were likely tucked under the body during flight as in modern birds, co-authors John Conway and James Cunningham endorsed a system more in line with conventional models of pterosaur flight, wherein the hind limbs were splayed out while the animal was airborne.

=== Launching ===

Early interpretations of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; launching relied on bipedal models. In 2004, Sankar Chatterjee and R.J. Templin used a model and utilised a running launch cycle powered by the hind limbs, in which &quot;Q. northropi&quot; was only barely able to take off. In 2008, Michael Habib suggested that the only feasible takeoff method for a &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; was one that was mainly powered by the forelimbs. In 2010, Mark Witton and Habib noted that the femur of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; was only a third as strong as what would be expected from a bird of equal size, whereas the humerus is considerably stronger, and affirmed that an azhdarchid the size of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; would have great difficulty taking off bipedally. Thus, they considered a quadrupedal launching method, with the forelimbs applying most of the necessary force, a likelier method of takeoff. In 2021, Kevin Padian et al. attempted to resurrect the bipedal launch model, using a comparatively light weight estimate of . They suggested that &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;″ hind limbs were more powerful than previously suggested, and that they were strong enough to launch its body as high as off the ground without the aid of the forelimbs. A large breastbone would support the necessary muscles to create a flight stroke, allowing &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; to gain enough clearance to begin the downstrokes needed for takeoff. In an blog post written in response to the Padian et al. study, Mark Witton wrote that little of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;&#x27; morphology indicated that a bipedal launch mechanism was employed, and that quadrupedal launching, even in the smaller &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, remained the likeliest model.

==Paleoenvironment==
&quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; is known from the Lancian portion of the Javelina Formation, in a fauna dominated by &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;. It co-existed with another azhdarchid known as &quot;Wellnhopterus&quot;, as well as an additional pterosaur taxon, suggesting a relatively high diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaur genera. The depositional environment represents a floodplain which was probably semi-arid, analogous in terms of climate and flora to the coastal plains of southern Mexico, consisting of an evergreen or semideciduous tropical forest, with a mean annual temperature of . These forests consisted largely of angiosperm trees such as &quot;Javelinoxylon&quot;, conifers related to the modern &quot;Araucaria&quot;, and woody vines, with a closed canopy in excess of in height. Various non-avian dinosaur taxa are known from the Javelina Formation. In addition to &quot;Alamosaurus&quot;, the sole member of its sauropod fauna, there were ceratopsians (&quot;Bravoceratops&quot; and &quot;Torosaurus&quot;), hadrosaurs (&quot;Gryposaurus&quot; and &quot;Kritosaurus&quot;), indeterminate ankylosaurs, and theropods (&quot;Saurornitholestes&quot;, ?&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, and an indeterminate troodontid). Aquatic vertebrate fauna consisted of crocodilians, turtles, amiids (relatives of the modern bowfin), and gars. The remains of both &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; species are found in association with freshwater environments. &quot;Q. lawsoni&quot;, in particular, is strongly associated with abandoned channel and lake facies, which are rare in the Javelina Formation. These facies preserve a diverse fauna of gastropods and bivalves, though the vertebrate fauna known from other aquatic environments belonging the Javelina are absent. This suggests that the environment was inhospitable compared to normal stream channels, and high carbonate precipitation suggests that the water may have been highly alkaline. Eggshell fragments that may be attributable to &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; suggest that they may have nested around alkaline lakes.

==Cultural significance==
In 1975, artist Giovanni Caselli depicted &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; as a small-headed scavenger with an extremely long neck in the book &quot;The evolution and ecology of the Dinosaurs&quot; by British paleontologist Beverly Halstead. Over the next twenty-five years prior to future discoveries, it would launch similar depictions colloquially known as &quot;paleomemes&quot; in various books, as noted by Darren Naish.

In 1985, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and AeroVironment used &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;northropi&quot; as the basis for an experimental ornithopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). They produced a half-scale model weighing , with a wingspan of . Coincidentally, Douglas A. Lawson, who discovered &quot;Q. northropi&quot; in Texas in 1971, named it after John &quot;Jack&quot; Northrop, a developer of tailless flying wing aircraft in the 1940s. The replica of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; incorporates a &quot;flight control system/autopilot which processes pilot commands and sensor inputs, implements several feedback loops, and delivers command signals to its various servo-actuators&quot;. It is on exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum.

In 2010, several life-sized models of &quot;Q. northropi&quot; were put on display on London&#x27;s South Bank as the centerpiece exhibit for the Royal Society&#x27;s 350th-anniversary exhibition. The models, which included both flying and standing individuals with wingspans of over , were intended to help build public interest in science. The models were created by scientists from the University of Portsmouth.

<text>Quedlinburg () is a town situated just north of the Harz mountains, in the district of Harz in the west of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. As an influential and prosperous trading centre during the early Middle Ages, Quedlinburg became a center of influence under the Ottonian dynasty in the 10th and 11th centuries. The castle, church and old town with around 2,100 timber houses, dating from this time of influence, were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994 because of their exceptional preservation and outstanding Romanesque architecture.

Quedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the district of Quedlinburg until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the Romanesque Road.

==History==

The town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as &quot;Gross Orden&quot; on the eastern bank of the River Bode. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King Henry the Fowler (&quot;Heinrich der Vogler&quot;). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of Corvey.

According to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the &quot;cradle of the German Reich&quot;.

After Henry&#x27;s death in 936, his widow Saint Matilda founded a religious community for women (&quot;Frauenstift&quot;) on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, Quedlinburg Abbey, was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The &quot;Annals of Quedlinburg&quot; were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.

The Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by Emperor Otto I in 936, was an imperial &quot;Pfalz&quot; of the Saxon emperors. The &quot;Pfalz&quot;, including the male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of &quot;St. Wiperti&quot; is situated, while the women&#x27;s convent was located on the castle hill.

In 973, shortly before the death of Emperor Otto I, a &quot;Reichstag&quot; (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which Mieszko, duke of Polans, and Boleslav, duke of Bohemia, as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as Byzantium and Bulgaria, gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law Theophanu, a Byzantine princess whose marriage to Otto II brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.

In 994, Otto III granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.

The town became a member of the Hanseatic League in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the Bishopric of Halberstadt. In 1477, Abbess Hedwig, aided by her brothers Ernest and Albert, broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop&#x27;s forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the Electorate of Saxony. Both town and abbey converted to Lutheranism in 1539 during the Protestant Reformation.

In 1697, Frederick Augustus I of Poland–Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the German Mediatisation, and Quedlinburg passed to the Kingdom of Prussia as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg. Part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813, it was included within the new Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without &quot;taking the veil&quot;; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women&#x27;s rights, Sofia Albertina.

During the Nazi regime, the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as Heinrich Himmler saw himself as the reincarnation of the &quot;most German of all German&quot; rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for Nazi Germany. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed in 1938 and during the war. The local crematory was kept busy burning the victims of the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp. Georg Ay was local party chief from 1931 until the end of World War II. During the war, Quedlinburg was the location of a subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp and a subcamp of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. American occupation during the last months of World War II brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was removed from the tower. However, in the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg came to light.

Quedlinburg was administered within Bezirk Halle while part of the Communist East Germany from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt upon German reunification in 1990.

During Quedlinburg&#x27;s Communist era, restoration specialists from Poland were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of &quot;Fachwerk&quot; houses.

Quedlinburg is the setting for the acclaimed 2016 &quot;Frantz&quot;, serving as a quintessential small German town in the wake of WWI, home to a family who is reeling from the death of a son in the war.

==Geography==

The mayor is Frank Ruch (CDU), elected in 2022.

===Town twinning===

Quedlinburg is twinned with:
* Aulnoye-Aymeries, France, since 1961
* Herford, Germany, since 1991
* Celle, Germany, since 1991
* Hameln, Germany, since 1991
* Hann. Münden, Germany, since 1991

==Attractions==
In the centre of the town are a wide selection of half-timbered buildings from at least five different centuries (including a 14th-century structure, one of Germany&#x27;s oldest), while around the outer fringes of the old town are examples of &quot;Jugendstil&quot; buildings, dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The old town of Quedlinburg is among the largest in Germany with a size of around 90 hectares. 2000 half-timbered houses can be found here. The oldest, the &quot;Ständerbau&quot;, dates back from 1347.

Another famous building is called &quot;Klopstockhaus&quot;, the birthplace of poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock.

Since December 1994, the old town of Quedlinburg and the castle mount with the &quot;Stiftskirche&quot; (collegiate church) are listed as one of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites. Quedlinburg is one of the best-preserved medieval and Renaissance towns in Europe, having escaped major damage in World War II.

In 2006, the Selke valley branch of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways was extended to Quedlinburg from Gernrode, giving access to the historic steam narrow gauge railway, Alexisbad and the high Harz plateau.

The castle and &quot;Stiftskirche St. Servatius&quot; still dominate the town like in the early Middle Ages. The church is a prime example of German Romanesque style. The treasure of the church, containing ancient Christian religious artifacts and books, was stolen by an American soldier but brought back to Quedlinburg in 1993 and is again on display here.

The former &quot;Stiftskirche St. Wiperti&quot; was established in 936 when the &quot;Kanonikerstift St. Wigpertus&quot; (of male canons) was moved from the castle hill to make way for what became Quedlinburg Abbey. The church was built at the location of the first Ottonian Royal palace at Quedlinburg. Around 1020, a three-aisled crypt was added to the basilica. The crypt, which survived all later alterations to the church, is also a designated stop on the Romanesque Road today.

<doc id="25323" wikidata="Q267947" url="?curid=25323" title="QRP operation">
<text>In amateur radio, QRP operation refers to transmitting at reduced power while attempting to maximize one&#x27;s effective range. QRP operation is a specialized pursuit within the hobby that was first popularized in the early 1920s. QRP operators limit their transmitted RF output power to 5 W or less regardless of mode (Some call 10 W on Phone QRP) .

Reliable two-way communication at such low power levels can be challenging due to changing radio propagation and the difficulty of receiving the relatively weak transmitted signals. QRP enthusiasts may employ optimized antenna systems, enhanced operating skills, and a variety of special modes, in order to maximize their ability to make and maintain radio contact. Since the late 1960s, commercial transceivers specially designed for QRP operation have evolved from vacuum tube to solid state technology.

A number of organizations dedicated to QRP operation exist, and aficionados participate in various contests designed to test their skill in making long-distance contacts at low power levels.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;QRP&quot; derives from the standard Q code used in radio communication, where QRP is used to request &quot;&quot;Reduce power&quot; and QRP? is used to ask &quot;Should I reduce power?&quot;&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Most amateur transceivers are capable of transmitting approximately 100 watts, but in some parts of the world, such as the U.S., amateurs can transmit up to 1,500 watts. QRP enthusiasts contend that this practice is rarely necessary, and doing so wastes power, increases the likelihood of causing interference to nearby televisions, radios, and telephones and, for United States&#x27; amateurs, is contrary to FCC Part 97 rule, which states that one must use &quot;the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications&quot;. QRP can also be used for emergency communications during disaster recovery, when frugal use of available battery power and generator fuel is crucial.

== Practice ==

The practice of operating with low power was popularized as early as 1924, with a variety of reports, editorials and articles published in U.S. amateur radio magazines and journals that encouraged amateurs to lower power output, both for purposes of experimentation, and for improving operating conditions by reducing interference.

Although not universally agreed upon, the ARRL makes a recommendation for QRP power limits. Most amateur organizations agree that for CW, AM, FM, and data modes, the transmitter output power should be 5 watts (or less). The maximum output power for SSB (single sideband) is sometimes agreed to be no more than 10 Watts peak envelope power (PEP), while some organisations opine that the power limit should be 5 Watts. QRPers are known to regularly use less than 5 Watts, sometimes operating with as little as 100 milliwatts or even less. Extremely low power — 1 Watt and below — is often referred to by hobbyists as &quot;QRPP&quot;.

Communicating using QRP can be difficult since the QRPer must face the same challenges of radio propagation faced by amateurs using higher power levels, but with the inherent disadvantages associated with having a weaker signal on the receiving end, all other things being equal. QRP aficionados try to make up for this through more efficient antenna systems and enhanced operating skills.

=== Weak signal modes ===
QRP enthusiasts may use special modes that employ technology and software designed to enhance reception of the relatively weak transmitted signals resulting from low power levels.

QRSS: Very slow speed Morse code 
:QRSS uses very slow speed CW (Morse code) to compensate for the decreased signal-to-noise ratio involved in QRP operation. QRSS enthusiasts may record a transmission for later analysis, sometimes decoding &quot;by ear&quot; while playing it back at much faster speeds, or decoding &quot;by eye&quot; on the waterfall display of a spectrum analyzer.

Coherent CW: Critically-timed Morse code transmission
:Coherent CW uses transmitters that clock-out signals calibrated to a precise rate, allowing receivers to employ extremely narrowband filtering to increase readability.

WSJT: Weak Signal – Joe Taylor
:WSJT is a software system that utilizes several separate modes, each optimized for a different signal path; these include meteor scatter, troposcatter, and EME communications. WSJT was named after Dr. J.H. Taylor to acknowledge his work in developing weak signal communication modes for radio.

WSPR: Weak Signal – Propagation Reporter
:WSPR is a software suite and computer network used to monitor propagation paths for optimal communication conditions.

== Equipment ==

Many of the larger, more powerful commercial transceivers permit the operator to lower their output level to QRP levels. Commercial transceivers specially designed to operate at or near QRP power levels have been commercially available since the late 1960s.

In 1969 the American manufacturer Ten-Tec produced the Powermite-1, one of Ten-Tec&#x27;s first assembled transceivers, and featured modular construction. All stages of the transceiver were on individual circuit boards: the transmitter was capable of about one or two watts of RF, and the receiver was a direct-conversion unit, similar to that found in the Heathkit HW-7 and HW-8 lines, which introduced many amateurs to QRP&#x27;ing and led to the popularity of the mode.

Enthusiasts operate QRP radios on the HF bands in portable modes, usually carrying the radios in backpacks, with whip antennas. Some QRPers prefer to construct their equipment from kits, published plans, or homebrew it from scratch. Many popular designs are based on the NE612 mixer IC, i.e. the K1, K2, ATS series and the Softrock SDR.

== Organizations ==
Amateur radio organizations dedicated to QRP include QRP Amateur Radio Club International (QRPARCI), American QRP Club, G-QRP Club based in the United Kingdom, and The Adventure Radio Society emphasizing portable QRP operation. Major QRP gatherings are held yearly at hamfests such as Dayton Hamvention, Pacificon, and Friedrichshafen.

== Contests and awards ==
There are specific operating awards, contests, clubs, and conventions devoted to QRP enthusiasts. In the United States, the November Sweepstakes, June and September VHF QSO Parties, January VHF Sweepstakes, and the ARRL International DX Contest, as well as many major international contests have designated special QRP categories. For example, during the annual ARRL&#x27;s Field Day event, making a QSO (ham-to-ham contact) using &quot;QRP battery power&quot; is worth five times as many points as a contact made by conventional means. The QRP ARCI club sponsors 12 contests during the year specifically for QRP operators.

Typical awards include the QRP ARCI club&#x27;s &quot;thousand-miles-per-watt&quot; award, available to anyone presenting evidence of a qualifying contact. QRP ARCI also offers special awards for achieving the ARRL&#x27;s Worked All States, Worked All Continents, and DX Century Club awards under QRP conditions. Other QRP clubs also offer similar versions of these awards, as well as general QRP operating achievement awards.

<text>In music, a quartet (, , , , ) is an ensemble of four singers or instrumental performers.

==Classical==
===String quartet===

In classical music, one of the most common combinations of four instruments in chamber music is the string quartet. String quartets most often consist of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The particular choice and number of instruments derives from the registers of the human voice: soprano, alto, tenor and bass (SATB). In the string quartet, two violins play the soprano and alto vocal registers, the viola plays the tenor register and the cello plays the bass register.

Composers of notable string quartets include Joseph Haydn (68 compositions), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (23), Ludwig van Beethoven (16), Franz Schubert (15), Felix Mendelssohn (6), Johannes Brahms (3), Antonín Dvořák (14), Alexander Borodin (2), Béla Bartók (6), Elizabeth Maconchy (13), Darius Milhaud (18), Heitor Villa-Lobos (17), and Dmitri Shostakovich (15). The Italian composer Luigi Boccherini (1743–1805), wrote 91 string quartets.

Less often, string quartets are written for other combinations of the standard string ensemble. These include quartets for one violin, two violas, and one cello, notably by Carl Stamitz (6 compositions) and others; and for one violin, one viola, and two cellos, by Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and others.

===Piano quartet===

Another common standard classical quartet is the piano quartet, usually consisting of violin, viola, cello, and piano. Romantic composers Beethoven, Brahms, and Mendelssohn each wrote three important compositions in this form, and Mozart, Dvořák, and Gabriel Fauré each wrote two. Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Quartet for the End of Time&quot; substitutes clarinet for viola.

===Other instrumental quartets===
Wind quartets are scored either the same as a string quartet with the wind instrument replacing the first violin (i.e. scored for wind, violin, viola and cello) or are groups of four wind instruments. Among the latter, the SATB format woodwind quartet of flute, oboe, clarinet, and bassoon is relatively common.

An example of a wind quartet featuring four of the same types of wind instruments is the saxophone quartet, consisting of soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone and baritone saxophone. Often a second alto may be substituted for the soprano part or a bass saxophone may be substituted for the baritone.

===Vocal quartet===
Compositions for four singers have been written for quartets a cappella; accompanied by instruments, such as a piano; and accompanied by larger vocal forces, such as a choir. Brahms and Schubert wrote numerous pieces for four voices that were once popular in private salons, although they are seldom performed today. Vocal quartets also feature within larger classical compositions, such as opera, choral works, and symphonic compositions. The final movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Messa da Requiem&quot; are two examples of renowned concert works that include vocal quartets.

Typically, a vocal quartet is composed of:
* Soprano, alto (or mezzo-soprano), tenor, and bass (or baritone), for mixed ensembles; or
* 1st tenor, 2nd tenor, baritone, and bass, for male groups; or
* 1st soprano, 2nd soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto, for female groups; or
* Tenor, lead, baritone, and bass, for barbershop style (both male and female).

===Baroque quartet===
The baroque quartet is a form of music composition similar to the trio sonata, but with four music parts performed by three solo melodic instruments and basso continuo. The solo instruments could be strings or wind instruments.

Examples of baroque quartets are Georg Philipp Telemann&#x27;s Paris quartets.

==Jazz==
Quartets are popular in jazz and jazz fusion music. Jazz quartet ensembles are often composed of a horn, classically clarinet (or saxophone, trumpet, etc.), a chordal instrument (e.g., electric guitar, piano, Hammond organ, vibraphone, etc.), a bass instrument (e.g., double bass, tuba or bass guitar) and a drum kit. This configuration is sometimes modified by using a second horn replacing the chordal instrument, such as a trumpet and saxophone with string bass and drum kit, or by using two chordal instruments (e.g., piano and electric guitar).

== Popular music ==

=== Rock and pop ===

The quartet lineup is also very common in pop and rock music. A standard quartet formation in pop and rock music is an ensemble typically consisting of a vocalist, an electric guitar, a bass guitar, and a drum kit. This configuration is sometimes modified so that the vocalist also plays guitar, or sometimes a keyboard instrument (e.g., organ, piano, synthesizer) or soloing instrument (e.g., saxophone) may be used.

=== Vocal quartet ===
In the 20th century Western popular music, the term &quot;vocal quartet&quot; usually refers to ensembles of four singers of the same gender. This is particularly common for barbershop quartets and Gospel quartets.

Some well-known female US vocal quartets include The Carter Sisters; The Forester Sisters; The Chiffons; The Chordettes; The Lennon Sisters; Blackpink the South Korean girl group; and En Vogue. Some well-known male US vocal quartets include The Oak Ridge Boys; The Statler Brothers; The Ames Brothers; The Chi-Lites; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; The Dixie Hummingbirds; The Four Aces; The Four Freshmen; The Four Seasons; Four Tops; The Statesmen Quartet; The Blackwood Brothers; Cathedral Quartet; Ernie Haase &amp; Signature Sound; Golden Gate Quartet; The Hilltoppers; The Jordanaires; and The Mills Brothers. The only known U.S. drag quartet is The Kinsey Sicks. Some mixed-gender vocal quartets include ABBA, The Pied Pipers; The Mamas &amp; the Papas; The Merry Macs; and The Weavers.

==Folk music==

===Russian===

A Russian folk-instrument quartet commonly consists of a bayan, a prima balalaika, a prima or alto domra, and a contrabass balalaika (e.g., Quartet Moskovskaya Balalaika). Configurations without a bayan include a prima domra, a prima balalaika, an alto domra, and a bass balalaika (Quartet Skaz); or two prima domras, a prima balalaika, and a bass balalaika.

<text>Quantum entanglement is the phenomenon of a group of particles being generated, interacting, or sharing spatial proximity in a manner such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical physics and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.

Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle&#x27;s properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.

Such phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;) and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.

Later, however, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum mechanics were verified in tests where polarization or spin of entangled particles were measured at separate locations, statistically violating Bell&#x27;s inequality. This established that the correlations produced from quantum entanglement cannot be explained in terms of local hidden variables, i.e., properties contained within the individual particles themselves.
However, despite the fact that entanglement can produce statistical correlations between events in widely separated places, it cannot be used for faster-than-light communication.
Quantum entanglement has been demonstrated experimentally with photons, electrons, top quarks, molecules and even small diamonds. The use of quantum entanglement in communication and computation is an active area of research and development.

== History ==
Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr engaged in a long-running collegial dispute about the meaning of quantum mechanics, now known as the Bohr–Einstein debates. During these debates, Einstein introduced a thought experiment about a box that emits a photon. He noted that the experimenter&#x27;s choice of what measurement to make upon the box will change what can be predicted about the photon, even if the photon is very far away. This argument, which Einstein had formulated by 1931, was an early recognition of the phenomenon that would later be called entanglement. That same year, Hermann Weyl observed in his textbook on group theory and quantum mechanics that quantum systems made of multiple interacting pieces exhibit a kind of &quot;Gestalt,&quot; in which &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;. In 1932, Erwin Schrödinger wrote down the defining equations of quantum entanglement but set them aside, unpublished. In 1935, Grete Hermann studied the mathematics of an electron interacting with a photon and noted the phenomenon that would come to be called entanglement. Later that same year, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published a paper on what is now known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox, a thought experiment that attempted to show that &quot;the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete&quot;. Their thought experiment had two systems interact, then separate, and they showed that afterwards quantum mechanics cannot describe the two systems individually.

Shortly after this paper appeared, Erwin Schrödinger wrote a letter to Einstein in German in which he used the word &quot;Verschränkung&quot; (translated by himself as &quot;entanglement&quot;) to describe situations like that of the EPR scenario. Schrödinger followed up with a full paper defining and discussing the notion of &quot;entanglement&quot;, saying &quot;I would not call [entanglement] &quot;one&quot; but rather &quot;the&quot; characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought.&quot; 
Like Einstein, Schrödinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement, because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity. Einstein later referred to the effects of entanglement as &quot;spukhafte Fernwirkung&quot; or &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;, meaning the acquisition of a value of a property at one location resulting from a measurement at a distant location.

In 1946, John Archibald Wheeler suggested studying the polarization of pairs of gamma-ray photons produced by electron–positron annihilation. Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov carried out this experiment in 1949, thereby demonstrating that the entangled particle pairs considered by EPR could be created in the laboratory. 

Despite Schrödinger&#x27;s claim of its importance, little work on entanglement was published for decades after his paper was published. In 1964 John S. Bell demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell&#x27;s inequality, regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying local realism, and showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems. His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments, starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972 and Alain Aspect&#x27;s experiments in 1982.

While Bell actively discouraged students from pursuing work like his as too esoteric, after a talk at Oxford a student named Artur Ekert suggested that the violation of a Bell inequality could be used as a resource for communication. Ekert followed up by publishing a quantum key distribution protocol called E91 based on it.

In 1992, the entanglement concept was leveraged to propose quantum teleportation, an effect that was realized experimentally in 1997.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, Anton Zeilinger used the generation of entanglement via parametric down-conversion to develop entanglement swapping and demonstrate quantum cryptography with entangled photons.

In 2022, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Aspect, Clauser, and Zeilinger &quot;for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science&quot;.

== Concept ==

=== Meaning of entanglement ===
Just as energy is a resource that facilitates mechanical operations, entanglement is a resource that facilitates performing tasks that involve communication and computation. The mathematical definition of entanglement can be paraphrased as saying that maximal knowledge about the whole of a system does not imply maximal knowledge about the individual parts of that system. If the quantum state that describes a pair of particles is entangled, then the results of measurements upon one half of the pair can be strongly correlated with the results of measurements upon the other. However, entanglement is not the same as &quot;correlation&quot; as understood in classical probability theory and in daily life. Instead, entanglement can be thought of as &quot;potential&quot; correlation that can be used to generate actual correlation in an appropriate experiment. The correlations generated from an entangled quantum state cannot in general be replicated by classical probability.

An example of entanglement is a subatomic particle that decays into an entangled pair of other particles. The decay events obey the various conservation laws, and as a result, the measurement outcomes of one daughter particle must be highly correlated with the measurement outcomes of the other daughter particle (so that the total momenta, angular momenta, energy, and so forth remains roughly the same before and after this process). For instance, a spin-zero particle could decay into a pair of spin-1/2 particles. If there is no orbital angular momentum, the total spin angular momentum after this decay must be zero (by the conservation of angular momentum). Whenever the first particle is measured to be spin up on some axis, the other, when measured on the same axis, is always found to be spin down. This is called the spin anti-correlated case and the pair is said to be in the singlet state. Perfect anti-correlations like this could be explained by &quot;hidden variables&quot; within the particles. For example, we could hypothesize that the particles are made in pairs such that one carries a value of &quot;up&quot; while the other carries a value of &quot;down&quot;. Then, knowing the result of the spin measurement upon one particle, we could predict that the other will have the opposite value. Bell illustrated this with a story about a colleague, Bertlmann, who always wore socks with mismatching colors. &quot;Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable,&quot; Bell wrote, but upon observing &quot;that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink.&quot; Revealing the remarkable features of quantum entanglement requires considering multiple distinct experiments, such as spin measurements along different axes, and comparing the correlations obtained in these different configurations.

Quantum systems can become entangled through various types of interactions. For some ways in which entanglement may be achieved for experimental purposes, see the section below on methods. Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made. In more detail, this process involves the particles becoming entangled with the environment, as a consequence of which, the quantum state describing the particles themselves is no longer entangled.

Mathematically, an entangled system can be defined to be one whose quantum state cannot be factored as a product of states of its local constituents; that is to say, they are not individual particles but are an inseparable whole. When entanglement is present, one constituent cannot be fully described without considering the other(s). The state of a composite system is always expressible as a sum, or superposition, of products of states of local constituents; it is entangled if this sum cannot be written as a single product term.

=== Paradox ===

The singlet state described above is the basis for one version of the EPR paradox. In this variant, introduced by David Bohm, a source emits particles and sends them in opposite directions. The state describing each pair is entangled. In the standard textbook presentation of quantum mechanics, performing a spin measurement on one of the particles causes the wave function for the whole pair to collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated. This means that the random outcome of the measurement made on one particle seems to have been transmitted to the other, so that it can make the &quot;right choice&quot; when it too is measured.

The distance and timing of the measurements can be chosen so as to make the interval between the two measurements spacelike, hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light. According to the principles of special relativity, it is not possible for any information to travel between two such measuring events. It is not even possible to say which of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events and there are inertial frames in which is first and others in which is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.

=== Failure of local hidden-variable theories ===
A possible resolution to the paradox is to assume that quantum theory is incomplete, and the result of measurements depends on predetermined &quot;hidden variables&quot;. The state of the particles being measured contains some hidden variables, whose values effectively determine, right from the moment of separation, what the outcomes of the spin measurements are going to be. This would mean that each particle carries all the required information with it, and nothing needs to be transmitted from one particle to the other at the time of measurement. Einstein and others (see the previous section) originally believed this was the only way out of the paradox, and the accepted quantum mechanical description (with a random measurement outcome) must be incomplete.

Local hidden variable theories fail, however, when measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes are considered. If a large number of pairs of such measurements are made (on a large number of pairs of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy Bell&#x27;s inequality. A number of experiments have shown in practice that Bell&#x27;s inequality is not satisfied. Moreover, when measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated.

The fundamental issue about measuring spin along different axes is that these measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are incompatible in the sense that these measurements&#x27; maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the uncertainty principle. This is contrary to what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations, and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.

== Nonlocality and entanglement ==
As discussed above, entanglement is necessary to produce a violation of a Bell inequality. However, the mere presence of entanglement alone is insufficient, as Bell himself noted in his 1964 paper. This is demonstrated, for example, by Werner states, which are a family of states describing pairs of particles. For appropriate choices of the key parameter that identifies a given Werner state within the full set thereof, the Werner states exhibit entanglement. Yet pairs of particles described by Werner states always admit a local hidden variable model. In other words, these states cannot power the violation of a Bell inequality, despite possessing entanglement. This can be generalized from pairs of particles to larger collections as well.

The violation of Bell inequalities is often called &quot;quantum nonlocality.&quot; This term is not without controversy. It is sometimes argued that using the term &quot;nonlocality&quot; carries the unwarranted implication that the violation of Bell inequalities must be explained by physical, faster-than-light signals. In other words, the failure of local hidden-variable models to reproduce quantum mechanics is not necessarily a sign of true nonlocality in quantum mechanics itself. Despite these reservations, the term &quot;nonlocality&quot; has become a widespread convention.

The term &quot;nonlocality&quot; is also sometimes applied to other concepts besides the nonexistence of a local hidden-variable model, such as whether states can be distinguished by local measurements. Moreover, quantum field theory is often said to be &quot;local&quot; because observables defined within spacetime regions that are spacelike separated must commute. These other uses of &quot;local&quot; and &quot;nonlocal&quot; are not discussed further here.

== Mathematical details ==
The following subsections use the formalism and theoretical framework developed in the articles bra–ket notation and mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.

=== Pure states ===
Consider two arbitrary quantum systems and , with respective Hilbert spaces and . The Hilbert space of the composite system is the tensor product
: formula_1

If the first system is in state formula_2 and the second in state formula_3, the state of the composite system is
: formula_4

States of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called separable states, or product states. However, not all states of the composite system are separable. Fix a basis formula_5 for and a basis formula_6 for . The most general state in is of the form
: formula_7.

This state is separable if there exist vectors formula_8 so that formula_9 yielding formula_10 and formula_11 It is inseparable if for any vectors formula_12 at least for one pair of coordinates formula_13 we have formula_14 If a state is inseparable, it is called an &#x27;entangled state&#x27;.

For example, given two basis vectors formula_15 of and two basis vectors formula_16 of , the following is an entangled state:
: formula_17

If the composite system is in this state, it is impossible to attribute to either system or system a definite pure state. Another way to say this is that while the von Neumann entropy of the whole state is zero (as it is for any pure state), the entropy of the subsystems is greater than zero. In this sense, the systems are &quot;entangled&quot;. The above example is one of four Bell states, which are (maximally) entangled pure states (pure states of the space, but which cannot be separated into pure states of each and ).

Now suppose Alice is an observer for system , and Bob is an observer for system . If in the entangled state given above Alice makes a measurement in the formula_18 eigenbasis of , there are two possible outcomes, occurring with equal probability: Alice can obtain the outcome 0, or she can obtain the outcome 1. If she obtains the outcome 0, then she can predict with certainty that Bob&#x27;s result will be 1. Likewise, if she obtains the outcome 1, then she can predict with certainty that Bob&#x27;s result will be 0. In other words, the results of measurements on the two qubits will be perfectly anti-correlated. This remains true even if the systems and are spatially separated. This is the foundation of the EPR paradox.

The outcome of Alice&#x27;s measurement is random. Alice cannot decide which state to collapse the composite system into, and therefore cannot transmit information to Bob by acting on her system. Causality is thus preserved, in this particular scheme. For the general argument, see no-communication theorem.

=== Ensembles ===
As mentioned above, a state of a quantum system is given by a unit vector in a Hilbert space. More generally, if one has less information about the system, then one calls it an &#x27;ensemble&#x27; and describes it by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite matrix, or a trace class when the state space is infinite-dimensional, and which has trace 1. By the spectral theorem, such a matrix takes the general form:
: formula_19
where the &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; are positive-valued probabilities (they sum up to 1), the vectors are unit vectors, and in the infinite-dimensional case, we would take the closure of such states in the trace norm. We can interpret as representing an ensemble where formula_20 is the proportion of the ensemble whose states are formula_21. When a mixed state has rank 1, it therefore describes a &#x27;pure ensemble&#x27;. When there is less than total information about the state of a quantum system we need density matrices to represent the state.

Experimentally, a mixed ensemble might be realized as follows. Consider a &quot;black box&quot; apparatus that spits electrons towards an observer. The electrons&#x27; Hilbert spaces are identical. The apparatus might produce electrons that are all in the same state; in this case, the electrons received by the observer are then a pure ensemble. However, the apparatus could produce electrons in different states. For example, it could produce two populations of electrons: one with state formula_22 with spins aligned in the positive direction, and the other with state formula_23 with spins aligned in the negative direction. Generally, this is a mixed ensemble, as there can be any number of populations, each corresponding to a different state.

Following the definition above, for a bipartite composite system, mixed states are just density matrices on . That is, it has the general form
: formula_24
where the &quot;w&quot;&quot;i&quot; are positively valued probabilities, formula_25, and the vectors are unit vectors. This is self-adjoint and positive and has trace 1.

Extending the definition of separability from the pure case, we say that a mixed state is separable if it can be written as
: formula_26
where the are positively valued probabilities and the formula_27s and formula_28s are themselves mixed states (density operators) on the subsystems and respectively. In other words, a state is separable if it is a probability distribution over uncorrelated states, or product states. By writing the density matrices as sums of pure ensembles and expanding, we may assume without loss of generality that formula_27 and formula_28 are themselves pure ensembles. A state is then said to be entangled if it is not separable.

In general, finding out whether or not a mixed state is entangled is considered difficult. The general bipartite case has been shown to be NP-hard. For the and cases, a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability is given by the famous Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) condition.

=== Reduced density matrices ===
The idea of a reduced density matrix was introduced by Paul Dirac in 1930. Consider as above systems and each with a Hilbert space . Let the state of the composite system be
: formula_31

As indicated above, in general there is no way to associate a pure state to the component system . However, it still is possible to associate a density matrix. Let
: formula_32.
which is the projection operator onto this state. The state of is the partial trace of over the basis of system :
: formula_33

The sum occurs over formula_34 and formula_35 the identity operator in formula_36. is sometimes called the reduced density matrix of on subsystem . Colloquially, we &quot;trace out&quot; or &quot;trace over&quot; system to obtain the reduced density matrix on .

For example, the reduced density matrix of for the entangled state
: formula_37
discussed above is
: formula_38

This demonstrates that the reduced density matrix for an entangled pure ensemble is a mixed ensemble. In contrast, the density matrix of for the pure product state formula_39 discussed above is
: formula_40
the projection operator onto formula_41.

In general, a bipartite pure state &quot;ρ&quot; is entangled if and only if its reduced states are mixed rather than pure.

=== Entanglement as a resource ===
In quantum information theory, entangled states are considered a &#x27;resource&#x27;, i.e., something costly to produce and that allows implementing valuable transformations. The setting in which this perspective is most evident is that of &quot;distant labs&quot;, i.e., two quantum systems labelled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; on each of which arbitrary quantum operations can be performed, but which do not interact with each other quantum mechanically. The only interaction allowed is the exchange of classical information, which combined with the most general local quantum operations gives rise to the class of operations called LOCC (local operations and classical communication). These operations do not allow the production of entangled states between systems A and B. But if A and B are provided with a supply of entangled states, then these, together with LOCC operations can enable a larger class of transformations. 

If Alice and Bob share an entangled state, Alice can tell Bob over a telephone call how to reproduce a quantum state formula_42 she has in her lab. Alice performs a joint measurement on formula_42 together with her half of the entangled state and tells Bob the results. Using Alice&#x27;s results Bob operates on his half of the entangled state to make it equal to formula_42. Since Alice&#x27;s measurement necessarily erases the quantum state of the system in her lab, the state formula_42 is not copied, but transferred: it is said to be &quot;teleported&quot; to Bob&#x27;s laboratory through this protocol.
Entanglement swapping is variant of teleportation that allows two parties that have never interacted to share an entangled state. The swapping protocol begins with two EPR sources. One source emits an entangled pair of particles A and B, while the other emits a second entangled pair of particles C and D. Particles B and C are subjected to a measurement in the basis of Bell states. The state of the remaining particles, C and D, collapses to a Bell state, leaving them entangled despite never having interacted with each other.

An interaction between a qubit of A and a qubit of B can be realized by first teleporting A&#x27;s qubit to B, then letting it interact with B&#x27;s qubit (which is now a LOCC operation, since both qubits are in B&#x27;s lab) and then teleporting the qubit back to A. Two maximally entangled states of two qubits are used up in this process. Thus entangled states are a resource that enables the realization of quantum interactions (or of quantum channels) in a setting where only LOCC are available, but they are consumed in the process. There are other applications where entanglement can be seen as a resource, e.g., private communication or distinguishing quantum states.

===Multipartite entanglement===

Quantum states describing systems made of more than two pieces can also be entangled. An example for a three-qubit system is the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state,
formula_46
Another three-qubit example is the W state:
formula_47
Tracing out any one of the three qubits turns the GHZ state into a separable state, whereas the result of tracing over any of the three qubits in the W state is still entangled. This illustrates how multipartite entanglement is a more complicated topic than bipartite entanglement: systems composed of three or more parts can exhibit multiple qualitatively different types of entanglement. A single particle cannot be maximally entangled with more than a particle at a time, a property called monogamy.

=== Classification of entanglement ===
Not all quantum states are equally valuable as a resource. One method to quantify this value is to use an entanglement measure that assigns a numerical value to each quantum state. However, it is often interesting to settle for a coarser way to compare quantum states. This gives rise to different classification schemes. Most entanglement classes are defined based on whether states can be converted to other states using LOCC or a subclass of these operations. The smaller the set of allowed operations, the finer the classification. Important examples are:
* If two states can be transformed into each other by a local unitary operation, they are said to be in the same &quot;LU class&quot;. This is the finest of the usually considered classes. Two states in the same LU class have the same value for entanglement measures and the same value as a resource in the distant-labs setting. There is an infinite number of different LU classes (even in the simplest case of two qubits in a pure state).
* If two states can be transformed into each other by local operations including measurements with probability larger than 0, they are said to be in the same &#x27;SLOCC class&#x27; (&quot;stochastic LOCC&quot;). Qualitatively, two states formula_48 and formula_49 in the same SLOCC class are equally powerful, since one can transform each into the other, but since the transformations formula_50 and formula_51 may succeed with different probability, they are no longer equally valuable. E.g., for two pure qubits there are only two SLOCC classes: the entangled states (which contains both the (maximally entangled) Bell states and weakly entangled states like formula_52) and the separable ones (i.e., product states like formula_53).
* Instead of considering transformations of single copies of a state (like formula_50) one can define classes based on the possibility of multi-copy transformations. E.g., there are examples when formula_50 is impossible by LOCC, but formula_56 is possible. A very important (and very coarse) classification is based on the property whether it is possible to transform an arbitrarily large number of copies of a state formula_57 into at least one pure entangled state. States that have this property are called distillable. These states are the most useful quantum states since, given enough of them, they can be transformed (with local operations) into any entangled state and hence allow for all possible uses. It came initially as a surprise that not all entangled states are distillable; those that are not are called &#x27;bound entangled&#x27;.

A different entanglement classification is based on what the quantum correlations present in a state allow A and B to do: one distinguishes three subsets of entangled states: (1) the &quot;non-local states&quot;, which produce correlations that cannot be explained by a local hidden variable model and thus violate a Bell inequality, (2) the &quot;steerable states&quot; that contain sufficient correlations for A to modify (&quot;steer&quot;) by local measurements the conditional reduced state of B in such a way, that A can prove to B that the state they possess is indeed entangled, and finally (3) those entangled states that are neither non-local nor steerable. All three sets are non-empty.

=== Entropy ===
In this section, the entropy of a mixed state is discussed as well as how it can be viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement.

==== Definition ====
In classical information theory , the Shannon entropy, is associated to a probability distribution, formula_58, in the following way:
: formula_59

Since a mixed state is a probability distribution over an ensemble, this leads naturally to the definition of the von Neumann entropy:
: formula_60
which can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of : 
: formula_61.

Since an event of probability 0 should not contribute to the entropy, and given that
: formula_62
the convention is adopted. When a pair of particles is described by the spin singlet state discussed above, the von Neumann entropy of either particle is , which can be shown to be the maximum entropy for mixed states.

==== As a measure of entanglement ====
Entropy provides one tool that can be used to quantify entanglement, although other entanglement measures exist. If the overall system is pure, the entropy of one subsystem can be used to measure its degree of entanglement with the other subsystems. For bipartite pure states, the von Neumann entropy of reduced states is the unique measure of entanglement in the sense that it is the only function on the family of states that satisfies certain axioms required of an entanglement measure.

It is a classical result that the Shannon entropy achieves its maximum at, and only at, the uniform probability distribution . Therefore, a bipartite pure state is said to be a &quot;maximally entangled state&quot; if the reduced state of each subsystem of is the diagonal matrix
: formula_63

For mixed states, the reduced von Neumann entropy is not the only reasonable entanglement measure.

Rényi entropy also can be used as a measure of entanglement.

=== Entanglement measures ===
Entanglement measures quantify the amount of entanglement in a (often viewed as a bipartite) quantum state. As aforementioned, entanglement entropy is the standard measure of entanglement for pure states (but no longer a measure of entanglement for mixed states). For mixed states, there are some entanglement measures in the literature and no single one is standard.
* Entanglement cost
* Distillable entanglement
* Entanglement of formation
* Concurrence
* Relative entropy of entanglement
* Squashed entanglement
* Logarithmic negativity
Most (but not all) of these entanglement measures reduce for pure states to entanglement entropy, and are difficult (NP-hard) to compute for mixed states as the dimension of the entangled system grows.

=== Quantum field theory ===
The Reeh–Schlieder theorem of quantum field theory is sometimes interpreted as saying that entanglement is omnipresent in the quantum vacuum.

== Applications ==

Entanglement has many applications in quantum information theory. With the aid of entanglement, otherwise impossible tasks may be achieved.

Among the best-known applications of entanglement are superdense coding and quantum teleportation.

Most researchers believe that entanglement is necessary to realize quantum computing (although this is disputed by some).

Entanglement is used in some protocols of quantum cryptography, but to prove the security of quantum key distribution (QKD) under standard assumptions does not require entanglement. However, the &quot;device independent&quot; security of QKD is shown exploiting entanglement between the communication partners.

In August 2014, Brazilian researcher Gabriela Barreto Lemos, from the University of Vienna, and team were able to &quot;take pictures&quot; of objects using photons that had not interacted with the subjects, but were entangled with photons that did interact with such objects. The idea has been adapted to make infrared images using only standard cameras that are insensitive to infrared.

=== Entangled states ===
There are several canonical entangled states that appear often in theory and experiments.

For two qubits, the Bell states are
: formula_64
: formula_65

These four pure states are all maximally entangled and form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space of the two qubits. They provide examples of how quantum mechanics can violate Bell-type inequalities.

For qubits, the GHZ state is
: formula_66
which reduces to the Bell state formula_67 for . The traditional GHZ state was defined for . GHZ states are occasionally extended to qudits, i.e., systems of &quot;d&quot; rather than 2 dimensions.

Also for qubits, there are spin squeezed states, a class of squeezed coherent states satisfying certain restrictions on the uncertainty of spin measurements, which are necessarily entangled. Spin squeezed states are good candidates for enhancing precision measurements using quantum entanglement.

For two bosonic modes, a NOON state is
: formula_68

This is like the Bell state formula_69 except the basis states formula_70 and formula_71 have been replaced with &quot;the &quot;N&quot; photons are in one mode&quot; and &quot;the &quot;N&quot; photons are in the other mode&quot;.

Finally, there also exist twin Fock states for bosonic modes, which can be created by feeding a Fock state into two arms leading to a beam splitter. They are the sum of multiple NOON states, and can be used to achieve the Heisenberg limit.

For the appropriately chosen measures of entanglement, Bell, GHZ, and NOON states are maximally entangled while spin squeezed and twin Fock states are only partially entangled.

=== Methods of creating entanglement ===
Entanglement is usually created by direct interactions between subatomic particles. These interactions can take numerous forms. One of the most commonly used methods is spontaneous parametric down-conversion to generate a pair of photons entangled in polarization. Other methods include the use of a fibre coupler to confine and mix photons, photons emitted from decay cascade of the bi-exciton in a quantum dot, or the use of the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect. Quantum entanglement of a particle and its antiparticle, such as an electron and a positron, can be created by partial overlap of the corresponding quantum wave functions in Hardy&#x27;s interferometer. In the earliest tests of Bell&#x27;s theorem, the entangled particles were generated using atomic cascades.

It is also possible to create entanglement between quantum systems that never directly interacted, through the use of entanglement swapping. Two independently prepared, identical particles may also be entangled if their wave functions merely spatially overlap, at least partially.

=== Testing a system for entanglement ===

A density matrix &quot;ρ&quot; is called separable if it can be written as a convex sum of product states, namely
formula_72
with formula_73 probabilities. By definition, a state is entangled if it is not separable.

For 2-qubit and qubit-qutrit systems (2 × 2 and 2 × 3 respectively) the simple Peres–Horodecki criterion provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for separability, and thus—inadvertently—for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a necessary one for separability, as the problem becomes NP-hard when generalized. Other separability criteria include (but not limited to) the range criterion, reduction criterion, and those based on uncertainty relations. See Ref. for a review of separability criteria in discrete-variable systems and Ref. for a review on techniques and challenges in experimental entanglement certification in discrete-variable systems.

A numerical approach to the problem is suggested by Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper &quot;Geometrical aspects of entanglement&quot;. Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, and checking if the target state can indeed be reached.

In continuous variable systems, the Peres–Horodecki criterion also applies. Specifically, Simon formulated a particular version of the Peres–Horodecki criterion in terms of the second-order moments of canonical operators and showed that it is necessary and sufficient for formula_74-mode Gaussian states (see Ref. for a seemingly different but essentially equivalent approach). It was later found that Simon&#x27;s condition is also necessary and sufficient for formula_75-mode Gaussian states, but no longer sufficient for formula_76-mode Gaussian states. Simon&#x27;s condition can be generalized by taking into account the higher order moments of canonical operators or by using entropic measures.

=== In quantum gravity ===
There is a fundamental conflict, referred to as the problem of time, between the way the concept of &quot;time&quot; is used in quantum mechanics, and the role it plays in general relativity. In standard quantum theories time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, while general relativity treats time as a dynamical variable which relates directly with matter. Part of the effort to reconcile these approaches to time results in the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which predicts the state of the universe is timeless or static, contrary to ordinary experience. 
Work started by Don Page and William Wootters suggests that the universe appears to evolve for observers on the inside because of energy entanglement between an evolving system and a clock system, both within the universe. In this way the overall system can remain timeless while parts experience time via entanglement. The issue remains an open question closely related to attempts at theories of quantum gravity.

In general relativity, gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime and that curvature derives from the distribution of matter. However, matter is governed by quantum mechanics. Integration of these two theories faces many problems. In an (unrealistic) model space called the anti-de Sitter space, the AdS/CFT correspondence allows a quantum gravitational system to be related to a quantum field theory without gravity. Using this correspondence, Mark Van Raamsdonk suggested that spacetime arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the spacetime.

== Experiments demonstrating and using entanglement ==
===Bell tests===

A Bell test, also known as &quot;Bell inequality test&quot; or &quot;Bell experiment&quot;, is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics against the hypothesis of local hidden variables. These tests empirically evaluate the implications of Bell&#x27;s theorem. To date, all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave. Many types of Bell tests have been performed in physics laboratories, often with the goal of ameliorating problems of experimental design or set-up that could in principle affect the validity of the findings of earlier Bell tests. This is known as &quot;closing loopholes in Bell tests&quot;. In earlier tests, it could not be ruled out that the result at one point could have been subtly transmitted to the remote point, affecting the outcome at the second location. However, so-called &quot;loophole-free&quot; Bell tests have since been performed where the locations were sufficiently separated that communications at the speed of light would have taken longer—in one case, 10,000 times longer—than the interval between the measurements.

In 2017, Yin et al. reported setting a new quantum entanglement distance record of 1,203 km, demonstrating the survival of a two-photon pair and a violation of a Bell inequality, reaching a CHSH valuation of , under strict Einstein locality conditions, from the Micius satellite to bases in Lijian, Yunnan and Delingha, Qinghai, increasing the efficiency of transmission over prior fiberoptic experiments by an order of magnitude.

=== Entanglement of top quarks ===
In 2023 the LHC using techniques from quantum tomography measured entanglement at the highest energy so far, a rare intersection between quantum information and high energy physics based on theoretical work first proposed in 2021. The experiment was carried by the ATLAS detector measuring the spin of top-quark pair production and the effect was observed with a more than 5&quot;σ&quot; level of significance, the top quark is the heaviest known particle and therefore has a very short lifetime () being the only quark that decays before undergoing hadronization (~ ) and spin decorrelation (~ ), so the spin information is transferred without much loss to the leptonic decays products that will be caught by the detector. The spin polarization and correlation of the particles was measured and tested for entanglement with concurrence as well as the Peres–Horodecki criterion and subsequently the effect has been confirmed too in the CMS detector.

=== Entanglement of macroscopic objects ===
In 2020, researchers reported the quantum entanglement between the motion of a millimetre-sized mechanical oscillator and a disparate distant spin system of a cloud of atoms. Later work complemented this work by quantum-entangling two mechanical oscillators.

=== Entanglement of elements of living systems ===
In October 2018, physicists reported producing quantum entanglement using living organisms, particularly between photosynthetic molecules within living bacteria and quantized light.

Living organisms (green sulphur bacteria) have been studied as mediators to create quantum entanglement between otherwise non-interacting light modes, showing high entanglement between light and bacterial modes, and to some extent, even entanglement within the bacteria.

=== Entanglement of quarks and gluons in protons ===
Physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory demonstrated quantum entanglement within protons, showing quarks and gluons are interdependent rather than isolated particles. Using high-energy electron-proton collisions, they revealed maximal entanglement, reshaping our understanding of proton structure.

<text>The Quasi-War was an undeclared war from 1798 to 1800 between the United States and the French First Republic. It was fought almost entirely at sea, primarily in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States, with minor actions in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. 

In 1793, Congress unilaterally suspended repayment of French loans from the American Revolutionary War, and in 1794 signed the Jay Treaty with Great Britain. Then engaged in the 1792 to 1797 War of the First Coalition, France retaliated by seizing U.S. ships trading with Great Britain. When diplomacy failed to resolve these issues, in October 1796 French privateers began attacking all merchant ships in U.S. waters, regardless of nationality. 

Spending cuts following the end of the American Revolutionary War left the U.S. unable to mount an effective response, and within a year over 316 American ships had been captured. In March 1798, Congress reconstituted the United States Navy, and in July authorized the use of force against France. By 1799, losses had been significantly reduced through informal cooperation with the Royal Navy, whereby merchant ships from both nations were allowed to join each other&#x27;s convoys. 

The replacement of the French First Republic by the Consulate in November 1799 led to the Convention of 1800, which ended the war. The right of Congress to authorize military action without a formal declaration of war was later confirmed by the Supreme Court. This ruling formed the basis of many similar actions since, including U.S. participation in the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War.

==Background==
Under the Treaty of Alliance (1778), the United States had agreed to protect the French West Indies in return for French support in the American Revolutionary War. Because the treaty had no termination date, France claimed this obligation included defending them against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic during the 1792 to 1797 War of the First Coalition. Despite popular enthusiasm for the French Revolution, there was little support for this in Congress. Neutrality allowed New England shipowners to earn huge profits evading the British blockade, while Southern plantation owners feared the example set by France&#x27;s abolition of slavery in 1794.

In 1793, Congress suspended repayment of French loans incurred during the Revolutionary War, arguing the execution of Louis XVI and establishment of the French First Republic rendered existing agreements void. They further argued American military obligations under the Treaty of Alliance applied only to a &quot;defensive conflict&quot; and thus did not apply, since France had declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. To ensure the U.S. did not become involved, Congress passed the Neutrality Act of 1794, while President George Washington issued an executive order forbidding American merchant ships from arming themselves. 

France accepted these acts on the basis of &quot;benevolent neutrality&quot;. They interpreted this as allowing French privateers to enter U.S. ports, and to sell captured British ships in American prize courts, but not vice versa. However, the U.S. viewed it as the right to provide the same privileges to both. These differences were further exacerbated in November 1794 when the U.S. and Britain signed the Jay Treaty. By resolving outstanding issues from the American Revolution, it led to a rapid expansion of trade between the two countries. Between 1794 and 1801, American exports to Britain nearly tripled in value, from US$33 million to $94 million.

In late 1796, French privateers began seizing American ships trading with the British, helped by the almost complete lack of a United States Navy. Their last warship had been sold in 1785, leaving only a small flotilla belonging to the United States Revenue Cutter Service and a few neglected coastal forts. From October 1796 to June 1797, French vessels captured 316 ships, 6% of the entire American merchant fleet, causing losses of $12 to $15 million. On 2 March 1797, the French Directory issued a decree permitting the seizure of any neutral shipping without a &quot;role d&#x27;equipage&quot; listing the nationalities of each crewmen. Since American ships rarely carried such documents, France had effectively initiated a commerce war.

Diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict ended in the 1797 dispute known as the XYZ Affair. However, the hostilities created support for establishing a limited naval force, and on 18 June, President John Adams appointed Benjamin Stoddert the first Secretary of the Navy. On 7 July 1798, Congress approved the use of force against French warships in American waters, but wanted to ensure conflict did not escalate beyond these limits. As a result, it was called a &quot;limited&quot; or &quot;Quasi-War&quot;, and led to political debate over whether it was constitutional. A series of rulings by the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the ability of the U.S. to conduct undeclared wars, or &quot;police actions&quot;.

==Forces and strategy==
Since ships of the line were expensive to build and required highly specialised construction facilities, in 1794 Congress compromised by ordering six large frigates. By 1798, the first three were nearly complete and on 16 July 1798, additional funding was approved for the , , and , plus the frigates and . The provision of naval stores and equipment by the British allowed these to be built relatively quickly, and all saw action during the war.

These vessels were enhanced by so-called &quot;subscription ships&quot;, privately funded vessels provided by individual cities. They included five frigates, among them the , commanded by Stephen Decatur, and four merchantmen converted into sloops. Primarily intended to attack foreign shipping, they earned huge profits for their owners; the captured over 80 enemy vessels, including the French corvette .

With most of the French fleet confined to Europe by the Royal Navy, Secretary Stoddert was able to focus resources on eliminating the few vessels that evaded the blockade and reached the Caribbean. The U.S. also needed convoy protection, and while there was no formal agreement with the British, considerable co-operation took place at a local level. The two navies shared a signal system, and allowed their merchantmen to join each other&#x27;s convoys, most of which were provided by the British, who had four to five times more escorts available.

This freed the U.S. Navy to concentrate on French privateers, most of which had very shallow draft and were armed with a maximum of twenty guns. Operating from French and Spanish bases in the Caribbean, particularly Guadeloupe, they made opportunistic attacks on passing ships, before escaping back into port. To counter those tactics, the U.S. used similarly-sized vessels from the Revenue Cutter Service, as well as commissioning their own privateers. The first American ship to see action was the , a converted East Indiaman with 26 guns, but most were far smaller.

The revenue cutter , commanded by Edward Preble, made two cruises to the West Indies and captured ten prizes. Preble turned command of &quot;Pickering&quot; over to Benjamin Hillar, who captured the much larger and more heavily armed French privateer &quot;l″Egypte Conquise&quot; after a nine-hour battle. In September 1800, the &quot;Pickering&quot; and her entire crew were lost at sea in a storm. Preble next commanded the frigate , which he sailed around Cape Horn into the Pacific to protect U.S. merchantmen in the East Indies. He recaptured several U.S. ships that had been seized by French privateers.

The first significant study of the war was written by U.S. naval historian Gardner W. Allen in 1909, and focused exclusively on ship-to-ship actions. This is how the conflict is generally remembered in the U.S., but historian Michael Palmer argues American naval operations cannot be assessed in isolation. When operating in the Caribbean 

==Significant naval actions==
From the perspective of the U.S. Navy, the Quasi-War consisted of a series of ship-to-ship actions in U.S. coastal waters and the Caribbean; one of the first was the Capture of &quot;La Croyable&quot; on 7 July 1798 by outside Egg Harbor, New Jersey. On 20 November, a pair of French frigates, &quot;Insurgente&quot; and &quot;Volontaire&quot;, captured the schooner , commanded by Lieutenant William Bainbridge; &quot;Retaliation&quot; was recaptured on 28 June 1799.

On 9 February 1799, the frigate captured the French Navy&#x27;s frigate &quot;L&#x27;Insurgente&quot;. By 1 July, under the command of Decatur, had been refitted and repaired and embarked on her mission to patrol the South Atlantic coast and West Indies in search of French ships which were preying on American merchant vessels.

On 1 January 1800, a convoy of American merchant ships escorted by fought off an attack by French-allied Haitian privateers near Hispaniola. On 1 February, &quot;Constellation&quot; severely damaged the French frigate &quot;La Vengeance&quot; off the coast of Saint Kitts. Silas Talbot led a naval expedition during the Battle of Puerto Plata Harbor in early May, capturing a Spanish army controlled coastal fort and a French corvette. When French troops occupied Curaçao in July, and bombarded French positions on the island and landed marines to support the local Dutch troops before the French withdrew. On 12 October, the frigate &quot;Boston&quot; captured the corvette .

On 25 October, defeated the French brig &quot;Flambeau&quot; near Dominica. &quot;Enterprise&quot; also captured eight privateers and freed eleven U.S. merchant ships from captivity, while &quot;Experiment&quot; captured the French privateers &quot;Deux Amis&quot; and &quot;Diane&quot; and liberated numerous American merchant ships. Although U.S. military losses were light, the French had seized over 2,000 American merchant ships by the time the war ended.

==Conclusion of hostilities==
It has been suggested that since the war was primarily driven by domestic political considerations, neither side was able to identify what a successful resolution entailed. This was enhanced by the tendency of individual commanders to pursue their own objectives, and on the American side, focusing on ship to ship actions rather than overall strategy. 

In any event, by late 1800 U.S. and British naval operations, combined with a more conciliatory diplomatic stance by the new French government, had significantly reduced privateer activity. The Convention of 1800, signed on 30 September, ended the Quasi-War. It affirmed the rights of Americans as neutrals upon the sea and abrogated the 1778 French alliance, but failed to provide compensation for the alleged $20 million in American economic losses. While the agreement ensured the U.S. remained neutral during the Napoleonic Wars, it failed to resolve the underlying tensions with warring European nations, which led to the War of 1812.

<text>A quality management system (QMS) is a collection of business processes focused on consistently meeting customer requirements and enhancing their satisfaction. It is aligned with an organization&#x27;s purpose and strategic direction (ISO 9001:2015). It is expressed as the organizational goals and aspirations, policies, processes, documented information, and resources needed to implement and maintain it. Early quality management systems emphasized predictable outcomes of an industrial product production line, using simple statistics and random sampling. By the 20th century, labor inputs were typically the most costly inputs in most industrialized societies, so focus shifted to team cooperation and dynamics, especially the early signaling of problems via a continual improvement cycle. In the 21st century, QMS has tended to converge with sustainability and transparency initiatives, as both investor and customer satisfaction and perceived quality are increasingly tied to these factors. Of QMS regimes, the ISO 9000 family of standards is probably the most widely implemented worldwide – the ISO 19011 audit regime applies to both and deals with quality and sustainability and their integration.

Other QMS, e.g. Natural Step, focus on sustainability issues and assume that other quality problems will be reduced as result of the systematic thinking, transparency, documentation and diagnostic discipline.

The term &quot;Quality Management System&quot; and the initialism &quot;QMS&quot; were invented in 1991 by Ken Croucher, a British management consultant working on designing and implementing a generic model of a QMS within the IT industry.

==Concept of quality – historical background==
The concept of a quality as we think of it now first emerged from the Industrial Revolution. Previously goods had been made from start to finish by the same person or team of people, with handcrafting and tweaking the product to meet &#x27;quality criteria&#x27;. Mass production brought huge teams of people together to work on specific stages of production where one person would not necessarily complete a product from start to finish. In the late 19th century pioneers such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henry Ford recognized the limitations of the methods being used in mass production at the time and the subsequent varying quality of output. Birland established Quality Departments to oversee the quality of production and rectifying of errors, and Ford emphasized standardization of design and component standards to ensure a standard product was produced. Management of quality was the responsibility of the Quality department and was implemented by Inspection of product output to &#x27;catch&#x27; defects.

Application of statistical control came later as a result of World War production methods, which were advanced by the work done of W. Edwards Deming, a statistician, after whom the Deming Prize for quality is named. Joseph M. Juran focused more on managing for quality. The first edition of Juran&#x27;s Quality Control Handbook was published in 1951. He also developed the &quot;Juran&#x27;s trilogy&quot;, an approach to cross-functional management that is composed of three managerial processes: quality planning, quality control, and quality improvement. These functions all play a vital role when evaluating quality.

Quality, as a profession and the managerial process associated with the quality function, was introduced during the second half of the 20th century and has evolved since then. Over this period, few other disciplines have seen as many changes as the quality profession.

The quality profession grew from simple control to engineering, to systems engineering. Quality control activities were predominant in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The 1970s were an era of quality engineering and the 1990s saw quality systems as an emerging field. Like medicine, accounting, and engineering, quality has achieved status as a recognized profession.

As Lee and Dale (1998) state, there are many organizations that are striving to assess the methods and ways in which their overall productivity, the quality of their products and services and the required operations to achieve them are done.

==Medical devices==
The two primary, state of the art, guidelines for medical device manufacturer QMS and related services today are the ISO 13485 standards and the US FDA 21 CFR 820 regulations. The two have a great deal of similarity, and many manufacturers adopt QMS that is compliant with both guidelines.

ISO 13485 are harmonized with the European Union Regulation 2017/745 as well as the IVD and AIMD directives. The ISO standard is also incorporated in regulations for other jurisdictions such as Japan (JPAL) and Canada (CMDCAS).

Quality System requirements for medical devices have been internationally recognized as a way to assure product safety and efficacy and customer satisfaction since at least 1983 and were instituted as requirements in a final rule published on October 7, 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had documented design defects in medical devices that contributed to recalls from 1983 to 1989 that would have been prevented if Quality Systems had been in place. The rule is promulgated at 21 CFR 820.

According to current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), medical device manufacturers have the responsibility to use good judgment when developing their quality system and apply those sections of the FDA Quality System (QS) Regulation that are applicable to their specific products and operations, in Part 820 of the QS regulation. As with GMP, operating within this flexibility, it is the responsibility of each manufacturer to establish requirements for each type or family of devices that will result in devices that are safe and effective, and to establish methods and procedures to design, produce, and distribute devices that meet the quality system requirements.

The FDA has identified in the QS regulation the 7 essential subsystems of a quality system. These subsystems include:

* Management controls;
* Design controls;
* Production and process controls
* Corrective and preventative actions
* Material controls
* Records, documents, and change controls
* Facilities and equipment controls
all overseen by management and quality audits.

Because the QS regulation covers a broad spectrum of devices and production processes, it allows some leeway in the details of quality system elements. It is left to manufacturers to determine the necessity for, or extent of, some quality elements and to develop and implement procedures tailored to their particular processes and devices. For example, if it is impossible to mix up labels at a manufacturer because there is only one label to each product, then there is no necessity for the manufacturer to comply with all of the GMP requirements under device labeling.

Drug manufacturers are regulated under a different section of the Code of Federal Regulations:

==Organizations and awards==

The International Organization for Standardization&#x27;s ISO 9001:2015 series describes standards for a QMS addressing the principles and processes surrounding the design, development, and delivery of a general product or service. Organizations can participate in a continuing certification process to ISO 9001:2015 to demonstrate their compliance with the standard, which includes a requirement for continual (i.e. planned) improvement of the QMS, as well as more foundational QMS components such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).

ISO 9000:2005 provides information on the fundamentals and vocabulary used in quality management systems. ISO 9004:2009 provides guidance on a quality management approach for the sustained success of an organization. Neither of these standards can be used for certification purposes as they provide guidance, not requirements.

The Baldrige Performance Excellence Program educates organizations in improving their performance and administers the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. The Baldrige Award recognizes U.S. organizations for performance excellence based on the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence. The Criteria address critical aspects of management that contribute to performance excellence: leadership; strategy; customers; measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; workforce; operations; and results.

The European Foundation for Quality Management&#x27;s EFQM Excellence Model supports an award scheme similar to the Baldrige Award for European companies.

In Canada, the National Quality Institute presents the &#x27;Canada Awards for Excellence&#x27; on an annual basis to organizations that have displayed outstanding performance in the areas of Quality and workplace wellness, and have met the institute&#x27;s criteria with documented overall achievements and results.

The European Quality in Social Service (EQUASS) is a sector-specific quality system designed for the social services sector and addresses quality principles that are specific to service delivery to vulnerable groups, such as empowerment, rights, and person-centredness.

The Alliance for Performance Excellence is a network of state and local organizations that use the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the grassroots level to improve the performance of local organizations and economies. browsers can find Alliance members in their state and get the latest news and events from the Baldrige community.

==Process==
A QMS process is an element of an organizational QMS. The ISO 9001 standard requires organizations seeking compliance or certification to define the processes which form the QMS and the sequence and interaction of these processes. Butterworth-Heinemann and other publishers have offered several books which provide step-by-step guides to those seeking the quality certifications of their products.

Examples of such processes include:

comply with specific requirements e.g. statistical process control and measurement systems analysis,

* calibrations,
* corrective and preventive action,
* internal audit,
* order processes,
* product/ service/ process measurements to 
* identification, labeling and control of non-conforming products to prevent its inadvertent use, delivery or processing,
* production plans,
* purchasing and related processes such as supplier selection and 

ISO 9001 requires that the performance of these processes be measured, analyzed and continually improved, and the results of this form an input into the management review process.

== Software ==
Quality management software offers the techniques, processes, structure, and resources needed to simplify manufacturing and ERP activities while handling quality concerns efficiently and cost-effectively.

Helps manufacturers to monitor, control, and document quality processes electronically to guarantee that goods are made within tolerance, meet all necessary requirements, and are defect-free. Quality management software is often used in the manufacturing industry to identify potential issues before they occur.

Some benefits of quality management software include:

* real-time data monitoring
* issue prevention
* risk management
* increased efficiency and productivity
* process consistency
* increased employee participation

Quality management software can be integrated with manufacturing execution systems (MES). A MES is a complete, dynamic software system for monitoring, tracking, documenting, and controlling the manufacturing process from raw materials to final products. When combined with QMS, these systems:

* ensure compliance
* enable quality programs
* eliminate waste
* less product recalls
* lower per-product cost
* higher product quality
* product tracking
* real-time information for increase in quality control
* realistic production schedules
* up-to-date inventory
Quality management software focuses on 4 main elements:

# Document management: Quality management software enables companies to manage all product and quality records and documents, including product specifications, work instructions, standard operating procedures (SOPs), quality policies, and training records, among other things, to fulfill highly regulated requirements. Quality management software centralizes the storage of these documents. 
# Regulatory compliance: To decrease compliance risks, quality management software is used within companies to make sure they comply with ISO, OSHA, FDA, and other industry norms and requirements. The software makes closed-loop corrective and preventive action procedures (CAPA) possible, which result in faster issue resolution and issue prevention.
# Feedback loops: Quality management software permits staff to submit feedback or recommendations through centralized software. In turn, this way, managers gather insights from the shop floor creating a feedback loop.
# Training and skill management: To maintain product quality, quality management software can provide a fixed system through which employees and staff can be trained. This fixed system provides more clarity in the different tracking processes of the company and simplifies the tracking of different skill levels of employees.

Most quality management software are cloud-based and offer software as a service.

It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the application-level ROSE protocol. ISDN &quot;proper&quot; functions as the physical link layer.

QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms provided by disparate vendors. 

QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function). QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and government networks, such as line identification, call intrusion and call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.

QSIG will likely never rival each vendor&#x27;s private network protocols, but it does provide an option for a higher level of integration than that of the traditional choices.

<text>A quasiperiodic crystal, or quasicrystal, is a structure that is ordered but not periodic. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks translational symmetry. While crystals, according to the classical crystallographic restriction theorem, can possess only two-, three-, four-, and six-fold rotational symmetries, the Bragg diffraction pattern of quasicrystals shows sharp peaks with other symmetry orders—for instance, five-fold.

Aperiodic tilings were discovered by mathematicians in the early 1960s, and, some twenty years later, they were found to apply to the study of natural quasicrystals. The discovery of these aperiodic forms in nature has produced a paradigm shift in the field of crystallography. In crystallography the quasicrystals were predicted in 1981 by a five-fold symmetry study of Alan Lindsay Mackay,—that also brought in 1982, with the crystallographic Fourier transform of a Penrose tiling, the possibility of identifying quasiperiodic order in a material through diffraction.

Quasicrystals had been investigated and observed earlier, but, until the 1980s, they were disregarded in favor of the prevailing views about the atomic structure of matter. In 2009, after a dedicated search, a mineralogical finding, icosahedrite, offered evidence for the existence of natural quasicrystals.

Roughly, an ordering is non-periodic if it lacks translational symmetry, which means that a shifted copy will never match exactly with its original. The more precise mathematical definition is that there is never translational symmetry in more than &quot;n&quot; – 1 linearly independent directions, where &quot;n&quot; is the dimension of the space filled, e.g., the three-dimensional tiling displayed in a quasicrystal may have translational symmetry in two directions. Symmetrical diffraction patterns result from the existence of an indefinitely large number of elements with a regular spacing, a property loosely described as long-range order. Experimentally, the aperiodicity is revealed in the unusual symmetry of the diffraction pattern, that is, symmetry of orders other than two, three, four, or six.

In 1982, materials scientist Dan Shechtman observed that certain aluminium–manganese alloys produced unusual diffractograms, which today are seen as revelatory of quasicrystal structures. Due to fear of the scientific community&#x27;s reaction, it took him two years to publish the results. Shechtman&#x27;s discovery challenged the long-held belief that all crystals are periodic. Observed in a rapidly solidified Al-Mn alloy, quasicrystals exhibited icosahedral symmetry, which was previously thought impossible in crystallography. This breakthrough, supported by theoretical models and experimental evidence, led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of solid-state matter. Despite initial skepticism, the discovery gained widespread acceptance, prompting the International Union of Crystallography to redefine the term &quot;crystal.&quot; The work ultimately earned Shechtman the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and inspired significant advancements in materials science and mathematics.

On 25 October 2018, Luca Bindi and Paul Steinhardt were awarded the Aspen Institute 2018 Prize for collaboration and scientific research between Italy and the United States, after they discovered icosahedrite, the first quasicrystal known to occur naturally.

==History==

The first representations of perfect quasicrystalline patterns can be found in several early Islamic works of art and architecture such as the Gunbad-i-Kabud tomb tower, the Darb-e Imam shrine and the Al-Attarine Madrasa. On July 16, 1945, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, the Trinity nuclear bomb test produced icosahedral quasicrystals. They went unnoticed at the time of the test but were later identified in samples of red trinitite, a glass-like substance formed from fused sand and copper transmission lines. Identified in 2021, they are the oldest known anthropogenic quasicrystals.
In 1961, Hao Wang asked whether determining if a set of tiles admits a tiling of the plane is an algorithmically unsolvable problem or not. He conjectured that it is solvable, relying on the hypothesis that every set of tiles that can tile the plane can do it &quot;periodically&quot; (hence, it would suffice to try to tile bigger and bigger patterns until obtaining one that tiles periodically). Nevertheless, two years later, his student Robert Berger constructed a set of some 20,000 square tiles (now called Wang tiles) that can tile the plane but not in a periodic fashion. As further aperiodic sets of tiles were discovered, sets with fewer and fewer shapes were found. In 1974 Roger Penrose discovered a set of just two tiles, now referred to as Penrose tiles, that produced only non-periodic tilings of the plane. These tilings displayed instances of fivefold symmetry. One year later Alan Mackay showed theoretically that the diffraction pattern from the Penrose tiling had a two-dimensional Fourier transform consisting of sharp &#x27;delta&#x27; peaks arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern. Around the same time, Robert Ammann created a set of aperiodic tiles that produced eightfold symmetry.

In 1972, R. M. de Wolf and W. van Aalst reported that the diffraction pattern produced by a crystal of sodium carbonate cannot be labeled with three indices but needed one more, which implied that the underlying structure had four dimensions in reciprocal space. Other puzzling cases have been reported, but until the concept of quasicrystal came to be established, they were explained away or denied.

Dan Shechtman first observed ten-fold electron diffraction patterns in 1982, while conducting a routine study of an aluminium–manganese alloy, Al6Mn, at the US National Bureau of Standards (later NIST). Shechtman related his observation to Ilan Blech, who responded that such diffractions had been seen before. Around that time, Shechtman also related his finding to John W. Cahn of the NIST, who did not offer any explanation and challenged him to solve the observation. Shechtman quoted Cahn as saying: &quot;Danny, this material is telling us something, and I challenge you to find out what it is&quot;.

The observation of the ten-fold diffraction pattern lay unexplained for two years until the spring of 1984, when Blech asked Shechtman to show him his results again. A quick study of Shechtman&#x27;s results showed that the common explanation for a ten-fold symmetrical diffraction pattern, a type of crystal twinning, was ruled out by his experiments. Therefore, Blech looked for a new structure containing cells connected to each other by defined angles and distances but without translational periodicity. He decided to use a computer simulation to calculate the diffraction intensity from a cluster of such a material, which he termed as &quot;multiple polyhedral&quot;, and found a ten-fold structure similar to what was observed. The multiple polyhedral structure was termed later by many researchers as icosahedral glass.

Shechtman accepted Blech&#x27;s discovery of a new type of material and chose to publish his observation in a paper entitled &quot;The Microstructure of Rapidly Solidified Al6Mn&quot;, which was written around June 1984 and published in a 1985 edition of &quot;Metallurgical Transactions A&quot;. Meanwhile, on seeing the draft of the paper, John Cahn suggested that Shechtman&#x27;s experimental results merit a fast publication in a more appropriate scientific journal. Shechtman agreed and, in hindsight, called this fast publication &quot;a winning move&quot;. This paper, published in the &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, repeated Shechtman&#x27;s observation and used the same illustrations as the original paper.

Originally, the new form of matter was dubbed &quot;Shechtmanite&quot;. The term &quot;quasicrystal&quot; was first used in print by Paul Steinhardt and Dov Levine shortly after Shechtman&#x27;s paper was published.

Also in 1985, T. Ishimasa &quot;et al.&quot; reported twelvefold symmetry in Ni-Cr particles. Soon, eightfold diffraction patterns were recorded in V-Ni-Si and Cr-Ni-Si alloys. Over the years, hundreds of quasicrystals with various compositions and different symmetries have been discovered. The first quasicrystalline materials were thermodynamically unstable: when heated, they formed regular crystals. However, in 1987, the first of many stable quasicrystals were discovered, making it possible to produce large samples for study and applications.

In 1992, the International Union of Crystallography altered its definition of a crystal, reducing it to the ability to produce a clear-cut diffraction pattern and acknowledging the possibility of the ordering to be either periodic or aperiodic.


In 2001, Steinhardt hypothesized that quasicrystals could exist in nature and developed a method of recognition, inviting all the mineralogical collections of the world to identify any badly cataloged crystals. In 2007 Steinhardt received a reply by Luca Bindi, who found a quasicrystalline specimen from Khatyrka in the University of Florence Mineralogical Collection. The crystal samples were sent to Princeton University for other tests, and in late 2009, Steinhardt confirmed its quasicrystalline character. This quasicrystal, with a composition of Al63Cu24Fe13, was named icosahedrite and it was approved by the International Mineralogical Association in 2010. Analysis indicates it may be meteoritic in origin, possibly delivered from a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid. In 2011, Bindi, Steinhardt, and a team of specialists found more icosahedrite samples from Khatyrka. A further study of Khatyrka meteorites revealed micron-sized grains of another natural quasicrystal, which has a ten-fold symmetry and a chemical formula of Al71Ni24Fe5. This quasicrystal is stable in a narrow temperature range, from 1120 to 1200 K at ambient pressure, which suggests that natural quasicrystals are formed by rapid quenching of a meteorite heated during an impact-induced shock.

Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011 for his work on quasicrystals. &quot;His discovery of quasicrystals revealed a new principle for packing of atoms and molecules,&quot; stated the Nobel Committee and pointed that &quot;this led to a paradigm shift within chemistry.&quot; In 2014, Post of Israel issued a stamp dedicated to quasicrystals and the 2011 Nobel Prize.

While the first quasicrystals discovered were made out of intermetallic components, later on quasicrystals were also discovered in soft-matter and molecular systems. Soft quasicrystal structures have been found in supramolecular dendrimer liquids and ABC Star Polymers in 2004 and 2007. In 2009, it was found that thin-film quasicrystals can be formed by self-assembly of uniformly shaped, nano-sized molecular units at an air-liquid interface. It was demonstrated that these units can be both inorganic and organic. Additionally in the 2010s, two-dimensional molecular quasicrystals were discovered, driven by intermolecular interactions and interface-interactions.

In 2018, chemists from Brown University announced the successful creation of a self-constructing lattice structure based on a strangely shaped quantum dot. While single-component quasicrystal lattices have been previously predicted mathematically and in computer simulations, they had not been demonstrated prior to this.

==Mathematics==
There are several ways to mathematically define quasicrystalline patterns. One definition, the &quot;cut and project&quot; construction, is based on the work of Harald Bohr (mathematician brother of Niels Bohr). The concept of an almost periodic function (also called a quasiperiodic function) was studied by Bohr, including work of Bohl and Escanglon.
He introduced the notion of a superspace. Bohr showed that quasiperiodic functions arise as restrictions of high-dimensional periodic functions to an irrational slice (an intersection with one or more hyperplanes), and discussed their Fourier point spectrum. These functions are not exactly periodic, but they are arbitrarily close in some sense, as well as being a projection of an exactly periodic function.

In order that the quasicrystal itself be aperiodic, this slice must avoid any lattice plane of the higher-dimensional lattice. De Bruijn showed that Penrose tilings can be viewed as two-dimensional slices of five-dimensional hypercubic structures; similarly, icosahedral quasicrystals in three dimensions are projected from a six-dimensional hypercubic lattice, as first described by Peter Kramer and Roberto Neri in 1984. Equivalently, the Fourier transform of such a quasicrystal is nonzero only at a dense set of points spanned by integer multiples of a finite set of basis vectors, which are the projections of the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors of the higher-dimensional lattice.

Classical theory of crystals reduces crystals to point lattices where each point is the center of mass of one of the identical units of the crystal. The structure of crystals can be analyzed by defining an associated group. Quasicrystals, on the other hand, are composed of more than one type of unit, so, instead of lattices, quasilattices must be used. Instead of groups, groupoids, the mathematical generalization of groups in category theory, is the appropriate tool for studying quasicrystals.

Using mathematics for construction and analysis of quasicrystal structures is a difficult task. Computer modeling, based on the existing theories of quasicrystals, however, greatly facilitated this task. Advanced programs have been developed allowing one to construct, visualize and analyze quasicrystal structures and their diffraction patterns. The aperiodic nature of quasicrystals can also make theoretical studies of physical properties, such as electronic structure, difficult due to the inapplicability of Bloch&#x27;s theorem. However, spectra of quasicrystals can still be computed with error control.

Study of quasicrystals may shed light on the most basic notions related to the quantum critical point observed in heavy fermion metals. Experimental measurements on an Au–Al–Yb quasicrystal have revealed a quantum critical point defining the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility as temperature tends to zero. It is suggested that the electronic system of some quasicrystals is located at a quantum critical point without tuning, while quasicrystals exhibit the typical scaling behaviour of their thermodynamic properties and belong to the well-known family of heavy fermion metals.

==Materials science==


Since the original discovery by Dan Shechtman, hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed. Quasicrystals are found most often in aluminium alloys (Al–Li–Cu, Al–Mn–Si, Al–Ni–Co, Al–Pd–Mn, Al–Cu–Fe, Al–Cu–V, etc.), but numerous other compositions are also known (Cd–Yb, Ti–Zr–Ni, Zn–Mg–Ho, Zn–Mg–Sc, In–Ag–Yb, Pd–U–Si, etc.).

Two types of quasicrystals are known. The first type, polygonal (dihedral) quasicrystals, have an axis of 8-, 10-, or 12-fold local symmetry (octagonal, decagonal, or dodecagonal quasicrystals, respectively). They are periodic along this axis and quasiperiodic in planes normal to it. The second type, icosahedral quasicrystals, are aperiodic in all directions. Icosahedral quasicrystals have a three dimensional quasiperiodic structure and possess fifteen 2-fold, ten 3-fold and six 5-fold axes in accordance with their icosahedral symmetry.

Quasicrystals fall into three groups of different thermal stability:
* Stable quasicrystals grown by slow cooling or casting with subsequent annealing,
* Metastable quasicrystals prepared by melt spinning, and
* Metastable quasicrystals formed by the crystallization of the amorphous phase.

Except for the Al–Li–Cu system, all the stable quasicrystals are almost free of defects and disorder, as evidenced by X-ray and electron diffraction revealing peak widths as sharp as those of perfect crystals such as Si. Diffraction patterns exhibit fivefold, threefold, and twofold symmetries, and reflections are arranged quasiperiodically in three dimensions.

The origin of the stabilization mechanism is different for the stable and metastable quasicrystals. Nevertheless, there is a common feature observed in most quasicrystal-forming liquid alloys or their undercooled liquids: a local icosahedral order. The icosahedral order is in equilibrium in the &quot;liquid state&quot; for the stable quasicrystals, whereas the icosahedral order prevails in the &quot;undercooled liquid state&quot; for the metastable quasicrystals.

A nanoscale icosahedral phase was formed in Zr-, Cu- and Hf-based bulk metallic glasses alloyed with noble metals.

Most quasicrystals have ceramic-like properties including high thermal and electrical resistance, hardness and brittleness, resistance to corrosion, and non-stick
properties. Many metallic quasicrystalline substances are impractical for most applications due to their thermal instability; the Al–Cu–Fe ternary system and the Al–Cu–Fe–Cr and Al–Co–Fe–Cr quaternary systems, thermally stable up to 700 °C, are notable exceptions.

The quasi-ordered droplet crystals could be formed under Dipolar forces in the Bose Einstein condensate. While the softcore Rydberg dressing interaction has forms triangular droplet-crystals, adding a Gaussian peak to the plateau type interaction would form multiple roton unstable points in the Bogoliubov spectrum. Therefore, the excitation around the roton instabilities would grow exponentially and form multiple allowed lattice constants leading to quasi-ordered periodic droplet crystals.

=== Applications ===
Quasicrystalline substances have potential applications in several forms.

Metallic quasicrystalline coatings can be applied by thermal spraying or magnetron sputtering. A problem that must be resolved is the tendency for cracking due to the materials&#x27; extreme brittleness. The cracking could be suppressed by reducing sample dimensions or coating thickness. Recent studies show typically brittle quasicrystals can exhibit remarkable ductility of over 50% strains at room temperature and sub-micrometer scales (&lt;500 nm).

An application was the use of low-friction Al–Cu–Fe–Cr quasicrystals as a coating for frying pans. Food did not stick to it as much as to stainless steel making the pan moderately non-stick and easy to clean; heat transfer and durability were better than PTFE non-stick cookware and the pan was free from perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); the surface was very hard, claimed to be ten times harder than stainless steel, and not harmed by metal utensils or cleaning in a dishwasher; and the pan could withstand temperatures of without harm. However, after an initial introduction the pans were a chrome steel, probably because of the difficulty of controlling thin films of the quasicrystal.

The Nobel citation said that quasicrystals, while brittle, could reinforce steel &quot;like armor&quot;. When Shechtman was asked about potential applications of quasicrystals he said that a precipitation-hardened stainless steel is produced that is strengthened by small quasicrystalline particles. It does not corrode and is extremely strong, suitable for razor blades and surgery instruments. The small quasicrystalline particles impede the motion of dislocation in the material.

Quasicrystals were also being used to develop heat insulation, LEDs, diesel engines, and new materials that convert heat to electricity. Shechtman suggested new applications taking advantage of the low coefficient of friction and the hardness of some quasicrystalline materials, for example embedding particles in plastic to make strong, hard-wearing, low-friction plastic gears. The low heat conductivity of some quasicrystals makes them good for heat insulating coatings. One of the special properties of quasicrystals is their smooth surface, which despite the irregular atomic
structure, the surface of quasicrystals can be smooth and flat.

Other potential applications include selective solar absorbers for power conversion, broad-wavelength reflectors, and bone repair and prostheses applications where biocompatibility, low friction and corrosion resistance are required. Magnetron sputtering can be readily applied to other stable quasicrystalline alloys such as Al–Pd–Mn.
==Non-material science applications==
Applications in macroscopic engineering have been suggested, building quasi-crystal-like large scale engineering structures, which could have interesting physical properties. Also, aperiodic tiling lattice structures may be used instead of isogrid or honeycomb patterns. None of these seem to have been put to use in practice.

<text>Recreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time. The &quot;need to do something for recreation&quot; is an essential element of human biology and psychology. Recreational activities are often done for enjoyment, amusement, or pleasure and are considered to be &quot;fun&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;recreation&quot; appears to have been used in English first in the late 14th century, first in the sense of &quot;refreshment or curing of a sick person&quot;, and derived turn from Latin (&quot;re&quot;: &quot;again&quot;, &quot;creare&quot;: &quot;to create, bring forth, beget&quot;).

===Prerequisites to leisure===
People spend their time on activities of daily living, work, sleep, social duties and leisure, the latter time being free from prior commitments to physiologic or social needs, a prerequisite of recreation. Leisure has increased with increased longevity and, for many, with decreased hours spent for physical and economic survival, yet others argue that time pressure has increased for modern people, as they are committed to too many tasks. Other factors that account for an increased role of recreation are affluence, population trends, and increased commercialization of recreational offerings. While one perception is that leisure is just &quot;spare time&quot;, time not consumed by the necessities of living, another holds that leisure is a force that allows individuals to consider and reflect on the values and realities that are missed in the activities of daily life, thus being an essential element of personal development and civilization. This direction of thought has even been extended to the view that leisure is the purpose of work, and a reward in itself, and &quot;leisure life&quot; reflects the values and character of a nation. Leisure is human right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

===Play, recreation and work===
Recreation is difficult to separate from the general concept of play, which is usually the term for children&#x27;s recreational activity. Children may playfully imitate activities that reflect the realities of adult life. It has been proposed that play or recreational activities are outlets of or expression of excess energy, channeling it into socially acceptable activities that fulfill individual as well as societal needs, without need for compulsion, and providing satisfaction and pleasure for the participant. A traditional view holds that work is supported by recreation, recreation being useful to &quot;recharge the battery&quot; so that work performance is improved.

Work, an activity generally performed out of economic necessity and useful for society and organized within the economic framework, however can also be pleasurable and may be self-imposed thus blurring the distinction to recreation. Many activities in entertainment are work for one person and recreation for another. Over time, a recreational activity may become work, and vice versa. Thus, for a musician, playing an instrument may be at one time a profession, and at another a recreation.

Similarly, it may be difficult to separate education from recreation as in the case of recreational mathematics.

===Health and recreation===
Recreation has many health benefits, and, accordingly, Therapeutic Recreation has been developed to take advantage of this effect. The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) is the nationally recognized credentialing organization for the profession of Therapeutic Recreation. Professionals in the field of Therapeutic Recreation who are certified by the NCTRC are called &quot;Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists&quot;. The job title &quot;Recreation Therapist&quot; is identified in the U.S. Dept of Labor&#x27;s Occupation Outlook. Such therapy is applied in rehabilitation, psychiatric facilities for youth and adults, and in the care of the elderly, the disabled, or people with chronic diseases. Recreational physical activity is important to reduce obesity, and the risk of osteoporosis and of cancer, most significantly in men that of colon and prostate, and in women that of the breast; however, not all malignancies are reduced as outdoor recreation has been linked to a higher risk of melanoma. Extreme adventure recreation naturally carries its own hazards.

==Forms and activities==

Recreation is an essential part of human life and finds many different forms which are shaped naturally by individual interests but also by the surrounding social construction. Recreational activities can be communal or solitary, active or passive, outdoors or indoors, healthy or harmful, and useful for society or detrimental. Some recreational activities – such as gambling, recreational drug use, or delinquent activities – may violate societal norms and laws. A list of typical activities could be almost endless.

===Hobby===

A significant section of recreational activities are designated as hobbies which are activities done for pleasure on a regular basis. A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one&#x27;s leisure time, not professionally and not for pay. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies have increased with time.

===Bricolage===

Bricolage and DIY are some of the terms describing the building, , or repairing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where &quot;individuals engage raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)&quot;. DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness). They could involve crafts that require particular skills and knowledge of skilled work. Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as home improvement, electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, and the use of Computer Numeric Control tools, as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and, mainly, its predecessor, traditional arts and crafts. The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist technologies, and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications. There is a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them to reference designs. There is also growing work on equity and the maker culture.

===Games===
Any structured form of play could become a game. Games are played sometimes purely for recreation, sometimes for achievement or monetary rewards as well. They are played for recreation alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs. Professionals can play as part of their work for entertainment of the audience. The games could be board games, puzzles, computer or video games.

===Outdoor recreation===
Recreation engaged in out of doors, most commonly in natural settings. The activities themselves — such as fishing, hunting, backpacking, and horseback riding — characteristically dependent on the environment practiced in. While many of these activities can be classified as sports, they do not all demand that a participant be an athlete. Competition generally is less stressed than in individual or team sports organized into opposing squads in pursuit of a trophy or championship. When the activity involves exceptional excitement, physical challenge, or risk, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;adventure recreation&quot; or &quot;adventure training&quot;, rather than an extreme sport.

Other traditional examples of outdoor recreational activities include hiking, camping, mountaineering, cycling, canoeing, caving, kayaking, rafting, rock climbing, running, sailing, skiing, sky diving and surfing. As new pursuits, often hybrids of prior ones, emerge, they gain their own identities, such as coasteering, canyoning, fastpacking, and plogging.

===Performing arts===
====Dance====
Participatory dance, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance, as is common in Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as entertainment, social interaction or exercise, by participants rather than onlookers. The many forms of dance provide recreation for all age groups and cultures.

====Music creation====

Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from recreation, religious or ceremonial purposes, or for entertainment. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras in Europe, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on their instruments.

====Playing video games====

Video games are immersive experiences that leave some of the aesthetics to be defined by the player while reserving the author&#x27;s authority on the latter.

===Visual arts===

Woodworking, photography, moviemaking, jewelry making, software projects such as Photoshopping and home music or video production, making bracelets, artistic projects such as drawing, painting, Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing of a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper (called papercraft) fall under the category visual arts. Many of these are practised for recreation.

====Drawing====

Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to Paleolithic cave representations of animals such as those at Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain. In ancient Egypt, ink drawings on papyrus, often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on Greek vases, initially geometric, later developed to the human form with black-figure pottery during the 7th century BC.

With paper becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as Sandro Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo da Vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.

====Literature====
Writing may involve letters, journals and web blogs.
In the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year. About 5% read more than 50 books per year.

====Painting====
Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the Chauvet and Lascaux caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer. Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of Ramses II, Nefertari, his queen, is depicted being led by Isis. Greek and Roman art like the Hellenistic Fayum mummy portraits and Battle of Issus at Pompeii contributed to Byzantine art in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting. Models of aeroplanes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers and superheroes are popular subjects to build, paint and display.

====Photography====

An amateur photographer practices photography as a hobby/passion and not for monetary profit. The quality of some amateur work may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the Hand-held camera. Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, including the use of cell phone. Clear pictures can now be taken with a cell phone which is a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone.

==Organized recreation==

Many recreational activities are organized, typically by public institutions, voluntary group-work agencies, private groups supported by membership fees, and commercial enterprises. Examples of each of these are the National Park Service, the YMCA, the Kiwanis, and Walt Disney World. Public space such as parks and beaches are essential venues for many recreational activities and Tourism has recognized that many visitors are specifically attracted by recreational offerings. In particular, beach and waterfront promenades such as the beach area of Venice Beach in California, the Promenade de la Croisette in Cannes, the Promenade des Anglais in Nice or the lungomare of Barcola with Miramare Castle in Trieste are important recreational areas for the city population on the one hand and on the other also important tourist destinations with all advantages and disadvantages for the locals.

In support of recreational activities government has taken an important role in their creation, maintenance, and organization, and whole industries have developed merchandise or services. Recreation-related business is an important factor in the economy; it has been estimated that the outdoor recreation sector alone contributes $730 billion annually to the U.S. economy and generates 6.5 million jobs.

===Recreation center===
A recreation center is a place for recreational activities usually administered by a municipal government agency. Swimming, basketball, weightlifting, volleyball and kids&#x27; play areas are very common.

===Recreation as a career===
A recreation specialist would be expected to meet the recreational needs of a community or assigned interest group. Educational institutions offer courses that lead to a degree as a Bachelor of Arts in recreation management. People with such degrees often work in parks and recreation centers in towns, on community projects and activities. Networking with instructors, budgeting, and evaluation of continuing programs are common job duties.

In the United States, most states have a professional organization for continuing education and certification in recreation management. The National Recreation and Park Association administers a certification program called the CPRP (Certified Park and Recreation Professional) that is considered a national standard for professional recreation specialist practices.

=== e-commerce ===
Since the beginning of the 2000s, there are more and more online booking / ticketing platforms for recreational activities that emerged. Many of them leveraged the ever-growing prevalence of internet, mobile devices and e-payments to build comprehensive online booking solutions. The first successful batch includes tourist recreation activities platform like TripAdvisor that went public. The emergence of these platforms infers the rising needs for recreation and entertainment from the growing urban citizens worldwide.

<text>In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction that occurs when there is a period of broad decline in economic activity. Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). There is no official definition of a recession, according to the IMF.

In the United States, a recession is defined as &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.&quot; The European Union has adopted a similar definition. In the United Kingdom and Canada, a recession is defined as negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.

Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply and decreasing interest rates or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.

==Definitions==

In a 1974 article by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Julius Shiskin suggested that a rough translation of the bureau&#x27;s qualitative definition of a recession into a quantitative one that almost anyone can use might run like this:
* In terms of duration – Declines in real gross national income (GNI) for two consecutive quarters; a decline in industrial production over a six-month period.
* In terms of depth – A 1.5% decline in real gross national income; a 15% decline in non-agricultural employment; a two-point rise in unemployment to a level of at least 6%.
* In terms of financial indicators - A significant increase in loan defaults or a tightening of credit conditions by financial institutions, leading to a decrease in business investment and consumer spending.
* In terms of diffusion – A decline in non-agricultural employment in more than 75% of industries, as measured over six-month spans, for six months or longer.

Over the years, some commentators dropped most of Shiskin&#x27;s &quot;recession-spotting&quot; criteria for the simplistic rule-of-thumb of a decline in real GNI for two consecutive quarters.

In the United States, the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is generally seen as the authority for dating US recessions. The NBER, a private economic research organization, defines an economic recession as: &quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales&quot;. The NBER also explains that: &quot;a recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when the economy reaches its trough.&quot; The NBER is considered the official arbiter of recession start and end dates for the United States. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, an independent federal agency that provides official macroeconomic and industry statistics, says &quot;the often-cited identification of a recession with two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth is not an official designation&quot; and that instead, &quot;The designation of a recession is the province of a committee of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research&quot;.

The European Union, akin to the NBER&#x27;s methodology, has embraced a definition of recession that integrates GDP alongside a spectrum of macroeconomic indicators, including employment and various other metrics. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the depth and breadth of economic downturns, enabling policymakers to devise more effective strategies for economic stabilization and recovery.

Recessions in the United Kingdom are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, as measured by the seasonal adjusted quarter-on-quarter figures for real GDP.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organization, defines a recession as a period of at least two years during which the cumulative output gap reaches at least 2% of GDP, and the output gap is at least 1% for at least one year.

&quot;GDP per capita recession&quot; refers to the decline of GDP per capita instead of decline of total GDP.

==Attributes==

A recession encompasses multiple attributes that often occur simultaneously and encompasses declines in component measures of economic activity, such as GDP, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net export activity. These summary measures are indicative of underlying drivers such as employment levels and skills, household savings rates, corporate investment decisions, interest rates, demographics, and government policies (Smith, 2018; Johnson &amp; Thompson, 2020). By examining these factors comprehensively, economists gain insights into the complex dynamics that contribute to economic downturns and can formulate effective strategies for mitigating their impact (Anderson, 2019; Patel, 2017).

Economist Richard C. Koo wrote that under ideal conditions, a country&#x27;s economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero.

A severe (GDP down by 10%) or prolonged (three or four years) recession is referred to as an economic depression, although some argue that their causes and cures can be different. As an informal shorthand, economists sometimes refer to different recession shapes, such as V-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped and W-shaped recessions.

===Type of recession or shape===
The type and shape of recessions are distinctive. In the US, v-shaped, or short-and-sharp contractions followed by rapid and sustained recovery, occurred in 1954 and 1990–1991; U-shaped (prolonged slump) in 1974–1975, and W-shaped, or double-dip recessions in 1949 and 1980–1982. Japan&#x27;s 1993–1994 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997–1999 can be described as L-shaped. Korea, Hong Kong and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997–1998, although Thailand&#x27;s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.

===Psychological aspects===

Recessions have psychological and confidence aspects. For example, if companies expect economic activity to slow, they may reduce employment levels and save money rather than invest. Such expectations can create a self-reinforcing downward cycle, bringing about or worsening a recession. Consumer confidence is one measure used to evaluate economic sentiment. The term animal spirits has been used to describe the psychological factors underlying economic activity. Keynes, in his &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, was the first economist to claim that such emotional mindsets significantly affect the economy. Economist Robert J. Shiller wrote that the term &quot;refers also to the sense of trust we have in each other, our sense of fairness in economic dealings, and our sense of the extent of corruption and bad faith. When animal spirits are on ebb, consumers do not want to spend and businesses do not want to make capital expenditures or hire people.&quot;
Behavioral economics has also explained many psychological biases that may trigger a recession including the availability heuristic, the money illusion, and normalcy bias.

===Balance sheet recession===
Excessive levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause what is called a &quot;balance sheet recession&quot;. This occurs when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term balance sheet derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that &quot;the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt—that it was a so-called &quot;balance sheet recession&quot;. In Krugman&#x27;s view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.

For example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan&#x27;s &quot;Great Recession&quot; that began in 1990 was a &quot;balance sheet recession&quot;. It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have negative equity, meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type Great Depression, in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities. In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.

Krugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept in 2010, agreeing with Koo&#x27;s situation assessment and view that sustained deficit spending when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates), disagreeing with Koo&#x27;s view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).

A July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by household leverage levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects (Smith &amp; Johnson, 2012).

===Liquidity trap===

A liquidity trap is a Keynesian theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero (zero interest-rate policy) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; increasing the money supply is like &quot;pushing on a string&quot;. Economist Paul Krugman described the U.S. 2009 recession and Japan&#x27;s lost decade as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via quantitative easing or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating inflationary expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and mercantilist policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand. He estimated in March 2010 that developed countries representing 70% of the world&#x27;s GDP were caught in a liquidity trap.

===Paradoxes of thrift and deleveraging===

Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately, one person&#x27;s consumption is another person&#x27;s income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a &quot;paradox of deleveraging&quot; as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.

In April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes: &quot;Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn&#x27;t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.&quot;

==Causes of recessions==

There are many reasons why recessions happen. One overall reason can be lack of demand due to sharp developments in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services. Another main reason can be problems e.g. in financial markets. Because recessions have many likely explanations, it is demanding to predict them. Some variables might at first glance be the causes of recessions, but they could also be the results of a recession, which means they are endogenous to recessions. One can summarize the causes of recessions in the following categories:

Economic factors:
* Supply shocks: A sudden increase in the prices of key inputs (input price shock) can lead to higher production costs and reduced aggregate demand, triggering a recession.
* Fiscal policies or monetary policies by the government, which are contractionary in nature: A contractionary policy is a tool usually used to tame rising inflation. Excessive use of tightening policies, e.g. too rapid increases in interest rates, can reduce demand and consumer spending for goods and services, leading to a recession (creating a so called hard landing). Monetary policy changes can influence both the frequency and intensity of recessions.
* Demand shocks: A widespread drop in spending, known as an adverse demand shock, can lead to recessions. This can be triggered by various events, including the bursting of economic bubbles (see economic bubbles below).

Financial factors:
* Credit risk and credit and debt issues: Overextension of credit and accumulation of risky debt can lead to financial crises. When borrowers (e.g. corporations) default, it can cause a cascade of business failures and reduced consumption).
* Financial risk factors that can cause a recession are plentiful: Besides credit risk like e.g. concentration risk, there is also market risk like e.g. systemic risk, liquidity risk like e.g. refinancing risk, investment risk like e.g. model risk, business risk like e.g. political risk as well as profit risk.
* Financial market problems: Issues in financial markets, such as rapid credit expansion. When households accumulate excessive debt and later face difficulties in meeting their obligations, they cut back on consumption, leading to a decrease in economic activity.
* Credit tightening: Restrictions on credit availability also known as credit crunch, can reduce consumer spending and business investment, leading to a slowdown in economic activity.
* Interest rate distortions: Artificially low interest rates can encourage excessive borrowing and result in a buildup of risk in the financial sector. When interest rates rise, these investments (like new constructions in real estate) may fail, exacerbate economic declines, contributing to a recession.
* Economic bubble: Unsustainable rapid increases in asset prices due to excessive risk-taking, characterized by exaggerated optimism during the economic boom period and accumulation of financial risks during good economic times creates a asset bubble, followed by continued sharp declines in asset prices, a (stock market crash), which can lead to a cascade of business failures, significant recessions and worst case depressions and stagnation.
* Minsky Moment: Euphoria and speculative borrowing as well as unsustainable financial practices eventually result in economic downturns. A Minsky Moment marks the point at which overleveraged investors are forced to sell off assets to cover their debts, leading to a rapid decline in asset prices and liquidity. This term is named after the American economist Hyman Minsky, who theorized that financial markets are inherently unstable.

External shocks
* Adverse events: Unexpected major world events like natural disasters and geopolitical events like wars can cause widespread disruptions in critical sectors in supply chains and disrupt economic activity, reduce productivity, increase costs, affect confidence and thereby diminish economic activity, leading to decreased spending and investment and finally recessions.
* Decline in external demand: For countries with strong export sectors, a decline in demand from major trading partners can trigger a recession.
* Global spillover effects: Recessions in one part of the world can have spillover effects on other economies due to global interconnectedness. For example, economic troubles in Europe can impact the U.S. economy.

Summary: Why recessions happen is a complex phenomena often resulting from a interplay of various factors. While these factors can individually contribute to a recession, the cumulative impact of several occurring simultaneously can significantly amplify the negative effect on the economy.

==Predictors==
Recessions are very challenging to predict. While some variables like the (inverted) yield curve appear to be more useful to predict a recession ahead of time than other variables, no single variable has proven to be an always reliable predictor whether recessions will actually (soon) appear, let alone predicting their sharpness and severity in terms of duration. The longest and deepest Treasury yield curve inversion in history began in July 2022, as the Federal Reserve sharply increased the fed funds rate to combat the 2021–2023 inflation surge. Despite widespread predictions by economists and market analysts of an imminent recession, none had materialized by July 2024, economic growth remained steady, and a Reuters survey of economists that month found they expected the economy to continue growing for the next two years. An earlier survey of bond market strategists found a majority no longer believed an inverted curve to be a reliable recession predictor. The curve began re-steepening toward positive territory in June 2024, as it had at other points during that inversion; in every previous inversion they examined; Deutsche Bank analysts found the curve had re-steepened before a recession began. The following variables and indicators are used by economists, like e.g. Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz, to try to predict the possibility of a recession:

* The U.S. Conference Board&#x27;s Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.
* The U.S. Conference Board Leading Economic Indicator year-over-year change turns negative before a recession.
* When the CFNAI Diffusion Index drops below the value of −0.35, then there is an of the beginning a recession. Usually, the signal happens in the three months of the recession. The CFNAI Diffusion Index signal tends to happen about one month before a related signal by the CFNAI-MA3 (3-month moving average) drops below the −0.7 level. The CFNAI-MA3 correctly identified the 7 recessions between March 1967 – August 2019, while triggering only 2 false alarms.

Except for the above, there are no known completely reliable predictors. Analysis by Prakash Loungani of the International Monetary Fund found that only two of the sixty recessions around the world during the 1990s had been predicted by a consensus of economists one year earlier, while there were zero consensus predictions one year earlier for the 49 recessions during 2009.

However, the following are considered possible predictors:

Manufacturing:
* Average weekly hours in manufacturing. Firms tend to react to worsening business cycle circumstances by lowering hours worked before laying off workers, according to Glosser and Golden (1997). This popular indicator leads industrial production by two to four months.
* Manufacturers&#x27; new orders for consumer goods and materials.
* Manufacturers&#x27; new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft orders.
* Manufacturing sales.
* A decline in manufacturing activities and new orders for consumer and capital goods can signal reduced business investment and economic slowdown.
* Measuring manufacturing output against business demand (new orders plus backlog minus inventory) as a composite index for U.S. economic activity, using data from ISM (Manufacturing Services, Chicago) and Fed (Empire Manufacturing, Philadelphia, Kansas City, Richmond, Dallas) indices, has been a reliable recession indicator during the last eight recessions.

Industrial Production:
* Factory output, including factories, mines, and utilities.
* Low industrial output and sales: During economic downturns, companies reduce production to minimize risk. This leads to lower industrial output and sales, which can signal an impending recession, because it causes a ripple effect. As fewer goods are produced, lesser resources like labor, equipment and raw materials are required. As industrial output falls this sooner or later leads to a cutback in hiring as well as a surge in layoffs.

Chemical Activity:
* Basic industrial chemicals like chlorine, alkalies, pigments and plastic resins are positioned early in the supply chain. This early position allows to identify emerging turning points in the economy.
* Chemical activity also includes data on hours worked in chemicals, chemical company stock data, publicly sourced chemical price information, end-use chemical industry sales-to-inventories.
* Indicators of chemical activity provide a longer lead time compared to other economic indicators. Tracking chemical activity as an index can lead by two to fourteen months, with an average lead of eight months at cycle peaks and four months at cycle troughs, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC).

Transportation:
* Declining trucking and shipping volumes of goods.
* The Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a shipping freight-cost index which reflects the demand for shipping capacity versus the supply of dry bulk carriers, is generally seen as a leading indicator of economic activity, because changes in the index reflect global supply and demand for commodities and raw materials used in manufacturing. A falling BDI can signal a slowdown in economic activity.
* The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) contains railroads, shipping companies, air freight carriers, marine transportation, delivery services, and logistics companies. The performance of transportation stocks can predict trends in the broader market, according to the Dow Theory, which says that a divergence between the DJTA and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can signal potential early economic weakness if transportation stocks are underperforming while industrial stocks are rising.
* Both indices (BDI and DJTA) serve as barometers for economic health and are considered to be leading economic indicators but from different perspectives. The BDI focuses on global trade and commodity demand, while the DJTA reflects domestic transportation activity in the U.S.
* There are various trucking indices, most notably the Cass Freight Index, which measures monthly freight activity across all domestic freight modes in North America. Other trucking indices are the FreightWaves National Truckload Index (NTI), the FTR Trucking Conditions Index (TCI), the ACT For-Hire Trucking Index, the American Trucking Associations&#x27; Truck Tonnage Index, the DAT Trendlines index and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index (PPI) by Industry: General Freight Trucking Index. These indices are essential for understanding the dynamics of the trucking industry and predicting future market conditions.
* According to research by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Transportation Services Index (TSI) is a leading indicator of economic cycles. It tracks the movement of freight and passengers to provide insights into the broader economic conditions. Both TSI index components lead the business cycles since 1979 by an average of approximately four months.
* Light truck sales are seen as a recession predictor.

Corporate Profits:
* Business sector profits. Declining corporate earnings over successive quarters can signal economic trouble and the risk of a potential bear market.

Employment:
* Decreasing job growth.
* Decreasing payroll employment.
* Growing unemployment rate as measured by the initial claims for unemployment insurance (indicated by a constant enduring year-over-year increase in the three-week average of unemployment insurance initial claims), which are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: A enlarging unemployment rate with rising initial claims for unemployment insurance indicate weakening labor market conditions, which can be a precursor to a recession. This indicator leads industrial production by two to three months. Also see Sahm rule indicator below in the overview of recession indicators, which tracks the momentum in the U3 unemployment rate.
* Growing labor market weakness as indicated by a negative three-month average of U.S. nonfarm payrolls.
* Swelling unemployment rate, specifically a unemployment rate rising above its 36-month moving average is a cause for concern, according to Jeffrey Gundlach.
* A narrowing labor differential between those who think jobs are plentiful versus those who think they are hard to get, as measured by the Conference Board. On average, the peak in the labor differential comes nine months ahead of a recession, according to BCA Research strategist Peter Berezin.
* Jobs market contraction: The &#x27;Perkins rule&#x27;, created by GlobalData TS Lombard managing director Dario Perkins, triggers when payrolls are declining. Commonly when the Sahm rule produces a recession warning signal the Perkins rule has already triggered. Another jobs market indicator measuring a rise in unemployment is the &#x27;Kantro rule&#x27;. This recession indicator isn&#x27;t influenced by participation rates and has an equally impressive track record as the Sahm rule going back to the early 1970s. Kantro&#x27;s 10% recession rule, created by Michael Kantrowitz, CIO of Piper Sandler, measures the year-over-year growth in unemployed persons in the U.S. workforce. When the three-month moving average of this indicator grows beyond the 10% threshold at least in the past 11 occurrences the economy has already been in recession.
* Growing shifts in labor market internals to part-time work signals increasing weakness in the economy as normally part-time jobs rise and full-time jobs decrease as a share of employment before a recession takes hold. As an indicator this can be measured simply using the ratio of part-time to full-time employment (with the year-over-year change crossing into negative territory as recession risk warning). Another way to use this approach is to look at the number of people who are working part time but would rather be working full time, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This approach is also called U-7 and was invented by David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth labor economist who served on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. David Kotok, the chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, says the way to use the U-7 number is to compare it with the main unemployment rate, which the Labor Department calls U-3. When the U-3 rises faster than the U-7, that is a recession warning.
* Six other employment-based recession indicators are: 1) new claims for unemployment (8-week smoothing of 26-week change) larger than 60.000. 2) Continuing claims for unemployment (percent change year-over-year) larger 21%. 3) Employed part-time due to economic reasons (percent change year-over-year) larger 16%. 4) Unemployed more than 15 weeks (percent change from 12-month low) larger 30%. 5) Temporary help services (percent change year-over-year) smaller -2%. 6) Aggregate hours worked, production and non-supervisory employees (6-month percent change) smaller 0%.

Personal Income:
* Decline in wages.
* Decline in personal income less transfer payments. Real median household income is reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
* Increased income inequality.

Household Savings and Consumer Debt:
* Tracking consumer savings rates can help indicate how people are feeling about the economy in general. A personal savings rate that is too low (and then rises once people become worried about their job security, start to spend less and begin to build their savings again) typically precedes a recession. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis households were saving less than 3% of their disposable personal income based on data from the Commerce Department.
* Rising consumer debt at the onset of a recession: When the budget shrinks some consumers may turn to debt to maintain their lifestyle and to continue spending. As available cash tightens an increase in overall credit card debt, auto loans and other types of consumer debt can indicate that consumers can’t afford daily purchases anymore. This debt overhang suggests lower future consumer spending and a worsening economy.

Retail Sales, Consumer Confidence and Consumer Expenditures:
* Decline in wholesale/retail sales, which are reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.
* Consumer expectations, confidence surveys like the index of consumer expectations (University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index) and the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index: Declines in consumer sentiment and confidence can signal a recession. These measures reflect consumers&#x27; outlook on the economy and their willingness to spend, which drives economic activity. A drop in consumer confidence often precedes reduced consumer spending.
* Weakening personal consumption expenditure growth. Declines in consumer spending can signal a recession. As consumers cut back on spending, businesses may respond by reducing production and laying off workers, creating a cycle that can lead to a recession.
* Changes in household consumer spending like a switch to more generic brands (trading down): When households start buying more private label or lower-cost goods (generic brands that are a lower-cost option for a similar product instead of more expensive name brand goods) could indicate that consumers have less discretionary income and that a recession is coming.
* Consumers choosing to eat out less at restaurants and make food at home more: It can be a leading sign of a looming recession when consumers cut back on non-essential items like restaurants, entertainment and experiences like travel.
* Declining luxury purchases: When the jobs market starts getting stressed and cash is less plentiful consumers postpone expensive, non-urgent purchases and especially luxury purchases (fashion, beauty and jewelry) are one of the first spending categories to get hit when a recession is coming.
* Tumbling sales in durable consumer goods, like e.g. new car sales (light vehicles unit retail sales). and decreasing recreational vehicle shipments.

Housing and non-residential construction:
* Housing starts and construction, specifically building permits for new private housing units. Residential investment contains information that is particularly useful for predicting recessions when compared by what is captured by standard leading indicators such as the term spread. And it is especially useful for the prediction of recessions for countries with high home-ownership rates. Research results strongly suggest that recession predictability of leading indicators is improved, when residential investment is included.
* Non-residential construction spending (like e.g. offices and industrial plants) as measured by the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) 9-12 months ahead. The ABI is a survey send each month by the AIA to several hundreds of architecture firms. The index can be used to predict a recession. The index is centered around a value of 50. Below 50 means there is a high likelihood that construction spending will decrease and that therefore overall economic health is going to worsen. Researchers at the AIA came to the conclusion that their Architecture Billings Index is an accurate indicator of actual construction spending with on average 11 months&#x27; worth of lead time and therefore reliably leads economic downturns whenever the index severely drops below 50. For example the ABI plunged below 50 between July of 2000 and January of 2001 (and then in June of 2001 the percentage change in construction spending as compared to the prior year sank into negative growth territory) ahead of the wider crash in the US equity markets that followed.

Credit Markets:
* Rising corporate debt can foreshadow a bear market, notably when businesses go ahead with taking on more debt, despite having diminishing sales and dwindling earnings.
* Credit conditions like credit spreads. The spread between corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries is important. If the spread between corporate and government debt increases, this could signal that private sector lending is becoming strained.
* The long-term spread: The spread between a shorter-term rate (like the three-month Treasury yield) and 10-year U.S. bond yields. The long-term Treasury yield spread has been particularly effective at predicting recessions many months in advance, achieving an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) value of 0.89 at 14 months ahead. And it is the best predictor at a horizon of 16 to 20 months ahead, when compared to other leading indicators.
* The near-term forward spread: This is the difference between the market expectation of the interest rate on a three-month Treasury bill six quarters in the future and the current three-month Treasury bill yield.
* An inverted yield curve can indicate that a recession may be on the horizon as it has historically often preceded economic downturns with lead times ranging from several months to over a year. Especially the disinversion, a move back into positive territory for the spread between the shorter (e.g. 3-month or 2-year) yield and the longer (e.g. 10-year) Treasury yield, has in the past, been a reliable recession signal as the curve usually disinverts (or un-inverts) nearly before the recession truly appears. Based on recent history, the last four recessions, as of Q2-2024, didn’t start until the inverted curve returned to a positive reading (steepens). Further analysis shows that &quot;the average time to recession (...) [is] only 66 days from when the [3-month/10-year] curve disinverts.&quot;
* The S&amp;P 500 and BBB bond spread.
* The federal budget deficit typically worsens strongly ahead of a recession.

Business Expectations:
* Business confidence surveys and expectations for business condition.
* New businesses form at a slower rate when entrepreneurs are less likely to take the risk of starting a new venture while more established struggling businesses close down when a recession is looming.

Margin of stock market traders:
* The value of debit balances in broker-dealers’ securities margin accounts.

Asset Prices:
* Oil is a critical commodity input for many industries.
* Commodity prices, as measured e.g. by the Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI), may increase before recessions, which usually hinders consumer spending by making necessities like transportation and housing costlier. This will tend to constrict spending for non-essential goods and services. Once the recession occurs, commodity prices will usually reset to a lower level.
* A sector rotation in the stock market, specifically strong shifts in investment from leading more volatile sectors like consumer cyclicals and consumer discretionary (as well as e.g. biotechnology) to more stable sectors such as utilities and consumer staples (as well as e.g. telecommunications) can signal increasing market uncertainty and that a recession is on the horizon.
* Lowering of asset prices, such as homes and financial assets, or high personal and corporate debt levels.
* Significant declines in stock prices can reflect investor pessimism about future economic conditions and can be a leading indicator of a recession.
* Volatility Index (VIX) measuring of stock market volatility. A high VIX indicates increased market stress, which can precede economic downturns.

Gross Domestic Product:
* GDP contraction: The GDP measures a country&#x27;s economic output, all goods and services a country produces. GDP provides a good insight into what has already been taking place in the economy. A contraction in GDP, especially if it occurs for two consecutive quarters, is a strong indicator of a recession as it reflects reduced economic activity, lower consumer demand, and decreased employment.
* GDP per capita contraction
* The Atlanta Fed offers a GDPnow model, which estimates changes in real GDP growth by aggregating 13 subcomponents that make up GDP. GDPnow can provide a timelier gauge of the current state of the economy.

Unorthodox Recession Indicators:
* Sausage sales: Heightened appetites for sausages might be a harbinger of a looming economic downturn, because sausages are a cheaper protein substitute for other higher-priced meat products, a reaction by shoppers when times are tough experts call the “trade down.”
* Plunging underwear sales: During the global financial crisis, men&#x27;s underwear sales dropped significantly, mirroring reduced consumer spending and causing former Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan to see men’s underwear as a key economic predictor.

Overview of recession indicators:
* Index of Leading (Economic) Indicators (LEI) (includes some of the above indicators). The LEI&#x27;s lead time is six to seven months. The Conference Board’s leading index is highly accurate in the near term, one to three months ahead (accomplishing an AUC value of 0.97).
* Euro Area Leading Indicator (ALI), research indicates that the ALI can lead turning points in the business cycle by approximately five to six months.
* The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas posts the Texas Index of Leading Economic Indicators. This index contains the real oil price, well permits, initial claims for unemployment insurance, Texas stock index, help-wanted index and average weekly hours worked in manufacturing.
* The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago posts updates of the Brave-Butters-Kelley Indexes (BBKI).
* The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis posts the Weekly Economic Index (Lewis-Mertens-Stock) (WEI).
* The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis posts the Smoothed U.S. Recession Probabilities (RECPROUSM156N).
* The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago&#x27;s National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) and its nonfinancial leverage subindex can be used as leading indicators to predict a recession.
* The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago developed the ROC Threshold Index (ROC means receiver operating characteristic). It combines multiple leading indicators to predict recessions. It has shown better predictive ability than individual indicators up to 11 months ahead. And it also significantly outperformed other measures at leading recession forecasts with a range of six to nine months in advance.
* The inverted yield curve, the model developed by economist Jonathan H. Wright, uses yields on 10-year and three-month Treasury securities as well as the Fed&#x27;s overnight funds rate. Another model developed by Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists uses only the 10-year/three-month spread. The Estrella and Mishkin model is a well-known approach for predicting U.S. recessions. This model primarily uses the yield curve, specifically the spread between long-term and short-term interest rates, as a predictor. This method has been widely adopted and is considered robust. The model, developed by economists Arturo Estrella and Frederic Mishkin, uses the difference between the yields on 10-year Treasury bonds and 3-month Treasury bills, as detailed in their research papers and working papers for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their models estimate the 12-month-ahead recession probabilities using the term spread. This yield curve spread has been found to be a valuable forecasting tool, outperforming other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. An inversion of this yield curve has been successful in predicting past recessions, including those in 1973-75, and 1981-82. The Estrella and Mishkin model later also successfully predicted the recessions in the early 2000s, and the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Moreover, a negative spread has historically preceded each U.S. recession since the 1950s, according to The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
* The three-month change in the unemployment rate and initial jobless claims. U.S. unemployment index is defined as the difference between the 3-month average of the unemployment rate and the 12-month minimum of the unemployment rate. Unemployment momentum and acceleration with Hidden Markov model.
* The Sahm Recession Indicator, named after economist Claudia Sahm, was published in October 2019 by the St. Louis Federal Reserve bank&#x27;s Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). It is defined as: 

==Government responses==
Keynesian economists favor the use of expansionary macroeconomic policy during recessions to increase aggregate demand. Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. Monetarists, exemplified by economist Milton Friedman, would favor the use of limited expansionary monetary policy, while Keynesian economists may advocate increased government spending to spark economic growth. Supply-side economists promote tax cuts to stimulate business capital investment. For example, the Trump administration claimed that lower effective tax rates on new investment imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 would raise investment, thereby making workers more productive and raising output and wages. Investment patterns in the United States through 2019, however, indicated that the supply-side incentives of the TCJA had little effect on investment growth. Although investments increased after 2017, much of the increase was a response to oil prices, and investment in other sectors had negligible growth.

Monetarist economists have argued that objectives of monetary policy, i.e., controlling the money supply to influence interest rates, are best achieved by targeting the growth rate of the money supply. They maintain that money may affect output in the short term but that in the long run, expansionary monetary policy leads to inflation only. Keynesian economists have mostly adopted this analysis, modifying the theory with better integration of short and long run trends and an understanding that a change in the money supply &quot;affects only nominal variables in the economy, such as prices and wages, and has no effect on real variables, like employment and output&quot;. The Federal Reserve traditionally uses monetary accommodation, a policy instrument of lowering its main benchmark interest rate, to accommodate sudden supply-side shifts in the economy. When the federal funds rate reaches the boundary of an interest rate of 0%, called the zero lower bound, the government resorts to unconventional monetary policy to stimulate recovery.

Gauti B. Eggertsson of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, using a New Keynesian macroeconomic model for policy analysis, writes that cutting taxes on labor or capital is contractionary under certain circumstances, such as those that prevailed following the economic crisis of 2008, and that temporarily increasing government spending at such times has much larger effects than under normal conditions. He says other forms of tax cuts, such as a reduction in sales taxes and investment tax credits, e.g., in the context of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Great Recession&quot;, are also very effective. Eggertsson infers from his analysis that the contractionary effects of labor and capital tax cuts, and the strong expansionary effect of government spending, are peculiar to the unusual environment created by zero interest rates. He asserts that with positive interest rates a labor tax cut is expansionary, per the established literature, but at zero interest rates, it reverses and tax cuts become contractionary. Further, while capital tax cuts are inconsequential in his model with a positive interest rate, they become strongly negative at zero, and the multiplier of government spending is then almost five times larger.

Paul Krugman wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because indebted households were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: &quot;The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can&#x27;t spend the way they used to, they&#x27;re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what&#x27;s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more—and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...&quot;

John Maynard Keynes believed that government institutions could stimulate aggregate demand in a crisis:

==Stock market==

Some recessions have been anticipated by stock market declines. In &quot;Stocks for the Long Run&quot;, Siegel mentions that since 1948, ten recessions were preceded by a stock market decline, by a lead time of 0 to 13 months (average 5.7 months), while ten stock market declines of greater than 10% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were not followed by a recession.

The real estate market also usually weakens before a recession. However, real estate declines can last much longer than recessions.

Since the business cycle is very hard to predict, Siegel argues that it is not possible to take advantage of economic cycles for timing investments. Even the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) takes a few months to determine if a peak or trough has occurred in the US.

==U.S. politics==

An administration generally gets credit or blame for the state of the economy during its time in office; this state of affairs has caused disagreements about how particular recessions actually started.

For example, the 1981 recession is thought to have been caused by the tight-money policy adopted by Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before Ronald Reagan took office. Reagan supported that policy. Economist Walter Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s, said that &quot;I call it a Reagan-Volcker-Carter recession.&quot;

==Consequences==

===Unemployment===

Unemployment is particularly high during a recession. Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a natural rate of unemployment which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to estimate the GDP gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0%, so it is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy, unless it exceeds the &quot;natural rate&quot;, in which case the excess corresponds directly to a loss in the GDP.

The full impact of a recession on employment may not be felt for several quarters. After recessions in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, it took five years for unemployment to fall back to its original levels. Employment discrimination claims rise during a recession.

===Business===

Productivity tends to fall in the early stages of a recession, then rises again as weaker firms close. The variation in profitability between firms rises sharply. The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across the UK due to Brexit, which may create a mini-recession in the region. Global epidemics, such as COVID-19, could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent the movement of goods, services, and people.

Recessions have also provided opportunities for anti-competitive mergers, with a negative impact on the wider economy; the suspension of competition policy in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.

===Social effects===

The living standards of people dependent on wages and salaries are more affected by recessions than those who rely on fixed incomes or welfare benefits. The loss of a job is known to have a negative impact on the stability of families, and individuals&#x27; health and well-being.

==History==

===Global===
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), &quot;Global recessions seem to occur over a cycle lasting between eight and 10 years.&quot; The IMF takes many factors into account when defining a global recession. Until April 2009, IMF several times communicated to the press, that a global annual real GDP growth of 3.0% or less in their view was &quot;equivalent to a global recession&quot;.

By this measure, six periods since 1970 qualify: 1974–1975, 1980–1983, 1990–1993, 1998, 2001–2002, and 2008–2009. During what IMF in April 2002 termed the past three global recessions of the last three decades, global per capita output growth was zero or negative, and IMF argued—at that time—that because of the opposite being found for 2001, the economic state in this year by itself did not qualify as a &quot;global recession&quot;.

In April 2009, IMF had changed their Global recession definition to &quot;A decline in annual percapita real World GDP (purchasing power parity weighted), backed up by a decline or worsening for one or more of the seven other global macroeconomic indicators: Industrial production, trade, capital flows, oil consumption, unemployment rate, percapita investment, and percapita consumption.&quot; By this new definition, a total of four global recessions took place since World War II: 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009. All of them only lasted one year, although the third would have lasted three years (1991–1993) if IMF as criteria had used the normal exchange rate weighted percapita real World GDP rather than the purchase power parity weighted percapita real World GDP.

===Australia===

As a result of late 1920s profit issues in agriculture and cutbacks, 1931–1932 saw Australia&#x27;s biggest recession in its entire history. It fared better than other nations that underwent depressions, but their poor economic states influenced Australia, which depended on them for export, as well as foreign investments. The nation also benefited from greater productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with lessening the effects.

The economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961 because of a credit squeeze. Australia was facing a rising level of inflation in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.

Another recession came at the beginning of the 1990s as the result of a major stock collapse in October 1987, referred to now as Black Monday. Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession was not limited to the United States, but it also affected partnering nations such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.

Australia next went into recession in March 2020, due to the impact of huge bush fires and the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s effect on tourism and other important aspects of the economy. This recession, while steep, only lasted until May 2020.

===European Union===

The Eurozone experienced a recession in 2012: the economies of the 17-nation region failed to grow during any quarter of the 2012 calendar year. The recession deepened during the final quarter of the year, with the French, German and Italian economies all affected.

===United Kingdom===
The most recent recession to affect the United Kingdom was the 2020 recession attributed to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the first recession since the Great Recession.

===United States===


According to economists, since 1854, the U.S. has encountered 32 cycles of expansions and contractions, with an average of 17 months of contraction and 38 months of expansion. From 1980 to 2018 there were only eight periods of negative economic growth over one fiscal quarter or more, and four periods considered recessions:
* July 1981 – November 1982: 15 months
* July 1990 – March 1991: 8 months
* March 2001 – November 2001: 8 months
* December 2007 – June 2009: 18 months

For the last three of these recessions, the NBER decision has approximately conformed with the definition involving two consecutive quarters of decline. While the 2001 recession did not involve two consecutive quarters of decline, it was preceded by two quarters of alternating decline and weak growth.

Since then, the NBER has also declared a 2-month COVID-19 recession for February 2020 – April 2020.

NBER has sometimes declared a recession before a second quarter of GDP shrinkage has been reported, but beginnings and endings can also be declared over a year after they are reckoned to have occurred. In 1947, NBER did not declare a recession despite two quarters of declining GDP, due to strong economic activity reported for employment, industrial production, and consumer spending.

===Late 2000s===
Official economic data shows that a substantial number of nations were in recession as of early 2009. The US entered a recession at the end of 2007, and 2008 saw many other nations follow suit. The US recession of 2007 ended in June 2009 as the nation entered the current economic recovery. The timeline of the Great Recession details the many elements of this period.

====United States====

The United States housing market correction (a consequence of the United States housing bubble) and subprime mortgage crisis significantly contributed to a recession.

The 2007–2009 recession saw private consumption fall for the first time in nearly 20 years. This indicated the depth and severity of the recession. With consumer confidence so low, economic recovery took a long time. Consumers in the U.S. were hit hard by the Great Recession, with the value of their houses dropping and their pension savings decimated on the stock market.

U.S. employers shed 63,000 jobs in February 2008, the most in five years. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said on 6 April 2008 that &quot;There is more than a 50 percent chance the United States could go into recession.&quot; On 1 October, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that an additional 156,000 jobs had been lost in September. On 29 April 2008, Moody&#x27;s declared that nine US states were in a recession. In November 2008, employers eliminated 533,000 jobs, the largest single-month loss in 34 years. In 2008, an estimated 2.6 million U.S. jobs were eliminated.

The unemployment rate in the U.S. grew to 8.5% in March 2009, and there were 5.1 million job losses by March 2009 since the recession began in December 2007. That was about five million more people unemployed compared to just a year prior, which was the largest annual jump in the number of unemployed persons since the 1940s.

Although the US economy grew in the first quarter by 1%, by June 2008 some analysts stated that due to a protracted credit crisis and &quot;rampant inflation in commodities such as oil, food, and steel&quot;, the country was nonetheless in a recession. The third quarter of 2008 brought on a GDP retraction of 0.5%, the biggest decline since 2001. The 6.4% decline in spending during Q3 on non-durable goods, like clothing and food, was the largest since 1950.

A November 2008 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on the survey of 51 forecasters, suggested that the recession started in April 2008 and would last 14 months. They projected real GDP declining at an annual rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2009. These forecasts represented significant downward revisions from the forecasts of three months prior.

A December 2008 report from the National Bureau of Economic Research stated that the U.S. had been in a recession since December 2007, when economic activity peaked, based on several measures including job losses, declines in personal income, and declines in real GDP. By July 2009, a growing number of economists believed that the recession may have ended. The National Bureau of Economic Research announced on 20 September 2010 that the 2008/2009 recession ended in June 2009, making it the longest recession since World War II. Prior to the start of the recession, it appears that no known formal theoretical or empirical model was able to accurately predict the advance of this recession, except for minor signals in the sudden rise of forecasted probabilities, which were still well under 50%.

<text>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem, one of the oldest widely used for secure data transmission. The initialism &quot;RSA&quot; comes from the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. An equivalent system was developed secretly in 1973 at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency, by the English mathematician Clifford Cocks. That system was declassified in 1997.

In a public-key cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret (private).
An RSA user creates and publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers are kept secret. Messages can be encrypted by anyone, via the public key, but can only be decrypted by someone who knows the private key.

The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the &quot;factoring problem&quot;. Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem. Whether it is as difficult as the factoring problem is an open question. There are no published methods to defeat the system if a large enough key is used.

RSA is a relatively slow algorithm. Because of this, it is not commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA is used to transmit shared keys for symmetric-key cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryption–decryption.

==History==

The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976. They also introduced digital signatures and attempted to apply number theory. Their formulation used a shared-secret-key created from exponentiation of some number, modulo a prime number. However, they left open the problem of realizing a one-way function, possibly because the difficulty of factoring was not well-studied at the time. Moreover, like Diffie-Hellman, RSA is based on modular exponentiation.

Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made several attempts over the course of a year to create a function that was hard to invert. Rivest and Shamir, as computer scientists, proposed many potential functions, while Adleman, as a mathematician, was responsible for finding their weaknesses. They tried many approaches, including &quot;knapsack-based&quot; and &quot;permutation polynomials&quot;. For a time, they thought what they wanted to achieve was impossible due to contradictory requirements. In April 1977, they spent Passover at the house of a student and drank a good deal of wine before returning to their homes at around midnight. Rivest, unable to sleep, lay on the couch with a math textbook and started thinking about their one-way function. He spent the rest of the night formalizing his idea, and he had much of the paper ready by daybreak. The algorithm is now known as RSA the initials of their surnames in same order as their paper.

Clifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the British intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), described a similar system in an internal document in 1973. However, given the relatively expensive computers needed to implement it at the time, it was considered to be mostly a curiosity and, as far as is publicly known, was never deployed. His ideas and concepts were not revealed until 1997 due to its top-secret classification.

Kid-RSA (KRSA) is a simplified, insecure public-key cipher published in 1997, designed for educational purposes. Some people feel that learning Kid-RSA gives insight into RSA and other public-key ciphers, analogous to simplified DES.

==Patent==

A patent describing the RSA algorithm was granted to MIT on 20 September 1983: &quot;Cryptographic communications system and method&quot;. From DWPI&#x27;s abstract of the patent:
A detailed description of the algorithm was published in August 1977, in Scientific American&#x27;s Mathematical Games column. This preceded the patent&#x27;s filing date of December 1977. Consequently, the patent had no legal standing outside the United States. Had Cocks&#x27; work been publicly known, a patent in the United States would not have been legal either.

When the patent was issued, terms of patent were 17 years. The patent was about to expire on 21 September 2000, but RSA Security released the algorithm to the public domain on 6 September 2000.

==Operation==
The RSA algorithm involves four steps: key generation, key distribution, encryption, and decryption.

A basic principle behind RSA is the observation that it is practical to find three very large positive integers , , and , such that for all integers (), both formula_1 and formula_2 have the same remainder when divided by formula_3 (they are congruent modulo formula_3):formula_5However, when given only and , it is extremely difficult to find .

The integers and comprise the public key, represents the private key, and represents the message. The modular exponentiation to and corresponds to encryption and decryption, respectively.

In addition, because the two exponents can be swapped, the private and public key can also be swapped, allowing for message signing and verification using the same algorithm.

===Key generation===
The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated in the following way:
# Choose two large prime numbers and .
#* To make factoring harder, and should be chosen at random, be both large and have a large difference. For choosing them the standard method is to choose random integers and use a primality test until two primes are found.
#* and are kept secret.
# Compute .
#* is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys. Its length, usually expressed in bits, is the key length.
#* is released as part of the public key.
# Compute , where is Carmichael&#x27;s totient function. Since , and since and are prime, , and likewise . Hence .
#* The may be calculated through the Euclidean algorithm, since .
#* is kept secret.
# Choose an integer such that and ; that is, and are coprime.
#* having a short bit-length and small Hamming weight results in more efficient encryption the most commonly chosen value for is . The smallest (and fastest) possible value for is 3, but such a small value for has been shown to be less secure in some settings.
#* is released as part of the public key.
# Determine as ; that is, is the modular multiplicative inverse of modulo .
#* This means: solve for the equation ; can be computed efficiently by using the extended Euclidean algorithm, since, thanks to and being coprime, said equation is a form of Bézout&#x27;s identity, where is one of the coefficients.
#* is kept secret as the &quot;private key exponent&quot;.
The &quot;public key&quot; consists of the modulus and the public (or encryption) exponent . The &quot;private key&quot; consists of the private (or decryption) exponent , which must be kept secret. , , and must also be kept secret because they can be used to calculate . In fact, they can all be discarded after has been computed.

In the original RSA paper, the Euler totient function is used instead of for calculating the private exponent . Since is always divisible by , the algorithm works as well. The possibility of using Euler totient function results also from Lagrange&#x27;s theorem applied to the multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;pq&quot;. Thus any satisfying also satisfies . However, computing modulo will sometimes yield a result that is larger than necessary (i.e. ). Most of the implementations of RSA will accept exponents generated using either method (if they use the private exponent at all, rather than using the optimized decryption method based on the Chinese remainder theorem described below), but some standards such as FIPS 186-4 (Section B.3.1) may require that . Any &quot;oversized&quot; private exponents not meeting this criterion may always be reduced modulo to obtain a smaller equivalent exponent.

Since any common factors of and are present in the factorisation of = = , it is recommended that and have only very small common factors, if any, besides the necessary 2.

Note: The authors of the original RSA paper carry out the key generation by choosing and then computing as the modular multiplicative inverse of modulo , whereas most current implementations of RSA, such as those following PKCS#1, do the reverse (choose and compute ). Since the chosen key can be small, whereas the computed key normally is not, the RSA paper&#x27;s algorithm optimizes decryption compared to encryption, while the modern algorithm optimizes encryption instead.

===Key distribution===
Suppose that Bob wants to send information to Alice. If they decide to use RSA, Bob must know Alice&#x27;s public key to encrypt the message, and Alice must use her private key to decrypt the message.

To enable Bob to send his encrypted messages, Alice transmits her public key to Bob via a reliable, but not necessarily secret, route. Alice&#x27;s private key is never distributed.

===Encryption===
After Bob obtains Alice&#x27;s public key, he can send a message to Alice.

To do it, he first turns (strictly speaking, the un-padded plaintext) into an integer (strictly speaking, the padded plaintext), such that by using an agreed-upon reversible protocol known as a padding scheme. He then computes the ciphertext , using Alice&#x27;s public key , corresponding to

formula_6

This can be done reasonably quickly, even for very large numbers, using modular exponentiation. Bob then transmits to Alice. Note that at least nine values of will yield a ciphertext equal to
, but this is very unlikely to occur in practice.

===Decryption===
Alice can recover from by using her private key exponent by computing

formula_7

Given , she can recover the original message by reversing the padding scheme.

===Example===
Here is an example of RSA encryption and decryption:

# Choose two distinct prime numbers, such as
#: formula_8 and formula_9.
# Compute giving
#: formula_10
# Compute the Carmichael&#x27;s totient function of the product as giving
#: formula_11
# Choose any number that is coprime to 780. Choosing a prime number for leaves us only to check that is not a divisor of 780.
#: Let formula_12.
# Compute , the modular multiplicative inverse of , yieldingformula_13 as formula_14

The public key is . For a padded plaintext message , the encryption function is
formula_15

The private key is . For an encrypted ciphertext , the decryption function is
formula_16

For instance, in order to encrypt , one calculates
formula_17

To decrypt , one calculates
formula_18

Both of these calculations can be computed efficiently using the square-and-multiply algorithm for modular exponentiation. In real-life situations the primes selected would be much larger; in our example it would be trivial to factor (obtained from the freely available public key) back to the primes and . , also from the public key, is then inverted to get , thus acquiring the private key.

Practical implementations use the Chinese remainder theorem to speed up the calculation using modulus of factors (mod &quot;pq&quot; using mod &quot;p&quot; and mod &quot;q&quot;).

The values , and , which are part of the private key are computed as follows:
formula_19

Here is how , and are used for efficient decryption (encryption is efficient by choice of a suitable and pair):
formula_20

===Signing messages===
Suppose Alice uses Bob&#x27;s public key to send him an encrypted message. In the message, she can claim to be Alice, but Bob has no way of verifying that the message was from Alice, since anyone can use Bob&#x27;s public key to send him encrypted messages. In order to verify the origin of a message, RSA can also be used to sign a message.

Suppose Alice wishes to send a signed message to Bob. She can use her own private key to do so. She produces a hash value of the message, raises it to the power of (modulo ) (as she does when decrypting a message), and attaches it as a &quot;signature&quot; to the message. When Bob receives the signed message, he uses the same hash algorithm in conjunction with Alice&#x27;s public key. He raises the signature to the power of (modulo ) (as he does when encrypting a message), and compares the resulting hash value with the message&#x27;s hash value. If the two agree, he knows that the author of the message was in possession of Alice&#x27;s private key and that the message has not been tampered with since being sent.

This works because of exponentiation rules:
formula_21
formula_22

Thus the keys may be swapped without loss of generality, that is, a private key of a key pair may be used either to:
# Decrypt a message only intended for the recipient, which may be encrypted by anyone having the public key (asymmetric encrypted transport).
# Encrypt a message which may be decrypted by anyone, but which can only be encrypted by one person; this provides a digital signature.

==Proofs of correctness==

===Proof using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem===
The proof of the correctness of RSA is based on Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, stating that for any integer and prime , not dividing .

We want to show that
formula_23
for every integer when and are distinct prime numbers and and are positive integers satisfying .

Since is, by construction, divisible by both and , we can write
formula_24
for some nonnegative integers and .

To check whether two numbers, such as and , are congruent , it suffices (and in fact is equivalent) to check that they are congruent and separately.

To show , we consider two cases:
# If , is a multiple of . Thus &quot;med&quot; is a multiple of . So . 
# If ,

====Notes====
===Proof using Euler&#x27;s theorem===
Although the original paper of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman used Fermat&#x27;s little theorem to explain why RSA works, it is common to find proofs that rely instead on Euler&#x27;s theorem.

We want to show that , where is a product of two different prime numbers, and and are positive integers satisfying . Since and are positive, we can write for some non-negative integer . &quot;Assuming&quot; that is relatively prime to , we have
formula_28

where the second-last congruence follows from Euler&#x27;s theorem.

More generally, for any and satisfying , the same conclusion follows from Carmichael&#x27;s generalization of Euler&#x27;s theorem, which states that for all relatively prime to .

When is not relatively prime to , the argument just given is invalid. This is highly improbable (only a proportion of numbers have this property), but even in this case, the desired congruence is still true. Either or , and these cases can be treated using the previous proof.

==Padding==

===Attacks against plain RSA===
There are a number of attacks against plain RSA as described below.
* When encrypting with low encryption exponents (e.g., ) and small values of the (i.e., ), the result of is strictly less than the modulus . In this case, ciphertexts can be decrypted easily by taking the th root of the ciphertext over the integers.
* If the same clear-text message is sent to or more recipients in an encrypted way, and the receivers share the same exponent , but different , , and therefore , then it is easy to decrypt the original clear-text message via the Chinese remainder theorem. Johan Håstad noticed that this attack is possible even if the clear texts are not equal, but the attacker knows a linear relation between them. This attack was later improved by Don Coppersmith (see Coppersmith&#x27;s attack).
* Because RSA encryption is a deterministic encryption algorithm (i.e., has no random component) an attacker can successfully launch a chosen plaintext attack against the cryptosystem, by encrypting likely plaintexts under the public key and test whether they are equal to the ciphertext. A cryptosystem is called semantically secure if an attacker cannot distinguish two encryptions from each other, even if the attacker knows (or has chosen) the corresponding plaintexts. RSA without padding is not semantically secure.
* RSA has the property that the product of two ciphertexts is equal to the encryption of the product of the respective plaintexts. That is, . Because of this multiplicative property, a chosen-ciphertext attack is possible. E.g., an attacker who wants to know the decryption of a ciphertext may ask the holder of the private key to decrypt an unsuspicious-looking ciphertext for some value chosen by the attacker. Because of the multiplicative property, &#x27; is the encryption of . Hence, if the attacker is successful with the attack, they will learn from which they can derive the message by multiplying with the modular inverse of modulo .
* Given the private exponent , one can efficiently factor the modulus . And given factorization of the modulus , one can obtain any private key (&#x27;, ) generated against a public key (&#x27;, ).

===Padding schemes===
To avoid these problems, practical RSA implementations typically embed some form of structured, randomized padding into the value before encrypting it. This padding ensures that does not fall into the range of insecure plaintexts, and that a given message, once padded, will encrypt to one of a large number of different possible ciphertexts.

Standards such as PKCS#1 have been carefully designed to securely pad messages prior to RSA encryption. Because these schemes pad the plaintext with some number of additional bits, the size of the un-padded message must be somewhat smaller. RSA padding schemes must be carefully designed so as to prevent sophisticated attacks that may be facilitated by a predictable message structure. Early versions of the PKCS#1 standard (up to version 1.5) used a construction that appears to make RSA semantically secure. However, at Crypto 1998, Bleichenbacher showed that this version is vulnerable to a practical adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack. Furthermore, at Eurocrypt 2000, Coron et al. showed that for some types of messages, this padding does not provide a high enough level of security. Later versions of the standard include Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), which prevents these attacks. As such, OAEP should be used in any new application, and PKCS#1 v1.5 padding should be replaced wherever possible. The PKCS#1 standard also incorporates processing schemes designed to provide additional security for RSA signatures, e.g. the Probabilistic Signature Scheme for RSA (RSA-PSS).

Secure padding schemes such as RSA-PSS are as essential for the security of message signing as they are for message encryption. Two USA patents on PSS were granted ( and ); however, these patents expired on 24 July 2009 and 25 April 2010 respectively. Use of PSS no longer seems to be encumbered by patents. Note that using different RSA key pairs for encryption and signing is potentially more secure.

==Security and practical considerations==

===Using the Chinese remainder algorithm===
For efficiency, many popular crypto libraries (such as OpenSSL, Java and .NET) use for decryption and signing the following optimization based on the Chinese remainder theorem. The following values are precomputed and stored as part of the private key:
* formula_29 and formula_30 the primes from the key generation,
* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33

These values allow the recipient to compute the exponentiation more efficiently as follows:
formula_34,
formula_35,
formula_36,
formula_37.

This is more efficient than computing exponentiation by squaring, even though two modular exponentiations have to be computed. The reason is that these two modular exponentiations both use a smaller exponent and a smaller modulus.

===Integer factorization and the RSA problem===

The security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on two mathematical problems: the problem of factoring large numbers and the RSA problem. Full decryption of an RSA ciphertext is thought to be infeasible on the assumption that both of these problems are hard, i.e., no efficient algorithm exists for solving them. Providing security against &quot;partial&quot; decryption may require the addition of a secure padding scheme.

The RSA problem is defined as the task of taking th roots modulo a composite : recovering a value such that , where is an RSA public key, and is an RSA ciphertext. Currently the most promising approach to solving the RSA problem is to factor the modulus . With the ability to recover prime factors, an attacker can compute the secret exponent from a public key , then decrypt using the standard procedure. To accomplish this, an attacker factors into and , and computes that allows the determination of from . No polynomial-time method for factoring large integers on a classical computer has yet been found, but it has not been proven that none exists; see integer factorization for a discussion of this problem.

The first RSA-512 factorization in 1999 used hundreds of computers and required the equivalent of 8,400 MIPS years, over an elapsed time of about seven months. By 2009, Benjamin Moody could factor an 512-bit RSA key in 73 days using only public software (GGNFS) and his desktop computer (a dual-core Athlon64 with a 1,900 MHz CPU). Just less than 5 gigabytes of disk storage was required and about 2.5 gigabytes of RAM for the sieving process.

Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman noted that Miller has shown that – assuming the truth of the extended Riemann hypothesis – finding from and is as hard as factoring into and (up to a polynomial time difference). However, Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman noted, in section IX/D of their paper, that they had not found a proof that inverting RSA is as hard as factoring.

, the largest publicly known factored RSA number had 829 bits (250 decimal digits, RSA-250). Its factorization, by a state-of-the-art distributed implementation, took about 2,700 CPU-years. In practice, RSA keys are typically 1024 to 4096 bits long. In 2003, RSA Security estimated that 1024-bit keys were likely to become crackable by 2010. As of 2020, it is not known whether such keys can be cracked, but minimum recommendations have moved to at least 2048 bits. It is generally presumed that RSA is secure if is sufficiently large, outside of quantum computing.

If is 300 bits or shorter, it can be factored in a few hours on a personal computer, using software already freely available. Keys of 512 bits have been shown to be practically breakable in 1999, when RSA-155 was factored by using several hundred computers, and these are now factored in a few weeks using common hardware. Exploits using 512-bit code-signing certificates that may have been factored were reported in 2011. A theoretical hardware device named TWIRL, described by Shamir and Tromer in 2003, called into question the security of 1024-bit keys.

In 1994, Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer – if one could ever be practically created for the purpose – would be able to factor in polynomial time, breaking RSA; see Shor&#x27;s algorithm.

===Faulty key generation===

Finding the large primes and is usually done by testing random numbers of the correct size with probabilistic primality tests that quickly eliminate virtually all of the nonprimes.

The numbers and should not be &quot;too close&quot;, lest the Fermat factorization for be successful. If is less than (, which even for &quot;small&quot; 1024-bit values of is ), solving for and is trivial. Furthermore, if either or has only small prime factors, can be factored quickly by Pollard&#x27;s &quot;p&quot; − 1 algorithm, and hence such values of or should be discarded.

It is important that the private exponent be large enough. Michael J. Wiener showed that if is between and (which is quite typical) and , then can be computed efficiently from and .

There is no known attack against small public exponents such as , provided that the proper padding is used. Coppersmith&#x27;s attack has many applications in attacking RSA specifically if the public exponent is small and if the encrypted message is short and not padded. 65537 is a commonly used value for ; this value can be regarded as a compromise between avoiding potential small-exponent attacks and still allowing efficient encryptions (or signature verification). The NIST Special Publication on Computer Security (SP 800-78 Rev. 1 of August 2007) does not allow public exponents smaller than 65537, but does not state a reason for this restriction.

In October 2017, a team of researchers from Masaryk University announced the ROCA vulnerability, which affects RSA keys generated by an algorithm embodied in a library from Infineon known as RSALib. A large number of smart cards and trusted platform modules (TPM) were shown to be affected. Vulnerable RSA keys are easily identified using a test program the team released.

===Importance of strong random number generation===
A cryptographically strong random number generator, which has been properly seeded with adequate entropy, must be used to generate the primes and . An analysis comparing millions of public keys gathered from the Internet was carried out in early 2012 by Arjen K. Lenstra, James P. Hughes, Maxime Augier, Joppe W. Bos, Thorsten Kleinjung and Christophe Wachter. They were able to factor 0.2% of the keys using only Euclid&#x27;s algorithm.

They exploited a weakness unique to cryptosystems based on integer factorization. If is one public key, and is another, then if by chance (but is not equal to &#x27;), then a simple computation of factors both and &#x27;, totally compromising both keys. Lenstra et al. note that this problem can be minimized by using a strong random seed of bit length twice the intended security level, or by employing a deterministic function to choose given , instead of choosing and independently.

Nadia Heninger was part of a group that did a similar experiment. They used an idea of Daniel J. Bernstein to compute the GCD of each RSA key against the product of all the other keys &#x27; they had found (a 729-million-digit number), instead of computing each separately, thereby achieving a very significant speedup, since after one large division, the GCD problem is of normal size.

Heninger says in her blog that the bad keys occurred almost entirely in embedded applications, including &quot;firewalls, routers, VPN devices, remote server administration devices, printers, projectors, and VOIP phones&quot; from more than 30 manufacturers. Heninger explains that the one-shared-prime problem uncovered by the two groups results from situations where the pseudorandom number generator is poorly seeded initially, and then is reseeded between the generation of the first and second primes. Using seeds of sufficiently high entropy obtained from key stroke timings or electronic diode noise or atmospheric noise from a radio receiver tuned between stations should solve the problem.

Strong random number generation is important throughout every phase of public-key cryptography. For instance, if a weak generator is used for the symmetric keys that are being distributed by RSA, then an eavesdropper could bypass RSA and guess the symmetric keys directly.

===Timing attacks===
Kocher described a new attack on RSA in 1995: if the attacker Eve knows Alice&#x27;s hardware in sufficient detail and is able to measure the decryption times for several known ciphertexts, Eve can deduce the decryption key quickly. This attack can also be applied against the RSA signature scheme. In 2003, Boneh and Brumley demonstrated a more practical attack capable of recovering RSA factorizations over a network connection (e.g., from a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-enabled webserver). This attack takes advantage of information leaked by the Chinese remainder theorem optimization used by many RSA implementations.

One way to thwart these attacks is to ensure that the decryption operation takes a constant amount of time for every ciphertext. However, this approach can significantly reduce performance. Instead, most RSA implementations use an alternate technique known as cryptographic blinding. RSA blinding makes use of the multiplicative property of RSA. Instead of computing , Alice first chooses a secret random value and computes . The result of this computation, after applying Euler&#x27;s theorem, is , and so the effect of can be removed by multiplying by its inverse. A new value of is chosen for each ciphertext. With blinding applied, the decryption time is no longer correlated to the value of the input ciphertext, and so the timing attack fails.

===Adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks===
In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher described the first practical adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack against RSA-encrypted messages using the PKCS #1 v1 padding scheme (a padding scheme randomizes and adds structure to an RSA-encrypted message, so it is possible to determine whether a decrypted message is valid). Due to flaws with the PKCS #1 scheme, Bleichenbacher was able to mount a practical attack against RSA implementations of the Secure Sockets Layer protocol and to recover session keys. As a result of this work, cryptographers now recommend the use of provably secure padding schemes such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding, and RSA Laboratories has released new versions of PKCS #1 that are not vulnerable to these attacks.

A variant of this attack, dubbed &quot;BERserk&quot;, came back in 2014. It impacted the Mozilla NSS Crypto Library, which was used notably by Firefox and Chrome.

===Side-channel analysis attacks===
A side-channel attack using branch-prediction analysis (BPA) has been described. Many processors use a branch predictor to determine whether a conditional branch in the instruction flow of a program is likely to be taken or not. Often these processors also implement simultaneous multithreading (SMT). Branch-prediction analysis attacks use a spy process to discover (statistically) the private key when processed with these processors.

Simple Branch Prediction Analysis (SBPA) claims to improve BPA in a non-statistical way. In their paper, &quot;On the Power of Simple Branch Prediction Analysis&quot;, the authors of SBPA (Onur Aciicmez and Cetin Kaya Koc) claim to have discovered 508 out of 512 bits of an RSA key in 10 iterations.

A power-fault attack on RSA implementations was described in 2010. The author recovered the key by varying the CPU power voltage outside limits; this caused multiple power faults on the server.

===Tricky implementation===
There are many details to keep in mind in order to implement RSA securely (strong PRNG, acceptable public exponent, etc.). This makes the implementation challenging, to the point the book Practical Cryptography With Go suggests avoiding RSA if possible.

<doc id="25389" wikidata="Q123078" url="?curid=25389" title="Robert A. Heinlein">
<text>Robert Anson Heinlein ( ; July 7, 1907 – May 8, 1988) was an American science fiction author, aeronautical engineer, and naval officer. Sometimes called the &quot;dean of science fiction writers&quot;, he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction, and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction. His published works, both fiction and non-fiction, express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking. His plots often posed provocative situations which challenged conventional social mores. His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre, and on modern culture more generally.

Heinlein became one of the first American science-fiction writers to break into mainstream magazines such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in the late 1940s. He was one of the best-selling science-fiction novelists for many decades, and he, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke are often considered the &quot;Big Three&quot; of English-language science fiction authors. Notable Heinlein works include &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (which helped mold the space marine and mecha archetypes) and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. His work sometimes had controversial aspects, such as plural marriage in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, militarism in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and technologically competent women characters who were formidable, yet often stereotypically feminine—such as &quot;Friday&quot;.

Heinlein used his science fiction as a way to explore provocative social and political ideas and to speculate how progress in science and engineering might shape the future of politics, race, religion, and sex.
Within the framework of his science-fiction stories, Heinlein repeatedly addressed certain social themes: the importance of individual liberty and self-reliance, the nature of sexual relationships, the obligation individuals owe to their societies, the influence of organized religion on culture and government, and the tendency of society to repress nonconformist thought. He also speculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices.

Heinlein was heavily influenced by the visionary writers and philosophers of his day. William H. Patterson Jr, writing in &quot;Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with his Century,&quot; states that by 1930, Heinlein was a progressive liberal who had spent some time in the open sexuality climate of New York’s Jazz Age Greenwich Village. Heinlein believed that some level of socialism was inevitable and was already occurring in America. He was absorbing the social concepts of writers such as H.G. Wells and Upton Sinclair. He adopted many of the progressive social beliefs of his day and projected them forward. 

Heinlein was named the first Science Fiction Writers Grand Master in 1974. Four of his novels won Hugo Awards. In addition, fifty years after publication, seven of his works were awarded &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;—awards given retrospectively for works that were published before the Hugo Awards came into existence. In his fiction, Heinlein coined terms that have become part of the English language, including grok, waldo and speculative fiction, as well as popularizing existing terms like &quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;, &quot;pay it forward&quot;, and &quot;space marine&quot;. He also anticipated mechanical computer-aided design with &quot;Drafting Dan&quot; in his novel &quot;The Door into Summer&quot; and described a modern version of a waterbed in his novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;.

==Life ==
===Birth, childhood, and early education===
Heinlein, born on July 7, 1907, to Rex Ivar Heinlein (an accountant) and Bam Lyle Heinlein, in Butler, Missouri, was the third of seven children. He was a sixth-generation German-American; a family tradition had it that Heinleins fought in every American war, starting with the War of Independence.

He spent his childhood in Kansas City, Missouri. The outlook and values of this time and place (in his own words, &quot;The Bible Belt&quot;) had an influence on his fiction, especially in his later works, as he drew heavily upon his childhood in establishing the setting and cultural atmosphere in works like &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;. The 1910 appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet inspired the young child&#x27;s life-long interest in astronomy.

In January 1924, the sixteen year old Heinlein lied about his age to enlist in Company C, 110th Engineer Regiment, of the Missouri National Guard, in Kansas City. His family could not afford to send Heinlein to college, so he sought an appointment to a military academy. When Heinlein graduated from Kansas City Central High School in 1924, he was initially prevented from attending the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis because his older brother Rex was a student there, and at the time, regulations discouraged multiple family members from attending the academy simultaneously. He instead matriculated at Kansas City Community College and began vigorously petitioning Missouri Senator James A. Reed for an appointment to the Naval Academy. In part due to the influence of the Pendergast machine, the Naval Academy admitted him in June 1925. Heinlein received his discharge from the Missouri National Guard as a staff sergeant. Reed later told Heinlein that he had received 100 letters of recommendation for nomination to the Naval Academy, 50 for other candidates and 50 for Heinlein.

===Navy===
Heinlein&#x27;s experience in the U.S. Navy exerted a strong influence on his character and writing. In 1929, he graduated from the Naval Academy with the equivalent of a bachelor of arts in engineering. (At that time, the Academy did not confer degrees.) He ranked fifth in his class academically but with a class standing of 20th of 243 due to disciplinary demerits. The U.S. Navy commissioned him as an ensign shortly after his graduation. He advanced to lieutenant junior grade in 1931 while serving aboard the new aircraft carrier , where he worked in radio communications—a technology then still in its earlier stages. The captain of this carrier, Ernest J. King, later served as the Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet during World War II. Military historians frequently interviewed Heinlein during his later years and asked him about Captain King and his service as the commander of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first modern aircraft carrier. Heinlein also served as gunnery officer aboard the destroyer in 1933 and 1934, reaching the rank of lieutenant. His brother, Lawrence Heinlein, served in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the Missouri National Guard, reaching the rank of major general in the National Guard.

===Marriages===
In 1929, Heinlein married Elinor Curry of Kansas City. However, their marriage lasted only about one year. His second marriage, to Leslyn MacDonald (1904–1981) in 1932, lasted 15 years. MacDonald was, according to the testimony of Heinlein&#x27;s Navy friend, Rear Admiral Cal Laning, &quot;astonishingly intelligent, widely read, and extremely liberal, though a registered Republican&quot;, while Isaac Asimov later recalled that Heinlein was, at the time, &quot;a flaming liberal&quot;. &quot;(See section: Politics of Robert Heinlein.)&quot;

At the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Heinlein met and befriended a chemical engineer named Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; Gerstenfeld. After the war, her engagement having fallen through, she attended UCLA for doctoral studies in chemistry, and while there reconnected with Heinlein. As his second wife&#x27;s alcoholism gradually spun out of control, Heinlein moved out and the couple filed for divorce. Heinlein&#x27;s friendship with Virginia turned into a relationship and on October 21, 1948—shortly after the decree nisi came through—they married in the town of Raton, New Mexico. Soon thereafter, they set up housekeeping in the Broadmoor district of Colorado Springs, Colorado, in a house that Heinlein and his wife designed. As the area was newly developed, they were allowed to choose their own house number, 1776 Mesa Avenue. The design of the house was featured in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;. They remained married until Heinlein&#x27;s death. In 1965, after various chronic health problems of Virginia&#x27;s were traced back to altitude sickness, they moved to Santa Cruz, California, which is at sea level. Robert and Virginia designed and built a new residence, circular in shape, in the adjacent village of Bonny Doon.

Ginny undoubtedly served as a model for many of his intelligent, fiercely independent female characters. She was a chemist and rocket test engineer, and held a higher rank in the Navy than Heinlein himself. She was also an accomplished college athlete, earning four varsity letters. In 1953–1954, the Heinleins voyaged around the world (mostly via ocean liners and cargo liners, as Ginny detested flying), which Heinlein described in &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;, and which also provided background material for science fiction novels set aboard spaceships on long voyages, such as &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the latter initially being set on a cruise much as detailed in &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;. Ginny acted as the first reader of his manuscripts. Isaac Asimov believed that Heinlein made a swing to the right politically at the same time he married Ginny.

===California===
In 1934, Heinlein was discharged from the Navy, owing to pulmonary tuberculosis. During a lengthy hospitalization, and inspired by his own experience while bed-ridden, he developed a design for a waterbed.

After his discharge, Heinlein attended a few weeks of graduate classes in mathematics and physics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), but he soon quit, either because of his ill-health or because of a desire to enter politics.

Heinlein supported himself at several occupations, including real estate sales and silver mining, but for some years found money in short supply. Heinlein was active in Upton Sinclair&#x27;s socialist End Poverty in California movement (EPIC) in the early 1930s. He was deputy publisher of the &quot;EPIC News&quot;, which Heinlein noted &quot;recalled a mayor, kicked out a district attorney, replaced the governor with one of our choice.&quot; When Sinclair gained the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in 1934, Heinlein worked actively in the campaign. Heinlein himself ran for the California State Assembly in 1938, but was unsuccessful. Heinlein was running as a left-wing Democrat in a conservative district, and he never made it past the Democratic primary.

===Author===
While not destitute after the campaign—he had a small disability pension from the Navy—Heinlein turned to writing to pay off his mortgage. His first published story, &quot;Life-Line&quot;, was printed in the August 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Originally written for a contest, it sold to &quot;Astounding&quot; for significantly more than the contest&#x27;s first-prize payoff. Another Future History story, &quot;Misfit&quot;, followed in November. Some saw Heinlein&#x27;s talent and stardom from his first story, and he was quickly acknowledged as a leader of the new movement toward &quot;social&quot; science fiction. In California he hosted the Mañana Literary Society, a 1940–41 series of informal gatherings of new authors. He was the guest of honor at Denvention, the 1941 Worldcon, held in Denver. During World War II, Heinlein was employed by the Navy as a civilian aeronautical engineer at the Navy Aircraft Materials Center at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania. Heinlein recruited Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp to also work there. While at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards, Asimov, Heinlein, and de Camp brainstormed unconventional approaches to kamikaze attacks, such as using sound to detect approaching planes.

As the war wound down in 1945, Heinlein began to re-evaluate his career. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, along with the outbreak of the Cold War, galvanized him to write nonfiction on political topics. In addition, he wanted to break into better-paying markets. He published four influential short stories for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; magazine, leading off, in February 1947, with &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;. That made him the first science fiction writer to break out of the &quot;pulp ghetto&quot;. In 1950, the movie &quot;Destination Moon&quot;—the documentary-like film for which he had written the story and scenario, co-written the script, and invented many of the effects—won an Academy Award for special effects. 

Heinlein created SF stories with social commentary about relationships. In &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, a 1951 alien invasion novel, the point of view character Sam persuades fellow operative Mary to marry him. When they go to the county clerk, they are offered a variety of marriage possibilities; “Term, renewable or lifetime”, as short as six months or as long as forever.

Also, he embarked on a series of juvenile novels for the Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons publishing company that went from 1947 through 1959, at the rate of one book each autumn, in time for Christmas presents to teenagers. He also wrote for &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; in 1952.

Heinlein used topical materials throughout his juvenile series beginning in 1947, but in 1958 he interrupted work on &quot;The Heretic&quot; (the working title of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;) to write and publish a book exploring ideas of civic virtue, initially serialized as &quot;Starship Soldiers&quot;. In 1959, his novel (now entitled &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;) was considered by the editors and owners of Scribner&#x27;s to be too controversial for one of its prestige lines, and it was rejected. Heinlein found another publisher (Putnam), feeling himself released from the constraints of writing novels for children. He had told an interviewer that he did not want to do stories that merely added to categories defined by other works. Rather he wanted to do his own work, stating that: &quot;I want to do my own stuff, my own way&quot;. He would go on to write a series of challenging books that redrew the boundaries of science fiction, including &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966).

===Later life and death===
Beginning in 1970, Heinlein had a series of health crises, broken by strenuous periods of activity in his hobby of stonemasonry: in a private correspondence, he referred to that as his &quot;usual and favorite occupation between books&quot;. The decade began with a life-threatening attack of peritonitis, recovery from which required more than two years, and treatment of which required multiple transfusions of Heinlein&#x27;s rare blood type, A2 negative. As soon as he was well enough to write again, he began work on &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973), which introduced many of the themes found in his later fiction.

In the mid-1970s, Heinlein wrote two articles for the &quot;Britannica Compton Yearbook&quot;. He and Ginny crisscrossed the country helping to reorganize blood donation in the United States in an effort to assist the system which had saved his life. At science fiction conventions to receive his autograph, fans would be asked to co-sign with Heinlein a beautifully embellished pledge form he supplied stating that the recipient agrees that they will donate blood. He was the guest of honor at the Worldcon in 1976 for the third time at MidAmeriCon in Kansas City, Missouri. At that Worldcon, Heinlein hosted a blood drive and donors&#x27; reception to thank all those who had helped save lives.

Beginning in 1977, and including an episode while vacationing in Tahiti in early 1978, he had episodes of reversible neurologic dysfunction due to transient ischemic attacks. Over the next few months, he became more and more exhausted, and his health again began to decline. The problem was determined to be a blocked carotid artery, and he had one of the earliest known carotid bypass operations to correct it.

In 1980, Robert Heinlein was a member of the Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Council on National Space Policy, chaired by Jerry Pournelle, which met at the home of SF writer Larry Niven to write space policy papers for the incoming Reagan administration. Members included such aerospace industry leaders as former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, General Daniel O. Graham, aerospace engineer Max Hunter and North American Rockwell VP for Space Shuttle development George Merrick. Policy recommendations from the Council included ballistic missile defense concepts which were later transformed into what was called the Strategic Defense Initiative. Heinlein assisted with Council contribution to the Reagan SDI spring 1983 speech. Asked to appear before a Joint Committee of the United States Congress that year, he testified on his belief that spin-offs from space technology were benefiting the infirm and the elderly.

Heinlein&#x27;s surgical treatment re-energized him, and he wrote five novels from 1980 until he died in his sleep from emphysema and heart failure on May 8, 1988.

In 1995, Spider Robinson wrote the novel &quot;Variable Star&quot; based on an outline and notes created by Heinlein. Heinlein&#x27;s posthumously published nonfiction includes a selection of correspondence and notes edited into a somewhat autobiographical examination of his career, published in 1989 under the title &quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot; by his wife, Virginia; his book on practical politics written in 1946 and published as &quot;Take Back Your Government&quot; in 1992; and a travelogue of their first around-the-world tour in 1954, &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;. The novel &quot;Podkayne of Mars,&quot; which had been edited against Heinlein&#x27;s wishes in their original release, was reissued with the original ending. &quot;Stranger In a Strange Land&quot; was originally published in a shorter form, but both the long and short versions are now simultaneously available in print.

Heinlein&#x27;s archive is housed by the Special Collections department of McHenry Library at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The collection includes manuscript drafts, correspondence, photographs and artifacts. A substantial portion of the archive has been digitized and it is available online through the Robert A. and Virginia Heinlein Archives.

==Written works==
Heinlein published 32 novels, 59 short stories, and 16 collections during his life. Nine films, two television series, several episodes of a radio series, and a board game have been derived more or less directly from his work. He wrote a screenplay for one of the films. Heinlein edited an anthology of other writers&#x27; SF short stories.

Three nonfiction books and two poems have been published posthumously. &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot; was published posthumously in 2003; &quot;Variable Star&quot;, written by Spider Robinson based on an extensive outline by Heinlein, was published in September 2006. Four collections have been published posthumously.

===Early work, 1939–1958===
Heinlein began his career as a writer of stories for &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, which was edited by John Campbell. The science fiction writer Frederik Pohl has described Heinlein as &quot;that greatest of Campbell-era sf writers&quot;. Isaac Asimov said that, from the time of his first story, the science fiction world accepted that Heinlein was the best science fiction writer in existence, adding that he would hold this title through his lifetime.

Alexei and Cory Panshin noted that Heinlein&#x27;s impact was immediately felt. In 1940, the year after selling &#x27;Life-Line&#x27; to Campbell, he wrote three short novels, four novelettes, and seven short stories. They went on to say that &quot;No one ever dominated the science fiction field as Bob did in the first few years of his career.&quot; Alexei expresses awe in Heinlein&#x27;s ability to show readers a world so drastically different from the one we live in now, yet have so many similarities. He says that &quot;We find ourselves not only in a world other than our own, but identifying with a living, breathing individual who is operating within its context, and thinking and acting according to its terms.&quot;

The first novel that Heinlein wrote, &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot; (1939), did not see print during his lifetime, but Robert James tracked down the manuscript and it was published in 2003. Though some regard it as a failure as a novel, considering it little more than a disguised lecture on Heinlein&#x27;s social theories, some readers took a very different view. In a review of it, John Clute wrote:

I&#x27;m not about to suggest that if Heinlein had been able to publish [such works] openly in the pages of &quot;Astounding&quot; in 1939, SF would have gotten the future right; I would suggest, however, that if Heinlein, and his colleagues, had been able to publish adult SF in &quot;Astounding&quot; and its fellow journals, then SF might not have done such a grotesquely poor job of prefiguring something of the flavor of actually living here at the onset of 2004.

&quot;For Us, the Living&quot; was intriguing as a window into the development of Heinlein&#x27;s radical ideas about man as a social animal, including his interest in free love. The root of many themes found in his later stories can be found in this book. It also contained a large amount of material that could be considered background for his other novels. This included a detailed description of the protagonist&#x27;s treatment to avoid being banished to Coventry (a lawless land in the Heinlein mythos where unrepentant law-breakers are exiled).

It appears that Heinlein at least attempted to live in a manner consistent with these ideals, even in the 1930s, and had an open relationship in his marriage to his second wife, Leslyn. He was also a nudist; nudism and body taboos are frequently discussed in his work. At the height of the Cold War, he built a bomb shelter under his house, like the one featured in &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;.

After &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;, Heinlein began selling (to magazines) first short stories, then novels, set in a Future History, complete with a time line of significant political, cultural, and technological changes. A chart of the future history was published in the May 1941 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;. Over time, Heinlein wrote many novels and short stories that deviated freely from the Future History on some points, while maintaining consistency in some other areas. The Future History was eventually overtaken by actual events. These discrepancies were explained, after a fashion, in his later World as Myth stories.

Heinlein&#x27;s first novel published as a book, &quot;Rocket Ship Galileo&quot;, was initially rejected because going to the Moon was considered too far-fetched, but he soon found a publisher, Scribner&#x27;s, that began publishing a Heinlein juvenile once a year for the Christmas season. Eight of these books were illustrated by Clifford Geary in a distinctive white-on-black scratchboard style. Some representative novels of this type are &quot;Have Space Suit—Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot;, and &quot;Starman Jones&quot;. Many of these were first published in serial form under other titles, e.g., &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot; was published as &quot;Satellite Scout&quot; in the Boy Scout magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;. There has been speculation that Heinlein&#x27;s intense obsession with his privacy was due at least in part to the apparent contradiction between his unconventional private life and his career as an author of books for children. However, &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; explicitly discusses the political importance Heinlein attached to privacy as a matter of principle.

The novels that Heinlein wrote for a young audience are commonly called &quot;the Heinlein juveniles&quot;, and they feature a mixture of adolescent and adult themes. Many of the issues that he takes on in these books have to do with the kinds of problems that adolescents experience. His protagonists are usually intelligent teenagers who have to make their way in the adult society they see around them. On the surface, they are simple tales of adventure, achievement, and dealing with stupid teachers and jealous peers. Heinlein was a vocal proponent of the notion that juvenile readers were far more sophisticated and able to handle more complex or difficult themes than most people realized. His juvenile stories often had a maturity to them that made them readable for adults. &quot;Red Planet&quot;, for example, portrays some subversive themes, including a revolution in which young students are involved; his editor demanded substantial changes in this book&#x27;s discussion of topics such as the use of weapons by children and the misidentified sex of the Martian character. Heinlein was always aware of the editorial limitations put in place by the editors of his novels and stories, and while he observed those restrictions on the surface, was often successful in introducing ideas not often seen in other authors&#x27; juvenile SF.

In 1957, James Blish wrote that one reason for Heinlein&#x27;s success &quot;has been the high grade of machinery which goes, today as always, into his story-telling. Heinlein seems to have known from the beginning, as if instinctively, technical lessons about fiction which other writers must learn the hard way (or often enough, never learn). He does not always operate the machinery to the best advantage, but he always seems to be aware of it.&quot;

===1959–1960===
Heinlein decisively ended his juvenile novels with &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1959), a controversial work and his personal riposte to leftists calling for President Dwight D. Eisenhower to stop nuclear testing in 1958. &quot;The &#x27;Patrick Henry&#x27; ad shocked &#x27;em&quot;, he wrote many years later of the campaign. &quot;&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; outraged &#x27;em.&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is a coming-of-age story about duty, citizenship, and the role of the military in society. The book portrays a society in which suffrage is earned by demonstrated willingness to place society&#x27;s interests before one&#x27;s own, at least for a short time and often under onerous circumstances, in government service; in the case of the protagonist, this was military service.

Later, in &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;, Heinlein said that it was his intention in the novel that service could include positions outside strictly military functions such as teachers, police officers, and other government positions. This is presented in the novel as an outgrowth of the failure of unearned suffrage government and as a very successful arrangement. In addition, the franchise was only awarded after leaving the assigned service; thus those serving their terms—in the military, or any other service—were excluded from exercising any franchise. Career military were completely disenfranchised until retirement.

===Middle period work, 1961–1973===

From about 1961 (&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;) to 1973 (&quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;), Heinlein explored some of his most important themes, such as individualism, libertarianism, and free expression of physical and emotional love. Three novels from this period, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, and &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, won the Libertarian Futurist Society&#x27;s Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, designed to honor classic libertarian fiction. Jeff Riggenbach described &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; as &quot;unquestionably one of the three or four most influential libertarian novels of the last century&quot;.

Heinlein did not publish &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; until some time after it was written, and the themes of free love and radical individualism are prominently featured in his long-unpublished first novel, &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot;.

&quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; tells of a war of independence waged by the Lunar penal colonies, with significant comments from a major character, Professor La Paz, regarding the threat posed by government to individual freedom.

Although Heinlein had previously written a few short stories in the fantasy genre, during this period he wrote his first fantasy novel, &quot;Glory Road&quot;. In &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;, he began to mix hard science with fantasy, mysticism, and satire of organized religion. Critics William H. Patterson, Jr., and Andrew Thornton believe that this is simply an expression of Heinlein&#x27;s longstanding philosophical opposition to positivism. Heinlein stated that he was influenced by James Branch Cabell in taking this new literary direction. The penultimate novel of this period, &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;, is according to critic James Gifford &quot;almost universally regarded as a literary failure&quot; and he attributes its shortcomings to Heinlein&#x27;s near-death from peritonitis.

===Later work, 1980–1987===
After a seven-year hiatus brought on by poor health, Heinlein produced five new novels in the period from 1980 (&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;) to 1987 (&quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;). These books have a thread of common characters and time and place. They most explicitly communicated Heinlein&#x27;s philosophies and beliefs, and many long, didactic passages of dialog and exposition deal with government, sex, and religion. These novels are controversial among his readers and one critic, David Langford, has written about them very negatively. Heinlein&#x27;s four Hugo awards were all for books written before this period.

Most of the novels from this period are recognized by critics as forming an offshoot from the Future History series and are referred to by the term &quot;World as Myth&quot;.

The tendency toward authorial self-reference begun in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; becomes even more evident in novels such as &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;, whose first-person protagonist is a disabled military veteran who becomes a writer, and finds love with a female character.

The 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot;, a more conventional adventure story (borrowing a character and backstory from the earlier short story &quot;Gulf&quot;, also containing suggestions of connection to &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;) continued a Heinlein theme of expecting what he saw as the continued disintegration of Earth&#x27;s society, to the point where the title character is strongly encouraged to seek a new life off-planet. It concludes with a traditional Heinlein note, as in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; or &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, that freedom is to be found on the frontiers.

The 1984 novel &quot;&quot; is a sharp satire of organized religion. Heinlein himself was agnostic.

===Posthumous publications===
Several Heinlein works have been published since his death, including the aforementioned &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; as well as 1989&#x27;s &quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot;, a collection of letters between Heinlein and his editors and agent; 1992&#x27;s &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;, a travelogue of a southern hemisphere tour the Heinleins took in the 1950s; &quot;Take Back Your Government&quot;, a how-to book about participatory democracy written in 1946 and reflecting his experience as an organizer with the EPIC campaign of 1934 and the movement&#x27;s aftermath as an important factor in California politics before the Second World War; and a tribute volume called &quot;Requiem: Collected Works and Tributes to the Grand Master&quot;, containing some additional short works previously unpublished in book form. &quot;Off the Main Sequence&quot;, published in 2005, includes three short stories never before collected in any Heinlein book (Heinlein called them &quot;stinkeroos&quot;).

Spider Robinson, a colleague, friend, and admirer of Heinlein, wrote &quot;Variable Star&quot;, based on an outline and notes for a novel that Heinlein prepared in 1955. The novel was published as a collaboration, with Heinlein&#x27;s name above Robinson&#x27;s on the cover, in 2006.

A complete collection of Heinlein&#x27;s published work has been published by the Heinlein Prize Trust as the &quot;Virginia Edition&quot;, after his wife. See the Complete Works section of Robert A. Heinlein bibliography for details.

On February 1, 2019, Phoenix Pick announced that through a collaboration with the Heinlein Prize Trust, a reconstruction of the full text of an unpublished Heinlein novel had been produced. It was published in March 2020. The reconstructed novel, entitled &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes&quot;, is an alternative version of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, with the first one-third of &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot; mostly the same as the first one-third of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; but the remainder of &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot; deviating entirely from &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, with a completely different story-line. The newly reconstructed novel pays homage to Edgar Rice Burroughs and E. E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith. It was edited by Patrick Lobrutto. Some reviewers describe the newly reconstructed novel as more in line with the style of a traditional Heinlein novel than was &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;. &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot; was considered superior to the original version of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; by some reviewers. Both &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot; and a new edition of &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; were published in March 2020. The new edition of the latter shares the subtitle of &quot;The Pursuit of the Pankera&quot;, hence entitled &quot;The Number of the Beast: A Parallel Novel about Parallel Universes&quot;.

== Movies ==

Heinlein contributed to the final draft of the script for &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1950) and served as a technical adviser for the film. Heinlein also shared screenwriting credit for &quot;Project Moonbase&quot; (1953).

==Influences==
The primary influence on Heinlein&#x27;s writing style may have been Rudyard Kipling. Kipling is the first known modern example of &quot;indirect exposition&quot;, a writing technique for which Heinlein later became famous. In his famous text on &quot;On the Writing of Speculative Fiction&quot;, Heinlein quotes Kipling:

&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; originated as a modernized version of Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. His wife suggested that the child be raised by Martians instead of wolves. Likewise, &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; can be seen as a reboot of Kipling&#x27;s novel &quot;Kim&quot;.

The &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; idea of needing to serve in the military in order to vote can be found in Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Army of a Dream&quot;:

Poul Anderson once said of Kipling&#x27;s science fiction story &quot;As Easy as A.B.C.&quot;, &quot;a wonderful science fiction yarn, showing the same eye for detail that would later distinguish the work of Robert Heinlein&quot;.

Heinlein described himself as also being influenced by George Bernard Shaw, having read most of his plays. Shaw is an example of an earlier author who used the competent man, a favorite Heinlein archetype. He denied, though, any direct influence of &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot; on &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;.

==Views==

Heinlein&#x27;s books probe a range of ideas about a range of topics such as sexuality, race, politics, and the military. Many were seen as radical or as ahead of their time in their social criticism. His books have inspired considerable debate about the specifics, and the evolution, of Heinlein&#x27;s own opinions, and have earned him both lavish praise and a degree of criticism. He has also been accused of contradicting himself on various philosophical questions.

Brian Doherty cites William Patterson, saying that the best way to gain an understanding of Heinlein is as a &quot;full-service iconoclast, the unique individual who decides that things do not have to be, and won&#x27;t continue, as they are&quot;. He says this vision is &quot;at the heart of Heinlein, science fiction, libertarianism, and America. Heinlein imagined how everything about the human world, from our sexual mores to our religion to our automobiles to our government to our plans for cultural survival, might be flawed, even fatally so.&quot;

The critic Elizabeth Anne Hull, for her part, has praised Heinlein for his interest in exploring fundamental life questions, especially questions about &quot;political power—our responsibilities to one another&quot; and about &quot;personal freedom, particularly sexual freedom&quot;.

Edward R. Murrow hosted a series on CBS Radio called &quot;This I Believe&quot;, which solicited an entry from Heinlein in 1952. Titled &quot;Our Noble, Essential Decency&quot;. In it, Heinlein broke with the normal trends, stating that he believed in his neighbors (some of whom he named and described), community, and towns across America that share the same sense of good will and intentions as his own, going on to apply this same philosophy to the US, and humanity in general.

===Politics===
Heinlein&#x27;s political positions shifted throughout his life. Heinlein&#x27;s early political leanings were liberal. In 1934, he worked actively for the Democratic campaign of Upton Sinclair for Governor of California. After Sinclair lost, Heinlein became an anti-communist Democratic activist. He made an unsuccessful bid for a California State Assembly seat in 1938. Heinlein&#x27;s first novel, &quot;For Us, the Living&quot; (written 1939), consists largely of speeches advocating the Social Credit philosophy, and the early story &quot;Misfit&quot; (1939) deals with an organization—&quot;The Cosmic Construction Corps&quot;—that seems to be Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Civilian Conservation Corps translated into outer space.

Of this time in his life, Heinlein later said:

Heinlein&#x27;s fiction of the 1940s and 1950s, however, began to espouse conservative views. After 1945, he came to believe that a strong world government was the only way to avoid mutual nuclear annihilation. His 1949 novel &quot;Space Cadet&quot; describes a future scenario where a military-controlled global government enforces world peace. Heinlein ceased considering himself a Democrat in 1954.

The Heinleins formed the Patrick Henry League in 1958, and they worked in the 1964 Barry Goldwater presidential campaign.

Heinlein&#x27;s response ad was entitled &quot;Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?&quot;. It started with the famous Henry quotation: &quot;Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!!&quot; It then went on to admit that there was some risk to nuclear testing (albeit less than the &quot;willfully distorted&quot; claims of the test ban advocates), and risk of nuclear war, but that &quot;The alternative is surrender. We accept the risks.&quot; Heinlein was among those who in 1968 signed a pro–Vietnam War ad in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;.

Heinlein always considered himself a libertarian; in a letter to Judith Merril in 1967 (never sent) he said, &quot;As for libertarian, I&#x27;ve been one all my life, a radical one. You might use the term &#x27;philosophical anarchist&#x27; or &#x27;autarchist&#x27; about me, but &#x27;libertarian&#x27; is easier to define and fits well enough.&quot;

&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; was embraced by the 1960s counterculture, and libertarians have found inspiration in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. Both groups found resonance with his themes of personal freedom in both thought and action.

===Race===
Heinlein grew up in the era of racial segregation in the United States and wrote some of his most influential fiction at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. He explicitly made the case for using his fiction not only to predict the future but also to educate his readers about the value of racial equality and the importance of racial tolerance. His early novels were very much ahead of their time both in their explicit rejection of racism and in their inclusion of protagonists of color. In the context of science fiction before the 1960s, the mere existence of characters of color was a remarkable novelty, with green occurring more often than brown. For example, his 1948 novel &quot;Space Cadet&quot; explicitly uses aliens as a metaphor for minorities. In his novel &quot;The Star Beast&quot;, the &quot;de facto&quot; foreign minister of the Terran government is an undersecretary, a Mr. Kiku, who is from Africa. Heinlein explicitly states his skin is &quot;ebony black&quot; and that Kiku is in an arranged marriage that is happy.

In a number of his stories, Heinlein challenges his readers&#x27; possible racial preconceptions by introducing a strong, sympathetic character, only to reveal much later that he or she is of African or other ancestry. In several cases, the covers of the books show characters as being light-skinned when the text states or at least implies that they are dark-skinned or of African ancestry. Heinlein repeatedly denounced racism in his nonfiction works, including numerous examples in &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;.

Heinlein reveals in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; that the novel&#x27;s protagonist and narrator, Johnny Rico, the formerly disaffected scion of a wealthy family, is Filipino, actually named &quot;Juan Rico&quot; and speaks Tagalog in addition to English.

Race was a central theme in some of Heinlein&#x27;s fiction. The most prominent example is &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot;, which casts a white family into a future in which white people are the slaves of cannibalistic black rulers. In the 1941 novel &quot;Sixth Column&quot; (also known as &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;), a white resistance movement in the United States defends itself against an invasion by an Asian fascist state (the &quot;Pan-Asians&quot;) using a &quot;super-science&quot; technology that allows ray weapons to be tuned to specific races. The idea for the story was pushed on Heinlein by editor John W. Campbell and the story itself was based on a then-unpublished story by Campbell, and Heinlein wrote later that he had &quot;had to re-slant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line&quot; and that he did not &quot;consider it to be an artistic success&quot;. However, the novel prompted a heated debate in the scientific community regarding the plausibility of developing ethnic bioweapons. John Hickman, writing in the &quot;European Journal of American Studies&quot;, identifies examples of anti–East Asian racism in some of Heinlein&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;Sixth Column&quot;.

Heinlein summed up his attitude toward people of any race in his essay &quot;Our Noble, Essential Decency&quot; thus:

===Individualism and self-determination===
In keeping with his belief in individualism, his work for adults—and sometimes even his work for juveniles—often portrays both the oppressors and the oppressed with considerable ambiguity. Heinlein believed that individualism was incompatible with ignorance. He believed that an appropriate level of adult competence was achieved through a wide-ranging education, whether this occurred in a classroom or not. In his juvenile novels, more than once a character looks with disdain at a student&#x27;s choice of classwork, saying, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you study something useful?&quot; In &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, Lazarus Long gives a long list of capabilities that anyone should have, concluding, &quot;Specialization is for insects.&quot; The ability of the individual to create himself is explored in stories such as &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;, &quot;″—All You Zombies—″&quot;, and &quot;By His Bootstraps&quot;.

Heinlein claimed to have written &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in response to &quot;calls for the unilateral ending of nuclear testing by the United States&quot;. Heinlein suggests in the book that the Bugs are a good example of Communism being something that humans cannot successfully adhere to, since humans are strongly defined individuals, whereas the Bugs, being a collective, can all contribute to the whole without consideration of individual desire.

===The Competent Man===
A common theme in Heinlein&#x27;s writing is his frequent use of the &quot;competent man&quot;, a stock character who exhibits a very wide range of abilities and knowledge, making him a form of polymath. This trope was notably common in 1950s U.S. science fiction. While Heinlein was not the first to use such a character type, the heroes and heroines of his fiction (with Jubal Harshaw being a prime example) generally have a wide range of abilities, and one of Heinlein&#x27;s characters, Lazarus Long, gives a wide summary of requirements:

Predecessors of Heinlein&#x27;s competent heroes include the protagonists of George Bernard Shaw, like Henry Higgins in &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and Caesar in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, as well as the citizen soldiers in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Army of a Dream&quot;.

===Sexuality===
For Heinlein, personal liberation included sexual liberation, and free love was a major subject of his writing starting in 1939, with &quot;For Us, the Living&quot;. During his early period, Heinlein&#x27;s writing for younger readers needed to take account of both editorial perceptions of sexuality in his novels, and potential perceptions among the buying public; as critic William H. Patterson has put it, his dilemma was &quot;to sort out what was really objectionable from what was only excessive over-sensitivity to imaginary librarians&quot;.

By his middle period, sexual freedom and the elimination of sexual jealousy became a major theme; for instance, in &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), the progressively minded but sexually conservative reporter, Ben Caxton, acts as a dramatic foil for the less parochial characters, Jubal Harshaw and Valentine Michael Smith (Mike). Another of the main characters, Jill, is homophobic, and says that &quot;nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped it&#x27;s partly her own fault.&quot;

According to Gary Westfahl,

In books written as early as 1956, Heinlein dealt with incest and the sexual nature of children. Many of his books including &quot;Time for the Stars&quot;, &quot;Glory Road&quot;, &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; dealt explicitly or implicitly with incest, sexual feelings and relations between adults, children, or both. The treatment of these themes include the romantic relationship and eventual marriage of two characters in &quot;The Door into Summer&quot; who met when one was a 30-year-old engineer and the other was an 11-year-old girl, and who eventually married when time-travel rendered the girl an adult while the engineer aged minimally, or the more overt intra-familial incest in &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; and &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;. Heinlein often posed situations where the nominal purpose of sexual taboos was irrelevant to a particular situation, due to future advances in technology. For example, in &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; Heinlein describes a brother and sister (Joe and Llita) who were mirror twins, being complementary diploids with entirely disjoint genomes, and thus not at increased risk for unfavorable gene duplication due to consanguinity. In this instance, Llita and Joe were props used to explore the concept of incest, where the usual objection to incest—heightened risk of genetic defect in their children—was not a consideration. Peers such as L. Sprague de Camp and Damon Knight have commented critically on Heinlein&#x27;s portrayal of incest and pedophilia in a lighthearted and even approving manner. Diane Parkin-Speer suggests that Heinlein&#x27;s intent seems more to provoke the reader and to question sexual norms than to promote any particular sexual agenda.

===Philosophy===
In &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, Heinlein has the main character, Maureen, state that the purpose of metaphysics is to ask questions: &quot;Why are we here?&quot; &quot;Where are we going after we die?&quot; (and so on); and that you are not allowed to answer the questions. &quot;Asking&quot; the questions is the point of metaphysics, but &quot;answering&quot; them is not, because once you answer this kind of question, you cross the line into religion. Maureen does not state a reason for this; she simply remarks that such questions are &quot;beautiful&quot; but lack answers. Maureen&#x27;s son/lover Lazarus Long makes a related remark in &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;. In order for us to answer the &quot;big questions&quot; about the universe, Lazarus states at one point, it would be necessary to stand &quot;outside&quot; the universe.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Heinlein was deeply interested in Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s general semantics and attended a number of seminars on the subject. His views on epistemology seem to have flowed from that interest, and his fictional characters continue to express Korzybskian views to the very end of his writing career. Many of his stories, such as &quot;Gulf&quot;, &quot;If This Goes On—&quot;, and &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, depend strongly on the premise, related to the well-known Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, that by using a correctly designed language, one can change or improve oneself mentally, or even realize untapped potential (as in the case of Joe in &quot;Gulf&quot;—whose last name may be Greene, Gilead or Briggs).

When Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was published, Heinlein was very favorably impressed, as quoted in &quot;Grumbles ...&quot; and mentioned John Galt—the hero in Rand&#x27;s &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;—as a heroic archetype in &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;. He was also strongly affected by the religious philosopher P. D. Ouspensky. Freudianism and psychoanalysis were at the height of their influence during the peak of Heinlein&#x27;s career, and stories such as &quot;Time for the Stars&quot; indulged in psychological theorizing.

However, he was skeptical about Freudianism, especially after a struggle with an editor who insisted on reading Freudian sexual symbolism into his juvenile novels. Heinlein was fascinated by the social credit movement in the 1930s. This is shown in &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; and in his 1938 novel &quot;For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs&quot;, which was finally published in 2003, long after his death.

====Pay it forward====
On that theme, the phrase &quot;pay it forward&quot;, though it was already in occasional use as a quotation, was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his book &quot;Between Planets&quot;, published in 1951:

He referred to this in a number of other stories, although sometimes just saying to pay a debt back by helping others, as in one of his last works, &quot;Job, a Comedy of Justice&quot;.

Heinlein was a mentor to Ray Bradbury, giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:

Bradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.

Heinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy; now the Heinlein Society, a humanitarian organization founded in his name, does so, attributing the philosophy to its various efforts, including Heinlein for Heroes, the Heinlein Society Scholarship Program, and Heinlein Society blood drives. Author Spider Robinson made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.

==Influence and legacy==
===Honorifics===
Heinlein is usually identified, along with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, as one of the three masters of science fiction to arise in the so-called Golden Age of science fiction, associated with John W. Campbell and his magazine &quot;Astounding&quot;.
In the 1950s he was a leader in bringing science fiction out of the low-paying and less prestigious &quot;pulp ghetto&quot;. Most of his works, including short stories, have been continuously in print in many languages since their initial appearance and are still available as new paperbacks decades after his death.

He was at the top of his form during, and himself helped to initiate, the trend toward social science fiction, which went along with a general maturing of the genre away from space opera to a more literary approach touching on such adult issues as politics and human sexuality. In reaction to this trend, hard science fiction began to be distinguished as a separate subgenre, but paradoxically Heinlein is also considered a seminal figure in hard science fiction, due to his extensive knowledge of engineering and the careful scientific research demonstrated in his stories. Heinlein himself stated—with obvious pride—that in the days before pocket calculators, he and his wife Virginia once worked for several days on a mathematical equation describing an Earth–Mars rocket orbit, which was then subsumed in a single sentence of the novel &quot;Space Cadet&quot;.

===Writing style===
Heinlein is often credited with bringing serious writing techniques to the genre of science fiction. For example, when writing about fictional worlds, previous authors were often limited by the reader&#x27;s existing knowledge of a typical &quot;space opera&quot; setting, leading to a relatively low creativity level: The same starships, death rays, and horrifying rubbery aliens becoming ubiquitous. This was necessary unless the author was willing to go into long expositions about the setting of the story, at a time when the word count was at a premium in SF.

But Heinlein utilized a technique called &quot;indirect exposition&quot;, perhaps first introduced by Rudyard Kipling in his own science fiction venture, the Aerial Board of Control stories. Kipling had picked this up during his time in India, using it to avoid bogging down his stories set in India with explanations for his English readers. This technique—mentioning details in a way that lets the reader infer more about the universe than is actually spelled out became a trademark rhetorical technique of both Heinlein and generation of writers influenced by him. Heinlein was significantly influenced by Kipling beyond this, for example quoting him in &quot;On the Writing of Speculative Fiction&quot;.
Likewise, Heinlein&#x27;s name is often associated with the competent hero, a character archetype who, though he or she may have flaws and limitations, is a strong, accomplished person able to overcome any soluble problem set in their path. They tend to feel confident overall, have a broad life experience and set of skills, and not give up when the going gets tough. This style influenced not only the writing style of a generation of authors, but even their personal character. Harlan Ellison once said, &quot;Very early in life when I read Robert Heinlein I got the thread that runs through his stories—the notion of the competent man ... I&#x27;ve always held that as my ideal. I&#x27;ve tried to be a very competent man.&quot;

====Rules of writing====

When fellow writers, or fans, wrote Heinlein asking for writing advice, he famously gave out his own list of rules for becoming a successful writer:
# You must write.
# Finish what you start.
# You must refrain from rewriting, except to editorial order.
# You must put your story on the market.
# You must keep it on the market until it has sold.

About which he said:

Heinlein later published an entire article, &quot;On the Writing of Speculative Fiction&quot;, which included his rules, and from which the above quote is taken. When he says &quot;anything said above them&quot;, he refers to his other guidelines. For example, he describes most stories as fitting into one of a handful of basic categories:

* The gadget story
* The human interest story
* Boy meets girl
* The Little Tailor
* The man-who-learned-better

In the article, Heinlein proposes that most stories fit into either the gadget story or the human interest story, which is itself subdivided into the three latter categories. He also credits L. Ron Hubbard as having identified &quot;The Man-Who-Learned-Better&quot;.

===Influence among writers===
Heinlein has had a pervasive influence on other science fiction writers. In a 1953 poll of leading science fiction authors, he was cited more frequently as an influence than any other modern writer. Critic James Gifford writes that

Heinlein gave Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle extensive advice on a draft manuscript of &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;. He contributed a cover blurb &quot;Possibly the finest science fiction novel I have ever read.&quot; In their novel Footfall, Niven and Pournelle included Robert A. Heinlein as a character under the name &quot;Bob Anson.&quot; Anson in the novel is a respected and well-known science-fiction author. Writer David Gerrold, responsible for creating the tribbles in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, also credited Heinlein as the inspiration for his &quot;Dingilliad&quot; series of novels. Gregory Benford refers to his novel &quot;Jupiter Project&quot; as a Heinlein tribute. Similarly, Charles Stross says his Hugo Award-nominated novel &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; is &quot;a space opera and late-period Robert A. Heinlein tribute&quot;, referring to Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Friday&quot;. The theme and plot of Kameron Hurley&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Light Brigade&quot; clearly echo those of Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

===Words and phrases coined===
Even outside the science fiction community, several words and phrases coined or adopted by Heinlein have passed into common English usage:
* , protagonist in the eponymous short story &quot;Waldo&quot;, whose name came to mean mechanical or robot arms in the real world that are akin to the ones used by the character in the story.
* Moonbat used in United States politics as a pejorative political epithet referring to progressives or leftists, was originally the name of a space ship in his story &quot;Space Jockey&quot;.
* Grok, a Martian word for understanding a thing so fully as to become one with it, from &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, whose root meaning in Martian is &quot;to drink&quot;.
* Space marine, an existing term popularized by Heinlein in short stories, the concept then being made famous by &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, though the term &quot;space marine&quot; is not used in that novel.
* Speculative fiction, a term Heinlein used for the separation of serious, consistent science fiction writing, from the pop &quot;sci fi&quot; of the day.

===Inspiring culture and technology===
In 1962, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then still using his birth name, Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways (including its name) after the treatment of religion in the novel &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as &quot;grok&quot;, &quot;Thou art God&quot;, and &quot;Never Thirst&quot;. Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, there was a frequent exchange of correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine, &quot;Green Egg&quot;. This Church still exists as a 501(C)(3) religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today. Zell-Ravenheart&#x27;s wife, Morning Glory coined the term polyamory in 1990, another movement that includes Heinlein concepts among its roots.

Heinlein was influential in making space exploration seem to the public more like a practical possibility. His stories in publications such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; took a matter-of-fact approach to their outer-space setting, rather than the &quot;gee whiz&quot; tone that had previously been common. The documentary-like film &quot;Destination Moon&quot; advocated a Space Race with an unspecified foreign power almost a decade before such an idea became commonplace, and was promoted by an unprecedented publicity campaign in print publications. Many of the astronauts and others working in the U.S. space program grew up on a diet of the Heinlein juveniles, best evidenced by the naming of a crater on Mars after him, and a tribute interspersed by the Apollo 15 astronauts into their radio conversations while on the moon.

Heinlein was also a guest commentator (along with fellow SF author Arthur C. Clarke) for Walter Cronkite&#x27;s coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. He remarked to Cronkite during the landing that, &quot;This is the greatest event in human history, up to this time. This is—today is New Year&#x27;s Day of the Year One.&quot;

Heinlein has inspired many transformational figures in business and technology including Lee Felsenstein, the designer of the first mass-produced portable computer, Marc Andreessen, co-author of the first widely-used web browser, and Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX.

===Heinlein Society===

The Heinlein Society was founded by Virginia Heinlein on behalf of her husband, to &quot;pay forward&quot; the legacy of the writer to future generations of &quot;Heinlein&#x27;s Children&quot;. The foundation has programs to:
* &quot;Promote Heinlein blood drives.&quot;
* &quot;Provide educational materials to educators.&quot;
* &quot;Promote scholarly research and overall discussion of the works and ideas of Robert Anson Heinlein.&quot;

The Heinlein society also established the Robert A. Heinlein Award in 2003 &quot;for outstanding published works in science fiction and technical writings to inspire the human exploration of space&quot;.

==Honors==
In his lifetime, Heinlein received four Hugo Awards, for &quot;Double Star&quot;, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, and was nominated for four Nebula Awards, for &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, and &quot;Job: A Comedy of Justice&quot;. He was also given seven Retro-Hugos: two for best novel: &quot;Beyond This Horizon&quot; and &quot;Farmer in the Sky&quot;; three for best novella: &quot;If This Goes On...&quot;, &quot;Waldo&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;; one for best novelette: &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;; and one for best dramatic presentation: &quot;Destination Moon&quot;.

Heinlein was also nominated for six Hugo Awards for the works &quot;Have Space Suit: Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Glory Road&quot;, &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Job: A Comedy of Justice&quot; and &quot;Grumbles from the Grave&quot;, as well as six Retro Hugo Awards for &quot;Magic, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot;, &quot;Coventry&quot;, &quot;Blowups Happen&quot;, &quot;Goldfish Bowl&quot;, and &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot;.

Heinlein won the Locus Award for &quot;All-Time Favorite Author&quot; in 1973, and for &quot;All-Time Best Author&quot; in 1988.

The Science Fiction Writers of America named Heinlein its first Grand Master in 1974, presented 1975. Officers and past presidents of the Association select a living writer for lifetime achievement (now annually and including fantasy literature).

In 1977, Heinlein was awarded the Inkpot Award, and in 1985, he was awarded the Eisner Awards &quot;Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award&quot;.

Main-belt asteroid 6312 Robheinlein (1990 RH4), discovered on September 14, 1990, by H. E. Holt at Palomar, was named after him.

In 1994 the International Astronomical Union named Heinlein crater on Mars in his honor.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Heinlein in 1998.

In 2001 the United States Naval Academy created the Robert A. Heinlein Chair in Aerospace Engineering.

Heinlein was the Ghost of Honor at the 2008 World Science Fiction Convention in Denver, Colorado, which held several panels on his works. Nearly seventy years earlier, he had been a Guest of Honor at the same convention.

In 2016, after an intensive online campaign to win a vote for the opening, Heinlein was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians. His bronze bust, created by Kansas City sculptor E. Spencer Schubert, is on permanent display in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City.

The Libertarian Futurist Society has honored eight of Heinlein&#x27;s novels and two short stories with their Hall of Fame award. The first two were given during his lifetime for &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. Five more were awarded posthumously for &quot;Red Planet&quot;, &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, and the short stories &quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot;.
