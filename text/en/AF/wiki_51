<doc id="26324" wikidata="Q272015" url="?curid=26324" title="Ranma ½">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It was serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from August 1987 to March 1996, with the chapters collected in 38 volumes by Shogakukan. The story revolves around a teenager named Ranma Saotome who has trained in martial arts since early childhood. As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when exposed to cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series Ranma seeks out a way to rid himself of his curse, while his friends, enemies, and many fiancées constantly hinder and interfere.

&quot;Ranma ½&quot; has a comedic formula and a sex-changing main character who often willfully transforms into a girl to advance his goals. The series also contains many other characters, whose intricate relationships with each other, unusual characteristics, and eccentric personalities drive most of the stories. Although the characters and their relationships are complicated, they rarely change once they are firmly introduced and settled into the series.

The manga has been adapted into two anime series produced by Studio Deen: &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and , which together were broadcast on Fuji TV from 1989 to 1992. In addition, they released 12 OVAs and three films. In 2011, a live-action television special was produced and aired on Nippon Television. Another anime adaptation produced by MAPPA premiered on October 6, 2024, broadcasting on Nippon Television and streaming on Netflix. The manga and anime series were licensed by Viz Media for English-language releases in North America. Madman Entertainment released the manga, part of the anime series, and the first two films in Australasia, while MVM Films released the first two films in the United Kingdom.

The &quot;Ranma ½&quot; manga has over 55 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. Both the manga and anime are cited as among the first in their respective media to have become popular in the United States.

==Plot==

On a training journey in the Bayankala Mountain Range in the Qinghai Province of China, Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fell into the cursed springs at . The cursed spring causes any afflicted to assume the physical form of whatever drowned there hundreds or thousands of years ago whenever they come into contact with cold water, which reverts on contact with hot water but resumes with exposure to cold water. Genma fell into the spring of a drowned panda while Ranma fell into the spring of a drowned girl.

Soun Tendo is a fellow practitioner of or &quot;Anything-Goes School&quot; of martial arts and owner of a dojo. Genma and Soun agreed years ago that their children would marry and carry on the Tendo Dojo. Soun has three teenage daughters: the polite and easygoing Kasumi, the greedy and indifferent Nabiki and the short-tempered, martial arts practicing Akane. Akane, who is Ranma&#x27;s age, is appointed for bridal duty by her sisters with the reasoning that they are the older sisters and can dump the duty on her, and that they all dislike the arranged engagement and think Akane&#x27;s dislike of men is the right way to express it to the fathers. At the appointed time, the Saotomes arrive in their new forms given by the cursed springs, confusing the Tendos, and ultimately leading to Akane seeing Ranma changing from girl form to boy form in the tub, much to her horror. It takes several more pages for the situation to be explained to Soun Tendo and his daughters. Both Ranma and Akane refuse the engagement initially, having not been consulted on the decision, but the fathers are insistent and they are generally treated as betrothed and end up helping or saving each other on some occasions. They are frequently found in each other&#x27;s company and are constantly arguing in their trademark awkward love-hate manner that is a franchise focus.

Ranma goes to school with Akane at , where he meets his recurring opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the conceited kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also falls in love with Ranma&#x27;s female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters eventually knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma&#x27;s regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately fell into the Spring of the Drowned Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he takes the form of a little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also fell into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Genma and Soun&#x27;s impish grand master, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.

Ranma&#x27;s prospective paramours include the martial arts rhythmic gymnastics champion (and Tatewaki&#x27;s sister) Kodachi Kuno, and his second fiancée and childhood friend Ukyo Kuonji the okonomiyaki vendor, along with the Chinese Amazon Shampoo, supported by her great-grandmother Cologne. As the series progresses, the school becomes more eccentric with the return of the demented, Hawaii-obsessed Principal Kuno and the placement of the power-leeching alternating child/adult Hinako Ninomiya as Ranma&#x27;s English teacher. Ranma&#x27;s indecision in choosing his true love causes chaos in his romantic and school life.

==Production==
Rumiko Takahashi stated that &quot;Ranma ½&quot; was conceived to be a martial arts manga that connects all aspects of everyday life to martial arts. Because her previous series had female protagonists, the author decided that she wanted a male this time. However, she was worried about writing a male main character, and therefore decided to make him half-female. According to Takahashi, the idea of making Ranma &quot;just kinda popped into [her] head&quot;, and she looked for a way to make it possible for him to go back and forth between genders. It was then when she had a vision of a bathhouse&#x27;s cloth entrance sign. She considered Ranma changing every time he was punched before deciding on water for initiating his changes. That decision led her to feeling that Jusenkyo had to be set in China, as it is the only place that could have such mysterious springs. She drew inspiration for &quot;Ranma ½&quot; from a variety of real-world objects. Some of the places frequently seen in the series are modeled after actual locations in Nerima, Tokyo (both the home of Takahashi and the setting of &quot;Ranma ½&quot;).

In a 1990 interview with &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, Takahashi stated that she had four assistants that draw the backgrounds, panel lines and tone, while she creates the story and layout, and pencils and inks the characters. All her assistants are female; Takahashi stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t use male assistants so that the girls will work more seriously if they aren&#x27;t worried about boys.&quot; In 1992, she explained her process as beginning with laying out the chapter in the evening so as to finish it by dawn, and resting for a day before calling her assistants. They finish it in two or three nights, usually utilizing five days for a chapter.

Takahashi purposefully aimed the series to be popular with women and children. In 1993, an &quot;Animerica&quot; interviewer talking with Takahashi asked her if she intended the sex-changing theme &quot;as an effort to enlighten a male-dominated society&quot;. Takahashi said that she does not think in terms of societal agendas and that she created the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; concept from simply wanting &quot;a simple, fun idea&quot;. She added that she, as a woman and while recalling what manga she liked to read as a child, felt that &quot;humans turning into animals might also be fun and ... you know, like a fairy tale.&quot; In 2013, she revealed that at the start of &quot;Ranma&quot; her editor told her to make it more dramatic, but she felt that was something she could not do. However, she admitted that drama did start to appear at the end. She also sat in on the voice actor auditions for the anime, where she insisted that male and female Ranma be voiced by different actors whose gender corresponded to that of the part.

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi, &quot;Ranma ½&quot; began publication in the manga anthology &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; issue #36 published on August 19, 1987, following the ending of her series &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. From August 1987 until March 1996, the manga was published on a near weekly basis with the occasional colored page to spruce up the usually black and white stories. After nearly a decade of storylines, the final chapter was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; issue #12 on March 6, 1996. The 407 chapters were periodically collected and published by Shogakukan into a total of 38 black and white volumes from 1988 to 1996. They were reassembled in 38 from April 2002 to October 2003. A &quot;Shōnen Sunday&quot; Special edition for all 20 volumes was published from 2016 to 2018. This edition included a series of interviews with Rumiko Takahashi called &quot;The Making of Ranma.&quot;

North American publisher Viz Media originally released &quot;Ranma ½&quot; in a monthly comic book format that contained two chapters each from 1992 to 2003, and had the images &quot;flipped&quot; to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored. These were periodically collected into graphic novels. On March 18, 2004, after releasing 21 volumes, Viz announced that it would reprint a number of its graphic novels. The content remained the same, but the novels moved to a smaller format with different covers and a price drop. Each volume covers roughly the same amount of material as the Japanese volumes, but retained its left-to-right format and had minor differences in grouping so that it spans 36 volumes rather than the original 38. The final volume was released in stores on November 14, 2006, thus making it Viz&#x27;s longest running manga, spanning over 13 years. At Anime Expo on July 7, 2013, Viz Media announced re-release of the manga in a format that combines two individual volumes into a single large one, and restores the original right-to-left reading order (a first in North America for this series). The first 2-in-1 book (volumes 1–2) was published on March 11, 2014; the final (volumes 35–36) on March 14, 2017. On July 27, 2021, Viz released all 19 2-in-1 books digitally. Madman Entertainment publishes the two-in-one version in Australasia.

Together with &quot;Spriggan&quot;, it was the first manga published in Portugal, by Texto Editora in 1995.

===First and second anime series===

An anime television series was created by Studio Deen and aired weekly between April 15, 1989, and September 16, 1989, on Fuji TV for 18 episodes, before being canceled due to low ratings. The series was then reworked by most of the same staff, retitled and launched in a different time slot, running for 143 episodes from October 20, 1989, to September 25, 1992. The anime stays true to the original manga but does differ by keeping Ranma&#x27;s gender transformation a secret from the high school students, at least throughout most of its length. It also does not introduce Hikaru Gosunkugi until very late in the series, instead, Sasuke Sarugakure, the diminutive ninja retainer of the Kuno family fills a number of Gosunkugi&#x27;s roles in early storylines but is a major character in his own right. The anime also alters the placement of many story arcs and contains numerous original episodes and characters not adapted from the manga.

Viz Media licensed both anime series in 1993, making &quot;Ranma ½&quot; one of the first anime titles licensed by Viz. The English dub produced for the series was recorded by The Ocean Group in Vancouver, British Columbia. They released the series on VHS from their own &quot;Viz Video&quot; label, and on DVD a few years later in association with Pioneer Home Entertainment. Their releases collected both anime series as one, separated episodes into what they call &quot;seasons&quot;, and changed the ordering of many of the episodes. Viz themselves re-released it on DVD in 2007 using their own DVD production company. At Otakon 2013, Viz announced that they re-acquired the TV series for Blu-ray and DVD release in 2014. The show is streamed on their anime channel service Neon Alley since Autumn 2013. In September 2020, Toonami co-creator Jason DeMarco revealed that he had previously tried to get &quot;Ranma ½&quot; aired on the American TV programming block, but &quot;it&#x27;s something we never were able to figure out, because, frankly, there&#x27;s too much nudity&quot;. Madman Entertainment licensed some of the series for release in Australasia, although their rights expired after releasing only the first four &quot;seasons&quot; as one series.

The original (1989–1992) anime adapts 56% of the manga, or 229 chapters, 22 volumes out of the 38.

===Films and original video animations===

Studio Deen also created three theatrical films; &quot;The Battle of Nekonron, China! A Battle to Defy the Rules!&quot; on November 2, 1991; &quot;Battle at Togenkyo! Get Back the Brides&quot; on August 1, 1992; and &quot;Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix&quot; on August 20, 1994. The first two films are feature length, but the third was originally shown in theaters with two other films: &quot;Ghost Sweeper Mikami&quot; and &quot;Heisei Dog Stories: Bow&quot;.

Following the ending of the TV series, 11 original video animations were released directly to home video, the earliest on December 7, 1993, and the eleventh on June 4, 1996. All but two are based on stories originally in the manga. Twelve years later, a &quot;Ranma&quot; animation was created for the &quot;It&#x27;s a Rumic World&quot; exhibition of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s artwork. Based on the &quot;Nightmare! Incense of Deep Sleep&quot; manga story from volume 34, it was shown on odd numbered days at the exhibition in Tokyo from July 30 to August 11, 2008. But it was not released until January 29, 2010, when it was put in a DVD box set with the &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot; specials that premiered at the same exhibit. It was then released on DVD and Blu-ray by itself on October 20, 2010. Viz Media also licensed all three films, and the original 11 OVAs for distribution in North America (however they released the third film as an OVA). MVM Films has released the first two films in the United Kingdom, while Madman Entertainment released them in Australasia.

===Third anime series===
A new anime adaptation was announced in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; on June 26, 2024. The new anime remake series, simply titled &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, is produced by MAPPA with Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions handling planning and production duties. The series was directed by Kōnosuke Uda, with Kimiko Ueno writing the series&#x27; scripts, Hiromi Taniguchi designing the characters, and Kaoru Wada composing the music. Most of the original Japanese voice cast for the main characters will reprise their roles. In contrast with the original animation, the remake will censor some Chinese communist symbolism. The first season aired from October 6 to December 22, 2024, on Nippon TV and its affiliates, with Netflix licensing it for streaming worldwide weekly after the Japanese broadcast. The opening theme is &quot;Iinazukekkyun&quot;, performed by , while the ending theme is &quot;Anta Nante&quot; performed by specifically for the anime. Viz Media and Hot Topic hosted the world premiere of the first episode on August 23 during Anime NYC. Earlier that same month, it was reported that the entire first season was leaked alongside many other Iyuno localization company works.

A second season was announced after the 12th episode aired.

====Episodes====
===Video games===

There have been seventeen video games based on the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; franchise. While most are fighting games, there have been several RPGs, puzzle games, and Pachinko slot machines. The most recent game is &quot;Pachislot Ranma 1/2&quot;, released on November 5, 2018, for &quot;Pachinko&quot;. Only two have been released in Western countries. &quot;Ranma ½: Chōnai Gekitōhen&quot; was released in the US as &quot;Street Combat&quot;; the characters were Americanized, having their appearances completely changed, and the music was changed as well. However, &quot;Ranma ½: Hard Battle&quot; was released in both North America and Europe unaltered.

===Live-action special===

A live action television adaption of &quot;Ranma ½&quot; aired on Nippon Television, in a two-hour time-slot, on December 9, 2011. Although it was initially reported that the special would contain an original story, the film does take its main plot from one of the manga&#x27;s early stories with several other early scenes mixed in. The special stars Yui Aragaki as Akane, with Kento Kaku and Natsuna Watanabe playing male and female Ranma respectively. Ryōsei Tayama is cast as the antagonist, the new original character Okamada. The all-girl pop group 9nine contribute &quot;Chikutaku☆2Nite&quot; as the theme song. It was released on both DVD and Blu-ray on March 21, 2012.

===Other media===
&quot;The Ranma ½ Memorial Book&quot; was published just as the manga ended in 1996. Acting as an end-cap to the series, it collects various illustrations from the series, features an interview with Takahashi, and includes tidbits about Ranma: summaries of his battles, his daily schedule, trivia, and a few exclusive illustrations. 
A &quot;Movie + OVA Visual Comic&quot; was released to illustrate the theatrical film &quot;Super Indiscriminate Decisive Battle! Team Ranma vs. the Legendary Phoenix&quot; and the OVA episodes &quot;The One to Carry On&quot; (both parts). It also included information on the voice actors, character designs, and a layout of the Tendo dojo.

Additionally, guidebooks were released for three of the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; video games; these included not only strategies, but also interviews. Two books including interviews with the cast of the live-action TV drama, and some select stories, were released in 2011.

The music from the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; TV series, films and OVAs have been released on various CDs. Four from the TV series, two from the first film, one from the second, one from the third film and OVAs, and three compiling the music by DoCo used in the OVAs. DoCo is a pop group composed of the anime&#x27;s main female characters&#x27; voice actresses. Several compilation albums were also released, some composed of the opening and closing theme songs and others of image songs. Many of the image songs were first released as singles.

==Reception==

By November 2006, it was reported that &quot;Ranma ½&quot; had sold over 49 million manga volumes in Japan. Shogakukan has printed 53 million copies as of November 2011, and by April 2021 it had 55 million copies in circulation.

The &quot;Ranma ½&quot; anime was ranked number 17 on &quot;Anime Insider&quot;″s 2001 list of the Top 50 Anime, although the list was limited to series that were released in North America. It ranked 36th on TV Asahi&#x27;s 2006 list of Japan&#x27;s 100 favorite animated TV series, which is based on an online poll of the Japanese people, up from the previous year&#x27;s list where it ranked 45th. In November 2006, the New York Comic Con announced that it would host the first-ever American Anime Awards. Fans had the chance to vote for their favorite anime online during the month of January 2007. Only the five nominees receiving the most votes for each category were announced on February 5. Among the 12 different categories, &quot;Ranma ½&quot; was voted into the &quot;Best Comedy Anime&quot; category, and the &quot;Ranma ½&quot; OVAs were voted into the &quot;Best Short Series&quot; category. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and &quot;Ranma ½ Nettōhen&quot; named Takahashi&#x27;s second best-animated work. Shampoo and Ranma were voted fourth and fifth place respectively in her characters category.

Although Lum from Takahashi&#x27;s first series &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; is often cited as the first character in anime and manga, Theron Martin of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; stated that &quot;Ranma ½&quot;″s Akane Tendo is closer to how they would later typically be portrayed in the 2000s. He also suggested that one could argue &quot;Ranma&quot; is an early example of a harem or reverse harem series, due to the main character attracting suitors in both genders. The series&#x27;s publication in North America proved highly successful as well, being many Americans&#x27; first introduction to manga and its anime adaptation one of the first Japanese animation shows to achieve popularity in the US. In an overview of the series, Jason Thompson called &quot;Ranma ½&quot; &quot;the direct ancestor of all comedy-action manga, like &quot;Sumomomo Momomo&quot; and &quot;History&#x27;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi&quot;&quot;, although noted that it was not the first, but only spanned the period when manga and anime sales were at their height. Relating it to Takahashi&#x27;s other works, he summed the series up as &quot;At the start, the fighting is minimal and it&#x27;s almost a semi-serious relationship comedy, like &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;; then it turns completely ridiculous; and by the climax, when Ranma fights the evil bird-people of Phoenix Mountain in an excessively long and un-funny fight scene, it&#x27;s like a warmup for &quot;Inuyasha&quot;.&quot; Reviewing the final volume of the manga, &quot;Anime News Network&quot; remarked that &quot;Every dimension of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s storytelling skills come into play here: comedy, romance and introspection, and of course, high-flying fantasy martial-arts action.&quot; However, they felt some of the action scenes were hard to follow and noted that the mirroring to left-to-right format caused errors with the art.

In their review of Viz Media&#x27;s season five DVD box set, &quot;Anime News Network&quot; praised the Japanese cast&#x27;s performance and the animation, but criticized the English version&#x27;s slight script changes and minor voice actors while praising its main cast. They also remarked that while &quot;Ranma ½&quot; is a classic, after a hundred episodes, the same jokes are just not funny anymore. &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot;&#x27; Raphael See called the television series and the OVAs &quot;one of the funniest things [he&#x27;s] ever seen, anime or otherwise&quot; and also praised the English dub as some of the best. However, he was much more critical of the first two films particularly for both using the same damsel in distress plot. Mike Toole of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; included &quot;Big Trouble in Nekronon, China&quot; at number 83 on The Other 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time, a list of &quot;lesser-known, lesser-loved classics&quot;, calling it &quot;a solid action-comedy and a good, well-rounded example of the appeal of &quot;Ranma ½&quot;&quot;.

==Legacy==
Hiroshi Aro admitted that he created &quot;Futaba-kun Change!&quot; based on &quot;Ranma ½&quot;. Western comic book artists who have cited &quot;Ranma ½&quot; as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley on his series &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; and American Colleen Coover on her erotic series &quot;Small Favors&quot;.

Film director Makoto Shinkai mentioned that &quot;Ranma ½&quot; served as an inspiration for the 2016 animation film &quot;Your Name&quot;. Matt Bozon, creator of the &quot;Shantae&quot; video game series, cited &quot;Ranma ½&quot; as a big influence on his work. The title of the fourth game, &quot;&quot;, is also a tribute to the series.

<text>The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The professional head of the RAN is Chief of Navy (CN) Vice Admiral Mark Hammond. The Chief of Navy is also jointly responsible to the Minister for Defence (MINDEF) and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). The Department of Defence, which is a part of the Australian Public Service, administers the ADF, and ergo, the Royal Australian Navy. In 2023, the Surface Fleet Review was introduced to outline the future of the Navy.

The navy was formed in 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Forces (CNF) through the amalgamation of the colonial navies of Australia following the federation of Australia. Although it was originally intended for local defence, it became increasingly responsible for regional defence as the British Empire started to diminish its influence in the South Pacific.

The Royal Australian Navy was initially a green-water navy, as the Royal Navy provided a blue-water force to the Australian Squadron, which the Australian and New Zealand governments helped to fund; the squadron was assigned to the Australia Station. This period lasted until 1913, when naval ships purchased from Britain arrived, although the British Admiralty continued to provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and Indian Oceans up to the early years of the Second World War.

During its history, the Royal Australian Navy has participated in a number of major wars, including the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation and the Vietnam War. As of 2024, the RAN consists of over 52 commissioned vessels, 11 non-commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel. The navy is one of the largest and most sophisticated naval forces in the South Pacific region, with a significant presence in the Indian Ocean and worldwide operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The Commonwealth Naval Forces were established on 1 March 1901, with the amalgamation of the six separate colonial naval forces, following the Federation of Australia. The Royal Australian Navy initially consisted of the former New South Wales, Victorian, Queensland, Western Australian, South Australian and Tasmanian ships and resources of their disbanded navies.

The &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; established the operation and command structure of the Royal Australian Navy. When policymakers sought to determine the newly established force&#x27;s requirements and purpose, there were arguments about whether Australia&#x27;s naval force would be structured mainly for local defence or designed to serve as a fleet unit within a larger imperial force, controlled centrally by the British Admiralty. In 1908–09, a compromise solution was pursued, with the Australian government agreeing to establish a force for local defence but that would be capable of forming a fleet unit within the Royal Navy, albeit without central control. As a result, the navy&#x27;s force structure was set at &quot;one battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers and three submarines&quot;. The first of the RAN&#x27;s new vessels, the destroyer HMAS Yarra, was completed in September 1910, and by the outbreak of the First World War the majority of the planned fleet had been realised. On 10 July 1911, the CNF was granted &quot;Royal&quot; status by King George V.

=== World War I ===

==== Pacific ====
Following the British Empire&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany, the British War Office tasked the capture of German New Guinea to the Australian Government. This was to deprive the Imperial German Navy&#x27;s East Asia Squadron of regional intelligence by removing their access to wireless stations. On 11 August, three destroyers and HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; prepared to engage the squadron at German Anchorages in New Guinea, which did not eventuate as the vessels were not present. Landing parties were placed on Rabaul and Herbertshohe to destroy its German wireless station; however, the objective was found to be further inland and an expeditionary force was required. Meanwhile, HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; was tasked with scouring the Pacific Ocean for the German squadron.

The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (ANMEF) began recruiting on the same day that the taskforce arrived in New Britain, and consisted of two battalions: one of 1,000 men, and the other with 500 serving and former seamen. On 19 August, the ANMEF departed Sydney for training in Townsville before the rendezvous with other RAN vessels in Port Moresby. On 29 August, four cruisers and HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; assisted New Zealand&#x27;s Samoa Expeditionary Force in landing at Apia, and committing a bloodless takeover of German Samoa. Additionally, the RAN captured German merchant vessels, disrupting German merchant shipping in the Pacific. On 7 September, the ANMEF, now including HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;, three destroyers, and two each of cruisers and submarines, departed for Rabaul.

A few days later, on 9 September, HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; landed a party to destroy the island&#x27;s wireless station, though the German administration promptly surrendered. Between 11 and 12 September, landings were put ashore at Kabakaul, Rabaul and Herbertshohe; it was during this period that the first Australian casualties and deaths of the war occurred. On 14 September, HMAS &quot;Encounter&quot; barraged an enemy position at Toma with shells; it was the first time the RAN had fired upon an enemy and had shelled an inland location. On 17 September, German New Guinea surrendered to the encroaching ANMEF, with the overall campaign a success and exceeded the objectives set by the War Office. However, the RAN submarine HMAS &quot;AE1&quot; became the first ever vessel of the new navy to be sunk. The Australian Squadron was placed under control of the British Admiralty, and was moreover tasked with protecting Australian shipping.

On 1 November, the RAN escorted the First Australian Imperial Force convoy from Albany, WA and set for the Khedivate of Egypt, which was soon to become the Sultanate of Egypt. On 9 November, HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; began hunting for SMS &quot;Emden&quot;, a troublesome German coastal raider. The SMS &quot;Emden&quot; and HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; met in the Battle of Cocos, the &quot;Emden&quot; was destroyed in Australia&#x27;s first naval victory. Following the almost complete destruction of the East Asia Squadron in the Battle of the Falklands by the Royal Navy, the RAN became able to be reassigned to other naval theatres of the war.

==== Atlantic and Mediterranean ====
On 28 February 1915, the Royal Australian Naval Bridging Train (RANBT) was formed with members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve who could not find billets in the RAN. Following the entrance of the Ottoman Empire in alliance with the Central Powers, HMAS &quot;AE2&quot; was committed to the initial naval operation of the Gallipoli campaign. After the failure of the naval strategy, an amphibious assault was planned to enable the Allies&#x27; warships to pass through the Dardanelles and capture Constantinople. The RANBT was sent ashore, along with the invasion, for engineering duties.

Later in the war, most of the RAN&#x27;s major ships operated as part of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean and North Seas, and then later in the Adriatic, and then the Black Sea following the surrender of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Interwar years ===
In 1919, the RAN received a force of six destroyers, three sloops and six submarines from the Royal Navy, but throughout the 1920s and early 1930s, the RAN was drastically reduced in size due to a variety of factors including political apathy and economic hardship as a result of the Great Depression. In this time the focus of Australia&#x27;s naval policy shifted from defence against invasion to trade protection, and several fleet units were sunk as targets or scrapped. By 1923, the size of the navy had fallen to eight vessels, and by the end of the decade it had fallen further to five, with just 3,500 personnel. In the late 1930s, as international tensions increased, the RAN was modernised and expanded, with the service receiving primacy of funding over the Army and Air Force during this time as Australia began to prepare for war.

=== World War II ===
Early in the Second World War, RAN ships again operated as part of Royal Navy formations, many serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and off the West African coast. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the virtual destruction of Allied naval forces in Southeast Asia, the RAN operated more independently, defending against Axis naval activity in Australian waters, or participating in United States Navy offensives. As the navy took on an even greater role, it was expanded significantly and at its height the RAN was the fourth-largest navy in the world, with 39,650 personnel operating 337 warships, but no active submarines. A total of 34 vessels were lost during the war, including three cruisers and four destroyers.

=== Post war to present ===

After the Second World War, the size of the RAN was again reduced, but it gained new capabilities with the acquisition of two aircraft carriers, &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Melbourne&quot;. The RAN saw action in many Cold War–era conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region and operated alongside the Royal Navy and United States Navy off Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Since the end of the Cold War, the RAN has been part of Coalition forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, operating in support of Operation Slipper and undertaking counter piracy operations. It was also deployed in support of Australian peacekeeping operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.

The high demand for personnel in the Second World War led to the establishment of the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) branch in 1942, where over 3,000 women served in shore-based positions. The WRANS was disbanded in 1947, but then re-established in 1951 during the Cold War. It was given permanent status in 1959, and the RAN was the final branch to integrate women in the Australian military in 1985.

==Structure==

===Command structure===
The strategic command structure of the RAN was overhauled during the New Generation Navy changes. The RAN is commanded through Naval Headquarters (NHQ) in Canberra. NHQ is responsible for implementing policy decisions handed down from the Department of Defence and for overseeing tactical and operational issues that are the purview of the subordinate commands.

Beneath NHQ are two subordinate commands:
* Fleet Command: fleet command is led by Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSFLT). COMAUSFLT holds the rank of rear admiral; previously, this post was Flag Officer Commanding HM&#x27;s Australian Fleet (FOCAF), created in 1911, but the title was changed in 1988 to the Maritime Commander Australia. On 1 February 2007, the title changed again, becoming Commander Australian Fleet. The nominated at-sea commander is Commodore Warfare (COMWAR), a one-star deployable task group commander. Fleet command has responsibility to CN for the full command of assigned assets, and to Joint Operations command for the provision of operationally ready forces.
* Navy Strategic Command: the administrative element overseeing the RAN&#x27;s training, engineering and logistical support needs. Instituted in 2000, the Systems Commander was appointed at the rank of commodore; in June 2008, the position was upgraded to the rank of rear admiral.

Fleet Command was previously made up of seven Force Element Groups, but after the New Generation Navy changes, this was restructured into four Force Commands:
* Fleet Air Arm (previously known as the Australian Navy Aviation Group), responsible for the navy&#x27;s aviation assets and capability. As of 2018, the FAA consists of two front line helicopter squadrons (one focused on anti-submarine and anti-shipping warfare and the other a transport unit), two training squadrons and a trials squadron.
* Mine Warfare, Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Forces, an amalgamation of the previous Patrol Boat, Hydrographic, and Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Forces, operating what are collectively termed the RAN&#x27;s &quot;minor war vessels&quot;
* Submarine Force, (Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service) operating the s
* Surface Force, covering the RAN&#x27;s surface combatants (generally ships of frigate size or larger)

===Fleet===
The Royal Australian Navy consists of over 50 commissioned vessels and over 16,000 personnel. Ships commissioned into the RAN are given the prefix HMAS (His/Her Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ship).

The RAN has two primary bases for its fleet: the first, Fleet Base East, is located at , Sydney and the second, Fleet Base West, is located at , near Perth. In addition, three other bases are home to the majority of the RAN&#x27;s minor war vessels: , in Cairns, , in Darwin, and , in Sydney.

===Clearance Diving Branch===
The Clearance Diving Branch is composed of two &quot;Clearance Diving Teams&quot; (CDT) that serve as parent units for naval clearance divers:
* Clearance Diving Team 1 (AUSCDT ONE), based at HMAS &quot;Waterhen&quot; in New South Wales; and
* Clearance Diving Team 4 (AUSCDT FOUR), based at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot; in Western Australia.

When clearance divers are sent into combat, Clearance Diving Team Three (AUSCDT THREE) is formed.

The CDTs have two primary roles:
* Mine counter-measures (MCM) and explosive ordnance disposal (EOD); and
* Maritime tactical operations.

==Personnel==
As of June 2023, the RAN has 14,745 permanent full-time personnel, 172 gap-year personnel, and 4,607 reserve personnel. The permanent full-time trained force consists of 3,070 commissioned officers, and 9,695 enlisted personnel. Male personnel made up 75.9% of the permanent full-time force, while female personnel made up 24%. The RAN has the second-highest percentage of women in the permanent forces, compared to the RAAF&#x27;s 26.6% and the Army&#x27;s 15.3%. Throughout the 2022-23 financial year 1,141 enlisted in the RAN on a permanent basis while 1,354 left, representing a net loss of 213 personnel.               

The following are some of the current senior Royal Australian Navy officers:
* Vice Admiral David Johnston – Vice Chief of the Defence Force
* Vice Admiral Mark Hammond – Chief of Navy
*Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead – Chief Nuclear-Powered Submarine Taskforce
* Rear Admiral Jonathan Earley – Deputy Chief of Navy
* Rear Admiral Christopher Smith – Commander Australian Fleet
*Rear Admiral Matthew Buckley – Head Nuclear-Powered Submarine Capability
* Rear Admiral Stephen Hughes – Head Navy Capability
* Rear Admiral Rachel Durbin – Head Navy Engineering
* Rear Admiral David Greaves – Director-General Australian Navy Cadets
* Warrant Officer Andrew Bertoncin – Warrant Officer of the Navy

==Ranks and uniforms==

===Commissioned Officers===
Commissioned officers of the Australian Navy have pay grades ranging from S-1 to O-10. The highest rank achievable in the current Royal Australian Navy structure is O-10, an admiral who serves as the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) when the position is held by a Naval Officer. The navy has a O-11 position Admiral of the Fleet that is honorary and is currently held by Charles III, King of Australia.

O-8 (rear admiral) to O-11 (admiral of the fleet) are referred to as flag officers, O-5 (commander) and above are referred to as senior officers, while S-1 (midshipman) to O-4 (lieutenant commander) are referred to as junior officers. All RAN Officers are issued a commission by the Governor-General as Commander-in-Chief on behalf of His Majesty King Charles III.

Naval officers are trained at the Royal Australian Naval College (HMAS &quot;Creswell&quot;) in Jervis Bay as well as the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.

===Sailors===
=== Rate Insignia ===
Royal Australian Navy Other Ranks wear &quot;right arm rates&quot; insignia, called &quot;Category Insignia&quot; to indicate specialty training qualifications. This is a holdover from the Royal Navy.

====Special insignia====
The Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N) is an appointment held by the most senior sailor in the RAN and holds the rank of warrant officer (WO). However, the WO-N does not wear the WO rank insignia; instead, they wear the special insignia of the appointment. The WO-N appointment has similar equivalent appointments in the other services, each holding the rank of warrant officer, each being the most senior sailor/soldier/airman in that service, and each wearing their own special insignia rather than their rank insignia. The Australian Army equivalent is the Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) and the Royal Australian Air Force equivalent is the Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF-AF).

==== Chaplains and Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officers ====
Chaplains in the Royal Australian Navy are commissioned officers who complete the same training as other officers in the RAN at the Royal Australian Naval College, HMAS Creswell. From July 2020, Maritime Spiritual Wellbeing Officers (MSWOs) were introduced to the Navy Chaplaincy Branch, designed to give Navy people and their families with professional, non-religious pastoral care and spiritual support.

In the Royal Australian Navy, Chaplains and MSWOs are commissioned officers without rank. For reasons of protocol, ceremonial occasions and for saluting purposes, they are, where appropriate, normally grouped with Commanders (O-5). The more senior Division 4 Senior Chaplains are grouped with Captains (O-6) and Division 5 Principal Chaplains are grouped with Commodores (O-7), but their rank slide remains the same. Principal Chaplains and MSWOs, however, have gold braid on the peak of their white service cap.

From January 2021, MSWOs and all chaplains wear the branch&#x27;s new non-faith-specific rank insignia of a fouled anchor overlaying a compass rose, which represents a united team front, encompassing all faiths and purpose. Chaplains and MSWOs have insignia that reflect their religion on collar mounted patches (Cross for Christian, Crescent for Muslim etc, Compass rose for MSWOs.)

== Ships and equipment ==

=== Current ships ===

The RAN currently operates 27 commissioned vessels, made up of nine ship classes and three individual ships, plus 11 non-commissioned vessels. In addition, DMS Maritime operates a large number of civilian-crewed vessels under contract to the Australian Defence Force.
=== Fleet Air Arm ===

=== Small arms ===
RAN personnel utilise the following small arms:
* EF88 Austeyr
* F89A1 Minimi
*Browning Hi-Power
*870P Shotgun
*M2HB-QCB
*M4A1 carbine
*MAG 58

=== Future ===

There are currently several major projects underway that will see upgrades to RAN capabilities.

*&quot;Project SEA 1180 Phase 1&quot; is building six s based on the Lürssen OPV80 design, to replace &quot;Armidale&quot;-class patrol boats. Construction started in November 2018, with the first vessel, HMAS &quot;Arafura&quot; to enter service in 2022.
*&quot;Project SEA 1905&quot; is the acquisition of a further two &quot;Arafura&quot;-class offshore patrol vessels in a mine counter-measures configuration.
* &quot;Project SEA 1654 Phase 3&quot; acquired two replenishment ships based on the Spanish &quot;Cantabria&quot;-class oiler. HMAS &quot;Supply&quot; was launched in November 2018 and replaced , while the second, HMAS &quot;Stalwart&quot; replaced HMAS &quot;Sirius&quot;.
*&quot;Project SEA 1445 Phase 1&quot; is the acquisition of ten Evolved patrol boats to be built by Austal in Henderson. The RAN decided to acquire the Evolved boats instead of extending the life of six patrol boats as it transitions to the new offshore patrol vessel.
*&quot;Project SEA 3000&quot; is the General Purpose Frigate program aimed to replace the &quot;Anzac-&quot;class frigates in the Tier 2 role.
*&quot;Project SEA 4000 Phase 6&quot; will upgrade the existing three &quot;Hobart-class&quot; destroyers with Aegis Baseline 9 combat system.
*&quot;Project SEA 5000 Phase 1&quot; is acquiring six s based on the British Type 26 Global Combat Ship, to replace the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates in the Tier 1 ASW role from 2034. The vessels will be built in Adelaide by BAE Systems, with the first three to be named HMA Ships &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Flinders&quot; and &quot;Tasman&quot;.
*&quot;Surface Fleet Review&quot; announced the acquisition of six &quot;Large Optionally Crewed Surface Vessels (LOSVs)&quot; which will be constructed in partnership with the United States Navy.

==== Submarines ====
*&quot;Project SEA 1429 Phase 2&quot; is upgrading the s with the Mk48 Mod 7 CBASS torpedo. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in May 2008 with Final Operational Capability (FOC) due in December 2018, 60 months late.
*&quot;Project SEA 1439 Phase 3&quot; is upgrading the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarine platform systems to improve &#x27;reliability, sustainability, safety and capability&#x27;. IOC was achieved in October 2007, FOC is due in September 2022.
*&quot;Project SEA 1439 Phase 4A&quot; is replacing the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines&#x27; combat system with the AN/BYG-1(V)8 developed in conjunction with the US Navy IOC Expected to achieve Final Operating Capability in December 2018. IOC was in May 2008 with FOC planned for December 2018.
* &quot;Project SEA 1450&quot;: In September 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines will receive a Life of Type Extension (LOTE) from 2026 that will cost up to A$6.4 billion.
* SSN-AUKUS: In March 2023, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that Australia will build nuclear-powered SSN-AUKUS class submarines. The UK Submersible Ship Nuclear Replacement (SSNR) design was renamed SSN-AUKUS in March 2023, under the AUKUS trilateral security partnership, when Australia joined the project and additional US technology was incorporated into the design. The construction of the first boat is to begin by the end of the 2030s with the boat delivered in the early 2040s. Five boats are planned to be built.
* : In March 2023, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that Australia intends to purchase three nuclear-powered &quot;Virginia&quot; class submarines from the US, subject to congressional approval, to ensure there is no capability gap as the RAN transitions to the SSN-AUKUS. The first boat is planned to be delivered in 2033. If there are delays with the SSN-AUKUS class program, Australia has the option of purchasing up to two additional &quot;Virginia&quot; class boats.
* East coast base: In March 2022, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that a &quot;new submarine base will be built on the east coast of Australia&quot; and &quot;three preferred locations on the east coast have been identified, being Brisbane, Newcastle, and Port Kembla&quot;.

<text>The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is the principal aerial warfare force of Australia, a part of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) along with the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Army. Constitutionally the Governor-General of Australia is the de jure Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Defence Force. The Royal Australian Air Force is commanded by the Chief of Air Force (CAF), who is subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). The CAF is also directly responsible to the Minister for Defence, with the Department of Defence administering the ADF and the Air Force.

Formed in March 1921, as the Australian Air Force, through the separation of the Australian Air Corps from the Army in January 1920, which in turn amalgamated the separate aerial services of both the Army and Navy. It directly continues the traditions of the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), the aviation corps of the Army that fought in the First World War and that was formed on 22 October 1912.

During its history, the Royal Australian Air Force has fought in a number of major wars, including the Second World War in Europe and the Pacific, participated in the Berlin Airlift, Korean War, Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation, Vietnam War, and more recently, operations in East Timor, the Iraq War and subsequent intervention, and the War in Afghanistan.

The RAAF operates the majority of the ADF&#x27;s fixed wing aircraft, although both the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy also operate aircraft in various roles. The RAAF provides support across a spectrum of operations such as air superiority, precision strikes, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, air mobility, space surveillance, and humanitarian support. The RAAF has 252 aircraft, of which 108 are combat aircraft.

==History==
===Formation===
The RAAF traces its history back to the 1911 Imperial Conference that was held in London, where it was decided aviation should be developed within the armed forces of the British Empire. Australia implemented this decision, the first dominion to do so, by approving the establishment of the &quot;Australian Aviation Corps&quot;. This initially consisted of the Central Flying School at Point Cook, Victoria, opening on 22 October 1912. By 1914 the corps was known as the &quot;Australian Flying Corps&quot;.

===First World War===

Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914, the Australian Flying Corps sent aircraft to assist in capturing German colonies in what is now north-east New Guinea. However, these colonies surrendered quickly, before the planes were even unpacked. The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in providing air support during the Mesopotamian Campaign against the Ottoman Empire, in what is now Iraq.

The corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of the First World War. By the end of the war, four squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4—had seen operational service, while another four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8—had also been established. A total of 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC, whilst another 200 men served as aircrew in the British flying services. Casualties included 175 dead, 111 wounded, 6 gassed and 40 captured.

===Inter-war period===
The Australian Flying Corps remained part of the Australian Army until 1919, when it was disbanded along with the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Although the Central Flying School continued to operate at Point Cook, military flying virtually ceased until 1920, when the interim Australian Air Corps (AAC), with a wing each for the Army and the Navy, was formed as a unit of the Army. The AAC was succeeded by the Australian Air Force which was formed on 31 March 1921. King George V approved the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in May 1921 and became effective on 13 August 1921. The RAAF then became the second Royal air arm to be formed in the British Commonwealth, following the British Royal Air Force. When formed the RAAF had more aircraft than personnel, with 21 officers and 128 other ranks and 153 aircraft.

As British aircraft manufacturers at the time were unable to meet Australian requirements, in addition to British production demands, the Australian government established the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1936 and purchased some American aircraft.

===Second World War===
====Europe and the Mediterranean====
In September 1939, the Australian Air Board directly controlled the Air Force via RAAF Station Laverton, RAAF Station Richmond, RAAF Station Pearce, No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF at Point Cook, RAAF Station Rathmines and five smaller units.

In 1939, just after the outbreak of the Second World War, Australia joined the Empire Air Training Scheme, under which flight crews received basic training in Australia before travelling to Canada for advanced training. A total of 17 RAAF bomber, fighter, reconnaissance and other squadrons served initially in Britain and with the Desert Air Force located in North Africa and the Mediterranean. Thousands of Australians also served with other Commonwealth air forces in Europe during the Second World War. About nine percent of the personnel who served under British RAF commands in Europe and the Mediterranean were RAAF personnel.

With British manufacturing targeted by the German Luftwaffe, in 1941 the Australian government created the Department of Aircraft Production (DAP; later known as the Government Aircraft Factories) to supply Commonwealth air forces, and the RAAF was eventually provided with large numbers of locally built versions of British designs such as the DAP Beaufort torpedo bomber, Beaufighters and Mosquitos, as well as other types such as Wirraways, Boomerangs, and Mustangs.

In the European theatre of the war, RAAF personnel were especially notable in RAF Bomber Command: although they represented just two percent of all Australian enlistments during the war, they accounted for almost twenty percent of those killed in action. This statistic is further illustrated by the fact that No. 460 Squadron RAAF, mostly flying Avro Lancasters, had an official establishment of about 200 aircrew and yet had 1,018 combat deaths. The squadron was therefore effectively wiped out five times over. Total RAAF casualties in Europe were 5,488 killed or missing.

====Pacific War====
The beginning of the Pacific War—and the rapid advance of Japanese forces—threatened the Australian mainland for the first time in its history. The RAAF was quite unprepared for the emergency, and initially had negligible forces available for service in the Pacific. In 1941 and early 1942, many RAAF airmen, including Nos. 1, 8, 21 and 453 Squadrons, saw action with the RAF Far East Command in the Malayan, Singapore and Dutch East Indies campaigns. Equipped with aircraft such as the Brewster Buffalo, and Lockheed Hudsons, the Australian squadrons suffered heavily against Japanese Zeros.

During the fighting for Rabaul in early 1942, No. 24 Squadron RAAF fought a brief, but ultimately futile defence as the Japanese advanced south towards Australia. The devastating air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942 increased concerns about the direct threat facing Australia. In response, some RAAF squadrons were transferred from the northern hemisphere—although a substantial number remained there until the end of the war. Shortages of fighter and ground attack planes led to the acquisition of US-built Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks and the rapid design and manufacture of the first Australian fighter, the CAC Boomerang. RAAF Kittyhawks came to play a crucial role in the New Guinea and Solomon Islands campaigns, especially in operations like the Battle of Milne Bay. As a response to a possible Japanese chemical warfare threat the RAAF imported hundreds of thousands of chemical weapons into Australia.

In the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, imported Bristol Beaufighters proved to be highly effective ground attack and maritime strike aircraft. Beaufighters were later made locally by the DAP from 1944. Although it was much bigger than Japanese fighters, the Beaufighter had the speed to outrun them. The RAAF operated a number of Consolidated PBY Catalina as long-range bombers and scouts. The RAAF&#x27;s heavy bomber force was predominantly made up of 287 B-24 Liberators, equipping seven squadrons, which could bomb Japanese targets as far away as Borneo and the Philippines from airfields in Australia and New Guinea. By late 1945, the RAAF had received or ordered about 500 P-51 Mustangs, for fighter/ground attack purposes. The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation initially assembled US-made Mustangs, but later manufactured most of those used.

By mid-1945, the RAAF&#x27;s main operational formation in the Pacific, the First Tactical Air Force (1st TAF), consisted of over 21,000 personnel, while the RAAF as a whole consisted of about 50 squadrons and 6,000 aircraft, of which over 3,000 were operational. The 1st TAF&#x27;s final campaigns were fought in support of Australian ground forces in Borneo, but had the war continued some of its personnel and equipment would likely have been allocated to the invasion of the Japanese mainland, along with some of the RAAF bomber squadrons in Europe, which were to be grouped together with British and Canadian squadrons as part of the proposed Tiger Force. However, the war was brought to a sudden end by the US nuclear attacks on Japan. The RAAF&#x27;s casualties in the Pacific were around 2,000 killed, wounded or captured.

By the time the war ended, a total of 216,900 men and women served in the RAAF, of whom 10,562 were killed in action; a total of 76 squadrons were formed. With over 152,000 personnel operating nearly 6,000 aircraft it was the world&#x27;s fourth-largest air force.

===Cold War===

==== Postwar ====

During the Berlin Airlift, in 1948–49, the RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift aided the international effort to fly in supplies to the stricken city; two RAF Avro York aircraft were also crewed by RAAF personnel. Although a small part of the operation, the RAAF contribution was significant, flying 2,062 sorties and carrying 7,030 tons of freight and 6,964 passengers.

In the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, North American Mustangs from No. 77 Squadron RAAF, stationed in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, were among the first United Nations aircraft to be deployed, in ground support, combat air patrol, and escort missions. When the UN planes were confronted by North Korean Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters, 77 Sqn acquired Gloster Meteors, however the MiGs remained superior and the Meteors were relegated to ground support missions as the North Koreans gained experience. The air force also operated transport aircraft during the conflict. No. 77 Squadron flew 18,872 sorties, claiming the destruction of 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, 16 bridges, 98 railway carriages and an unknown number of enemy personnel. Three MiG-15s were confirmed destroyed, and two others probably destroyed. RAAF casualties included 41 killed and seven captured; 66 aircraft – 22 Mustangs and 44 Meteors – were lost.

In July 1952, No. 78 Wing RAAF was deployed to Malta in the Mediterranean where it formed part of a British force which sought to counter the Soviet Union&#x27;s influence in the Middle East as part of Australia&#x27;s Cold War commitments. Consisting of No. 75 and 76 Squadrons equipped with de Havilland Vampire jet fighters, the wing provided an air garrison for the island for the next two and half years, returning to Australia in late 1954.

In 1953, a Royal Air Force officer, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman, was brought out to Australia to become Chief of the Air Staff. He reorganised the RAAF into three commands: Home Command, Maintenance Command, and Training Command. Five years later, Home Command was renamed Operational Command, and Training Command and Maintenance Command were amalgamated to form Support Command.

==== South East Asia operations ====

In the Malayan Emergency, from 1950 to 1960, six Avro Lincolns from No. 1 Squadron RAAF and a flight of Douglas Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron RAAF took part in operations against the communist guerrillas (labelled as &quot;Communist Terrorists&quot; by the British authorities) as part of the RAF Far East Air Force. The Dakotas were used on cargo runs, in troop movement and in paratrooper and leaflet drops within Malaya. The Lincolns, operating from bases in Singapore and from Kuala Lumpur, formed the backbone of the air war against the CTs, conducting bombing missions against their jungle bases. Although results were often difficult to assess, they allowed the government to harass CT forces, attack their base camps when identified and keep them on the move. Later, in 1958, Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF were deployed to Malaya and took part in bombing missions against the CTs.

During the Vietnam War, from 1964 to 1972, the RAAF contributed Caribou STOL transport aircraft as part of the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam, later redesignated No. 35 Squadron RAAF, UH-1 Iroquois helicopters from No. 9 Squadron RAAF, and English Electric Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF. The Canberras flew 11,963 bombing sorties, and two aircraft were lost. One went missing during a bombing raid. The wreckage of the aircraft was recovered in April 2009, and the remains of the crew were found in late July 2009. The other was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, although both crew were rescued. They dropped 76,389 bombs and were credited with 786 enemy personnel confirmed killed and a further 3,390 estimated killed, 8,637 structures, 15,568 bunkers, 1,267 sampans and 74 bridges destroyed. RAAF transport aircraft also supported anti-communist ground forces. The UH-1 helicopters were used in many roles including medical evacuation and close air support. RAAF casualties in Vietnam included six killed in action, eight non-battle fatalities, 30 wounded in action and 30 injured. A small number of RAAF pilots also served in United States Air Force units, flying F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers or serving as forward air controllers.

In September 1975, a group of 44 civilians, including armed supporters of the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT), commandeered an RAAF Caribou, &quot;A4-140&quot;, on the ground at Baucau Airport in the then Portuguese Timor, which was in the middle of a civil war. The Caribou had landed at Baucau on a humanitarian mission for the International Committee of the Red Cross. The civilians demanded that the RAAF crew members fly them to Darwin Airport (also RAAF Base Darwin) in Australia, which they did. After the Caribou arrived there, the Australian government detained the civilians for a short period, and then granted refugee visas to all of them. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later described &quot;A4-140&quot; as &quot;the only RAAF plane ever hijacked&quot;, and the incident as &quot;one of the more remarkable stories in Australia&#x27;s military and immigration history&quot;.

=== Recent history (1990–present) ===

Military airlifts were conducted for a number of purposes in subsequent decades, such as the peacekeeping operations in East Timor from 1999. Australia&#x27;s combat aircraft were not used again in combat until the Iraq War in 2003, when 14 F/A-18s from No. 75 Squadron RAAF operated in the escort and ground attack roles, flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser-guided bombs. A detachment of AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were deployed in the Middle East between 2003 and 2012. These aircraft conducted maritime surveillance patrols over the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea in support of Coalition warships and boarding parties, as well as conducting extensive overland flights of Iraq and Afghanistan on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and supporting counter-piracy operations in Somalia.
From 2007 to 2009, a detachment of No. 114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit RAAF was on active service at Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan.
Approximately 75 personnel deployed with the AN/TPS-77 radar assigned the responsibility to co-ordinate coalition air operations. A detachment of IAI Heron unmanned aerial vehicles has been deployed in Afghanistan since January 2010.

In late September 2014, an Air Task Group consisting of up to eight F/A-18F Super Hornets, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control aircraft and 400 personnel was deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Operations began on 1 October. A number of C-17 and C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft based in the Middle East have also been used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid and to airlift arms and munitions since August.

In June 2017, two RAAF AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft were deployed to the southern Philippines in response to the Marawi crisis.

In 2021, the Royal Australian Air Force commemorated its 100th anniversary. Later that year, on 29 November, the Hornet was officially retired from RAAF service, with a ceremony to mark the occasion taking place that day at RAAF Base Williamtown.

In January 2022, two RAAF P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and one C-130J Hercules departed RAAF Amberley and Richmond to conduct aerial reconnaissance of Tonga in the wake of the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption and tsunami. According to Australian Defence News, the flights were to &quot;help determine the extent of the damage [to Tongan infrastructure]… and inform future disaster support requests.&quot;

In October 2023, the Australian Government announced that, in addition to a further round of A$31.6 million for military assistance for Ukraine, it would be sending a single E-7A Wedgetail. This aircraft, and the associated 100 personnel - mainly from 2 Squadron, would operate from Ramstein Air Base for a six month deployment under Operation Kudu. The stated objective of the deployment was to &quot;help ensure that vital support flowing to Ukraine by the international community is protected.&quot;

=== Strength ===
As of June 2018, the RAAF had 14,313 permanent full-time personnel and 5,499 part-time active reserve personnel.

=== Women ===

The RAAF established the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) in March 1941, which then became the Women&#x27;s Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF) in 1951. The service merged with the RAAF in 1977; however, all women in the Australian military were barred from combat-related roles until 1990. Women have been eligible for flying roles in the RAAF since 1987, with the RAAF&#x27;s first women pilots awarded their &quot;wings&quot; in 1988. In 2016, the remaining restrictions on women in frontline combat roles were removed, and the first two female RAAF fast jet fighter pilots graduated in December 2017. Air Force has implemented several programs to assist women who choose a pilot career. Entry to the Graduate Pilot Scheme is open to women who are currently undertaking a Bachelor of Aviation (BAv). Once qualified, women pilots are able to access the Flying Females Mentoring Network. Men and women are required to undergo the same basic fitness tests to become a pilot; however the standards are lower for females. For some roles, the requirement cannot be adjusted for safety reasons.

=== Ranks ===
The rank structure of the nascent RAAF was established to ensure that the service remained separate from the Army and Navy. The service&#x27;s predecessors, the AFC and the AAC, had used the Army&#x27;s rank structure. In November 1920 it was decided by the Air Board that the RAAF would adopt the structure adopted by the RAF the previous year. As a result, the RAAF&#x27;s rank structure came to be: Aircraftman, Leading Aircraftman, Corporal, Sergeant, Flight Sergeant, Warrant Officer, Officer Cadet, Pilot Officer, Flying Officer, Flight Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Wing Commander, Group Captain, Air Commodore, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Chief Marshal, and Marshal of the RAAF.

==== Officer insignia ====
==== Other ranks insignia ====
=== Uniforms ===
In 1922, the colour of the RAAF winter uniform was determined by Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams on a visit to the Geelong Wool Mill. He asked for one dye dip fewer than the RAN blue (three indigo dips rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue-grey when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in 1972 by Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Colin Hannah. The original colour and style were re-adopted from 1 January 2000 under direction from the then CAF Air Marshal Errol McCormack. Slip-on rank epaulettes, known as &quot;Soft Rank Insignia&quot; (SRI), displaying the word are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform. When not in the service dress or &quot;ceremonial&quot; uniform, RAAF personnel wear the General Purpose Uniform (GPU) as a working dress, which is a blue version of the Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform.

==Roundel and badge==
Originally, the air force used the red, white and blue roundel of the RAF. However, during the Second World War the inner red circle, which was visually similar to the Japanese &quot;hinomaru&quot;, was removed after a No. 11 Squadron Catalina was mistaken for a Japanese aircraft and attacked by a Grumman Wildcat of VMF-212 of the United States Marine Corps on 27 June 1942. After the war, a range of options for the RAAF roundel was proposed, including the Southern Cross, a boomerang, a sprig of wattle, and a red kangaroo. On 2 July 1956, the current version of the roundel was formally adopted. This consists of a white inner circle with a red kangaroo surrounded by a royal blue circle. The kangaroo faces left, except when used on aircraft or vehicles, when the kangaroo should always face forward. Low visibility versions of the roundel exist, with the white omitted and the red and blue replaced with light or dark grey.

The RAAF badge was accepted by the Chester Herald in 1939. The badge is composed of the St Edward&#x27;s Crown mounted on a circle featuring the words Royal Australian Air Force, beneath which scroll work displays the Latin motto &quot;Per Ardua Ad Astra&quot;, which it shares with the Royal Air Force. Surmounting the badge is a wedge-tailed eagle. &quot;Per Ardua Ad Astra&quot; is attributed with the meaning &quot;Through Adversity to the Stars&quot; and is from Sir Henry Rider Haggard&#x27;s novel &quot;The People of the Mist&quot;.

==Music==
The &quot;Eagles of Australia&quot; is the official march of the RAAF and is played as a quick march when the RAAF bands perform public duties in the capital. Composed by the RAAF&#x27;s Director of Music, Squadron Leader Ron Mitchell (who was also director of the Air Force Band), it was officially adopted as the RAAF&#x27;s new march music on 23 March 1983, replacing the Royal Air Force March Past, which had long been the RAAF&#x27;s march as well as the marchpast of other Commonwealth air forces. Subsequently, journalist Frank Cranston wrote lyrics to the march and a musical score was produced by September of the following year.

== Roulettes ==

The Roulettes are the RAAF&#x27;s formation aerobatic display team. They perform around Australia and Southeast Asia, and are part of the RAAF Central Flying School (CFS) based at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. The Roulettes operate the Pilatus PC-21 and formations for shows are a group of six aircraft. The pilots learn many formations including loops, rolls, corkscrews and ripple rolls. Most of the performances are done at a low altitude of .
==Future procurement==

This list includes aircraft on order or a requirement which has been identified:
* Up to 100 F-35A Lightning II (CTOL variant) with no fewer than 72 aircraft acquired to equip three operational squadrons and an operational conversion unit. The remaining aircraft will be acquired in conjunction with the withdrawal of the F/A-18F Super Hornets after 2020 to ensure no gap in Australia&#x27;s overall air combat capability occurs. On 25 November 2009, Australia committed to placing a first order for 14 aircraft at a cost of A$3.2 billion with deliveries to begin in 2014. In May 2012, the decision to purchase 12 F-35s from the initial 14 order was deferred until 2014 as part of wider ADF procurement deferments to balance the Federal Government budget. On 23 April 2014, Australia confirmed the purchase of 58 F-35A Lightning II fighters in addition to the 14 already ordered. Up to a further 28 aircraft may be acquired. The first two Australian F-35A Lightning II fighters were rolled out in July 2014, and began flying training flights with the USAF 61st Fighter Squadron in December 2014. The last 9 of the 72 F-35As ordered arrived in Australia in December 2024 completing the order. 
* A further seven Boeing P-8A Poseidons to be purchased and brought into service by the late 2020s, bringing the total number of aircraft to fifteen, was announced in the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot;.
* Six MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to expand the surveillance of Australia&#x27;s maritime approaches, with the possibility of purchasing a seventh air frame. The drones will cost approximately A$6.9 billion over their entire life-time, with the fleet expected to be in service by late 2025. They will be based at RAAF Base Edinburgh however will regularly conduct missions from RAAF Base Tindal.
* A possible further two KC-30As to support the incoming P-8A fleet, which would bring the total number of aircraft to nine, was announced in the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot;.
*In May 2020, Boeing Australia unveiled the Airpower Teaming System (ATS), a joint partnership between the company and the RAAF. The Airpower Teaming System is an unmanned aircraft incorporating artificial intelligence; the aircraft is the first of its kind to be produced in Australia and the first aircraft to be designed and manufactured in Australia for over 50 years.
* A$4–5 billion project to replace the BAE Hawk 127 lead-in fighter trainer was announced in the &quot;2016 Integrated Investment Program&quot; that accompanied the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot;. The project has a timeframe of 2022 to 2033.
* Four MC-55A Peregrine SIGINT and ELINT intelligence gathering aircraft, based on the Gulfstream G550, in a A$2.5 billion procurement.
*In July 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia would acquire the AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) for the F/A-18F Super Hornet. In September 2021, Morrison announced that Australia would acquire the AGM-158B Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM-ER) for the F/A-18F Super Hornet and F-35A fighters.
* A$4.9–7.3 billion project to acquire a Medium Range Ground Based Air Defence capability to defend deployed airfields, command centres and other valuable assets from enemy air attack. The project has a timeframe of mid to late 2020s. The project had been named Medium Range Air and Missile Defence in the &quot;2016 Integrated Investment Program&quot;. The project was also renamed and renumbered to AIR6502 Phase 1 from AIR6500 Phase 2 for the &quot;2020 Force Structure Plan&quot;.
* The full replacement and expansion of the existing 12 C-130J Super Hercules fleet to 20 aircraft. Announced in July 2023 by Defence Minister Richard Marles, the fleet expansion and renewal is budgeted at A$9.8 billion.
* Australia plans to, via SCIFiRE, acquire a Mach 5-8 hypersonic air-launched cruise missile in collaboration with the United States, as of 2021, the date for the receiving of these missiles is stated at 5–10 years.

<text>Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is usually responsible first to the parliament&#x27;s lower house, which is more representative than the upper house, as it usually has more members and they are always directly elected.

Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers must have the privileges of the floor, which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must ordinarily immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.

Lastly, the head of state is in turn required to effectuate their executive power only through these responsible ministers. They must never attempt to set up a shadow government of executives or advisors and attempt to use them as instruments of government, or to rely upon their unofficial advice. They generally are not permitted to take any action under the color of their executive power without that action being as a result of the counsel and advisement of their responsible ministers. Common exceptions to this rule include emergency or wartime acts of necessity and the granting of certain state honours. Their ministers are required to counsel them (i.e., explain to them and be sure they understand any issue that they will be called upon to decide) and to form and have recommendations for them (i.e., their advice or advisement) to choose from, which are the ministers&#x27; formal, reasoned recommendations as to what course of action should be taken.

==History in the British Empire and Commonwealth==
From the middle of the 19th century, the United Kingdom began to introduce systems of responsible government to the colonial governments of its settler colonies including in Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. These systems were strongly based upon the system that had historically developed in the United Kingdom, with a bicameral legislature and an executive responsible to the Lower House.

===Canada===
Responsible government was implemented in several colonies of British North America (present day Canada), between 1848 and 1850, with the executive council formulating policy with the assistance of the legislative branch, which voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacting those policies that the legislature had approved. This replaced the previous system, whereby the governor took advice from an executive council and used the legislature chiefly to raise money.

Under responsible government, the executive is also a part of the legislature. The Executive branch must consist of MPs
Responsible government was a major element of Canada&#x27;s gradual development toward independence. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with self-government than with parliamentary accountability; hence, there is the notion that the Dominion of Newfoundland &quot;gave up responsible government&quot; when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933, as a result of financial problems. It did not regain responsible government until it became a province of Canada in 1949.

====Background====
Following the formation of elected legislative assemblies, starting with Nova Scotia in 1758, governors and their executive councils did not require the consent of elected legislators in order to carry out all their roles. It was only in the decades leading up to Canadian Confederation in 1867 that the governing councils of those British North American colonies became responsible to the elected representatives of the people. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, sparked by the perceived shortcomings of virtual representation, the British government became more sensitive to unrest in its remaining colonies with large populations of European-descended colonists. Elected assemblies were introduced to both Upper Canada and Lower Canada with the Constitutional Act 1791. Many reformers thought that these assemblies should have some control over the executive power, leading to political unrest between the governors and assemblies in both Upper and Lower Canada. The Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Sir Francis Bond Head, wrote in one dispatch to London that, if responsible government were implemented, &quot;democracy, in the worst possible form, will prevail in our colonies.&quot;

After the Rebellions of 1837–1838 in the Canadas, the Earl of Durham was appointed governor general of British North America, with the task of examining the issues and determining how to defuse tensions. In his report, one of his recommendations was colonies that were developed enough should be granted &quot;responsible government&quot;. This term specifically meant the policy that British-appointed governors should bow to the will of elected colonial assemblies.

====Implementation====
The first instance of responsible government in the British Empire outside of the United Kingdom itself was achieved by the colony of Nova Scotia in January and February 1848, through the efforts of Joseph Howe. Howe&#x27;s push for responsible government was inspired by the work of Thomas McCulloch and Jotham Blanchard almost two decades earlier. The plaque erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly reads:
First Responsible Government in the British Empire.&lt;br&gt;
The first executive council chosen exclusively from the party having a majority in the representative branch of a colonial legislature was formed in Nova Scotia on 2 February 1848. Following a vote of want of confidence in the preceding council, James Boyle Uniacke, who had moved the resolution, became attorney general and leader of the government. Joseph Howe, the long-time campaigner for this &quot;peaceable revolution&quot;, became provincial secretary. Other members of the council were Hugh Bell, Wm.F. Desbarres, Lawrence O.C. Doyle, Herbert Huntingdon, James McNab, Michael Tobin, and George R. Young.

The colony of New Brunswick soon followed in May 1848, when Lieutenant Governor Edmund Walker Head brought in a more balanced representation of members of the Legislative Assembly to the Executive Council and ceded more powers to that body.

In the Province of Canada, responsible government was introduced when Elgin swore-in the ministry of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin on 11 March 1848. It was put to the test in the following year, when Reformers in the legislature passed the Rebellion Losses Bill, which provided compensation to French-Canadians who suffered losses during the Rebellions of 1837–1838. Elgin had serious misgivings about the bill, but, nonetheless assented to it, despite demands from the Tories that he refuse to do so. Elgin was physically assaulted by an English-speaking mob for this and the parliament building in Montreal was burned to the ground in the ensuing riots. Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.

In time, the granting of responsible government became the first step on the road to complete independence. Canada gradually gained greater autonomy through inter imperial and Commonwealth diplomacy, including the British North America Act, 1867; the Statute of Westminster, 1931; and the patriation of the Constitution Act, 1982.

====Commemoration====
Charles III, King of Canada, sent a message to Nova Scotians on 2 February 2023 to mark the 175th anniversary of the implementation of responsible government in the province. In his remarks, the King said:

I am delighted to have the opportunity to recognize the 175th anniversary of Nova Scotia&#x27;s establishment of the system of responsible government, which has become a cornerstone of Canadian democracy.&lt;br&gt;

It was in the drawing room at Government House, Halifax, where Lieutenant Governor Sir John Harvey swore in the first democratically elected cabinet in Canada&#x27;s history. In 2014, as Prince of Wales, I had the great privilege of being sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada in the very same room. At the time, I was struck by the historic setting and profound significance in the history of Canada and the Commonwealth and, as you reflect on and celebrate this important milestone, I wanted to send you my warmest best wishes.

John Ralston Saul, a former viceregal consort of Canada, penned a piece for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on 11 March 2023 lamenting that the country does not celebrate that date in 1848, which Saul regards as &quot;the day on which we became a democracy—a continuous democracy&quot; and such lack of observance perpetuates the misconceived identity of Canada as a new country.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
Prior to European colonisation, the Australian continent was inhabited by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples, who had their own traditional forms of self-government. They were divided into various nations and clans and, in some cases, large alliances between several nations. In 1770, Royal Navy officer James Cook sailed along the east coast of Australia and claimed it for King George III. Nearly two decades later, in 1788 the First Fleet led by Arthur Phillip established the first permanent European settlement in Australia at Port Jackson. The settlers gradually expanded across the continent, displacing the indigenous population, until they had established six colonies; the legal system of these colonies were based on the common law system.

At first, the Australian colonies were run by autocratic governors. They were appointed by the British monarch, but in practice the governors exercised vast executive and legislative powers with very little oversight. Several factors influenced this: most of these early colonies were penal colonies, they were at a great distance from the United Kingdom and communication was slow. In addition the continent was of enormous size and the Australian colonies were largely unexplored by Europeans and sparsely settled by them.

In 1808 a military coup d&#x27;état known as the Rum Rebellion deposed Governor Bligh and briefly established military rule over the Colony of New South Wales until a new Governor (Lachlan Macquarie) was appointed and sent from Britain. This did not aid in establishing responsible or representative government.

The early colonists, coming mostly from the United Kingdom (which by 1801 included Ireland), were familiar with the Westminster system and made efforts to reform local government in order to increase the opportunity for ordinary men to participate. The Governors and London therefore set in motion a gradual process of establishing a Westminster system in the colonies. They did not want to get ahead of population or economic growth, nor be so slow as to provoke clamouring for revolutionary change as had happened in the American Revolutionary War and was threatened in the Rebellions of 1837–1838 in Canada. The government first established appointed or partially elected Legislative Councils. William Wentworth among other prominent colonists in this time advocated for the introduction of responsible government in the Australian colonies.

Violence erupted in the Colony of Victoria during the 1850s, where there was growing political discontent and civil disobedience among the common men, especially in the inland gold fields areas. This culminated in the 1854 Eureka Rebellion near Ballarat. 190 miners armed themselves, erected a stockade, and raised the Southern Cross Flag. They demanded an end to taxation (via an expensive miner&#x27;s license) without representation, the right to vote in colonial elections, and colonial maintenance and upkeep of the area&#x27;s roads.

The British colonial forces overran the stockade, capturing or killing dozens of miners and bringing many to Melbourne for trial. However, mass public support led to the miners&#x27; release. Within a year, most of their demands had been met, including responsible self-government and universal male suffrage for the Colony of Victoria.

The Eureka Rebellion and events in Victoria resonated around the Australian colonies, which had their own regional agitators for change. South Australia was quick to pass universal male suffrage, and Victoria and New South Wales followed soon after. By the end of the 1850s, all the Australian colonies and New Zealand had achieved responsible self-government. Only Western Australia took until 1890 to achieve this.

The Northern Territory was originally part of South Australia, but transferred to the Australian Commonwealth Government in 1911. It then &quot;lost&quot; responsible self-government (although residents could still vote in federal elections) and did not gain it back until 1974. Likewise, the Australian Capital Territory was originally part of New South Wales. It was transferred to the Commonwealth Government in 1911 and lost responsible self-government until 1989.

====Participation by women and indigenous people====

White female suffrage (then considered universal suffrage) was gained from the 1890s to the 1910s in Australia and New Zealand (1893), allowing the other half of the ethnic European population to participate in responsible representative government.

In New Zealand, the indigenous Maori had full British citizenship following the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi.

In Australia during the colonial period, some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people may have theoretically had the right to vote in colonial elections. But, in practice they were usually unable to exercise this right: they lived traditional lifestyles in remote areas uncontacted by the colony, or affected by the disruption of the Frontier Wars. In addition, they often were excluded from voting by racial discrimination in practices or by property requirements.

After federation, the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 barred Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from voting in federal elections unless they were already eligible to vote in their state. Queensland explicitly barred Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from voting until the 1960s, while Western Australia barred Aboriginal people unless they successfully applied to become citizens. As a result, most Aboriginal people across the country were prevented from voting, including those who in theory had the right. Later, the 1962 Commonwealth Electoral Act gave all Aboriginal people the option to enroll to vote, but still most were not able to exercise their rights.

After passage of the 1967 Australian referendum, the federal government was allowed to count Indigenous Australians in the census, and to ensure that their voting rights were respected across the country.

=== Cape Colony ===
The Cape Colony, in Southern Africa, was under responsible self-government from 1872 until 1910 when it became the Cape Province of the new Union of South Africa.

Under its previous system of representative government, the Ministers of the Cape Government reported directly to the British Imperial Governor, and not to the locally elected representatives in the Cape Parliament. Among Cape citizens of all races, growing anger at their powerlessness in influencing unpopular imperial decisions had repeatedly led to protests and rowdy political meetings – especially during the early &quot;Convict Crisis&quot; of the 1840s.
A popular political movement for responsible government soon emerged, under local leader John Molteno. A protracted struggle was then conducted over the ensuing years as the movement (known informally as &quot;the responsibles&quot;) grew increasingly powerful, and used their parliamentary majority to put pressure on the British Governor, withholding public finances from him, and conducting public agitations. Not everyone favoured responsible government though, and pro-imperial press outlets even accused the movement of constituting &quot;crafts and assaults of the devil&quot;.

Supporters believed that the most effective means of instituting responsible government was simply to change the section of the constitution which prevented government officials from being elected to parliament or members of parliament from serving in executive positions. The conflict therefore centred on the changing of this specific section. &quot;Although responsible government merely required an amendment to s.79 of the constitution, it transpired only after nearly twenty years in 1872 when the so-called &#x27;responsibles&#x27; under Molteno were able to command sufficient support in both houses to secure the passage of the necessary bill.&quot; Finally, with a parliamentary majority and with the Colonial Office and new Governor Henry Barkly won over, Molteno instituted responsible government, making the Ministers directly responsible to the Cape Parliament, and becoming the Cape&#x27;s first Prime Minister.

The ensuing period saw an economic recovery, a massive growth in exports and an expansion of the colony&#x27;s frontiers. Despite political complications that arose from time to time (such as an ill-fated scheme by the British Colonial Office to enforce a confederation in Southern Africa in 1878, and tensions with the Afrikaner-dominated Government of Transvaal over trade and railroad construction), economic and social progress in the Cape Colony continued at a steady pace until a renewed attempt to extend British control over the hinterland caused the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer Wars in 1899.

An important feature of the Cape Colony under responsible government was that it was the only state in southern Africa (and one of very few in the world at the time) to have a non-racial system of voting.

Later however – following the South Africa Act 1909 to form the Union of South Africa – this multi-racial universal suffrage was steadily eroded, and eventually abolished by the Apartheid government in 1948.

== In German history ==

In the early 1860s, the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck was involved in a bitter dispute with the Liberals, who sought to institute a system of responsible government modeled on that of Britain. Bismarck, who strongly opposed that demand, managed to deflect the pressure by embarking energetically and successfully on the unification of Germany. The Liberals, who were also strong German nationalists, backed Bismarck&#x27;s unification efforts and tacitly accepted that the Constitution of Imperial Germany, crafted by Bismarck, did not include a responsible government – the Chancellor being accountable solely to the emperor and needing no parliamentary confidence. Germany gained a responsible government only with the Weimar Republic and more securely with the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany. Historians account the lack of responsible government in the formative decades of united Germany as one of the factors contributing to the prolonged weakness of German democratic institutions, lasting also after such a government was finally instituted.

<doc id="26332" wikidata="Q2608153" url="?curid=26332" title="Rural flight">
<text>Rural flight (also known as rural-to-urban migration, rural depopulation, or rural exodus) is the migratory pattern of people from rural areas into urban areas. It is urbanization seen from the rural perspective.

In industrializing economies like Britain in the eighteenth century or East Asia in the twentieth century, it can occur following the industrialization of primary industries such as agriculture, mining, fishing, and forestry—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of output to market—and related secondary industries (refining and processing) are consolidated. Rural exodus can also follow an ecological or human-caused catastrophe such as a famine or resource depletion. These are examples of push factors.

People can also move into town to seek higher wages, educational access and other urban amenities; examples of pull factors.

Once rural populations fall below a critical mass, the population is too small to support certain businesses, which then also leave or close, in a vicious circle. Services to smaller and more dispersed populations may be proportionately more expensive, which can lead to closures of offices and services, which further harm the rural economy. Schools are the archetypal example because they influence the decisions of parents of young children: a village or region without a school will typically lose families to larger towns that have one. But the concept (urban hierarchy) can be applied more generally to many services and is explained by central place theory.

Government policies to combat rural flight include campaigns to expand services to the countryside, such as electrification or distance education. Governments can also use restrictions like internal passports to make rural flight illegal. Economic conditions that can counter rural depopulation include commodities booms, the expansion of outdoor-focused tourism, and a shift to remote work, or exurbanization. To some extent, governments generally seek only to manage rural flight and channel it into certain cities, rather than stop it outright as this would imply taking on the expensive task of building airports, railways, hospitals, and universities in places with few users to support them, while neglecting growing urban and suburban areas.

==Historical trends==
Prior to the Industrial Revolution, rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. Ancient Athens and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000.

The onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of these checks. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers arose, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the start of rural flight on a massive scale. This was often helped along by periodic agricultural recessions. The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925. While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in Western Europe and the United States, as industrialization spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and urbanization followed quickly behind. In the early twenty-first century, rural flight was especially distinctive phenomenon in China and sub-Saharan Africa.

=== Mechanization and ecology: case study of the Dust Bowl in 1930s North America ===

The shift from mixed subsistence farming to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century. New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical reapers, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production. The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions. Most homesteaders had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.

During the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the 1930s, large numbers of people fled rural areas of the Great Plains and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high debt loads exacerbated by several years of drought and large dust storms. Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, as in John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939), in which a family from the Great Plains migrates to California, fleeing the Dust Bowl.

===Since World War II===
Post-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of industrialized agriculture. Small, labor-intensive family farms have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products—all requiring substantial labor—large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, Iowa State University reports the number of hog farmers in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.

The consolidation of the feed, seed, processed grain, and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.

===Abandonment of small towns===
The rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.

Since the 1990s, China has merged schools into more centralized village-, town-, or county-level schools in rural areas to address some of these very problems.

== Reasons for leaving ==
As with other human migration, various push and pull factors contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.

=== Economic motives ===
Some migrants choose to leave rural communities to pursue economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the Harris-Todaro Model, migration to urban areas will continue as long as &quot;expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product&quot; (127). However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level. This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as overurbanization. With the rise of industrial agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs in rural communities. 

Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor. At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates. The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as chain migration, migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.

Some families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.

Poorer people face severe challenges in the agricultural sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in Cambodia and Ethiopia. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.

===Social motives===
In other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions. 
Rural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms – demonstrating leadership and self-respect. With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. 
Lastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as one out of every four residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s. More recently, drought in Syria from 2006 to 2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.

==Examples==
===United States and Canada===

The terms are used in the United States and Canada to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the Great Plains and Midwest regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast and Appalachia. It is also particularly noticeable in parts of Atlantic Canada (especially Newfoundland), since the collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields in 1992.

Rural counties in the United States make up about 70 percent of the nation&#x27;s land mass. Historically, population increase from births in rural areas more than compensated for the number of people moving from rural areas to urban areas, but from 2010 to 2016, rural areas lost population in absolute numbers for the first time.

===China===

China, like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the hukou system, greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has progressively lifted the restrictions on internal migration. This has led to a great increase in the number of people migrating to urban areas. However, even today, the hukou system limits the ability of rural migrants to receive full access to urban social services at the urban subsidized costs. As with most examples of rural flight, several factors have led towards China&#x27;s massive urbanization. Income disparity, family pressure, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas. In 2014, approximately 250 million rural migrants lived in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.

===England and Wales===

A focus by landowners on efficient production led to the enclosure of the commons in the 16th and 17th centuries. This created unrest in rural areas as tenants were then unable to graze their livestock. They sometimes resorted to illegal means to support their families. This was followed, in turn, by penal transportation which sent offenders out of the country, often Australia. Eventually, economic measures produced the British Agricultural Revolution.

===Germany===
====Middle Ages====
Rural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century. A corresponding principle of German law is &quot;Stadtluft macht frei&quot; (&quot;city air makes you free&quot;), in longer form &quot;Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag&quot; (&quot;city air makes you free after a year and a day&quot;): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a serf who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.

====German &quot;Landflucht&quot;====
&quot;Landflucht&quot; (&quot;flight from the land&quot;) refers to the mass migration of peasants into the cities that occurred in Germany (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.

In 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%. In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Posen, Silesia, and Pomerania lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities, where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class; One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.

&quot;Landflucht&quot; resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture. Mechanized agriculture and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachsengänger), became more common. This was especially true in the province of Posen that was gained by Prussia when Poland was partitioned. The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the &quot;Polish corridor&quot; after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as game preserves.

The word &quot;Landflucht&quot; has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.

===Scotland===

The rural exodus of Scotland followed that of England, but delayed by several centuries. Consolidation of farms and elimination of inefficient tenants occurred over about 110 years from the 18th to the 19th centuries. Samuel Johnson encountered this in 1773 and documented it in his work &quot;A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland.&quot; He deplored the exodus but did not have the information to analyze the problem.

===Sweden===
Rural flight and out-migration in Sweden can be traced in two distinct waves. The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.

The second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly &quot;pull factors&quot; due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden&#x27;s GDP per capita increased from US$850 to US$6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.

=== Russia and the former Soviet states ===
Rural flight began later for the former states of the USSR than in Western Europe. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas. Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid urbanization of the USSR. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change. Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district. Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the end of the Soviet Union, rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.

Rural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and the Ukraine experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like Central Asia, experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.

Rural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas. In particular, the Soviet &quot;kolkhoz&quot; system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the kolkhoz system replaced family farms throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to inflation, Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life. While Brezhnev&#x27;s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.

Although migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.

=== Mexico ===
Rural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.

In the 1930s, President Cardenas implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940 to 1965 as the &quot;Golden Era for Mexican Migration.&quot; During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in Mexico City demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for migration to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.

However, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs. This regulation severely undercut the market price of maize lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the Green Revolution had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of Norman Borlaug, farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre. Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates. A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population. The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.

==Consequences of rural flight==
Rural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.

Additionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.

Women, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.

<doc id="26333" wikidata="Q1023459" url="?curid=26333" title="Robotech">
<text>Robotech is an American-Japanese science fiction franchise that began with an 85-episode anime television series produced by Harmony Gold USA in association with Tatsunoko Production; it was first released in the United States in 1985.

The show was adapted from three original and distinct, though visually similar, Japanese anime television series (&quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, &quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA&quot;) to make a series suitable for syndication.

In the series, &quot;Robotechnology&quot; refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island. With this technology, Earth developed robotic technologies, such as transformable mecha, to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions.

==Name origin==
Prior to the release of the TV series, the name &quot;Robotech&quot; was used by model kit manufacturer Revell on their &quot;Robotech Defenders&quot; line in the mid-1980s. The line consisted of mecha model kits imported from Japan and featured in anime titles such as &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982), &quot;Super Dimension Century Orguss&quot; (1983) and &quot;Fang of the Sun Dougram&quot; (1981). The kits were originally intended to be a marketing tie-in to a similarly named comic book series by DC Comics, which ran for only two issues.

At the same time, Harmony Gold licensed the &quot;Macross&quot; TV series for direct-to-video distribution in 1984, but their merchandising plans were compromised by Revell&#x27;s prior distribution of the &quot;Macross&quot; kits. In the end, both parties signed a co-licensing agreement and the &quot;Robotech&quot; name was adopted for the TV syndication of &quot;Macross&quot; combined with &quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; (1984) and &quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA&quot; (1983).

==Fictional chronology==
The &quot;Robotech&quot; chronology, according to Harmony Gold, is illustrated below:

* Asterisked works are now considered &#x27;secondary continuity&#x27;—that is, that their events exist in the continuity of &quot;Robotech&quot;, but &#x27;don&#x27;t count&#x27; when conflicts arise with the primary continuity that comprises the three-part &quot;Robotech&quot; TV series and 2006&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

In 2002, with the publication of the WildStorm (DC) comics, Harmony Gold officially decided to retcon the &quot;Robotech&quot; Universe. The following &quot;Robotech&quot; material is now relegated to the status of secondary continuity:

* &quot;The Sentinels&quot; in all its incarnations.
* &quot;Robotech&quot; comics published by , Eternity, Academy, Antarctic Press and Titan Comics.
*&quot;Robotech&quot; RPGs published by Palladium Books.
* &quot;Robotech&quot; novels written by Jack McKinney, most notably &quot;The End of the Circle&quot;.

While these materials are not precisely &#x27;retired&#x27; or &#x27;removed&#x27; from the continuity, their events are subject to critical review, and are strictly subordinate to the &#x27;official&#x27; events of the 85-episode animated series.

==Television and film==

===The original television series===
&quot;Robotech&quot; (1985) is an original story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different mecha anime series:
#&quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (1982–1983)
#&quot;Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross&quot; (1984)
#&quot;Genesis Climber MOSPEADA&quot; (1983–1984)

Harmony Gold&#x27;s cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market &quot;Macross&quot; for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). &quot;Macross&quot; and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. On some television stations, the syndicated run was preceded by the broadcast premiere of &quot;&quot;, a feature-length pilot.

This combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations, as mankind must fight three destructive &#x27;Robotech Wars&#x27; in succession with various invading forces, each of which is motivated in one way or another by a desire for a powerful energy source called &#x27;protoculture&#x27;. While each of the three animated series used for its footage informs its content, the Robotech storyline is distinct and separate from each of them.

*The First Robotech War (&quot;The Macross Saga&quot;) concerns humanity&#x27;s discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown. In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture. Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.
* The Second Robotech War (&quot;The Masters&quot;) focuses on the arrival in Earth orbit of the Robotech Masters, who have come seeking what turns out to be the sole means in the universe of producing protoculture. Through a combination of mistrust and arrogance, their attempts at retrieving this meet with opposition from the humans and unleash a war that leaves the Masters defeated and Earth awash in the spores of a plant called the Flower of Life—the source of protoculture and a beacon to the mysterious Invid who scour the galaxy for its presence.
* The Third Robotech War (&quot;The New Generation&quot;) begins with the arrival on Earth of the Invid, who are lured by the Flower of Life and rapidly conquer the planet. References in the previous two chapters explain to viewers that many of the heroes of the First Robotech War had left Earth to seek out the Robotech Masters on a preemptive mission, and it is this Robotech Expeditionary Force that sends missions back from across the galaxy to attempt a liberation of their homeworld. The storyline follows one group of freedom fighters as they work their way towards the final battle with the Invid.

===&quot;Robotech: The Movie&quot;===

&quot;Robotech: The Movie&quot;, also called &quot;Robotech: The Untold Story&quot;, is a feature film and was the first new &quot;Robotech&quot; adventure created after the premiere of the original series. It uses footage from the &quot;Megazone 23 – Part 1&quot; OVA (original video animation; made-for-video animated feature) combined with scenes from &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and additional original animation produced for the film.

The original plan for the film was to have it set during the Macross Saga, parallel to the SDF-1&#x27;s return to Earth from Pluto. The film would also have served as a prequel to the Sentinels, as both projects were initially meant to share many characters. Harmony Gold producer Carl Macek worked with the OVA&#x27;s original creators to make the story and the new ending work. The film had to be changed again after the distributor of the film, Cannon Films, saw an incomplete rough cut of the film and were upset by it. They ordered Macek to remove multiple scenes from the film and to add more violence (most of the scenes removed were scenes setting up characters and showing female characters interacting). Macek reluctantly did what they ordered, and created a new script and rough edit for the film in less than 24 hours. When the distributors saw Macek act out the new film, they were much more pleased with the new cut. The opening night in Texas received a positive response, but Cannon Films pulled out after noting that most attendants were adults; the bulk of the scheduled advertising for the series was targeted to children. The film had limited success in Argentina and Belgium.

In 2011, A&amp;E Home Video released, as a part of their &quot;Robotech: The Complete Series&quot; collection, a 29-minute version of &quot;Robotech: The Movie&quot; containing only footage used from &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. There was no attempt to remaster the footage.

===&quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot;===

This aborted American-produced series would have followed the continuing adventures of Rick and Lisa Hunter and the Robotech Expedition during the events of &quot;The Masters&quot; and &quot;The New Generation&quot;. The feature-length pilot is composed of the first three (and only) episodes that were produced. &quot;The Sentinels&quot; featured characters from all three &quot;Robotech&quot; sagas and introduced the SDF-3 along with an overview of their new mission. The series was planned to have a total of 65 episodes.

In &quot;Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels&quot;, Carl Macek blamed the cancellation of the series on the crash of the Yen/Dollar exchange rate, which caused toy partner Matchbox to withdraw from the project. Harmony Gold lacked the funds to produce the series on its own, and production ceased after only three episodes.

&quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot; was released on VHS by Palladium Books. In 2011, a &quot;remastered&quot; version was released on the A&amp;E DVD set, &quot;Robotech: The Complete Original Series&quot; DVD. This version has opening titles resembling those found on the &quot;Robotech Remastered&quot; DVDs, as well as a new ending with text explaining the fate of the SDF-3. Also, all of the flashback footage used from &quot;The Macross Saga&quot; has been removed, including the re-used footage from the episode &quot;Wedding Bells&quot;.

===&quot;Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles&quot;===

In 2002, Tommy Yune announced development of a new animated sequel. Originally announced as a television series with a planned 2004 release date, the project was revealed at Anime Expo 2004 as a feature-length film titled &quot;Robotech: Shadow Force&quot;. The storyline overlaps with and continues from the unresolved ending of the original series. The title of the story arc was soon changed to &quot;&quot;. The first trailers with finished animation were shown at Anime Expo and Comic-Con International in 2005. It was not until February 2006, when Kevin McKeever, operations coordinator at Harmony Gold, was able to confirm that the pilot movie had been completed. After a series of delays, FUNimation Entertainment was finally announced as the home video, broadcast, and theatrical distributor at the 2006 Comic-Con International in San Diego with the possibility of producing further sequels. Harmony Gold premiered the movie at various film festivals in 2006, and it was first seen by a public audience at MechaCon on August 9, 2006, where it was showcased as a charity screening to help raise funds for the ongoing Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita recovery effort. A limited theatrical run followed in January 2007, and the film was released on DVD on February 6, 2007. A two-disc collector&#x27;s edition was released in November 2007.

===&quot;Robotech: Love Live Alive&quot;===

First revealed in late 2011 in the final minutes of &quot;Carl Macek&#x27;s Robotech Universe&quot;, a documentary on the making of &quot;Robotech&quot; dedicated to the then-recent passing of Macek, &quot;Love Live Alive&quot; is an adaptation of the 1985 &quot;Genesis Climber Mospeada&quot; OVA, &quot;Love Live Alive&quot;, incorporating some brand-new animation. The film was released on DVD on July 23, 2013, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in North America.

==Other television and film productions==

===&quot;Robotech Wars&quot;===
This promotional VHS tape created by Matchbox was included with their &quot;Robotech Wars&quot; playset. This video includes two episodes cobbled together from clips of &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;. Titled &quot;To the End of the Universe&quot; and &quot;Battle Royale&quot;, these episodes contain no new footage, and are not meant to follow any continuity established in the TV series.

===&quot;Robotech III&quot;, &quot;Robotech IV&quot; and &quot;Robotech V&quot;===


During the production of &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot;, Carl Macek had already begun to plot out 13 weeks of a third series title &quot;Robotech III: The Odyssey&quot;, which would have raised the total number or Robotech episodes 215 had both series been produced. He envisioned two additional series (&quot;Robotech IV&quot; and &quot;Robotech V&quot;) to bring the total number of episodes to around 300, one to air every weekday for over a year. 

For &quot;Robotech III: The Odyssey,&quot; Macek stated that his plans were to create a time-travel loop, allowing the last episode of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; to lead directly into the first episode of &quot;The Macross Saga.&quot; This particular plot detail was eventually adapted into the Robotech novel &quot;The End of the Circle&quot; by Jack McKinney.

In 1986, fan publication &quot;Macross Life&quot; published an interview with Harmony Gold executive Richard Firth who first mentioned the &quot;Robotech IV&quot; and &quot;Robotech V&quot; series plans. Firth said the story would be about a retired Commodore character from &quot;The Macross Saga&quot; telling a story via flashback, but Macek later refuted that plot detail in a 2007 interview. Macek stated that while he was hoping to do up to five series, nothing was ever written for the final two.

===&quot;Robotech 3000&quot;===

Macek attempted another sequel with the development of &quot;Robotech 3000&quot;. This all-CGI series would have been set a millennium in the future of the &quot;Robotech&quot; universe and feature none of the old series&#x27; characters. In the three-minute trailer, an expedition is sent to check on a non-responsive mining outpost and is attacked by &quot;infected&quot; Veritech mecha. The idea was abandoned midway into production after negative reception within the company, negative fan reactions at the FanimeCon anime convention in 2000, and financial difficulties within Netter Digital who was animating the show. During a 2000 San Diego Comic-Con panel, Macek announced the series was would be re-conceptualized as a traditional, hand-drawn animated series, however that idea was &quot;abandoned&quot; sometime prior to 2002 in favor of development of what would become &quot;Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles&quot;. The trailer was hosted on the official &quot;Robotech&quot; website, and was included in the 2007 release of the &quot;Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles&quot; 2-disc collector&#x27;s DVD, along with behind-the-scenes motion capture footage.

===&quot;Robotech: Mars Force&quot;===
In October 2004, veteran animation writer and producer Greg Weisman revealed that he developed an animated spin-off series titled &quot;Robotech: Mars Force&quot;. When asked about the project, Weisman said that he was under a non-disclosure agreement with Harmony Gold and was only allowed to mention that he developed the series.

In 2006, Harmony Gold Creative Director Tommy Yune elaborated on the project in the Space Station Liberty Podcast, saying that Mars Force was a series geared at younger audiences, following the children of the Robotech Expeditionary Force. A similar plot would later be used for the canceled 2014 spin-off, &quot;Robotech Academy&quot;.

===&quot;Robotech UN Public Service Announcement&quot;===
A sixty-second public service announcement for the 60th anniversary of the United Nations, featuring Scott Bernard and Ariel, was animated during the production of &quot;The Shadow Chronicles&quot;. Although it did not use the original voice actors and the dialogue was somewhat out-of-character, it nonetheless marked the first fully completed &quot;Robotech&quot; footage in many years.

===&quot;Robotech: Shadow Rising&quot;===
On July 27, 2007, at their Comic-Con International panel, Harmony Gold and Yune unveiled the second entry of the &quot;Shadow Chronicles&quot; production, titled &quot;Robotech: Shadow Rising&quot; and was to be a co-production with FUNimation Entertainment. Pre-production reportedly began in February 2007 and a projected release date of sometime in 2009 was originally expected. In 2009 Harmony Gold revealed that production had not moved forward since the summer of 2007, due to the announced development deal of a live-action film deal with Warner Bros. in September 2007.

At Comic-Con 2012, Tommy Yune announced that &quot;Love Live Alive&quot; would pave the way for &quot;Shadow Rising&quot;, and one year later announced at Anime Expo that they had resumed work on &quot;Shadow Rising.&quot; 

Harmony Gold&#x27;s trademark of the term &quot;Shadow Rising&quot; was filed in 2007, extended in 2010, but abandoned since 2011.

===&quot;Robotech Academy&quot;===
On July 5, 2014, Harmony Gold started a Kickstarter project for &quot;Robotech Academy&quot;, which Macek had developed before he died. The goal of this project was to raise US$500,000 to produce a new 24-minute pilot episode. The crowdfunding project was to have closed on August 9, 2014; however, on August 2, the project was canceled with a pledge level of US$194,574, or 39% of its target. Harmony Gold, however, announced that further plans to fund the project were being explored. At the 2014 Long Beach Comic Con, it was announced that the producers at Harmony Gold were in talks with at least one new media network on the prospect of producing the show. As of December 7, 2015, the project remains abandoned.

===Unofficial and parody productions===
In the 1990s, Seishun Shitemasu, an anime fandubbing group, produced the parodies &quot;Robotech III: Not Necessarily the Sentinels&quot; and &quot;Robotech IV: Khyron&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, using footage from, respectively, &quot;Gunbuster&quot; and &quot;Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, continuing the tradition of the original Robotech&#x27;s adaptation of unrelated anime series into a single continuity.

On July 2, 2010, Ecuadorian animator Patricio &quot;Pat&quot; Mosquera uploaded to YouTube a teaser for &quot;Robotech Skull Knights&quot;. On August 17, 2010, second teaser revealed Rick Hunter standing in front of an image of the VF-4 shown in the final episodes of the original series. &quot;Robotech Skull Knights&quot; has not been released yet. In July 2013, Patricio Mosquera was included as an animation director in the staff list in the IMDb page of &quot;Love Live Alive&quot;.

On December 31, 2012, Cesar Turturro uploaded to YouTube an Argentine fan trailer for &quot;Robotech Valkyrie Project&quot;. In December 2013 the first episode was uploaded to YouTube, and in January 2014, the second episode was also uploaded. The series was cancelled after Harmony Gold issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter to the producers. The team was, however, hired to do the CGI effects for &quot;Robotech: Academy&quot;.

===Proposed live-action film===
Attempts at producing a live-action &quot;Robotech&quot; have been in development for an extended time, with numerous writers, directors, and actors attached at various times and the film rights changing between studios.

Some time prior to February 2006, the company Kickstart Entertainment (founded by &quot;Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Robotech 3000&quot; producer Jason Netter) featured a graphic on their website stating that a live-action Robotech movie was in development with Chuck Russel attached to write and direct. While never formally announced by Harmony Gold, Kickstart Entertainment&#x27;s announcement of this project was reported by Anime News Network on February 27, 2006. Anime News Network&#x27;s article was updated on March 1, 2006 saying that this announcement had been removed.

On September 7, 2007, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that Warner Bros. had acquired the film rights to &quot;Robotech&quot;, with Tobey Maguire producing and pursuing the lead role. A Harmony Gold representative stated that the company had been approached by WB and would have &quot;a say&quot; in the film&#x27;s creative direction. A March 2021 review of a 2008 draft written by S. Craig Zahler by the website Scriptshadow revealed the initial plot was very loosely based on &quot;The Macross Saga&quot; portion of &quot;Robotech&quot;. Writers attached to the project included Lawrence Kasdan in June 2008, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar in November 2008, Tom Rob Smith in June 2009, and Michael B. Gordon in February 2015. Nic Mathieu had been announced as director in early 2013.

On March 25, 2015, the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise was acquired by Sony Pictures; on July 3, 2015, Harmony Gold clarified that Sony has the rights to release the film worldwide with the exception of Japan. After Harmony Gold and Big West reached an agreement which was signed on March 1, 2021 regarding to the &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Robotech&quot; franchises, announced on April 8, 2021, Big West officially affirmed as part of the deal that they will not take any opposition on Harmony Gold&#x27;s upcoming live action adaptation of &quot;Robotech&quot;. Both Harmony Gold and Big West will cooperate on future projects for the foreseeable future.

For the Sony production, James Wan was announced in 2015 to direct a script written with Kurt Johnstad; Andy Muschietti took over the project in 2017 after Wan dropped out to direct &quot;Aquaman&quot;, with Jason Fuchs writing the screenplay from scratch. On April 27, 2022, it was reported that &quot;Hawkeye&quot; producer and director Rhys Thomas will be directing the film, with duo Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing.

In June 2023, artist Col Price posted images on both social media and his official ArtStation page of concept art he was hired to create for the film. While only citing &quot;a few years ago&quot; as the time frame of which they were made, Price&#x27;s images depict an adaptation of &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;.

==Other media==
At the time of its broadcast, Harmony Gold also launched &quot;Robotech&quot; through a popular line of comics to be followed by novels, role-playing games, toys, and other consumer products. With the cancellation of &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot;, many of these licensed products were discontinued, and led to a drought of &quot;Robotech&quot; product through much of the 1990s, except for publishers who continued &quot;The Sentinels&quot; storyline in print.

===Art books===
In 1986, Starblaze Graphics published &quot;Robotech Art 1&quot;, a reference book containing artwork, Japanese production designs, and episode guides from the original television series. This was followed by &quot;Robotech Art 2&quot;, which was largely a collection of art by various American artists and fans. In 1988, Carl Macek collected much of the unused designs from &quot;Robotech II: The Sentinels&quot; into &quot;Robotech Art 3: The Sentinels&quot;, which also included his story outline for the rest of the unfinished series, with an explanation behind its cancellation. In 2007, Stone Bridge Press published &quot;The Art of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles&quot;.

===Comics===
&quot;Robotech&quot; comics were first published in 1984 with DC Comics&#x27; short-lived &quot;Robotech Defenders&quot; and Comico&#x27;s adaptation of the first episode of the Japanese version of &quot;Macross&quot;. However, the first adaptation of the &quot;Robotech&quot; television series did not arrive until 1985 with Comico&#x27;s &quot;Robotech: The Macross Saga&quot; Number 2, which continued from the first &quot;Macross&quot; issue.

The various comic publishers include:

* (1984–1989)
* Eternity Comics (1988–1994)
* Academy Comics (1994–1996)
* Antarctic Press (1997–1998)
* Wildstorm (DC) (2002–2005)
* Dynamite Entertainment (2013–2015)
* Titan Comics (2017–present)

===Collectible card game===
The first &quot;Robotech&quot; collectible card game was released in 2006 by Hero Factory, which had previously produced &quot;Robotech&quot; trading cards.

===Music and soundtracks===
Various &quot;Robotech&quot; soundtracks have been released on records, cassettes, and compact discs since 1988.

* &quot;Robotech&quot;: BGM Collection, Vol.1 (1988)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: Perfect Collection (1988)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: Perfect Soundtrack Album (1996)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: Battlecry Soundtrack (2002)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: Invasion Soundtrack (2004)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: 20th Anniversary Soundtrack (2005)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: The Shadow Chronicles Soundtrack (2007)
* &quot;Robotech&quot;: 30th Anniversary Soundtrack (2015)

===Novelizations===
Since 1987, &quot;Robotech&quot; was adapted into novel form by &quot;Jack McKinney&quot;, a pseudonym for the team of James Luceno and Brian Daley, a pair of writers who had been working with Macek since they had collaborated on the animated series &quot;Galaxy Rangers&quot;. Using fictitious epigraphs in the style of &quot;Dune&quot;, McKinney&#x27;s novels fleshed out the chronology (including adapting the incomplete &quot;Sentinels&quot; source material) in far greater detail than the original animation. Many &quot;Robotech&quot; fans consider the McKinney series to be an unofficial canon of its own, despite notable divergences in the writing from Harmony Gold&#x27;s current official animation-based canon. Despite no longer being considered core-continuity by Harmony Gold, the novels have been recently re-issued by Del Rey Books as Omnibus compilations.

===Role-playing games===
In 1986, Palladium Books published a role-playing game based on the &quot;Robotech&quot; series, including several books covering the &quot;Sentinels&quot; portion of the storyline. The original &quot;Robotech&quot; RPG line went out of print as of June 30, 2001, but Harmony Gold and Palladium Books signed an agreement in 2007 to produce a new line of Robotech RPG books, beginning with a book covering and promoting the feature-length film &quot;The Shadow Chronicles&quot;. The &quot;&quot; sourcebook first book was released on March 21, 2008, followed by sourcebooks covering the Macross, Masters, and New Generation chapters of Robotech (redrafted to reflect the Harmony Gold canon). Other sourcebooks and supplements are reflected in the Palladium Books production pipeline.

On April 18, 2013, Palladium started a campaign on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter for a tabletop miniatures game based on the Robotech RPG called &quot;Robotech: RPG Tactics&quot;. The miniatures are being produced by Ninja Division (combining sculpting talents from Soda Pop Miniatures and Cipher Studios), and will feature multi part plastic miniatures that can be posed during assembly. The campaign reached its goal in 3 hours, and was initially scheduled to release in December 2013, but delays have persisted into 2018.

In May 2019, under licensing from Harmony Gold and Strange Machine Games, Battlefield Press International produced a game book for the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition.

===Toys===
Action figures in the size of the three &quot;Robotech&quot; generations were initially released in 1985 by Matchbox toy company, but then reissued in 1992 by Harmony Gold (Lunk and Corg were only released by Matchbox and Lynn Minmei was only released by Harmony Gold). Each included a weapon and helmet where appropriate. Matchbox also released figures of Zentraedi characters from the first generation. These figures were supposed to represent the size difference between the Humans and the giant Zentraedi forces, but to be correct these figures would have to have been made about tall. None of the larger figures came with weapons but the Armored Zentraedi came with a removable helmet.

Also many toys depicting the vehicles and mecha from the series were released by Matchbox in 1985, Harmony Gold in 1992 and Playmates Toys in 1994 (under the Exosquad line). There were major differences in packaging, toy stickers and colors between the different releases. The vehicles were designed to be used only with the 3¾-inch figures. The SDF-1 Playset was only released under the Matchbox line in the 1980s and could be used with both the 3¾- and six-inch figures.

Harmony Gold and Matchbox were unable to sell the 1/55 VF-1 Valkyrie toy originally sold in Japan by Takatoku Toys due to Hasbro licensing it as Jetfire in the Transformers toy line. Because of this, they settled with manufacturing a non-transformable Veritech Fighter that could fit any of the 3¾-inch action figures, as well as importing the transformable super deformed Veritech Fighters (originally manufactured in Japan by Bandai as &quot;Macross&quot; VF-1 Valkyrie &quot;Joke machines&quot;).

Since the late 1990s, there has been a resurgence of &quot;Robotech&quot;-related toys. In 2001, Toynami released the &quot;Robotech Masterpiece Collection&quot; line, featuring replicas of the Veritech Fighters of &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;. Since then, Toynami has become the exclusive toy manufacturer of the &quot;Robotech&quot; franchise—having covered mecha from &quot;The Macross Saga&quot;, &quot;The New Generation&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Chronicles&quot;.

===Video games===
&quot;Robotech&quot; spawned five video game licenses, of which the most recent three were released:

* &quot;&quot; was a cancelled release for the Nintendo 64 game system. It was initially being developed by GameTek, but in 1997 Ocean Software purchased the rights to the game and took over as both developer and publisher. The game would have taken place during the period between the SDF-1&#x27;s destruction and the launch of the SDF-3. The game had a Zentraedi invasion during what was scripted in the series as a period of peace.
* &quot;&quot; (2002) for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube. The gameplay takes place in the Macross era, and features a storyline running exactly concurrent with that era&#x27;s historical events. Multiplayer support is limited to one-on-one. Several of the voice actors from the original series, including Tony Oliver, Melanie MacQueen, Dan Woren, and Cam Clarke, reprised their original roles, or voiced new characters in this game. The game was a relative success, even though many fans complained of the over-cartoonified look of the game.
* &quot;&quot; (2002) for the Game Boy Advance, a side-scrolling shooter that resembles the Japanese Super Famicom game &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;&quot; (2004) for the Microsoft Xbox and the Sony PlayStation 2. First-/third-person shooter. The gameplay covers the &quot;New Generation&quot; part of the story, with support for single player missions and multiplayer online matches. Features Cyclones, transformable body armor/motorcycles. As with &quot;Battlecry&quot;, several of the original voice actors reprised their roles. Unlike &quot;Battlecry&quot;, it is not backwards compatible with the Xbox 360.
* &quot;&quot; (2007) for mobile phones. A top-down scrolling shooter that covers the &quot;New Generation&quot; part of the story, leading up to the &quot;&quot;. The player can play as one of three characters (Scott, Rook and Rand), each with their own special weapons. The player also has the ability to change into &quot;Battloid Mode&quot; through the collection of Protoculture. &quot;Robotech: The New Generation&quot; features famous music from the TV series, as well as the most evil of all the villains.
*&quot;Robotech: The Macross Saga HD Edition&quot; (2021) for the Nintendo Switch. A remake of &quot;&quot; (2002) for the Game Boy Advance with new 3D models, dynamic lighting, enhanced effects, and high-definition backgrounds. As of March 2021, this title has only been made available on the Nintendo eShop in the Australia region.

==Reception of adaptation==
&quot;Robotech&quot; is often a polarizing subject amongst anime fans. Some critics look down upon the show for its extensive edits to the source material (Westernizing character names, editing for content and chiefly, forging a connection between previously unrelated series), while supporters of the adaptation have pointed out that the weaving of three unrelated series into a contiguous whole necessarily required reworking, and that it helped to maintain a slow but continuous rise in the consumption of anime in the US.

Series writer/actor Gregory Snegoff said in an interview on the now-defunct &quot;Shadow Chronicles News&quot; fansite that, &quot;afterward, we received compliments from the Japanese who thought our dialogue and stories were better than the original,&quot; likely a reference to the creators of the latter two series, both of whom worked with the team on &quot;The Sentinels&quot;. The producers of &quot;Megazone 23 – Part 1&quot; were very happy with the original plans for &quot;&quot; (where the incomplete film would have been added to the &quot;Robotech&quot; mythos to play part in &quot;The Sentinels&quot; storyline), and worked closely with Carl Macek to plan the new ending and animation. When the film reached a limited release, the new ending was released on a LaserDisc of &quot;Megazone 23&quot;, with the title &quot;Present For You.&quot; However, &quot;Animag&quot; magazine (issue 11) and &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine (issue 9, volume 4) reports that the staff of &quot;Macross&quot; at Studio Nue and Artland, such as the original story creator and mecha designer Shōji Kawamori and chief director Noboru Ishiguro, expressed their concern over the &quot;Robotech&quot; adaptation, and surprise at its differences.

In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Robotech&quot; as the 34th-greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.

In a review of &quot;The Macross Saga&quot; for &quot;NEO&quot;, David West considered it a landmark in Japanese animation and an essential watch for fans of the mecha genre. He considered its take on human issues such as love and death to be fresh and enduring, and although he found the animation to be not as up to date as the story, he considers the show impressive despite its age.

==Distribution==

Following the original broadcast, the series enjoyed popularity on home video in VHS and DVD formats from the following distributors:

<text>Radioteletype (RTTY) is a telecommunications system consisting originally of two or more electromechanical teleprinters in different locations connected by radio rather than a wired link. Radioteletype evolved from earlier landline teleprinter operations that began in the mid-1800s. The US Navy Department successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, Massachusetts, radio station to the RMS &quot;Majestic&quot;. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. From the 1980s, teleprinters were replaced by personal computers (PCs) running software to emulate teleprinters.

The term radioteletype is used to describe both the original radioteletype system, sometimes described as &quot;Baudot&quot;, as well as the entire family of systems connecting two or more teleprinters or PCs using software to emulate teleprinters, over radio, regardless of alphabet, link system or modulation.

In some applications, notably military and government, radioteletype is known by the acronym RATT (Radio Automatic Teletype).

==History==
Landline teleprinter operations began in 1849 when a circuit was put in service between Philadelphia and New York City. Émile Baudot designed a system using a five unit code in 1874 that is still in use today. Teleprinter system design was gradually improved until, at the beginning of World War II, it represented the principal distribution method used by the news services.

Radioteletype evolved from these earlier landline teleprinter operations. The US Department of the Navy successfully tested printing telegraphy between an airplane and ground radio station in August 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, MA radio station to the RMS &quot;Majestic&quot;. An early implementation of the Radioteletype was the Watsongraph, named after Detroit inventor Glenn Watson in March 1931. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US Military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. The Navy called radioteletype &quot;RATT&quot; (Radio Automatic Teletype) and the Army Signal Corps called radioteletype &quot;SCRT&quot;, an abbreviation of Single-Channel Radio Teletype. The military used frequency shift keying (FSK) technology and this technology proved very reliable even over long distances.

==Technical description==
A radioteletype station consists of three distinct parts: the Teletype or teleprinter, the modem and the radio.

The Teletype or teleprinter is an electromechanical or electronic device. The word &quot;Teletype&quot; was a trademark of the Teletype Corporation, so the terms &quot;TTY&quot;, &quot;RTTY&quot;, &quot;RATT&quot; and &quot;teleprinter&quot; are usually used to describe a generic device without reference to a particular manufacturer.

Electromechanical teleprinters are heavy, complex and noisy, and have largely been replaced with electronic units. The teleprinter includes a keyboard, which is the main means of entering text, and a printer or visual display unit (VDU). An alternative input device is a perforated tape reader and, more recently, computer storage media (such as floppy disks). Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.

The line output of a teleprinter can be at either digital logic levels (+5 V signifies a logical &quot;1&quot; or &quot;mark&quot; and 0 V signifies a logical &quot;0&quot; or &quot;space&quot;) or line levels (−80 V signifies a &quot;1&quot; and +80 V a &quot;0&quot;). When no traffic is passed, the line idles at the &quot;mark&quot; state.

When a key of the teleprinter keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit character is generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits a sequence of a &quot;start bit&quot; (a logical 0 or space), then one after the other the 5 data bits, finishing with a &quot;stop bit&quot; (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 data bits and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.

The 5 data bits allow for only 32 different codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two &quot;states&quot;, the &quot;unshifted&quot; or &quot;letters&quot; state and the &quot;shifted&quot; or &quot;numbers&quot; or &quot;figures&quot; state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes &quot;LETTERS&quot; and &quot;FIGURES&quot; are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the &quot;letters&quot; state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional &quot;third shift&quot; state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.

The modem is sometimes called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to one or the other of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125 Hz (US) or 2125/1955 Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the &quot;mark&quot; condition and the other to the &quot;space&quot; condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the &quot;mark&quot; or &quot;space&quot; input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.

On reception, the FSK signal is converted to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or &quot;beat frequency oscillator&quot;. These tones are fed to the demodulator part of the modem, which processes them through a series of filters and detectors to recreate the original digital signal. The FSK signals are audible on a communications radio receiver equipped with a BFO, and have a distinctive &quot;beedle-eeeedle-eedle-eee&quot; sound, usually starting and ending on one of the two tones (&quot;idle on mark&quot;).

The transmission speed is a characteristic of the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic of the modem. These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given transmission speed. Electronic teleprinters can readily operate in a variety of speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.

Today, both functions can be performed with modern computers equipped with digital signal processors or sound cards. The sound card performs the functions of the modem and the CPU performs the processing of the digital bits. This approach is very common in amateur radio, using specialized computer programs like fldigi, MMTTY or MixW.

Before the computer mass storage era, most RTTY stations stored text on paper tape using paper tape punchers and readers. The operator would type the message on the TTY keyboard and punch the code onto the tape. The tape could then be transmitted at a steady, high rate, without typing errors. A tape could be reused, and in some cases - especially for use with ASCII on NC Machines - might be made of plastic or even very thin metal material in order to be reused many times.

The most common test signal is a series of &quot;RYRYRY&quot; characters, as these form an alternating tone pattern exercising all bits and are easily recognized. Pangrams are also transmitted on RTTY circuits as test messages, the most common one being &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;, and in French circuits, &quot;Voyez le brick géant que j&#x27;examine près du wharf&quot;

==Technical specification==

The original (or &quot;Baudot&quot;) radioteletype system is based almost invariably on the Baudot code or ITA-2 5 bit alphabet. The link is based on character asynchronous transmission with 1 start bit and 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits. Transmitter modulation is normally FSK (F1B). Occasionally, an AFSK signal modulating an RF carrier (A2B, F2B) is used on VHF or UHF frequencies. Standard transmission speeds are 45.45, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 300 baud.

Common carrier shifts are 85 Hz (used on LF and VLF frequencies), 170 Hz, 425 Hz, 450 Hz and 850 Hz, although some stations use non-standard shifts. There are variations of the standard Baudot alphabet to cover languages written in Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek etc., using special techniques.

Some combinations of speed and shift are standardized for specific services using the original radioteletype system:

* Amateur radio transmissions are almost always 45.45 baud – 170 Hz, although 75 baud activity is being promoted by BARTG in the form of 4-hour contests.
* Radio amateurs have experimented with ITA-5 (7-bit ASCII) alphabet transmissions at 110 baud – 170 Hz.
* NATO military services use 75 or 100 baud – 850 Hz.
* A few naval stations still use RTTY without encryption for CARB (channel availability broadcasts).
* Commercial, diplomatic and weather services prefer 50 baud – 425 or 450 Hz.
* Russian (and in the past, Soviet Union) merchant marine communications use 50 baud – 170 Hz.
* RTTY transmissions on LF and VLF frequencies use a narrow shift of 85 Hz, due to the limited bandwidth of the antennas.

== Early amateur radioteletype history ==
After World War II, amateur radio operators in the U.S. started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. &quot;The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society&quot; was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to &quot;The VHF Teletype Society&quot; and started US amateur radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radio teletype contact (QSO) of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY, and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized.

In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY contact was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSW&#x27;s test transmissions. While contacts could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of &quot;The RTTY Society of Southern California&quot; publisher of &quot;RTTY&quot; and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of &quot;CQ Magazine&quot;, amateur radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40, and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of was specified. Amateur radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for amateur radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow amateur radio operators to use any shift that was 900 Hz or less.

The FCC &quot;Notice of Proposed Rule Making&quot; (NPRM) that resulted in the authorization of FSK in the amateur high frequency (HF) bands responded to petitions by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), the National Amateur Radio Council, and a Mr. Robert Weinstein. The NPRM specifically states this, and this information may be found in its entirety in the December 1951 issue of &quot;QST Magazine&quot;. While &quot;The New RTTY Handbook&quot; gives ARRL no credit, it was published by &quot;CQ Magazine&quot; and its author was a &quot;CQ&quot; columnist (&quot;CQ&quot; was generally hostile to the ARRL at that time).

The first RTTY Contest was held by the RTTY Society of Southern California from October 31 to November 1, 1953. Named the RTTY Sweepstakes Contest, twenty nine participants exchanged messages that contained a serial number, originating station call, check or RST report of two or three numbers, ARRL section of originator, local time (0000-2400 preferred) and date. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15. By the late 1950s, the contest exchange was expanded to include band used. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15 FORTY METERS. The contest was scored as follows: One point for each message sent and received entirely by RTTY and one point for each message received and acknowledged by RTTY. The final score was computed by multiplying the total number of message points by the number of ARRL sections worked. Two stations could exchange messages again on a different band for added points, but the section multiplier did not increase when the same section was reworked on a different band. Each DXCC entity was counted as an additional ARRL section for RTTY multiplier credit.

A new magazine named &quot;RTTY&quot;, later renamed &quot;RTTY Journal&quot;, also published the first listing of stations, mostly located in the continental US, that were interested in RTTY in 1956. Amateur radio operators used this callbook information to contact other operators both inside and outside the United States. For example, the first recorded USA to New Zealand two-way RTTY contact took place in 1956 between W0BP and ZL1WB.

By the late 1950s, new organizations focused on amateur radioteletype started to appear. The &quot;British Amateur Radio Teletype Group&quot;, BARTG, now known as the &quot;British Amateur Radio Teledata Group&quot; was formed in June 1959. The Florida RTTY Society was formed in September 1959. Amateur radio operators outside of Canada and the U.S. began to acquire surplus teleprinter and receive permission to get on the air. The first recorded RTTY contact in the U.K. occurred in September 1959 between G2UK and G3CQE. A few weeks later, G3CQE had the first G/VE RTTY QSO with VE7KX. This was quickly followed up by G3CQE QSOs with VK3KF and ZL3HJ. Information on how to acquire surplus teleprinter equipment continued to spread and before long it was possible to work all continents on RTTY.

Amateur radio operators used various equipment designs to get on the air using RTTY in the 1950s and 1960s. Amateurs used their existing receivers for RTTY operation but needed to add a terminal unit, sometimes called a demodulator, to convert the received audio signals to DC signals for the teleprinter.

Most of the terminal unit equipment used for receiving RTTY signals was home built, using designs published in amateur radio publications. These original designs can be divided into two classes of terminal units: audio-type and intermediate frequency converters. The audio-type converters proved to be more popular with amateur radio operators. The Twin City, W2JAV and W2PAT designs were examples of typical terminal units that were used into the middle 1960s. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of terminal units designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6. These designs were first published in &quot;RTTY Journal&quot; starting in September 1967 and ending in 1970.

An adaptation of the W6FFC TT/L terminal unit was developed by Keith Petersen, W8SDZ, and it was first published in the &quot;RTTY Journal&quot; in September 1967. The drafting of the schematic in the article was done by Ralph Leland, W8DLT.

Amateur radio operators needed to modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor in and out of the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters, and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better frequency stability across all amateur radio HF bands.

During the early days of Amateur RTTY, the RTTY Worked All Continents Award was conceived by the RTTY Society of Southern California and issued by RTTY Journal. The first amateur radio station to achieve this WAC – RTTY Award was VE7KX. The first stations recognized as having achieved single band WAC RTTY were W1MX (3.5 MHz); DL0TD (7.0 MHz); K3SWZ (14.0 MHz); W0MT (21.0 MHz) and FG7XT (28.0 MHz). The ARRL began issuing WAC RTTY certificates in 1969.

By the early 1970s, amateur radio RTTY had spread around the world and it was finally possible to work more than 100 countries via RTTY. FG7XT was the first amateur radio station to claim to achieve this honor. However, Jean did not submit his QSL cards for independent review. ON4BX, in 1971, was the first amateur radio station to submit his cards to the DX editor of &quot;RTTY Journal&quot; and to achieve this honor. The ARRL began issuing DXCC RTTY Awards on November 1, 1976. Prior to that date, an award for working 100 countries on RTTY was only available via RTTY Journal.

In the 1950s through the 1970s, &quot;RTTY art&quot; was a popular on-air activity. This consisted of (sometimes very elaborate and artistic) pictures sent over RTTY through the use of lengthy punched tape transmissions and then printed by the receiving station on paper.

On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 to allow faster RTTY speeds. Four standard RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60 words per minute () (45 baud), 67  (50 baud), 75  (56.25 baud), and 100  (75 baud). Many amateur radio operators had equipment that was capable of being upgraded to 75 and 100 words per minute by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100  operation, many amateur radio operators moved back to 60 . Some of the reasons for the failure of 100  HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170 Hz shift at 100 , and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.

The FCC approved the use of ASCII by amateur radio stations on March 17, 1980 with speeds up to 300 baud from 3.5 MHz to 21.25 MHz and 1200 baud between 28 MHz and 225 MHz. Speeds up to 19.2 kilobaud was authorized on amateur frequencies above 420 MHz.

These symbol rates were later modified:

The requirement for amateur radio operators in the U.S. to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each digital transmission, and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code, was finally lifted by the FCC on June 15, 1983.

== Comparison with other modes ==
RTTY has a typical baud rate for Amateur operation of 45.45 baud (approximately 60 words per minute). It remains popular as a &quot;keyboard to keyboard&quot; mode in Amateur Radio. RTTY has declined in commercial popularity as faster, more reliable alternative data modes have become available, using satellite or other connections.

For its transmission speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170 Hz shift at 45.45 baud requires around 250 Hz receiver bandwidth, more than double that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725 Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter does not need to use a linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.

RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, is moderately resistant to vagaries of HF propagation and interference, however modern digital modes, such as MFSK, use Forward Error Correction to provide much better data reliability.

== Primary users ==
Principally, the primary users are those who need robust shortwave communications. Examples are:
* All military departments, all over the world (using cryptography)
* Diplomatic services all over the world (using cryptography)
* Weather reports are transmitted by the US Coast Guard nearly continuously
* RTTY systems are also fielded by amateur radio operators, and are popular for long-distance contacts

One regular service transmitting RTTY meteorological information is the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst or DWD). The DWD regularly transmit two programs on various frequencies on LF and HF in standard RTTY (ITA-2 alphabet). The list of callsigns, frequencies, baud rates and shifts are as follows:

The DWD signals can be easily received in Europe, North Africa and parts of North America.

== Pronunciation ==
RTTY (in English) may be spoken as &quot;radioteletype&quot;, by its letters: R-T-T-Y, or simply as /ˈɹɪti/ or /ˈɹəti/

<doc id="26344" wikidata="Q1744743" url="?curid=26344" title="Register transfer language">
<text>In computer science, register transfer language (RTL) is a kind of intermediate representation (IR) that is very close to assembly language, such as that which is used in a compiler. It is used to describe data flow at the register-transfer level of an architecture. Academic papers and textbooks often use a form of RTL as an architecture-neutral assembly language. RTL is used as the name of a specific intermediate representation in several compilers, including the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Zephyr, and the European compiler projects CerCo and CompCert.

==History==

The idea behind RTL was first described in &quot;The Design and Application of a Retargetable Peephole Optimizer&quot;.

=== GCC ===
In GCC, RTL is generated from the GIMPLE representation, transformed by various passes in the GCC middle-end, and then converted to assembly language.

GCC&#x27;s RTL is usually written in a form that looks like a Lisp S-expression:

(set (reg: SI 140)
 (plus:SI (reg:SI 138)
 (reg: SI 139)))

This side-effect expression says &quot;sum the contents of register 138 with the contents of register 139 and store the result in register 140&quot;. The SI specifies the access mode for each register. In the example, it is &quot;SImode&quot;, i.e. &quot;access the register as 32-bit integer&quot;.

The sequence of RTL generated has some dependency on the characteristics of the processor for which GCC is generating code. However, the meaning of the RTL is more or less independent of the target: it would usually be possible to read and understand a piece of RTL without knowing what processor it was generated for. Similarly, the meaning of the RTL doesn&#x27;t usually depend on the program&#x27;s original high-level language.

A register transfer language is a system for expressing in symbolic form the microoperation sequences among the registers of a digital module. It is a convenient tool for describing the internal organization of digital computers in a concise and precise manner. It can also be used to facilitate the design process of digital systems.

<doc id="26346" wikidata="Q62270" url="?curid=26346" title="Remote procedure call">
<text>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared computer network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually, they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.

RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is also different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept.

==History and origins==
Request–response protocols date to early distributed computing in the late 1960s, theoretical proposals of remote procedure calls as the model of network operations date to the 1970s, and practical implementations date to the early 1980s. Bruce Jay Nelson is generally credited with coining the term &quot;remote procedure call&quot; in 1981.

Remote procedure calls used in modern operating systems trace their roots back to the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, which used a request-response communication protocol for process synchronization. The idea of treating network operations as remote procedure calls goes back at least to the 1970s in early ARPANET documents. In 1978, Per Brinch Hansen proposed Distributed Processes, a language for distributed computing based on &quot;external requests&quot; consisting of procedure calls between processes.

One of the earliest practical implementations was in 1982 by Brian Randell and colleagues for their Newcastle Connection between UNIX machines. This was soon followed by &quot;Lupine&quot; by Andrew Birrell and Bruce Nelson in the Cedar environment at Xerox PARC. Lupine automatically generated stubs, providing type-safe bindings, and used an efficient protocol for communication. One of the first business uses of RPC was by Xerox under the name &quot;Courier&quot; in 1981. The first popular implementation of RPC on Unix was Sun&#x27;s RPC (now called ONC RPC), used as the basis for Network File System (NFS).

In the 1990s, with the popularity of object-oriented programming, an alternative model of remote method invocation (RMI) was widely implemented, such as in Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA, 1991) and Java remote method invocation. RMIs, in turn, fell in popularity with the rise of the internet, particularly in the 2000s.

==Message passing==
RPC is a request–response protocol. An RPC is initiated by the &quot;client&quot;, which sends a request message to a known remote &quot;server&quot; to execute a specified procedure with supplied parameters. The remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. While the server is processing the call, the client is blocked (it waits until the server has finished processing before resuming execution), unless the client sends an asynchronous request to the server, such as an XMLHttpRequest. There are many variations and subtleties in various implementations, resulting in a variety of different (incompatible) RPC protocols.

An important difference between remote procedure calls and local calls is that remote calls can fail because of unpredictable network problems. Also, callers generally must deal with such failures without knowing whether the remote procedure was actually invoked. Idempotent procedures (those that have no additional effects if called more than once) are easily handled, but enough difficulties remain that code to call remote procedures is often confined to carefully written low-level subsystems.

===Sequence of events===
# The client calls the client stub. The call is a local procedure call, with parameters pushed on to the stack in the normal way.
# The client stub packs the parameters into a message and makes a system call to send the message. Packing the parameters is called marshalling.
# The client&#x27;s local operating system sends the message from the client machine to the server machine.
# The local operating system on the server machine passes the incoming packets to the server stub.
# The server stub unpacks the parameters from the message. Unpacking the parameters is called unmarshalling.
# Finally, the server stub calls the server procedure. The reply traces the same steps in the reverse direction.

==Standard contact mechanisms==
To let different clients access servers, a number of standardized RPC systems have been created. Most of these use an interface description language (IDL) to let various platforms call the RPC. The IDL files can then be used to generate code to interface between the client and servers.

<doc id="26347" wikidata="Q217463" url="?curid=26347" title="Russian submarine Kursk (K-141)">
<text>K-141 &quot;Kursk&quot; () was an Oscar II-class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine of the Russian Navy. On 12 August 2000, K-141 &quot;Kursk&quot; was lost when it sank in the Barents Sea, killing all 118 personnel on board.

== Construction ==

K-141 &quot;Kursk&quot; was a Project 949A class &quot;Antey&quot; () submarine of the Oscar class, known as the Oscar II by its NATO reporting name, and was the penultimate submarine of the Oscar II class designed and approved in the Soviet Union. Construction began in 1990 at the Soviet Navy military shipyards in Severodvinsk, near Arkhangelsk, in the northern Russian SFSR. During the construction of K-141, the Soviet Union collapsed; work continued, and she became one of the first naval vessels completed after the collapse. In 1993 K-141 was named &quot;Kursk&quot; after the Battle of Kursk in the 50-year anniversary of this battle. K-141 was inherited by Russia and launched in 1994, before being commissioned by the Russian Navy on 30 December, as part of the Russian Northern Fleet.

&quot;Kursk&quot; was assigned to the home port of Vidyayevo, Murmansk Oblast.

== Capabilities ==

The Antey design represented the highest achievement of Soviet nuclear submarine technology. They are the second-largest cruise missile submarines ever built, after some ballistic missile submarines that were converted to carry cruise missiles in 2007. It was built to defeat an entire United States aircraft carrier group. A single Type 65 torpedo carried a warhead powerful enough to sink an aircraft carrier. Both missiles and torpedoes could be equipped with nuclear warheads. She was longer than the preceding Oscar I-class of submarines. The senior officers had individual cabins and the entire crew had access to a gymnasium.

The outer hull, made of high-nickel, high-chromium stainless steel thick, had exceptionally good resistance to corrosion and a weak magnetic signature which helped prevent detection by U.S. magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) systems. There was a gap to the -thick steel pressure hull. She was designed to remain submerged for up to 120 days. The sail superstructure was reinforced to allow it to break through the Arctic ice.
The submarine was armed with 24 SS-N-19/P-700 Granit cruise missiles, and eight torpedo tubes in the bow: four and four . The Granit missiles with a range of , were capable of supersonic flight at altitudes over . They were designed to swarm enemy vessels and intelligently choose individual targets which terminated with a dive onto the target. The torpedo tubes could be used to launch either torpedoes or anti-ship missiles with a range of . Her weapons included 18 SS-N-16 &quot;Stallion&quot; anti-submarine missiles.

&quot;Kursk&quot; was part of Russia&#x27;s Northern Fleet, which had suffered funding cutbacks throughout the 1990s. Many of its submarines were anchored and rusting in Zapadnaya Litsa Naval Base, from Murmansk. Little work to maintain all but the most essential front-line equipment, including search and rescue equipment, had occurred. Northern Fleet sailors had gone unpaid in the mid-1990s.

== Deployments ==

During her five years of service, &quot;Kursk&quot; completed only one mission, a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea during the summer of 1999 to monitor the United States Sixth Fleet responding to the Kosovo crisis. As a result, many of her crew had spent little time at sea and were inexperienced.

== Naval exercise and disaster ==
&quot;Kursk&quot; joined the &quot;Summer-X&quot; exercise, the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade, on 10 August 2000. It included 30 ships including the fleet&#x27;s flagship &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot;, four attack submarines, and a flotilla of smaller ships. The crew had recently won a citation for its excellent performance and had been recognized as the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet. While it was on an exercise, &quot;Kursk&quot; loaded a full complement of combat weapons. It was one of the few vessels authorized to carry a combat load at all times.

=== Explosion ===

On the first day of the exercise, &quot;Kursk&quot; successfully launched a Granit missile armed with a dummy warhead. Two days later, on the morning of 12 August, &quot;Kursk&quot; prepared to fire dummy torpedoes at the &quot;Pyotr Velikiy&quot;. These practice torpedoes had no explosive warheads and were manufactured and tested at a much lower quality standard. On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 UTC), there was an explosion while preparing to fire. The Russian Navy&#x27;s final report on the disaster concluded the explosion was due to the failure of one of &quot;Kursk&quot; hydrogen peroxide-fueled Type 65 torpedoes. A subsequent investigation concluded that high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide used as propellant for the torpedo, seeped through a faulty weld in the torpedo casing. When HTP comes into contact with a catalyst, it rapidly expands by a factor of 5000, generating vast quantities of steam and oxygen. The pressure produced by the expanding HTP ruptured the kerosene fuel tank in the torpedo and set off an explosion equal to of TNT. The submarine sank in relatively shallow water, bottoming at about off Severomorsk, at . A second explosion 135 seconds after the initial event was equivalent to 3-7 tons of TNT. The explosions blew a large hole in the hull and caused the first three compartments of the submarine to collapse, killing or incapacitating all but 23 of the 118 personnel on board.

=== Rescue attempts ===
The British and Norwegian navies offered assistance, but Russia initially refused all help. All 118 sailors and officers aboard &quot;Kursk&quot; died. The Russian Admiralty initially told the public that the majority of the crew died within minutes of the explosion. On 21 August, Norwegian and Russian divers found 24 bodies in the ninth compartment, the turbine room at the stern of the boat. Captain-lieutenant Dmitri Kolesnikov wrote a note listing the names of 23 sailors who were alive in the compartment after the boat sank.

&quot;Kursk&quot; carried a potassium superoxide cartridge of a chemical oxygen generator; these are used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen during an emergency. However, the cartridge became contaminated with sea water and the resulting chemical reaction caused a flash fire which consumed the available oxygen. The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived the fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Ultimately, the remaining crew burned to death or suffocated.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, though immediately informed of the tragedy, was told by the navy that they had the situation under control and that rescue was imminent. He waited for five days before ending his holiday at a presidential resort in Sochi on the Black Sea. Putin was only four months into his tenure as president, and the public and media were extremely critical of his decision to remain at a seaside resort. His highly favourable ratings dropped dramatically. The president&#x27;s response appeared callous and the government&#x27;s actions looked incompetent. A year later he said, &quot;I probably should have returned to Moscow, but nothing would have changed. I had the same level of communication both in Sochi and in Moscow, but from a PR point of view I could have demonstrated some special eagerness to return.&quot;

==Submarine recovery==
A consortium formed by the Dutch companies Mammoet and Smit International was awarded a contract by Russia to raise the vessel, excluding the bow. They modified the barge &quot;Giant 4&quot; which raised &quot;Kursk&quot; and recovered the remains of the sailors.

During salvage operations in 2001, the team first cut the bow off the hull using a tungsten carbide-studded cable. As this tool had the potential to cause sparks which could ignite remaining pockets of reactive gases, such as hydrogen, the operation was executed with care. Most of the bow was abandoned and the rest of the vessel was towed to Severomorsk and placed in a floating dry dock for analysis.

The remains of &quot;Kursk&quot;s reactor compartment were towed to Sayda Bay on Russia&#x27;s northern Kola Peninsula, where more than 50 reactor compartments were afloat at pier points, after a shipyard had removed all the fuel from the boat in early 2003.

Some torpedo and torpedo tube fragments from the bow were recovered and the rest was destroyed by explosives in 2002.

==Official inquiry results==
Notwithstanding the navy&#x27;s oft-stated position that a collision with a foreign vessel had triggered the event, a report issued by the government attributed the disaster to a torpedo explosion caused when high-test peroxide (HTP), a form of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide, leaked from a faulty weld in the torpedo&#x27;s casing. The report found that the initial explosion destroyed the torpedo room compartment and killed everyone in the first compartment. The blast entered the second and perhaps the third and fourth compartments through an air conditioning vent. All of the 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the blast wave and possibly killed. The first explosion caused a fire that raised the temperature of the compartment to more than . The heat caused the warheads of between five and seven additional torpedoes to detonate, creating an explosion equivalent to 2–3 tons of TNT that measured 4.2 on the Richter magnitude scale on seismographs across Europe and was detected as far away as Alaska.

=== Alternative explanation ===
Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev differed with the government&#x27;s official conclusion. He cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. During the examination of the wrecked sub, investigators recovered a partially burned copy of the safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an air valve. The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected &quot;Kursk&quot;″s crew&#x27;s qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. &quot;Kursk&quot;″s crew had no experience with HTP-powered torpedoes and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP-powered torpedoes. Due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because the &quot;Kursk&quot;″s crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, Ryazantsev believes they set off a chain of events that led to the explosion.

<text>Radiation therapy or radiotherapy (RT, RTx, or XRT) is a treatment using ionizing radiation, generally provided as part of cancer therapy to either kill or control the growth of malignant cells. It is normally delivered by a linear particle accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body, and have not spread to other parts. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology. A physician who practices in this subspecialty is a radiation oncologist.

Radiation therapy is commonly applied to the cancerous tumor because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of cancerous tissue leading to cellular death. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through to treat the tumor), shaped radiation beams are aimed from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding healthy tissue. Besides the tumor itself, the radiation fields may also include the draining lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with the tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of subclinical malignant spread. It is necessary to include a margin of normal tissue around the tumor to allow for uncertainties in daily set-up and internal tumor motion. These uncertainties can be caused by internal movement (for example, respiration and bladder filling) and movement of external skin marks relative to the tumor position.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation, and is distinct from radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis. Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure or for adjuvant therapy. It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way.

The precise treatment intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate, and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.
==Medical uses==

It is estimated that half of the US&#x27; 1.2M invasive cancer cases diagnosed in 2022 received radiation therapy in their treatment program. Different cancers respond to radiation therapy in different ways.

The response of a cancer to radiation is described by its radiosensitivity.
Highly radiosensitive cancer cells are rapidly killed by modest doses of radiation. These include leukemias, most lymphomas, and germ cell tumors.
The majority of epithelial cancers are only moderately radiosensitive, and require a significantly higher dose of radiation (60–70 Gy) to achieve a radical cure.
Some types of cancer are notably radioresistant, that is, much higher doses are required to produce a radical cure than may be safe in clinical practice. Renal cell cancer and melanoma are generally considered to be radioresistant but radiation therapy is still a palliative option for many patients with metastatic melanoma. Combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy is an active area of investigation and has shown some promise for melanoma and other cancers.

It is important to distinguish the radiosensitivity of a particular tumor, which to some extent is a laboratory measure, from the radiation &quot;curability&quot; of a cancer in actual clinical practice. For example, leukemias are not generally curable with radiation therapy, because they are disseminated through the body. Lymphoma may be radically curable if it is localized to one area of the body. Similarly, many of the common, moderately radioresponsive tumors are routinely treated with curative doses of radiation therapy if they are at an early stage. For example, non-melanoma skin cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, anal cancer, and prostate cancer. With the exception of oligometastatic disease, metastatic cancers are incurable with radiation therapy because it is not possible to treat the whole body.

Modern radiation therapy relies on a CT scan to identify the tumor and surrounding normal structures and to perform dose calculations for the creation of a complex radiation treatment plan. The patient receives small skin marks to guide the placement of treatment fields. Patient positioning is crucial at this stage as the patient will have to be placed in an identical position during each treatment. Many patient positioning devices have been developed for this purpose, including masks and cushions which can be molded to the patient. Image-guided radiation therapy is a method that uses imaging to correct for positional errors of each treatment session.

The response of a tumor to radiation therapy is also related to its size. Due to complex radiobiology, very large tumors are affected less by radiation compared to smaller tumors or microscopic disease. Various strategies are used to overcome this effect. The most common technique is surgical resection prior to radiation therapy. This is most commonly seen in the treatment of breast cancer with wide local excision or mastectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Another method is to shrink the tumor with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical radiation therapy. A third technique is to enhance the radiosensitivity of the cancer by giving certain drugs during a course of radiation therapy. Examples of radiosensitizing drugs include cisplatin, nimorazole, and cetuximab.

The impact of radiotherapy varies between different types of cancer and different groups. For example, for breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy has been found to halve the rate at which the disease recurs. In pancreatic cancer, radiotherapy has increased survival times for inoperable tumors.

==Side effects==
Radiation therapy (RT) is in itself painless, but has iatrogenic side effect risks. Many low-dose palliative treatments (for example, radiation therapy to bony metastases) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain flare-up can be experienced in the days following treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient. Serious radiation complications may occur in 5% of RT cases. Acute (near immediate) or sub-acute (2 to 3 months post RT) radiation side effects may develop after 50 Gy RT dosing. Late or delayed radiation injury (6 months to decades) may develop after 65 Gy.

Most side effects are predictable and expected. Side effects from radiation are usually limited to the area of the patient&#x27;s body that is under treatment. Side effects are dose-dependent; for example, higher doses of head and neck radiation can be associated with cardiovascular complications, thyroid dysfunction, and pituitary axis dysfunction. Modern radiation therapy aims to reduce side effects to a minimum and to help the patient understand and deal with side effects that are unavoidable.

The main side effects reported are fatigue and skin irritation, like a mild to moderate sun burn. The fatigue often sets in during the middle of a course of treatment and can last for weeks after treatment ends. The irritated skin will heal, but may not be as elastic as it was before.

===Acute side effects===
; Nausea and vomiting
:This is not a general side effect of radiation therapy, and mechanistically is associated only with treatment of the stomach or abdomen (which commonly react a few hours after treatment), or with radiation therapy to certain nausea-producing structures in the head during treatment of certain head and neck tumors, most commonly the vestibules of the inner ears. As with any distressing treatment, some patients vomit immediately during radiotherapy, or even in anticipation of it, but this is considered a psychological response. Nausea for any reason can be treated with antiemetics.
; Damage to the epithelial surfaces
:Epithelial surfaces may sustain damage from radiation therapy. Depending on the area being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa, and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and for up to about one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation is uncomfortable, recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.
; Mouth, throat and stomach sores
:If the head and neck area is treated, temporary soreness and ulceration commonly occur in the mouth and throat. If severe, this can affect swallowing, and the patient may need painkillers and nutritional support/food supplements. The esophagus can also become sore if it is treated directly, or if, as commonly occurs, it receives a dose of collateral radiation during treatment of lung cancer. When treating liver malignancies and metastases, it is possible for collateral radiation to cause gastric, stomach, or duodenal ulcers This collateral radiation is commonly caused by non-targeted delivery (reflux) of the radioactive agents being infused. Methods, techniques and devices are available to lower the occurrence of this type of adverse side effect.
; Intestinal discomfort
:The lower bowel may be treated directly with radiation (treatment of rectal or anal cancer) or be exposed by radiation therapy to other pelvic structures (prostate, bladder, female genital tract). Typical symptoms are soreness, diarrhoea, and nausea. Nutritional interventions may be able to help with diarrhoea associated with radiotherapy. Studies in people having pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer found that changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment.
; Swelling
:As part of the general inflammation that occurs, swelling of soft tissues may cause problems during radiation therapy. This is a concern during treatment of brain tumors and brain metastases, especially where there is pre-existing raised intracranial pressure or where the tumor is causing near-total obstruction of a lumen (e.g., trachea or main bronchus). Surgical intervention may be considered prior to treatment with radiation. If surgery is deemed unnecessary or inappropriate, the patient may receive steroids during radiation therapy to reduce swelling.
; Infertility
:The gonads (ovaries and testicles) are very sensitive to radiation. They may be unable to produce gametes following direct exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if they are not the primary area of treatment.

===Late side effects===
Late side effects occur months to years after treatment and are generally limited to the area that has been treated. They are often due to damage of blood vessels and connective tissue cells. Many late effects are reduced by fractionating treatment into smaller parts.

; Fibrosis
: Tissues which have been irradiated tend to become less elastic over time due to a diffuse scarring process.
; Epilation
: Epilation (hair loss) may occur on any hair bearing skin with doses above 1 Gy. It only occurs within the radiation field(s). Hair loss may be permanent with a single dose of 10 Gy, but if the dose is fractionated permanent hair loss may not occur until dose exceeds 45 Gy.
; Dryness
: The salivary glands and tear glands have a radiation tolerance of about 30 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical head and neck cancer treatments. Dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient&#x27;s quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend to stop working, and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.
;Chronic sinus drainage
:Radiation therapy treatments to the head and neck regions for soft tissue, palate or bone cancer can cause chronic sinus tract draining and fistulae from the bone.
; Lymphedema
: Lymphedema, a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling, can result from damage to the lymphatic system sustained during radiation therapy. It is the most commonly reported complication in breast radiation therapy patients who receive adjuvant axillary radiotherapy following surgery to clear the axillary lymph nodes .
; Cancer
: Radiation is a potential cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen in some patients. Cancer survivors are already more likely than the general population to develop malignancies due to a number of factors including lifestyle choices, genetics, and previous radiation treatment. It is difficult to directly quantify the rates of these secondary cancers from any single cause. Studies have found radiation therapy as the cause of secondary malignancies for only a small minority of patients, e.g., exposure to ionizing radiation is an identified risk factor for subsequent glioma; see main topic Glioma#Causes. The combined risk of a radiation-induced glioblastoma or astrocytoma within 15 years of the initial radiotherapy is 0.5-2.7%.

: New techniques such as proton beam therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy which aim to reduce dose to healthy tissues will lower these risks. It starts to occur 4–6 years following treatment, although some haematological malignancies may develop within 3 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer even in pediatric malignancies which carry a higher burden of secondary malignancies.
; Cardiovascular disease
: Radiation can increase the risk of heart disease and death as observed in previous breast cancer RT regimens. Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) by 1.5 to 4 times a person&#x27;s normal rate, aggravating factors included. The increase is dose dependent, related to the RT&#x27;s dose strength, volume and location. Use of concomitant chemotherapy, e.g. anthracyclines, is an aggravating risk factor. The occurrence rate of RT induced cardiovascular disease is estimated between 10 and 30%.

: Cardiovascular late side effects have been termed radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) and radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RIVD). Symptoms are dose dependent and include cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart arrhythmia and peripheral artery disease. Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular cell damage and oxidative stress can lead to these and other late side effect symptoms. Most radiation-induced cardiovascular diseases occur 10 or more years post treatment, making causality determinations more difficult.
; Cognitive decline
: In cases of radiation applied to the head radiation therapy may cause cognitive decline. Cognitive decline was especially apparent in young children, between the ages of 5 and 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5-year-old children declined each year after treatment by several IQ points.

; Radiation enteropathy
: The gastrointestinal tract can be damaged following abdominal and pelvic radiotherapy. Atrophy, fibrosis and vascular changes produce malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea and bleeding with bile acid diarrhea and vitamin B12 malabsorption commonly found due to ileal involvement. Pelvic radiation disease includes radiation proctitis, producing bleeding, diarrhoea and urgency, and can also cause radiation cystitis when the bladder is affected.
; Lung injury
: Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) encompasses radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Lung tissue is sensitive to ionizing radiation, tolerating only 18–20 Gy, a fraction of typical therapeutic dosage levels. The lung&#x27;s terminal airways and associated alveoli can become damaged, preventing effective respiratory gas exchange. The adverse effects of radiation are often asymptomatic with clinically significant RILI occurrence rates varying widely in literature, affecting 5–25% of those treated for thoracic and mediastinal malignancies and 1–5% of those treated for breast cancer.
; Radiation-induced polyneuropathy
: Radiation treatments may damage nerves near the target area or within the delivery path as nerve tissue is also radiosensitive. Nerve damage from ionizing radiation occurs in phases, the initial phase from microvascular injury, capillary damage and nerve demyelination. Subsequent damage occurs from vascular constriction and nerve compression due to uncontrolled fibrous tissue growth caused by radiation. Radiation-induced polyneuropathy, ICD-10-CM Code G62.82, occurs in approximately 1–5% of those receiving radiation therapy.

: Depending upon the irradiated zone, late effect neuropathy may occur in either the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS for example, cranial nerve injury typically presents as a visual acuity loss 1–14 years post treatment. In the PNS, injury to the plexus nerves presents as radiation-induced brachial plexopathy or radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy appearing up to 3 decades post treatment.

: Myokymia (muscle cramping, spasms or twitching) may develop. Radiation-induced nerve injury, chronic compressive neuropathies and polyradiculopathies are the most common cause of myokymic discharges. Clinically, the majority of patients receiving radiation therapy have measurable myokymic discharges within their field of radiation which present as focal or segmental myokymia. Common areas affected include the arms, legs or face depending upon the location of nerve injury. Myokymia is more frequent when radiation doses exceed 10 gray (Gy).
;Radiation necrosis
:Radiation necrosis is the death of healthy tissue near the irradiated site. It is a type of coagulative necrosis that occurs because the radiation directly or indirectly damages blood vessels in the area, which reduces the blood supply to the remaining healthy tissue, causing it to die by ischemia, similar to what happens in an ischemic stroke. Because it is an indirect effect of the treatment, it occurs months to decades after radiation exposure. Radiation necrosis most commonly presents as osteoradionecrosis, vaginal radionecrosis, soft tissue radionecrosis, or laryngeal radionecrosis.

===Cumulative side effects===
Cumulative effects from this process should not be confused with long-term effects – when short-term effects have disappeared and long-term effects are subclinical, reirradiation can still be problematic. These doses are calculated by the radiation oncologist and many factors are taken into account before the subsequent radiation takes place.

===Effects on reproduction===
During the first two weeks after fertilization, radiation therapy is lethal but not teratogenic. High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce anomalies, impaired growth and intellectual disability, and there may be an increased risk of childhood leukemia and other tumors in the offspring.

In males previously having undergone radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy. However, the use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk.

===Effects on pituitary system===
Hypopituitarism commonly develops after radiation therapy for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumors, head and neck tumors, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies. 40–50% of children treated for childhood cancer develop some endocrine side effect. Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects growth hormone and gonadal hormones. In contrast, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced hypopituitarism. Changes in prolactin-secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency appears to be very rare as a consequence of radiation.

===Effects on subsequent surgery===
Delayed tissue injury with impaired wound healing capability often develops after receiving doses in excess of 65 Gy. A diffuse injury pattern due to the external beam radiotherapy&#x27;s holographic isodosing occurs. While the targeted tumor receives the majority of radiation, healthy tissue at incremental distances from the center of the tumor are also irradiated in a diffuse pattern due to beam divergence. These wounds demonstrate progressive, proliferative endarteritis, inflamed arterial linings that disrupt the tissue&#x27;s blood supply. Such tissue ends up chronically hypoxic, fibrotic, and without an adequate nutrient and oxygen supply. Surgery of previously irradiated tissue has a very high failure rate, e.g. women who have received radiation for breast cancer develop late effect chest wall tissue fibrosis and hypovascularity, making successful reconstruction and healing difficult, if not impossible.

===Radiation therapy accidents===
There are rigorous procedures in place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine Therac-25 was responsible for at least six accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in Missouri overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly.

Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and other members of the radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. In 2010 the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) launched a safety initiative called Target Safely that, among other things, aimed to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from recurring. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients to ask their doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.

==Use in non-cancerous diseases==
Radiation therapy is used to treat early stage Dupuytren&#x27;s disease and Ledderhose disease. When Dupuytren&#x27;s disease is at the nodules and cords stage or fingers are at a minimal deformation stage of less than 10 degrees, then radiation therapy is used to prevent further progress of the disease. Radiation therapy is also used post surgery in some cases to prevent the disease continuing to progress. Low doses of radiation are used typically three gray of radiation for five days, with a break of three months followed by another phase of three gray of radiation for five days.

==Technique==

===Mechanism of action===
Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells and can cause them to undergo mitotic catastrophe. This DNA damage is caused by one of two types of energy, photon or charged particle. This damage is either direct or indirect ionization of the atoms which make up the DNA chain. Indirect ionization happens as a result of the ionization of water, forming free radicals, notably hydroxyl radicals, which then damage the DNA.

In photon therapy, most of the radiation effect is through free radicals. Cells have mechanisms for repairing single-strand DNA damage and double-stranded DNA damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are much more difficult to repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo cell death. Cancer cells are generally less differentiated and more stem cell-like; they reproduce more than most healthy differentiated cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells&#x27; DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.

One of the major limitations of photon radiation therapy is that the cells of solid tumors become deficient in oxygen. Solid tumors can outgrow their blood supply, causing a low-oxygen state known as hypoxia. Oxygen is a potent radiosensitizer, increasing the effectiveness of a given dose of radiation by forming DNA-damaging free radicals. Tumor cells in a hypoxic environment may be as much as 2 to 3 times more resistant to radiation damage than those in a normal oxygen environment. Much research has been devoted to overcoming hypoxia including the use of high pressure oxygen tanks, hyperthermia therapy (heat therapy which dilates blood vessels to the tumor site), blood substitutes that carry increased oxygen, hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs such as misonidazole and metronidazole, and hypoxic cytotoxins (tissue poisons), such as tirapazamine. Newer research approaches are currently being studied, including preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound such as trans sodium crocetinate as a radiosensitizer.

Charged particles such as protons and boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (linear energy transfer) and have an antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue – the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for a good example of the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT&#x27;s use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers). This X-ray exposure is especially bad for children, due to their growing bodies, and while depending on a multitude of factors, they are around 10 times more sensitive to developing secondary malignancies after radiotherapy as compared to adults.

===Dose===
The amount of radiation used in photon radiation therapy is measured in grays (Gy), and varies depending on the type and stage of cancer being treated. For curative cases, the typical dose for a solid epithelial tumor ranges from 60 to 80 Gy, while lymphomas are treated with 20 to 40 Gy.

Preventive (adjuvant) doses are typically around 45–60 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy fractions (for breast, head, and neck cancers.) Many other factors are considered by radiation oncologists when selecting a dose, including whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, whether radiation therapy is being administered before or after surgery, and the degree of success of surgery.

Delivery parameters of a prescribed dose are determined during treatment planning (part of dosimetry). Treatment planning is generally performed on dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software. Depending on the radiation delivery method, several angles or sources may be used to sum to the total necessary dose. The planner will try to design a plan that delivers a uniform prescription dose to the tumor and minimizes dose to surrounding healthy tissues.

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions may be evaluated using the dosimetry technique known as gel dosimetry.

====Fractionation====
The total dose is fractionated (spread out over time) for several important reasons. Fractionation allows normal cells time to recover, while tumor cells are generally less efficient in repair between fractions. Fractionation also allows tumor cells that were in a relatively radio-resistant phase of the cell cycle during one treatment to cycle into a sensitive phase of the cycle before the next fraction is given. Similarly, tumor cells that were chronically or acutely hypoxic (and therefore more radioresistant) may reoxygenate between fractions, improving the tumor cell kill.

Fractionation regimens are individualised between different radiation therapy centers and even between individual doctors. In North America, Australia, and Europe, the typical fractionation schedule for adults is 1.8 to 2 Gy per day, five days a week. In some cancer types, prolongation of the fraction schedule over too long can allow for the tumor to begin repopulating, and for these tumor types, including head-and-neck and cervical squamous cell cancers, radiation treatment is preferably completed within a certain amount of time. For children, a typical fraction size may be 1.5 to 1.8 Gy per day, as smaller fraction sizes are associated with reduced incidence and severity of late-onset side effects in normal tissues.

In some cases, two fractions per day are used near the end of a course of treatment. This schedule, known as a concomitant boost regimen or hyperfractionation, is used on tumors that regenerate more quickly when they are smaller. In particular, tumors in the head-and-neck demonstrate this behavior.

Patients receiving palliative radiation to treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive more than a single fraction of radiation. A single treatment gives comparable pain relief and morbidity outcomes to multiple-fraction treatments, and for patients with limited life expectancy, a single treatment is best to improve patient comfort.

====Schedules for fractionation====
One fractionation schedule that is increasingly being used and continues to be studied is hypofractionation. This is a radiation treatment in which the total dose of radiation is divided into large doses. Typical doses vary significantly by cancer type, from 2.2 Gy/fraction to 20 Gy/fraction, the latter being typical of stereotactic treatments (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy, or SABR – also known as SBRT, or stereotactic body radiotherapy) for subcranial lesions, or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) for intracranial lesions. The rationale of hypofractionation is to reduce the probability of local recurrence by denying clonogenic cells the time they require to reproduce and also to exploit the radiosensitivity of some tumors. In particular, stereotactic treatments are intended to destroy clonogenic cells by a process of ablation, i.e., the delivery of a dose intended to destroy clonogenic cells directly, rather than to interrupt the process of clonogenic cell division repeatedly (apoptosis), as in routine radiotherapy.

==== Estimation of dose based on target sensitivity ====
Different cancer types have different radiation sensitivity. While predicting the sensitivity based on genomic or proteomic analyses of biopsy samples has proven challenging, the predictions of radiation effect on individual patients from genomic signatures of intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity have been shown to associate with clinical outcome. An alternative approach to genomics and proteomics was offered by the discovery that radiation protection in microbes is offered by non-enzymatic complexes of manganese and small organic metabolites. The content and variation of manganese (measurable by electron paramagnetic resonance) were found to be good predictors of radiosensitivity, and this finding extends also to human cells. An association was confirmed between total cellular manganese contents and their variation, and clinically inferred radioresponsiveness in different tumor cells, a finding that may be useful for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment of cancer patients.

==Types==
Historically, the three main divisions of radiation therapy are:
* external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy;
* brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy; and
* systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy.
The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel.

Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions.

A review of radiation therapy randomised clinical trials from 2018 to 2021 found many practice-changing data and new concepts that emerge from RCTs, identifying techniques that improve the therapeutic ratio, techniques that lead to more tailored treatments, stressing the importance of patient satisfaction, and identifying areas that require further study.

===External beam radiation therapy===

The following three sections refer to treatment using X-rays.

====Conventional external beam radiation therapy====

Historically conventional external beam radiation therapy (2DXRT) was delivered via two-dimensional beams using kilovoltage therapy X-ray units, medical linear accelerators that generate high-energy X-rays, or with machines that were similar to a linear accelerator in appearance, but used a sealed radioactive source like the one shown above. 2DXRT mainly consists of a single beam of radiation delivered to the patient from several directions: often front or back, and both sides.

&quot;Conventional&quot; refers to the way the treatment is &quot;planned&quot; or &quot;simulated&quot; on a specially calibrated diagnostic X-ray machine known as a simulator because it recreates the linear accelerator actions (or sometimes by eye), and to the usually well-established arrangements of the radiation beams to achieve a desired &quot;plan&quot;. The aim of simulation is to accurately target or localize the volume which is to be treated. This technique is well established and is generally quick and reliable. The worry is that some high-dose treatments may be limited by the radiation toxicity capacity of healthy tissues which lie close to the target tumor volume.

An example of this problem is seen in radiation of the prostate gland, where the sensitivity of the adjacent rectum limited the dose which could be safely prescribed using 2DXRT planning to such an extent that tumor control may not be easily achievable. Prior to the invention of the CT, physicians and physicists had limited knowledge about the true radiation dosage delivered to both cancerous and healthy tissue. For this reason, 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy has become the standard treatment for almost all tumor sites. More recently other forms of imaging are used including MRI, PET, SPECT and Ultrasound.

====Stereotactic radiation====

Stereotactic radiation is a specialized type of external beam radiation therapy. It uses focused radiation beams targeting a well-defined tumor using extremely detailed imaging scans. Radiation oncologists perform stereotactic treatments, often with the help of a neurosurgeon for tumors in the brain or spine.

There are two types of stereotactic radiation. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is when doctors use a single or several stereotactic radiation treatments of the brain or spine. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) refers to one or several stereotactic radiation treatments with the body, such as the lungs.

Some doctors say an advantage to stereotactic treatments is that they deliver the right amount of radiation to the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional treatments, which can often take 6 to 11 weeks. Plus treatments are given with extreme accuracy, which should limit the effect of the radiation on healthy tissues. One problem with stereotactic treatments is that they are only suitable for certain small tumors.

Stereotactic treatments can be confusing because many hospitals call the treatments by the name of the manufacturer rather than calling it SRS or SBRT. Brand names for these treatments include Axesse, Cyberknife, Gamma Knife, Novalis, Primatom, Synergy, X-Knife, TomoTherapy, Trilogy and Truebeam. This list changes as equipment manufacturers continue to develop new, specialized technologies to treat cancers.

====Virtual simulation, and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy====

The planning of radiation therapy treatment has been revolutionized by the ability to delineate tumors and adjacent normal structures in three dimensions using specialized CT and/or MRI scanners and planning software.

Virtual simulation, the most basic form of planning, allows more accurate placement of radiation beams than is possible using conventional X-rays, where soft-tissue structures are often difficult to assess and normal tissues difficult to protect.

An enhancement of virtual simulation is 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), in which the profile of each radiation beam is shaped to fit the profile of the target from a beam&#x27;s eye view (BEV) using a multileaf collimator (MLC) and a variable number of beams. When the treatment volume conforms to the shape of the tumor, the relative toxicity of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues is reduced, allowing a higher dose of radiation to be delivered to the tumor than conventional techniques would allow.

==== Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) ====

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced type of high-precision radiation that is the next generation of 3DCRT. IMRT also improves the ability to conform the treatment volume to concave tumor shapes, for example when the tumor is wrapped around a vulnerable structure such as the spinal cord or a major organ or blood vessel. Computer-controlled X-ray accelerators distribute precise radiation doses to malignant tumors or specific areas within the tumor. The pattern of radiation delivery is determined using highly tailored computing applications to perform optimization and treatment simulation (Treatment Planning). The radiation dose is consistent with the 3-D shape of the tumor by controlling, or modulating, the radiation beam&#x27;s intensity. The radiation dose intensity is elevated near the gross tumor volume while radiation among the neighboring normal tissues is decreased or avoided completely. This results in better tumor targeting, lessened side effects, and improved treatment outcomes than even 3DCRT.

3DCRT is still used extensively for many body sites but the use of IMRT is growing in more complicated body sites such as CNS, head and neck, prostate, breast, and lung. Unfortunately, IMRT is limited by its need for additional time from experienced medical personnel. This is because physicians must manually delineate the tumors one CT image at a time through the entire disease site which can take much longer than 3DCRT preparation. Then, medical physicists and dosimetrists must be engaged to create a viable treatment plan. Also, the IMRT technology has only been used commercially since the late 1990s even at the most advanced cancer centers, so radiation oncologists who did not learn it as part of their residency programs must find additional sources of education before implementing IMRT.

Proof of improved survival benefit from either of these two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers in a series of pivotal trials performed by Professor Christopher Nutting of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient immobilization). New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertainty – for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called image-guided radiation therapy or four-dimensional radiation therapy.

Another technique is the real-time tracking and localization of one or more small implantable electric devices implanted inside or close to the tumor. There are various types of medical implantable devices that are used for this purpose. It can be a magnetic transponder which senses the magnetic field generated by several transmitting coils, and then transmits the measurements back to the positioning system to determine the location. The implantable device can also be a small wireless transmitter sending out an RF signal which then will be received by a sensor array and used for localization and real-time tracking of the tumor position.

A well-studied issue with IMRT is the &quot;tongue and groove effect&quot; which results in unwanted underdosing, due to irradiating through extended tongues and grooves of overlapping MLC (multileaf collimator) leaves. While solutions to this issue have been developed, which either reduce the TG effect to negligible amounts or remove it completely, they depend upon the method of IMRT being used and some of them carry costs of their own. Some texts distinguish &quot;tongue and groove error&quot; from &quot;tongue or groove error&quot;, according as both or one side of the aperture is occluded.

==== Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) ====
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2007 which can achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields with one or more arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a multileaf collimator (MLC) (&quot;sliding window&quot; system of moving) and fluence output rate (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT has an advantage in patient treatment, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), of reduced radiation delivery times. Comparisons between VMAT and conventional IMRT for their sparing of healthy tissues and Organs at Risk (OAR) depends upon the cancer type. In the treatment of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas VMAT provides equivalent or better protection of the organ at risk (OAR). In the treatment of prostate cancer the OAR protection result is mixed with some studies favoring VMAT, others favoring IMRT.

==== Temporally feathered radiation therapy (TFRT) ====
Temporally feathered radiation therapy (TFRT) is a radiation technique introduced in 2018 which aims to use the inherent non-linearities in normal tissue repair to allow for sparing of these tissues without affecting the dose delivered to the tumor. The application of this technique, which has yet to be automated, has been described carefully to enhance the ability of departments to perform it, and in 2021 it was reported as feasible in a small clinical trial, though its efficacy has yet to be formally studied.

====Automated planning====
Automated treatment planning has become an integrated part of radiotherapy treatment planning. There are in general two approaches of automated planning. 1) Knowledge based planning where the treatment planning system has a library of high quality plans, from which it can predict the target and dose-volume histogram of the organ at risk. 2) The other approach is commonly called protocol based planning, where the treatment planning system tried to mimic an experienced treatment planner and through an iterative process evaluates the plan quality from on the basis of the protocol.

====Particle therapy====

In particle therapy (proton therapy being one example), energetic ionizing particles (protons or carbon ions) are directed at the target tumor. The dose increases while the particle penetrates the tissue, up to a maximum (the Bragg peak) that occurs near the end of the particle&#x27;s range, and it then drops to (almost) zero. The advantage of this energy deposition profile is that less energy is deposited into the healthy tissue surrounding the target tissue.

====Auger therapy====

Auger therapy (AT) makes use of a very high dose of ionizing radiation in situ that provides molecular modifications at an atomic scale. AT differs from conventional radiation therapy in several aspects; it neither relies upon radioactive nuclei to cause cellular radiation damage at a cellular dimension, nor engages multiple external pencil-beams from different directions to zero-in to deliver a dose to the targeted area with reduced dose outside the targeted tissue/organ locations. Instead, the in situ delivery of a very high dose at the molecular level using AT aims for in situ molecular modifications involving molecular breakages and molecular re-arrangements such as a change of stacking structures as well as cellular metabolic functions related to the said molecule structures.

====Motion compensation====
In many types of external beam radiotherapy, motion can negatively impact the treatment delivery by moving target tissue out of, or other healthy tissue into, the intended beam path. Some form of patient immobilisation is common, to prevent the large movements of the body during treatment, however this cannot prevent all motion, for example as a result of breathing. Several techniques have been developed to account for motion like this. Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is commonly used for breast treatments where it is important to avoid irradiating the heart. In DIBH the patient holds their breath after breathing in to provide a stable position for the treatment beam to be turned on. This can be done automatically using an external monitoring system such as a spirometer or a camera and markers. The same monitoring techniques, as well as 4DCT imaging, can also be for respiratory gated treatment, where the patient breathes freely and the beam is only engaged at certain points in the breathing cycle. Other techniques include using 4DCT imaging to plan treatments with margins that account for motion, and active movement of the treatment couch, or beam, to follow motion.

===Contact X-ray brachytherapy===
Contact X-ray brachytherapy (also called &quot;CXB&quot;, &quot;electronic brachytherapy&quot; or the &quot;Papillon Technique&quot;) is a type of radiation therapy using low energy (50 kVp) kilovoltage X-rays applied directly to the tumor to treat rectal cancer. The process involves endoscopic examination first to identify the tumor in the rectum and then inserting treatment applicator on the tumor through the anus into the rectum and placing it against the cancerous tissue. Finally, treatment tube is inserted into the applicator to deliver high doses of X-rays (30Gy) emitted directly onto the tumor at two weekly intervals for three times over four weeks period. It is typically used for treating early rectal cancer in patients who may not be candidates for surgery. A 2015 NICE review found the main side effect to be bleeding that occurred in about 38% of cases, and radiation-induced ulcer which occurred in 27% of cases.

===Brachytherapy (sealed source radiotherapy)===

Brachytherapy is delivered by placing radiation source(s) inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumors in many other body sites.

In brachytherapy, radiation sources are precisely placed directly at the site of the cancerous tumor. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumor can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.

As one example of the localized nature of breast brachytherapy, the SAVI device delivers the radiation dose through multiple catheters, each of which can be individually controlled. This approach decreases the exposure of healthy tissue and resulting side effects, compared both to external beam radiation therapy and older methods of breast brachytherapy.

===Radionuclide therapy===

Radionuclide therapy (also known as systemic radioisotope therapy, radiopharmaceutical therapy, or molecular radiotherapy), is a form of targeted therapy. Targeting can be due to the chemical properties of the isotope such as radioiodine which is specifically absorbed by the thyroid gland a thousandfold better than other bodily organs. Targeting can also be achieved by attaching the radioisotope to another molecule or antibody to guide it to the target tissue. The radioisotopes are delivered through infusion (into the bloodstream) or ingestion. Examples are the infusion of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) to treat neuroblastoma, of oral iodine-131 to treat thyroid cancer or thyrotoxicosis, and of hormone-bound lutetium-177 and yttrium-90 to treat neuroendocrine tumors (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy).

Another example is the injection of radioactive yttrium-90 or holmium-166 microspheres into the hepatic artery to radioembolize liver tumors or liver metastases. These microspheres are used for the treatment approach known as selective internal radiation therapy. The microspheres are approximately 30 μm in diameter (about one-third of a human hair) and are delivered directly into the artery supplying blood to the tumors. These treatments begin by guiding a catheter up through the femoral artery in the leg, navigating to the desired target site and administering treatment. The blood feeding the tumor will carry the microspheres directly to the tumor enabling a more selective approach than traditional systemic chemotherapy. There are currently three different kinds of microspheres: SIR-Spheres, TheraSphere and QuiremSpheres.

A major use of systemic radioisotope therapy is in the treatment of bone metastasis from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used in the treatment of bone metastasis are radium-223, strontium-89 and samarium (153Sm) lexidronam.

In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody conjugated to yttrium-90.
In 2003, the FDA approved the tositumomab/iodine (131I) tositumomab regimen (Bexxar), which is a combination of an iodine-131 labelled and an unlabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.
These medications were the first agents of what is known as radioimmunotherapy, and they were approved for the treatment of refractory non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma.

===Intraoperative radiotherapy===

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is applying therapeutic levels of radiation to a target area, such as a cancer tumor, while the area is exposed during surgery.

====Rationale====
The rationale for IORT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.

==History==

Medicine has used radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer for more than 100 years, with its earliest roots traced from the discovery of X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Röntgen. Emil Grubbe of Chicago was possibly the first American physician to use X-rays to treat cancer, beginning in 1896.

The field of radiation therapy began to grow in the early 1900s largely due to the groundbreaking work of Nobel Prize–winning scientist Marie Curie (1867–1934), who discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium in 1898. This began a new era in medical treatment and research. Through the 1920s the hazards of radiation exposure were not understood, and little protection was used. Radium was believed to have wide curative powers and radiotherapy was applied to many diseases.

Prior to World War 2, the only practical sources of radiation for radiotherapy were radium, its &quot;emanation&quot;, radon gas, and the X-ray tube. External beam radiotherapy (teletherapy) began at the turn of the century with relatively low voltage (&lt;150 kV) X-ray machines. It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage X-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages. Orthovoltage X-rays, which used tube voltages of 200-500 kV, began to be used during the 1920s. To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1 MV or above, called &quot;megavolt&quot; radiation. Producing megavolt X-rays required voltages on the X-ray tube of 3 to 5 million volts, which required huge expensive installations. Megavoltage X-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions. One of the first, installed at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s hospital, London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long X-ray tube and weighed 10 tons. Radium produced megavolt gamma rays, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores. In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.

The invention of the nuclear reactor in the Manhattan Project during World War 2 made possible the production of artificial radioisotopes for radiotherapy. Cobalt therapy, teletherapy machines using megavolt gamma rays emitted by cobalt-60, a radioisotope produced by irradiating ordinary cobalt metal in a reactor, revolutionized the field between the 1950s and the early 1980s. Cobalt machines were relatively cheap, robust and simple to use, although due to its 5.27 year half-life the cobalt had to be replaced about every 5 years.

Medical linear particle accelerators, developed since the 1940s, began replacing X-ray and cobalt units in the 1980s and these older therapies are now declining. The first medical linear accelerator was used at the Hammersmith Hospital in London in 1953. Linear accelerators can produce higher energies, have more collimated beams, and do not produce radioactive waste with its attendant disposal problems like radioisotope therapies.

With Godfrey Hounsfield&#x27;s invention of computed tomography (CT) in 1971, three-dimensional planning became a possibility and created a shift from 2-D to 3-D radiation delivery. CT-based planning allows physicians to more accurately determine the dose distribution using axial tomographic images of the patient&#x27;s anatomy. The advent of new imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1970s and positron emission tomography (PET) in the 1980s, has moved radiation therapy from 3-D conformal to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and to image-guided radiation therapy tomotherapy. These advances allowed radiation oncologists to better see and target tumors, which have resulted in better treatment outcomes, more organ preservation and fewer side effects.

While access to radiotherapy is improving globally, more than half of patients in low and middle income countries still do not have available access to the therapy as of 2017.

<text>Ronald Harry Coase (; 29 December 1910 – 2 September 2013) was a British economist and author. Coase was educated at the London School of Economics, where he was a member of the faculty until 1951. He was the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Law School, where he arrived in 1964 and remained for the rest of his life. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1991.
Coase believed economists should study real-world wealth creation, in the manner of Adam Smith, stating, &quot;It is suicidal for the field to slide into a hard science of choice, ignoring the influences of society, history, culture, and politics on the working of the economy.&quot; He believed economic study should reduce emphasis on Price Theory or theoretical markets and instead focus on real markets. He established the case for the corporation as a means to pay the costs of operating a marketplace. Coase is best known for two articles: &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot; (1937), which introduces the concept of transaction costs to explain the nature and limits of firms; and &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; (1960), which suggests that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities if it were not for transaction costs (see Coase theorem). Additionally, Coase&#x27;s transaction costs approach has been influential in modern organizational economics, where it was re-introduced by Oliver E. Williamson.

==Biography==

Ronald Harry Coase was born in Willesden, a suburb of London, on 29 December 1910. His father, Henry Joseph Coase (1884–1973) was a telegraphist for the post office, as was his mother, Rosalie Elizabeth Coase (née Giles; 1882–1972), before marriage. As a child, Coase had a weakness in his legs, for which he was required to wear leg-irons. Due to this problem, he attended the school for physical defectives. At the age of 12, he was able to enter Kilburn Grammar School on scholarship. At Kilburn, he studied for the intermediate examination of the University of London as an external student in 1927–29.

Coase then continued his studies at the University of London, enrolling as an internal student of the London School of Economics, where he took courses with Arnold Plant and received a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1932. During his undergraduate studies, Coase received the Sir Ernest Cassel Travelling Scholarship which he used to visit the University of Chicago in 1931–1932 studying with Frank Knight and Jacob Viner. Coase&#x27;s colleagues would later admit that they did not remember this first visit. Between 1932 and 1934, Coase was an assistant lecturer at the Dundee School of Economics and Commerce, which later became part of the University of Dundee. Subsequently, Coase was an assistant lecturer in commerce at the University of Liverpool between 1934 and 1935 before returning to London School of Economics as a member of staff until 1951 in which year he was awarded an earned doctorate in economics from the University of London. He then started to work at the University at Buffalo and retained his British citizenship after moving to the United States in the 1950s. In 1958, he moved to the University of Virginia. Coase settled at the University of Chicago in 1964 and became the co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; with Aaron Director. He was also for a time a trustee of the Philadelphia Society. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991.

Nearing his 100th birthday, Coase was working on a book concerning the rise of the economies of China and Vietnam. In an interview, Coase explained the mission of the Coase China Society and his vision of economics and the part to be played by Chinese economists. This became &quot;How China Became Capitalist&quot; (2012) co-authored with Ning Wang. Coase was honoured and received an honorary doctorate from the university at Buffalo Department of Economics in May 2012.

Coase married Marian Ruth Hartung of Chicago, Illinois in Willesden, England, 7 August 1937. Although they were unable to have children, they were married 75 years until her death on 17 October 2012, making him one of the longest-married Nobel Prize laureates. Coase himself died in Chicago on 2 September 2013, at the age of 102. Both are buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

He was praised across the political spectrum, with &quot;Slate&quot; calling him &quot;one of the most distinguished economists in the world&quot; and &quot;Forbes&quot; calling him &quot;the greatest of the many great University of Chicago economists&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called his work over eight decades &quot;impossible to summarize&quot; while recommending five of his papers to read.

==Contributions to economics==

===&quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot;===

In &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot; (1937), a brief but highly influential essay, Coase attempts to explain why the economy features a number of business firms instead of consisting exclusively of a multitude of independent, self-employed people who contract with one another. Given that &quot;production could be carried on without any organization [that is, firms] at all&quot;, Coase asks, why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?

Since modern firms can only emerge when an entrepreneur of some sort begins to hire people, Coase&#x27;s analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.

The traditional economic theory of the time (in the tradition of Adam Smith) suggested that, because the market is &quot;efficient&quot; (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.

Coase noted, however, a number of transaction costs involved in using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market actually exceeds the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something from another party. This suggests that firms will arise which can internalise the production of goods and services required to deliver a product, thus avoiding these costs. This argument sets the stage for the later contributions by Oliver Williamson: markets and hierarchies are alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.

There is a natural limit to what a firm can produce internally, however. Coase notices &quot;decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function&quot;, including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation. These factors become countervailing costs to the use of the firm.

Coase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are &quot;internal&quot; to the firm and how many &quot;external&quot;) is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above. In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.

Other things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:
* the lower the costs of organising and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the number of transactions organised
* the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organised
* the greater the lowering (or the smaller the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size

The first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organised and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organising transactions across space may allow firms to become larger – the advent of the telephone and of cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms.

A further exploration of the dichotomy between markets and hierarchies as co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions derived a third alternative way called Commons based peer production, in which individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals.

===&quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot;===
Upon publishing his article The Federal Communications Commission in 1959, Coase received negative feedback from the faculty at the University of Chicago over his conclusions and apparent conflicts with A. C. Pigou. According to Coase, &quot;What I said was thought to run counter to Pigou&#x27;s analysis by a number of economists at the University of Chicago and was therefore, according to them, wrong. At a meeting in Chicago I was able to convince these economists that I was right and Pigou&#x27;s analysis faulty.&quot; Coase had presented his paper in 1960 during a seminar in Chicago, to twenty senior economist including George Stigler and Milton Friedman. He gradually won over the usually skeptic audience, in what has later been considered a &quot;paradigm-shifting moment&quot; in the genesis of Chicago Law and Economics. Coase would join the Chicago faculty four years later.

Published in the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics&quot; in 1960, while Coase was a member of the Economics department at the University of Virginia, &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; provided the key insight that it is unclear where the blame for externalities lies. The example he gave was of a rancher whose cattle stray onto the cropland of his neighbour. If the rancher is made to restrict his cattle, he is harmed just as the farmer is if the cattle remain unrestrained.

Coase argued that without transaction costs the initial assignment of property rights makes no difference to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.

With sufficient transaction costs, initial property rights matter for both equity and efficiency. From the point of view of economic efficiency, property rights should be assigned such that the owner of the rights wants to take the economically efficient action. To elaborate, if it is efficient not to restrict the cattle, the rancher should be given the rights (so that cattle can move about freely), whereas if it is efficient to restrict the cattle, the farmer should be given the rights over the movement of the cattle (so the cattle are restricted).

This seminal argument forms the basis of the famous Coase theorem as labelled by Stigler.
In 1990, Coase wrote that he feared &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; had been widely misunderstood.

===Law and economics===

Though trained as an economist, Coase spent much of his career working in a law school. He is a central figure in the development of the subfield of law and economics. He viewed law and economics as having two parts, the first &quot;using the economists&#x27; approach and concepts to analyze the working of the legal system, often called the economic analysis of the law&quot;; and the second &quot;a study of the influence of the legal system on the working of the economic system.&quot; Coase said that the second part &quot;is the part of law and economics in which I am most interested.&quot;

In his Simons Lecture celebrating the centennial of the University of Chicago, titled &quot;Law and Economics at Chicago&quot;, Coase noted that he only accidentally wandered into the field:

Despite wandering accidentally into law and economics, the opportunity to edit the Journal of Law and Economics was instrumental in bringing him to the University of Chicago:

Coase believed that the University of Chicago was the intellectual center of law and economics. He concluded his Simons lecture by stating:

I am very much aware that, in concentrating in this lecture on law and economics at Chicago, I have neglected other significant contributions to the subject made elsewhere such as those by Guido Calabresi at Yale, by Donald Turner at Harvard, and by others. But it can hardly be denied that in the emergence of the subject of law and economics, Chicago has played a very significant part and one of which the University can be proud.

===Coase theorem===
In law and economics, the Coase theorem () describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities. The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property. In practice, obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent Coasean bargaining. This &#x27;theorem&#x27; is commonly attributed to Coase.

===Coase conjecture===
Another important contribution of Coase is the Coase conjecture, which is an informal argument that durable goods monopolists do not have market power because they are unable to commit to not lowering their prices in future periods.

==Political views==
When asked what he considered his politics to be, Coase stated,

I really don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t reject any policy without considering what its results are. If someone says there&#x27;s going to be regulation, I don&#x27;t say that regulation will be bad. Let&#x27;s see. What we discover is that most regulation does produce, or has produced in recent times, a worse result. But I wouldn&#x27;t like to say that all regulation would have this effect because one can think of circumstances in which it doesn&#x27;t.

Coase admitted that early in life, he aligned himself with socialism.

Guido Calabresi wrote that Coase&#x27;s focus on transaction costs in &quot;The Nature of the Firm&quot; was the result of his socialist beliefs. Reflecting on this, Coase wrote: &quot;It is very difficult to know where one&#x27;s ideas come from but for all I know he may well be right.&quot; Coase continued:

==Ronald Coase Institute==
Coase was research advisor to the Ronald Coase Institute, an organisation that promotes research on institutions and organizations – the laws, rules, customs, and norms – that govern real economic systems, with particular support for young scholars from developing and transitional countries.

==Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics==

The University of Chicago Law School carries on the legacy of Ronald Coase through the mission of the Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics. Each year, the University of Chicago Law School hosts the Coase Lecture, which was delivered in 2003 by Ronald Coase himself.

<text>Richard Robert Ernst (14 August 1933 – 4 June 2021) was a Swiss physical chemist and Nobel laureate.

Ernst was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1991 for his contributions towards the development of Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy while at Varian Associates and ETH Zurich. These underpin applications to both to chemistry with NMR spectroscopy and to medicine with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

He humbly referred to himself as a &quot;tool-maker&quot; rather than a scientist.

== Early life==
Ernst was born in Winterthur, Switzerland on 14 August 1933 to Robert Ernst and Irma Ernst-Brunner. He was the oldest of three children of Irma Brunner and Robert Ernst. He grew up in a house built in 1898 by his grandfather, who was a merchant. During his childhood, he was interested in music, playing the violoncello and even considering a career as a musical composer. At 13-years old, Ernst stumbled upon a box of chemicals belonging to his late uncle, a metallurgical engineer. Young Ernst was excited by what he found, and set about trying all conceivable reactions, some of which resulted in explosions that terrified his parents.

== Education ==
He enrolled in the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich to study chemistry and received his diploma in 1957 as a “Diplomierter Ingenieur Chemiker&quot;. He was disappointed in the course content, so conducted further research and taught himself quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in his spare time. After a break to complete his military service, Ernst earned his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1962 from ETH Zurich. His dissertation was on nuclear magnetic resonance in the field of physical chemistry.

== Career ==
Ernst entered Varian Associates as a scientist in 1963 and invented Fourier transform NMR, noise decoupling, and a number of other methods. He returned to ETH Zurich in 1968 and became a lecturer. His career developed into assistant professor in 1970 and associate professor in 1972. From 1976, Richard R. Ernst was Full Professor of Physical Chemistry.

Ernst led a research group dedicated to magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and was the director of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at the ETH Zurich. He developed two-dimensional NMR and several novel pulse techniques. He retired in 1998. He participated in the development of medical magnetic resonance tomography, as well as the NMR structure determination of biopolymers in solution collaborating with Professor Kurt Wüthrich. He also participated in the study of intra-molecular dynamics.

==Awards and honours==
Ernst was a foreign fellow of the Estonian Academy of Sciences (elected 2002), the US National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Academy of Sciences, London, the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Korean Academy of Science and Technology and Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1993. He was awarded the John Gamble Kirkwood Medal in 1989.

In 1991, Ernst was on an aeroplane flying over the Atlantic when he discovered he had been awarded The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was invited into the cockpit, where he was given a radio to talk to the Nobel committee. Here they told him he was being honoured &quot;for his contributions to the development of the methodology of high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy&quot;.

Ernst was a member of the World Knowledge Dialogue Scientific Board. He was awarded the Marcel Benoist Prize in 1986, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1991, and Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize of Columbia University in 1991. He was also awarded the Tadeus Reichstein Medal in 2000 and the Order of the Star of Romania in 2004. He also held Honorary Doctorates from the Technical University of Munich, EPF Lausanne, University of Zurich, University Antwerpen, Babes-Bolyai University, and University Montpellier.

The 2009 Bel Air Film Festival featured the world premiere of a documentary film on Ernst &quot;Science Plus Dharma Equals Social Responsibility&quot;. Produced by Carlo Burton, the film takes place in Ernst&#x27;s hometown in Switzerland. In 2022, another movie about Richard R. Ernst premiered at the Cameo cinema in Winterthur, produced by Lukas Schwarzenbacher and Susanne Schmid. The documentary contains a retrospective of Richard R. Ernsts life, which was filmed only a few months before his death.

==Personal life==
Ernst was married to Magdalena until his death. Together, they had three children: Anna Magdalena, Katharina Elisabeth and Hans-Martin Walter. Besides toiling with his work, Ernst also enjoyed music and art, specifically Tibetan scroll art. Using scientific techniques, Ernst would research the pigments on the scrolls to learn about their geographic origin and age.

Ernst died on 4 June 2021 in Winterthur at the age of 87.

<text>RIPEMD (RIPE Message Digest) is a family of cryptographic hash functions developed in 1992 (the original RIPEMD) and 1996 (other variants). There are five functions in the family: RIPEMD, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320, of which RIPEMD-160 is the most common.

The original RIPEMD, as well as RIPEMD-128, is not considered secure because 128-bit result is too small and also (for the original RIPEMD) because of design weaknesses. The 256- and 320-bit versions of RIPEMD provide the same level of security as RIPEMD-128 and RIPEMD-160, respectively; they are designed for applications where the security level is sufficient but longer hash result is necessary.

While RIPEMD functions are less popular than SHA-1 and SHA-2, they are used, among others, in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin.

== History ==

The original RIPEMD function was designed in the framework of the EU project RIPE (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation) in 1992. Its design was based on the MD4 hash function. In 1996, in response to security weaknesses found in the original RIPEMD, Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Leuven, Belgium published four strengthened variants: RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-256, and RIPEMD-320.

In August 2004, a collision was reported for the original RIPEMD. This does not apply to RIPEMD-160.

In 2019, the best collision attack for RIPEMD-160 could reach 34 rounds out of 80 rounds, which was published at CRYPTO 2019.

In February 2023, a collision attack for RIPEMD-160 was published at EUROCRYPT 2023, which could reach 36 rounds out of 80 rounds with time complexity of 264.5.

In December 2023, an improved collision attack was found based on the technique from the previous best collision attack, this improved collision attack could reach 40 rounds out of 80 round with a theoretical time complexity of 249.9.

==RIPEMD-160 hashes==
The 160-bit RIPEMD-160 hashes (also termed RIPE &quot;message digests&quot;) are typically represented as 40-digit hexadecimal numbers. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding RIPEMD-160 hash:

 RIPEMD-160(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 37f332f68db77bd9d7edd4969571ad671cf9dd3b

RIPEMD-160 behaves with the desired avalanche effect of cryptographic hash functions (small changes, e.g. changing to , result in a completely different hash):

 RIPEMD-160(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 132072df690933835eb8b6ad0b77e7b6f14acad7

The hash of a zero-length string is:

 RIPEMD-160(&quot;&quot;) =
 9c1185a5c5e9fc54612808977ee8f548b2258d31

<doc id="26364" wikidata="Q162314" url="?curid=26364" title="Roman law">
<text>Roman law is the legal system of ancient Rome, including the legal developments spanning over a thousand years of jurisprudence, from the Twelve Tables (), to the (AD 529) ordered by Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I. 

Roman law also denoted the legal system applied in most of Western Europe until the end of the 18th century. In Germany, Roman law practice remained in place longer under the Holy Roman Empire (963–1806). Roman law thus served as a basis for legal practice throughout Western continental Europe, as well as in most former colonies of these European nations, including Latin America, and also in Ethiopia. 

English and Anglo-American common law were influenced also by Roman law, notably in their Latinate legal glossary. Eastern Europe was also influenced by the jurisprudence of the , especially in countries such as medieval Romania, which created a new legal system comprising a mixture of Roman and local law. 

After the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Roman law remained in effect in the Byzantine Empire. From the 7th century onward, the legal language in the East was Greek, with Eastern European law continuing to be influenced by Byzantine law.

== Development ==
The jurist Sextus Pomponius said, &quot;At the beginning of our city, the people began their first activities without any fixed law, and without any fixed rights: all things were ruled despotically, by kings&quot;. 

Before the Twelve Tables (i.e between 754 and 449 BC), private law comprised the Roman civil law (&quot;ius civile Quiritium&quot;) that applied only to Roman citizens and was bonded to religion. The &quot;ius civile&quot; of the time was undeveloped, with attributes of strict formalism, symbolism, and conservatism, for example, as embodied in the ritual practice of &quot;mancipatio&quot;. It is believed that Roman law is rooted in the Etruscan religion, emphasizing ritual.

===Twelve Tables ===

The first legal text of the Roman law is the Law of the Twelve Tables, dating from the mid-fifth century BC. The plebeian tribune, C. Terentilius Arsa, proposed that the law should be written in order to prevent magistrates from applying the law arbitrarily. After eight years of political struggle, the plebeian social class convinced the patricians to send a delegation to Athens to copy the Laws of Solon; they also dispatched delegations to other Greek cities for a like reason. 

In 451 BC, according to the traditional story, according to Livy, ten Roman citizens were chosen to record the laws, known as the &quot;decemviri legibus scribundis&quot;. While they were performing this task, they were given supreme political power (&quot;imperium&quot;), whereas the power of the magistrates was restricted. In 450 BC, the &quot;decemviri&quot; produced the laws on ten tablets (&quot;tabulae&quot;), but these laws were regarded as unsatisfactory by the plebeians. A second decemvirate is allegedly said to have added two further tablets in 449 BC. The new Law of the Twelve Tables was approved by the people&#x27;s assembly.

Modern scholars tend to challenge the accuracy of Latin historians. They generally do not believe that a second decemvirate ever took place. The decemvirate of 451 BC is believed to have assumed the leading functions in Rome and included the most controversial points of customary law. Questions concerning Greek influence on early Roman Law are still much discussed. Many scholars consider it unlikely that the patricians sent an official delegation to Greece, as the Latin historians believed. Rather, the Romans acquired Greek legislations from the Greek cities of Magna Graecia, the main portal between the Roman and Greek worlds. 

The original text of the Twelve Tables has not been preserved. The tablets were probably destroyed when Rome was conquered and burned by the Gauls in 387 BC. The fragments which did survive show that it was not a law code in the modern sense. It did not provide a complete and coherent system of all applicable rules or give legal solutions for all possible cases. Rather, the tables contained specific provisions designed to change the then-existing customary law. Although the provisions pertain to all areas of law, the largest part is dedicated to private law and civil procedure.

===Early republican law===

Among the most consequential laws passed during the early Republic were the &quot;Lex Canuleia&quot; (445 BC), which allowed marriage &quot;(conubium)&quot; between patricians and plebeians; the &quot;Leges Liciinae Sextiae&quot; (367 BC), which restricted the amount of public land &quot;(ager publicus)&quot; that any citizen could occupy, and stipulated that one of the two annual consuls must be plebeian; the &quot;Lex Ogulnia&quot; (300 BC), which permitted plebeians to hold certain priestly offices as pontiffs or augurs; and the &quot;Lex Hortensia&quot; (287 BC), which stated that the determinations of plebeian assemblies &quot;(plebiscita)&quot; would henceforth be binding on the entire &quot;populus Romanus&quot;, both patricians and plebeians.

Another important statute from the Republican era is the &quot;Lex Aquilia&quot; of 286 BC, which may be regarded as the root of modern tort law.

== Jurisprudence ==
Rome&#x27;s most important contribution to European legal culture was not the enactment of well-drafted statutes, but the emergence of a class of professional jurists (&quot;prudentes&quot; or &quot;jurisprudentes&quot;, sing. &quot;prudens&quot;) and of a legal science. This was achieved in a gradual process of applying the scientific methods of Greek philosophy to the subject of law, a subject which the Greeks themselves never treated as a science.

Traditionally, the origins of Roman legal science are connected to Gnaeus Flavius. Around the year 300 BC, Flavius is said to have published the formularies containing the words which had to be spoken in court to begin a legal action. Before the time of Flavius, these formularies are said to have been secret and known only to the priests. Their publication made it possible for non-priests to explore the meaning of these legal texts. Whether or not this story is credible, jurists were active, and legal treatises were written in larger numbers before the 2nd century BC. Among the famous jurists of the republican period are Quintus Mucius Scaevola, who wrote an influential and voluminous treatise on all aspects of the law, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a friend of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Thus, Rome had developed a very sophisticated legal system and a refined legal culture when the Roman republic was replaced by the monarchical system of the Principate in 27 BC.

=== Pre-classical period ===
In the period between about 201 to 27 BC, more flexible laws developed to match the needs of the time. In addition to the old and formal &quot;ius civile&quot;, a new juridical class was created: the &quot;ius honorarium&quot;: &quot;The law introduced by the magistrates who had the right to promulgate edicts in order to support, supplement or correct the existing law.&quot; With this new law the old formalism was abandoned, and more flexible principles of &quot;ius gentium&quot; (&quot;law of the nations&quot;) were used.

The adaptation of law to new needs was given over to juridical practice, to magistrates, and especially to the praetors. Though the praetors were not legislators and did not technically create new law when he issued his edicts (&quot;magistratuum edicta&quot;), the results of his rulings enjoyed legal protection (&quot;actionem dare&quot;) and were in effect often the source of new legal rules. A praetor&#x27;s successor was not bound by the edicts of his predecessor. However, he did take rules from edicts of his predecessor that had proved to be useful. In this way a constant content was created that proceeded from edict to edict (&quot;edictum traslatitium&quot;).

Thus, over the course of time, parallel to the civil law and supplementing and correcting it, a new body of praetoric law emerged. In fact, praetoric law was so defined by the famous Roman jurist Papinian (142–212 AD): &quot;Ius praetorium est quod praetores introduxerunt adiuvandi vel supplendi vel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia propter utilitatem publicam&quot; (&quot;praetoric law is that law introduced by praetors to supplement or correct civil law for public benefit&quot;). Ultimately, civil law and praetoric law were fused in the .

=== Classical Roman law ===

The first 250 years of the current era are the period during which Roman law and Roman legal science reached its greatest degree of sophistication and influence. The law of this period is often referred to as the &quot;classical period of Roman law&quot;. The Roman Republic had three different branches: the Assemblies, the Senate, and the Consuls. The assemblies passed laws and made declarations of war; the Senate controlled the treasury; and the consuls had the highest juridical power.

The jurists worked in different functions, including giving legal opinions at the request of private parties; advising magistrates, especially the praetors; and helping the praetors draft their edicts, in which they publicly announced, at the beginning of their tenure, how they would handle their duties, and the formularies, according to which specific proceedings were conducted. Some jurists also held high judicial and administrative offices themselves.

The jurists also produced various legal punishments. Around 130 AD, the jurist Salvius Iulianus drafted a standard form of the praetor&#x27;s edict, which was used by all praetors from that time onwards. This edict contained detailed descriptions of all cases, in which the praetor would allow a legal action and in which he would grant a defense. The standard edict thus functioned like a comprehensive law code, even though it did not formally have the force of law. It indicated the requirements for a successful legal claim. The edict therefore became the basis for extensive legal commentaries by later classical jurists like Paulus and Ulpian. 

During the pre-classical and classical period, such laws emerged as the separation of ownership and possession; contract and tort as distinct sources of obligations; standard types of contracts (sale, contract for work, hire, contract for services) regulated in most continental codes; the Institutes of Gaius, which invented a system of private law based on the division of all material into &quot;personae&quot; (persons), &quot;res&quot; (things) and &quot;actiones&quot; (legal actions). Gaius&#x27;s system was used for many centuries, and has been recognized in legal treatises like William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; and enactments like the French Code civil and the German BGB.

=== Post-classical law ===
By the middle of the 3rd century, the conditions for the flourishing of a refined legal culture had become less favourable. The general political and economic situation deteriorated as the emperors assumed more direct control of all aspects of political life. The political system of the Principate, which had retained some features of the republican constitution, began to transform itself into the absolute monarchy of the Dominate. The existence of legal science and of jurists who regarded law as a science, not as an instrument to achieve the political goals set by the absolute monarch, did not fit well into the new order of things. Jurisprudential literary production all but ended. Few jurists after the mid-3rd century are known by name. While legal science and legal education persisted to some extent in the eastern part of the Empire, most of the subtleties of classical law came to be disregarded and finally forgotten in the west. Classical law was replaced by the so-called vulgar law of the late Roman Empire.

=== Byzantine law ===

When the centre of the Empire was moved to the Greek East in the 4th century, many legal concepts of Greek origin appeared in the official Roman legislation. The influence is visible even in the law of persons or of the family, traditionally the part of the law that changes least. For example, Constantine started putting restrictions on the ancient Roman concept of &quot;patria potestas&quot;, the power held by the male head of a family over his descendants, by acknowledging that persons &quot;in potestate&quot;, the descendants, could have proprietary rights. He was apparently making concessions to the much stricter concept of paternal authority under Greek-Hellenistic law. The &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; (438 AD) was a codification of Constantian laws. Later emperors went even further, until Justinian finally decreed that a child &quot;in potestate&quot; became owner of everything it acquired, except when it acquired something from its father.

The codes of Justinian, particularly the (529–534) continued to be the basis of legal practice in the Empire throughout its so-called &quot;Byzantine&quot; history. Leo III the Isaurian issued a new code, the &quot;Ecloga&quot;, in the early 8th century. In the 9th century, the emperors Basil I and Leo VI the Wise commissioned a combined translation of the Code and the Digest, parts of Justinian&#x27;s codes, into Greek, which became known as the &quot;Basilica&quot;. Roman law as preserved in the codes of Justinian and in the Basilica remained the basis of legal practice in Greece and in the courts of the Eastern Orthodox Church even after the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the conquest by the Turks, and, along with the Syro-Roman law book, also formed the basis for much of the &quot;Fetha Negest&quot;, which remained in force in Ethiopia until 1931.

== Substance ==

=== Concept of laws ===
The 2nd-century Roman jurist Ulpian, however, divided law into three branches: natural law, which existed in nature and governed animals as well as humans; the law of nations, which was distinctively human; and, civil law, which was the body of laws specific to a people.

&quot;Ius civile&quot; (&quot;citizen law&quot;, originally ius civile Quiritium) was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens and the &quot;Praetores Urbani&quot;, the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. &quot;Ius gentium&quot; (&quot;law of peoples&quot;) was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens. The &quot;Praetores Peregrini&quot; were the individuals who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. &quot;Ius naturale&quot; (&quot;natural law&quot;) was the concept that all persons had a kind of common sense, which the jurists developed to explain why all people seemed to obey some laws.

&quot;Ius scriptum&quot; (&quot;written law&quot;) was the body of statute laws made by the legislature, known as &quot;leges&quot; () and &quot;plebiscita&quot; (, originating in the Plebeian Council). Roman lawyers would also include in the &quot;ius scriptum&quot; the edicts of magistrates (&quot;magistratuum edicta&quot;), the advice of the Senate (), the responses and thoughts of jurists (&quot;responsa prudentium&quot;), and the proclamations and beliefs of the emperor (&quot;principum placita&quot;). &quot;Ius non scriptum&quot; (&quot;unwritten law&quot;) was the body of common laws that arose from customary practice and had become binding over time.

&quot;Ius singulare&quot; (&quot;singular law&quot;) was the special law for certain groups of people, things, or legal relations, as exceptional from the general rules of the legal system. For example, the ius singulare about wills written by people in the military during a campaign exempted them from the solemnities generally required for citizens when writing wills in normal circumstances. (&quot;common law&quot;) was the general, ordinary, law, as distinct from &quot;ius singulare&quot;. 

&quot;Ius publicum&quot; (&quot;public law&quot;) was the law that protected the interests of the Roman state. Roman criminal law was mostly private, with only the most severe crimes prosecuted by the state. &quot;Ius publicum&quot; was also used to describe obligatory legal regulations (today called &quot;ius cogens&quot;). &quot;Ius privatum&quot; (&quot;private law&quot;) was the law that protected individuals, which included personal, property, civil and criminal law as well as the procedural law of judicial proceedings (&quot;iudicium privatum&quot;).

The Roman Republic&#x27;s constitution or &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (&quot;custom of the ancestors&quot;) was an unwritten, informal, and unofficial set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, constantly evolving throughout the life of the Republic.

Throughout the 1st century BC, the power and legitimacy of the Roman constitution progressively eroded. Even Roman constitutionalists, such as the senator Cicero, lost a willingness to remain faithful to it towards the end of the Republic. When the Roman Republic ultimately fell in the years following the Battle of Actium and Mark Antony&#x27;s suicide, what was left of the Roman constitution died along with the Republic. The first Roman emperor, Augustus, attempted to manufacture the appearance of a constitution that still governed the Empire, by utilising that constitution&#x27;s institutions to lend legitimacy to the Principate, e.g., reusing prior grants of greater &quot;imperium&quot; to substantiate Augustus&#x27; greater &quot;imperium&quot; over the imperial provinces and the prorogation of different magistracies to justify Augustus&#x27; receipt of tribunician power. The belief in a surviving constitution lasted well into the life of the Roman Empire.

Concepts that originated in the Roman constitution live on in constitutions to this day. Examples include checks and balances, the separation of powers, vetoes, filibusters, quorum requirements, term limits, impeachments, the powers of the purse, and regularly scheduled elections. Even some lesser used modern constitutional concepts, such as the block voting found in the electoral college of the United States, originate from ideas found in the Roman constitution.

=== Private law ===
&quot;Stipulatio&quot; was the basic form of contract in Roman law. It was made in the format of question and answer. The precise nature of the contract is disputed.

&quot;Rei vindicatio&quot; is a legal action by which the plaintiff demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff. It was only used when the plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant somehow impeded the plaintiff&#x27;s possession of the thing. The plaintiff could also institute an &quot;actio furti&quot;, a personal action, to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could also claim damages from the defendant with the aid of the &quot;condictio furtiva&quot;, another personal action. With the aid of the &quot;actio legis Aquiliae&quot;, another personal action, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant. &quot;Rei vindicatio&quot; was derived from the &quot;ius civile&quot;, and was only available to Roman citizens.

=== Status ===

A person&#x27;s abilities and duties within the Roman legal system depended on their legal &quot;status&quot;. The individual could have been a Roman citizen (&quot;status civitatis&quot;), unlike a foreigner; been free (&quot;status libertatis&quot;), unlike slaves; or had a certain position in a Roman family (&quot;status familiae&quot;) either as the head of the family (&quot;pater familias&quot;) or some lower member (&quot;alieni iuris&quot; &quot;one who lives under someone else&#x27;s law&quot;).

=== Litigation ===

The history of Roman Law can be divided into three systems of procedure: &quot;legis actiones&quot;, the &quot;formulary system&quot;, and &quot;cognitio extra ordinem&quot;. The periods in which these systems were in use overlapped and did not have definitive breaks. Roughly, &quot;legis actio&quot; system prevailed from the time of the XII Tables (c. 450 BC) until about the end of the 2nd century BC; the formulary procedure was primarily used from the last century of the Republic until the end of the classical period (c. AD 200); and &quot;cognitio extra ordinem&quot; was used in post-classical times.

During the republic and until the bureaucratization of Roman judicial procedure, the judge was usually a private person (&quot;iudex privatus&quot;). He had to be a Roman male citizen. The parties could agree on a judge, or they could appoint one from a list of judges known as the &quot;album iudicum&quot;. They went down the list until they found a judge agreeable to both parties, or if none could be found they had to take the last one on the list.

No one had a legal obligation to judge a case. Judges had great latitude in the way they conducted litigation. He considered all the evidence and ruled in the way that seemed just. Because the judge was not a jurist or a legal technician, he often consulted a jurist about the technical aspects of the case, but he was not bound by the jurist&#x27;s reply. At the end of the litigation, if things were not clear to him, he could refuse to give a judgment, by swearing that it wasn&#x27;t clear. Also, there was a maximum time to issue a judgment, which depended on some technical issues of law.

Later on, with the bureaucratization, this procedure disappeared, and was substituted by the so-called &quot;extra ordinem&quot; procedure, also known as the cognitory system. The whole case was reviewed before a magistrate in a single phase. The magistrate had obligation to judge and to issue a decision, and the decision could be appealed to a higher magistrate.

=== In the West ===

In the west, Justinian&#x27;s political authority never went any farther than certain portions of the Italian and Hispanic peninsulas. In Law codes issued by the Germanic kings, however, the influence of early Eastern Roman codes on some of these is discernible. In many early Germanic states, Roman citizens continued to be governed by Roman laws for quite some time, even while members of the various Germanic tribes were governed by their own respective codes.

The &quot;Codex Justinianus,&quot; Institutes of Justinian, and the earlier code of Theodosius II were well-known in Western Europe and served as models for a few of the Germanic law codes. However, the &quot;Digest&quot; portion was largely ignored for several centuries until around 1070, when a manuscript of the &quot;Digest&quot; was rediscovered in Italy. This was done mainly through the works of glossars who wrote their comments between lines (&quot;glossa interlinearis&quot;), or in the form of marginal notes (&quot;glossa marginalis&quot;). From that time, scholars began to study the ancient Roman legal texts, and to teach others what they learned from their studies. The center of these studies was Bologna. The law school there gradually developed into Europe&#x27;s first university.

There are several reasons that Roman law was favored in the Middle Ages. Roman law regulated the legal protection of property and the equality of legal subjects and their wills, and it prescribed the possibility that the legal subjects could dispose their property through testament. The students who were taught Roman law in Bologna (and later in many other places) found that many rules of Roman law were better suited to regulate complex economic transactions than the customary rules applicable throughout Europe. For this reason, Roman law, or at least some provisions borrowed from it, began to be re-introduced into legal practice, centuries after the end of the Roman empire. This process was actively supported by many kings and princes who employed university-trained jurists as counselors and court officials and sought to benefit from rules like &quot;princeps legibus solutus est&quot; (&quot;The sovereign is not bound by the laws&quot;, a phrase initially coined by Ulpian, a Roman jurist).

By the middle of the 16th century, the rediscovered Roman law dominated the legal practice of many European countries. A legal system, in which Roman law was mixed with elements of canon law and of Germanic custom, especially feudal law, had emerged. This legal system, which was common to all of continental Europe (and Scotland) was known as . This &quot;Ius Commune&quot; and the legal systems based on it are usually referred to as civil law in English-speaking countries.

Only England and the Nordic countries did not take part in the wholesale reception of Roman law. One reason for this is that the English legal system was more developed than its continental counterparts by the time Roman law was rediscovered. Therefore, the practical advantages of Roman law were less obvious to English practitioners than to continental lawyers. As a result, the English system of common law developed in parallel to Roman-based civil law, with its practitioners being trained at the Inns of Court in London rather than receiving degrees in Canon or Civil Law at the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge. Elements of Romano-canon law were present in England in the ecclesiastical courts and, less directly, through the development of the equity system. In addition, some concepts from Roman law made their way into the common law. Especially in the early 19th century, English lawyers and judges were willing to borrow rules and ideas from continental jurists and directly from Roman law.

The practical application of Roman law, and the era of the European &quot;Ius Commune&quot;, came to an end when national codifications were made. In 1804, the French civil code came into force. In the course of the 19th century, many European states either adopted the French model or drafted their own codes. In Germany, the political situation made the creation of a national code of laws impossible. From the 17th century, Roman law in Germany had been heavily influenced by domestic (customary) law, and it was called &quot;usus modernus Pandectarum&quot;. In some parts of Germany, Roman law continued to be applied until the German civil code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB) went into effect in 1900.

Colonial expansion spread the civil law system.

=== Today ===

Today, Roman law is no longer applied in legal practice, even though the legal systems of some countries like South Africa and San Marino are still based on the old &quot;jus commune&quot;. However, even where the legal practice is based on a code, many rules deriving from Roman law apply: no code completely broke with the Roman tradition. Rather, the provisions of the Roman law were fitted into a more coherent system and expressed in the national language. For this reason, knowledge of the Roman law is indispensable to understand the legal systems of today. Thus, Roman law is often still a mandatory subject for law students in civil law jurisdictions. In this context, the annual International Roman Law Moot Court was developed in order to better educate the students and to network with one another internationally. 

As steps towards a unification of the private law in the member states of the European Union are being taken, the old &quot;jus commune&quot;, which was the common basis of legal practice everywhere in Europe, but allowed for many local variants, is seen by many as a model.

<text>Reuben James ( 1776 – 3 December 1838) was a boatswain&#x27;s mate of the United States Navy, famous for an act of heroism in the First Barbary War. As of current knowledge, that act was likely conducted by fellow sailor Daniel Frazier and later attributed to James due to a misunderstanding.

==Career==

Born in Delaware around 1776, James joined the United States Navy and served on several ships, including the frigate . During the First Barbary War, the American frigate was captured by the Barbary pirates when she ran aground in the city of Tripoli, on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. During the course of the naval blockade of the harbor, there were numerous engagements, the most intense being the Gunboat Battle of August 3, 1804. During the battle, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur boarded a Tripolitan gunboat that he believed was crewed by the men who had mortally wounded his brother after supposedly surrendering. While Lieutenant Decatur was locked in hand-to-hand combat with the Tripolitan commander, another Tripolitan sailor swung his saber at him. According to early accepted accounts, Reuben James interposed himself between the descending sword and his commander, taking the blow on his head. The blow did not kill him, and he recovered later to continue serving in the Navy.

This account, though, is now considered to be in error. No one by the name of James is recorded as having received medical treatment after the battle. Another of Decatur&#x27;s crewmen, Daniel Frazier, did receive medical treatment for a serious saber slash to the head. This supports some initial accounts that it was Frazier, not James, who saved Decatur&#x27;s life.

James continued his Naval career, serving many years with Decatur. He was forced to retire in January 1836 because of ill health. He died in 1838 at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Washington, DC.

==Influence==
Three warships of the Navy have been named &quot;Reuben James&quot; in his honor:
* [1919-1941], a four-stack , sunk by a German submarine 31 October 1941, after Germany had invaded Poland but before the US had entered World War II. Commemorated in the song &quot;The Sinking of the Reuben James.&quot;

James Island of Washington state was named for James.

<doc id="26367" wikidata="Q1348664" url="?curid=26367" title="Rockwell International">
<text>Rockwell International was a major American manufacturing conglomerate. It was involved in aircraft, the space industry, defense and commercial electronics, components in the automotive industry, printing presses, avionics and industrial products. At its peak, Rockwell International was No. 27 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list, with assets of over $8 billion, sales of $27 billion and 115,000 employees.

Rockwell International&#x27;s predecessor was Rockwell Manufacturing Company, founded in 1919 by Willard Rockwell. In 1968, Rockwell Manufacturing Company included seven operating divisions manufacturing industrial valves, German 2-cycle motors, power tools, gas and water meters. In 1973, it was combined with the aerospace products and renamed Rockwell International. It was split into various companies beginning in the 1980s, including its final split in 2001 into Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins.

==History==
=== Rockwell Manufacturing Company ===

Boston-born Willard Rockwell (1888–1978) made his fortune with the invention and successful launch of a new bearing system for truck axles in 1919. He merged his Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based operation with the Timken-Detroit Axle Company (current Meritor Inc.) in 1928, rising to become chairman of its board in 1940.

Rockwell also drew on the strengths of several of George Westinghouse&#x27;s concerns, and Westinghouse is considered a co-founder of the company.

In 1945, Rockwell Manufacturing Company acquired Delta Machinery and renamed it the Delta Power Tool Division of Rockwell Manufacturing Company and continued to manufacture in Milwaukee. In 1966, Rockwell invented the world&#x27;s first power miter saw. In 1981, Rockwell&#x27;s power tool group was acquired by Pentair and re-branded &quot;Delta Machinery&quot;. Pentair&#x27;s Tools group was acquired by Black &amp; Decker in 2005. Since 2011, Delta has been a subsidiary of Chang Type Industrial Co., Ltd. of China.

In 1956, Rockwell Manufacturing Co. bought Walker-Turner from Kearney and Trecker. In 1957, Walker-Turner operations were closed down in Plainfield, New Jersey and moved to Bellefontaine, Ohio and Tupelo, Mississippi.

Timken-Detroit merged in 1953 with the Standard Steel Spring Company, forming the Rockwell Spring and Axle Company. After various mergers with automotive suppliers, it comprised about 10 to 20 factories in the Upper Midwestern U.S. and southern Ontario, and in 1958 renamed itself Rockwell-Standard Corporation.

Pittsburgh-based Rockwell-Standard Corp. then acquired and merged with Los Angeles-based North American Aviation to form North American Rockwell in September 1967. It then purchased Miehle-Goss-Dexter, the largest supplier of printing presses, and in 1973, acquired Collins Radio, a major avionics supplier.

In 1968, Sterling Faucet Company was bought by Rockwell Manufacturing Co. and it became a subsidiary of the company.

=== 1968–1974 ===
Michael W. Hodges (who had also served as Corporate Director Manufacturing and later as CEO and &#x27;Geschäftsführer&#x27; (Managing Director) of the German-based Engine Division) joined Rockwell Manufacturing Company in 1968 as Corporate Director Quality Assurance. He was appointed member of the Board of Directors of Rockwell GmbH Germany and Dikkers Valve Products LLC Netherlands. Prior to Rockwell, Michael Hodges was a physicist with NASA and aerospace management with Martin-Marietta Corp. in Orlando, Florida.

During Hodges&#x27; seven years with Rockwell there were approximately 90,000 employees in seven divisions: the Valve Division with products for the gas and oil industry with plants located in Barberton, Ohio, Raleigh, North Carolina, Sulphur Springs, Texas, and Kearney, Nebraska, the Gas Products Division of meters and regulators in Dubois, Pennsylvania, the Municipal Water Meter Division in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the Power Tool Division in Syracuse, New York, Jackson, Tennessee, Tupelo, Mississippi, and Columbia, South Carolina, the Transportation Division in Atchison, Kansas with a large steel foundry of products for the automotive, railway and rapid-transit industry, the Sterling Faucet Division in Reedsville, West Virginia, and the Engine Division in Pinneberg, Germany (previously ILO-Motorenwerke, founded 1911 and acquired by Rockwell in 1959), manufacturing 2-cycle gas-driven motors for developing nation products including motor tillers, water pumps, sprayers, cement mixers, tampers and mopeds as well as snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle engines for North America.

A significantly different direction was planned starting in 1973 away from the business model developed since 1945 by the founder Willard Rockwell (1888–1978). The founder&#x27;s son, Willard Rockwell Jr., appeared taking the company in a new direction, replacing the founder&#x27;s model of strong medium-size manufacturing companies with diverse industrial products with strong industrial engineering and quality control in multiple locations – to a new model leveraging assets of the profitable seven manufacturing divisions of Rockwell Manufacturing Company into a new business model of a dominant government-serving (NASA, Defense Dept.) aerospace company, named Rockwell International, which included North American Aviation, of products such as the Space Shuttle. By the end of the 1980s, Rockwell International began to sell-off its prior industrial product manufacturing divisions, starting with the Valve Division, leading to the sale of all divisions and the end of the Rockwell names &gt; Rockwell Manufacturing Company, North American Rockwell, and Rockwell International

In 1973, North American Rockwell merged with Rockwell Manufacturing, run by Willard Rockwell Jr., to form Rockwell International. In the same year, the company acquired Admiral Radio and TV for US$500 million. In 1979, the appliance division was sold to Magic Chef.

=== Apex and break-up ===

In 1978, Rockwell released AIM-65, a one board microprocessor development board based on the MOS Technology 6502. With the death of company founder and first CEO Willard F. Rockwell in 1978, and the stepping down of his son Willard Rockwell Jr. in 1979 as the second CEO, Bob Anderson became CEO and led the company through the 1980s when it became the largest U.S. defense contractor and largest NASA contractor. Rockwell acquired the privately held Allen-Bradley Company for US$1.6billion (roughly $billion today) in February1985, of which $1billion ($billion today) was cash, and became a producer of industrial automation hardware and software.

During the 1980s, Anderson, his CFO Bob dePalma, and the Rockwell management team built the company to #27 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list. It boasted sales of US$12billion (roughly $billion today), and assets of over $8billion ($billion today). Its workforce of over 115,000 was organized into nine major divisions: Space, Aircraft, Defense Electronics, Commercial Electronics, Light Duty Automotive Components, Heavy Duty Automotive Components, Printing Presses, Valves and Meters, and Industrial Automation. Rockwell International was a major employer in southern California, northern Ohio, northern Georgia, eastern Oklahoma, Michigan, western Texas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and western Pennsylvania.
Anderson stepped down as CEO in February 1988, leaving the company to president Donald R. Beall. The completion of the Space Shuttle program and the completion of the B-1 bomber program had led to a decline in revenues, and Beall sought to diversify the company away from government contracts. The end of the Cold War and the perceived &quot;peace dividend&quot;, however, prompted accelerated divestitures and sweeping management reforms. From 1988 to 2001 the company moved its headquarters four times: from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where it had been for decades to El Segundo, California to Seal Beach, California to Costa Mesa, California to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

At the end of the 1980s, the company sold its valve and meter division, formerly Rockwell Manufacturing, to British Tyre &amp; Rubber. Although Rockwell was the #1 Defense and NASA contractor, the &quot;peace dividend&quot; perceived after the fall of the Soviet bloc, led the company to sell its defense and aerospace business, including what was once North American Aviation, the Defense Electronics Division and Rocketdyne, to Boeing in December 1996. In the 1990s, the company spun off its semiconductor products as Conexant Technologies (CNXT), later bought by Synaptics in 2017. Rockwell International also spun off its two automotive divisions (light vehicles division and heavy vehicles division) as one publicly traded company, Meritor Automotive, based in Troy, Michigan, which then merged with Arvin Industries to form Arvin Meritor. That company is now known as Meritor, Inc. In 1996, Rockwell International sold Graphic Systems (formerly Miehle-Goss-Dexter), an Illinois-based newspaper and commercial printing press manufacturer, to its internal management team Stonington Partners as part of a new corporation for US$600 million.

In 2001, what remained of Rockwell International was split into two publicly traded companies, Rockwell Automation and Rockwell Collins, ending the run of what had once been a massive and diverse conglomerate. The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of the old Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off.

In the end, the result had been four spin-offs and three sales combined from Rockwell&#x27;s nine divisions.

The various Rockwell companies list a large number of technological firsts and historic developments in their histories, including the World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter and B-25 Mitchell bomber, the Korean War-era F-86 Sabre fighter jet, America&#x27;s first truly supersonic fighter, the F-100 Super Sabre, and the B-1 Lancer bomber, as well as the Apollo spacecraft, the Space Shuttle orbiter, and most of the Navstar Global Positioning System satellites.

Rocketdyne, which had been spun off by North American in 1955, was re-merged into Rockwell, and by that time produced most of the rocket engines used in the United States. Rockwell also purchased the Aero Design and Engineering Company from William and Rufus Travis Amis. Rockwell redesigned the company&#x27;s Aero Commander aircraft, introducing its new design as the Rockwell Commander 112 and Commander 114.

The company developed a desktop calculator based on a MOSFET chip for use by its engineers. In 1967 Rockwell set up its own manufacturing plant to produce them, starting North American Rockwell MicroElectronics Corp. (called NARMEC). This would later become Rockwell Semiconductor. One of its major successes came in the early 1990s when it introduced the first low-cost 14.4 kbit/s modem chipset, which was used in a huge number of modems.

Collins radios were fitted to 80% of the airliners which were based in first-world countries. Collins designed and built the radios that communicated the Apollo Moon landings and the high-frequency radio network that allows worldwide communication with U.S. military aircraft. Rockwell&#x27;s Rocketdyne division designed and built the third stage of the Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, and the Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere inertial navigation system that provided its navigation. It also built inertial navigation systems for the fleet of ballistic missile submarines.

In addition to the manufacture of nuclear missiles and bombers, Rockwell also produced key components of the bombs they carried, including plutonium triggers at the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado. Rockwell ran the weapons plant from 1975 to 1990, and was one of the subjects of the investigation of Special Grand Jury 89-2 into mismanagement of the plant. In 1990, a group of Colorado homeowners filed a lawsuit against Rockwell and the Dow Chemical Company, accusing the operators of reducing the value of their properties as a result of plutonium releases from the plant. A $375 million settlement was reached in 2016.

Rockwell built heavy-duty truck axles and drive-trains in the U.S., along with power windows, seats, and locks. The Rockwell Tripmaster trip recording system for commercial vehicles was released along with the Logtrak module for DOT log recording for fleets who successfully petitioned the DOT for paper logbook exemptions. Rockwell also built yachts and business jets and owned large amounts of real estate.

It was also involved in providing custom electronic intelligence equipment to the Imperial Iranian Air Force as part of Project Ibex and paid bribes to the Shah of Iran in order to secure contracts there.

==Research laboratory==
Rockwell International had a major research laboratory complex in Thousand Oaks, Ventura County, California. It was founded and built by North American Aviation in 1962, as the North American Science Center. In 1973 it became the Rockwell International Science Center.

The laboratory did independent contract research for the U.S. Government, and also provided research services for the company&#x27;s business units. It was famous for its research in: advanced materials, particularly ceramics; for its infrared imagers; for its research in liquid-crystal displays; and for its high-speed electronics. The laboratory invented Metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), also commonly known as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD). It also achieved fame in selected areas of information science, notably human-computer interaction, augmented reality, multimedia systems, and diagnostics. Rockwell Science Center led the United States Army Research Laboratory&#x27;s Advanced Displays Federated Laboratory Consortium in the late 1990s. In 2000, the infrared imaging division of the laboratory moved into a new building in Camarillo, California.

After Rockwell International&#x27;s breakup in 2001, the laboratory was spun off as a semi-autonomous company called Rockwell Scientific, half owned by Rockwell Collins and half owned by Rockwell Automation. In 2006, the main laboratory and infrared imaging division were sold to Teledyne Corporation. Teledyne made the laboratory complex in Thousand Oaks into its corporate headquarters. A reduced but active research and development operation continues there, under the name Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging, LLC.

<doc id="26368" wikidata="Q42305" url="?curid=26368" title="Richard I of England">
<text>Richard I (8 September 1157 – 6 April 1199), known as Richard Cœur de Lion () or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior, was King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine, and Gascony; Lord of Cyprus; Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes; and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and was therefore not expected to become king, but his two elder brothers predeceased their father.

By the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving several victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he finalised a peace treaty and ended the campaign without retaking Jerusalem.

Richard probably spoke both French and Occitan. He was born in England, where he spent his childhood; before becoming king, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his reign was spent on Crusade, in captivity, or actively defending the French portions of the Angevin Empire. Though regarded as a model king during the four centuries after his death, and seen as a pious hero by his subjects, from the 17th century onward he was gradually perceived by historians as a ruler who preferred to use his kingdom merely as a source of revenue to support his armies, rather than regarding England as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler. This &quot;Little England&quot; view of Richard has come under increasing scrutiny by modern historians, who view it as anachronistic. Richard I remains one of the few kings of England remembered more commonly by his epithet than his regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.

==Early life and accession in Aquitaine==

===Childhood===

Richard was born on 8 September 1157, probably at Beaumont Palace, in Oxford, England, son of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. He was the younger brother of William, Henry the Young King, and Matilda; William died before Richard&#x27;s birth. As a younger son of King Henry II, Richard was not expected to ascend the throne. Four more children were born to King Henry and Queen Eleanor: Geoffrey, Eleanor, Joan, and John. Richard also had two half-sisters from his mother&#x27;s first marriage to Louis VII of France: Marie and Alix.

Richard is often depicted as having been the favourite son of his mother. His father was Angevin-Norman and great-grandson of William the Conqueror. Contemporary historian Ralph de Diceto traced his family&#x27;s lineage through Matilda of Scotland to the Anglo-Saxon kings of England and Alfred the Great, and from there legend linked them to Noah and Woden. According to Angevin family tradition, there was even &#x27;infernal blood&#x27; in their ancestry, with a claimed descent from the fairy, or female demon, Melusine.

While his father visited his lands from Scotland to France, Richard probably spent his childhood in England. His first recorded visit to the European continent was in May 1165, when his mother took him to Normandy. His wet nurse was Hodierna of St Albans, whom he gave a generous pension after he became king. Little is known about Richard&#x27;s education. Although he was born in Oxford and brought up in England up to his eighth year, it is not known to what extent he used or understood English; he was an educated man who composed poetry and wrote in Limousin (&quot;lenga d&#x27;òc&quot;) and also in French.

During his captivity, English prejudice against foreigners was used in a calculated way by his brother John to help destroy the authority of Richard&#x27;s chancellor, William Longchamp, who was a Norman. One of the specific charges laid against Longchamp, by John&#x27;s supporter Hugh Nonant, was that he could not speak English. This indicates that by the late 12th century a knowledge of English was expected of those in positions of authority in England.

Richard was said to be very attractive; his hair was between red and blond, and he was light-eyed with a pale complexion. According to Clifford Brewer, he was , although that is unverifiable since his remains have been lost since at least the French Revolution. John, his youngest brother, was known to be .

The &quot;Itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis Ricardi&quot;, a Latin prose narrative of the Third Crusade, states that: &quot;He was tall, of elegant build; the colour of his hair was between red and gold; his limbs were supple and straight. He had long arms suited to wielding a sword. His long legs matched the rest of his body&quot;.

Marriage alliances were common among medieval royalty: they led to political alliances and peace treaties and allowed families to stake claims of succession on each other&#x27;s lands. In March 1159, it was arranged that Richard would marry one of the daughters of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona; however, these arrangements failed, and the marriage never took place. Henry the Young King was married to Margaret, daughter of Louis VII of France, on 2 November 1160. Despite this alliance between the Plantagenets and the Capetians, the dynasty on the French throne, the two houses were sometimes in conflict. In 1168, the intercession of Pope Alexander III was necessary to secure a truce between them. Henry II had conquered Brittany and taken control of Gisors and the Vexin, which had been part of Margaret&#x27;s dowry.

Early in the 1160s there had been suggestions Richard should marry Alys, Countess of the Vexin, fourth daughter of Louis VII; because of the rivalry between the kings of England and France, Louis obstructed the marriage. A peace treaty was secured in January 1169 and Richard&#x27;s betrothal to Alys was confirmed. Henry II planned to divide his and Eleanor&#x27;s territories among their three eldest surviving sons: Henry would become King of England and have control of Anjou, Maine, and Normandy; Richard would inherit Aquitaine and Poitiers from his mother; and Geoffrey would become Duke of Brittany through marriage with Constance, heir presumptive of Conan IV. At the ceremony where Richard&#x27;s betrothal was confirmed, he paid homage to the king of France for Aquitaine, thus securing ties of vassalage between the two.

After Henry II fell seriously ill in 1170, he enacted his plan to divide his territories, although he would retain overall authority over his sons and their territories. His son Henry was crowned as heir apparent in June 1170, and in 1171 Richard left for Aquitaine with his mother, and Henry II gave him the duchy of Aquitaine at the request of Eleanor. Richard and his mother embarked on a tour of Aquitaine in 1171 in an attempt to pacify the locals. Together, they laid the foundation stone of St Augustine&#x27;s Monastery in Limoges. In June 1172, at age 14, Richard was formally recognised as duke of Aquitaine and count of Poitou when he was granted the lance and banner emblems of his office; the ceremony took place in Poitiers and was repeated in Limoges, where he wore the ring of St Valerie, who was the personification of Aquitaine.

===Revolt against Henry II===

According to Ralph of Coggeshall, Henry the Young King instigated a rebellion against Henry II; he wanted to reign independently over at least part of the territory his father had promised him, and to break away from his dependence on Henry II, who controlled the purse strings. There were rumors that Eleanor might have encouraged her sons to revolt against their father.

Henry the Young King abandoned his father and left for the French court, seeking the protection of Louis VII; his brothers Richard and Geoffrey soon followed him, while the five-year-old John remained in England. Louis gave his support to the three brothers and even knighted Richard, tying them together through vassalage.
Jordan Fantosme, a contemporary poet, described the rebellion as a &quot;war without love&quot;.
The brothers made an oath at the French court that they would not make terms with Henry II without the consent of Louis VII and the French barons. With the support of Louis, Henry the Young King attracted many barons to his cause through promises of land and money; one such baron was Philip I, Count of Flanders, who was promised £1,000 and several castles. The brothers also had supporters ready to rise up in England. Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester, joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester, and William I of Scotland for a rebellion in Suffolk. The alliance with Louis was initially successful, and by July 1173 the rebels were besieging Aumale, Neuf-Marché, and Verneuil, and Hugh de Kevelioc had captured Dol in Brittany. Richard went to Poitou and raised the barons who were loyal to himself and his mother in rebellion against his father. Eleanor was captured, so Richard was left to lead his campaign against Henry II&#x27;s supporters in Aquitaine on his own. He marched to take La Rochelle but was rejected by the inhabitants; he withdrew to the city of Saintes, which he established as a base of operations.

In the meantime, Henry II had raised a very expensive army of more than 20,000 mercenaries with which to face the rebellion. He marched on Verneuil, and Louis retreated from his forces. The army proceeded to recapture Dol and subdued Brittany. At this point Henry II made an offer of peace to his sons; on the advice of Louis the offer was refused. Henry II&#x27;s forces took Saintes by surprise and captured much of its garrison, although Richard was able to escape with a small group of soldiers. He took refuge in Château de Taillebourg for the rest of the war. Henry the Young King and the Count of Flanders planned to land in England to assist the rebellion led by the Earl of Leicester. Anticipating this, Henry II returned to England with 500 soldiers and his prisoners (including Eleanor and his sons&#x27; wives and fiancées), but on his arrival found out that the rebellion had already collapsed. William I of Scotland and Hugh Bigod were captured on 13 and 25 July respectively. Henry II returned to France and raised the siege of Rouen, where Louis VII had been joined by Henry the Young King after abandoning his plan to invade England. Louis was defeated and a peace treaty was signed in September 1174, the Treaty of Montlouis.

When Henry II and Louis VII made a truce on 8 September 1174, its terms specifically excluded Richard. Abandoned by Louis and wary of facing his father&#x27;s army in battle, Richard went to Henry II&#x27;s court at Poitiers on 23 September and begged for forgiveness, weeping and falling at the feet of Henry, who gave Richard the kiss of peace. Several days later, Richard&#x27;s brothers joined him in seeking reconciliation with their father. The terms the three brothers accepted were less generous than those they had been offered earlier in the conflict (when Richard was offered four castles in Aquitaine and half of the income from the duchy): Richard was given control of two castles in Poitou and half the income of Aquitaine; Henry the Young King was given two castles in Normandy; and Geoffrey was permitted half of Brittany. Eleanor remained Henry II&#x27;s prisoner until his death, partly as insurance for Richard&#x27;s good behaviour.

===Final years of Henry II&#x27;s reign===

After the conclusion of the war, the process of pacifying the provinces that had rebelled against Henry II began. The King travelled to Anjou for this purpose, and Geoffrey dealt with Brittany. In January 1175 Richard was dispatched to Aquitaine to punish the barons who had fought for him. The historian John Gillingham notes that the chronicle of Roger of Howden is the main source for Richard&#x27;s activities in this period. According to the chronicle, most of the castles belonging to rebels were to be returned to the state they were in 15 days before the outbreak of war, while others were to be razed. Given that by this time it was common for castles to be built in stone, and that many barons had expanded or refortified their castles, this was not an easy task. Roger of Howden records the two-month siege of Castillon-sur-Agen; while the castle was &quot;notoriously strong&quot;, Richard&#x27;s siege engines battered the defenders into submission.

On this campaign, Richard acquired the name &quot;the Lion&quot; or &quot;the Lionheart&quot; due to his noble, brave and fierce leadership. He is referred to as &quot;this our lion&quot; (&quot;hic leo noster&quot;) as early as 1187 in the &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot; of &quot;Giraldus Cambrensis&quot;, while the byname &quot;lionheart&quot; (&quot;le quor de lion&quot;) is first recorded in Ambroise&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Estoire de la Guerre Sainte&quot; in the context of the Accon campaign of 1191.

Henry seemed unwilling to entrust any of his sons with resources that could be used against him. It was suspected that the King had appropriated Alys of France, Richard&#x27;s betrothed, as his mistress. This made a marriage between Richard and Alys technically impossible in the eyes of the Church, but Henry prevaricated: he regarded Alys&#x27;s dowry, Vexin in the Île-de-France, as valuable. Richard was discouraged from renouncing Alys because she was the sister of King Philip II of France, a close ally.

After his failure to overthrow his father, Richard concentrated on putting down internal revolts by the nobles of Aquitaine, especially in the territory of Gascony. The increasing cruelty of his rule led to a major revolt there in 1179. Hoping to dethrone Richard, the rebels sought the help of his brothers Henry and Geoffrey. The turning point came in the Charente Valley in the spring of 1179. The well-defended fortress of Taillebourg seemed impregnable. The castle was surrounded by a cliff on three sides and a town on the fourth side with a three-layer wall. Richard first destroyed and looted the farms and lands surrounding the fortress, leaving its defenders no reinforcements or lines of retreat. The garrison sallied out of the castle and attacked Richard; he was able to subdue the army and then followed the defenders inside the open gates, where he easily took over the castle in two days. Richard&#x27;s victory at Taillebourg deterred many barons from thinking of rebelling and forced them to declare their loyalty to him. In 1181–82, Richard faced a revolt over the succession to the county of Angoulême. His opponents turned to Philip II of France for support, and the fighting spread through the Limousin and Périgord. The excessive cruelty of Richard&#x27;s punitive campaigns aroused even more hostility.

After Richard had subdued his rebellious barons he again challenged his father. From 1180 to 1183 the tension between Henry and Richard grew, as King Henry commanded Richard to pay homage to Henry the Young King, but Richard refused. Finally, in 1183 Henry the Young King and Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, invaded Aquitaine in an attempt to subdue Richard. Richard&#x27;s barons joined in the fray and turned against their duke. However, Richard and his army succeeded in holding back the invading armies, and they executed any prisoners. The conflict paused briefly in June 1183 when the Young King died. With the death of Henry the Young King, Richard became the eldest surviving son and therefore heir to the English crown. King Henry demanded that Richard give up Aquitaine (which he planned to give to his youngest son John as his inheritance). Richard refused, and conflict continued between them. This refusal is what finally made Henry II bring Queen Eleanor out of prison. He sent her to Aquitaine and demanded that Richard give up his lands to his mother, who would once again rule over those lands.

In 1187, to strengthen his position, Richard allied himself with 22-year-old Philip II, the son of Eleanor&#x27;s ex-husband Louis VII by Adela of Champagne. Roger of Howden wrote:

The King of England was struck with great astonishment, and wondered what [this alliance] could mean, and, taking precautions for the future, frequently sent messengers into France for the purpose of recalling his son Richard; who, pretending that he was peaceably inclined and ready to come to his father, made his way to Chinon, and, in spite of the person who had the custody thereof, carried off the greater part of his father&#x27;s treasures, and fortified his castles in Poitou with the same, refusing to go to his father.

Overall, Howden is chiefly concerned with the politics of the relationship between Richard and Philip. Gillingham has addressed theories suggesting that this political relationship was also sexually intimate, which he posits probably stemmed from an official record announcing that, as a symbol of unity between the two countries, the kings of England and France had slept overnight in the same bed. Gillingham has characterized this as &quot;an accepted political act, nothing sexual about it;... a bit like a modern-day photo opportunity&quot;.

With news arriving of the Battle of Hattin, he took the cross at Tours in the company of other French nobles. In exchange for Philip&#x27;s help against his father, Richard paid homage to Philip in November 1188. On 4 July 1189, the forces of Richard and Philip defeated Henry&#x27;s army at Ballans. Henry agreed to name Richard his heir apparent. Two days later Henry died in Chinon, and Richard succeeded him as King of England, Duke of Normandy, and Count of Anjou. Roger of Howden claimed that Henry&#x27;s corpse bled from the nose in Richard&#x27;s presence, which was assumed to be a sign that Richard had caused his death.

==King and crusader==
===Coronation and anti-Jewish violence===
Richard I was officially invested as Duke of Normandy on 20 July 1189 and crowned king in Westminster Abbey on 3 September 1189. Tradition barred all Jews and women from the investiture, but some Jewish leaders arrived to present gifts for the new king. According to Ralph of Diceto, Richard&#x27;s courtiers stripped and flogged the Jews, then flung them out of court.

When a rumour spread that Richard had ordered all Jews to be killed, the people of London attacked the Jewish population. Many Jewish homes were destroyed by arsonists, and several Jews were forcibly converted. Some sought sanctuary in the Tower of London, and others managed to escape. Among those killed was Jacob of Orléans, a respected Jewish scholar. Roger of Howden, in his &quot;&quot;, claimed that the jealous and bigoted citizens started the rioting, and that Richard punished the perpetrators, allowing a forcibly converted Jew to return to his native religion. Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, reacted by remarking, &quot;If the King is not God&#x27;s man, he had better be the devil&#x27;s&quot;.

Offended that he was not being obeyed, and aware that the attacks could destabilise his realm on the eve of his departure on crusade, Richard ordered the execution of those responsible for the most heinous murders and persecutions, including rioters who had accidentally burned down Christian homes. He distributed a royal writ demanding that the Jews be left alone. The edict was only loosely enforced, however, and the following March further violence occurred, including a massacre at York.

===Crusade plans===
Richard had already taken the cross as Count of Poitou in 1187. His father and Philip II had done so at Gisors on 21 January 1188 after receiving news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin. After Richard became king, he and Philip agreed to go on the Third Crusade, since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories.

Richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross. He started to raise and equip a new crusader army. He spent most of his father&#x27;s treasury (filled with money raised by the Saladin tithe), raised taxes, and even agreed to free King William I of Scotland from his oath of subservience to Richard in exchange for marks (£). To raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions, lands, and other privileges to those interested in them. Those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts. William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and the King&#x27;s chancellor, made a show of bidding £ to remain as Chancellor. He was apparently outbid by a certain Reginald the Italian, but that bid was refused.

Richard made some final arrangements on the continent. He reconfirmed his father&#x27;s appointment of William Fitz Ralph to the important post of seneschal of Normandy. In Anjou, Stephen of Tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement. Payn de Rochefort, an Angevin knight, became seneschal of Anjou. In Poitou the ex-provost of Benon, Peter Bertin, was made seneschal, and finally, the household official Helie de La Celle was picked for the seneschalship in Gascony. After repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his French possessions, Richard finally set out on the crusade in summer 1190. (His delay was criticised by troubadours such as Bertran de Born.) He appointed as regents Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essexwho soon died and was replaced by William Longchamp. Richard&#x27;s brother John was not satisfied by this decision and started scheming against William Longchamp. When Richard was raising funds for his crusade, he was said to have declared, &quot;I would have sold London if I could find a buyer&quot;.

===Occupation of Sicily===

In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily in 1189 his cousin Tancred had seized power, although the legal heir was William&#x27;s aunt Constance, wife of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor. Tancred had imprisoned William&#x27;s widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard&#x27;s sister, and did not give her the money she had inherited in William&#x27;s will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip, and Tancred. Its main terms were:
* Joan was to receive of gold as compensation for her inheritance, which Tancred kept.
* Richard officially proclaimed his nephew, Arthur of Brittany, son of Geoffrey, as his heir, and Tancred promised to marry one of his daughters to Arthur when he came of age, giving a further of gold that would be returned by Richard if Arthur did not marry Tancred&#x27;s daughter.

The two kings stayed in Sicily for a while, but this resulted in increasing tensions between them and their men, with Philip plotting with Tancred against Richard. The two kings eventually met to clear the air and reached an agreement, including the end of Richard&#x27;s betrothal to Philip&#x27;s sister Alys. In 1190 King Richard, before leaving for the Holy Land for the crusade, met Joachim of Fiore, who spoke to him of a prophecy contained in the Book of Revelation.

===Conquest of Cyprus===

In April 1191, Richard left Messina for Acre with an army of 17,000 men, but a storm dispersed his large fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the ship carrying his sister Joan and his new fiancée, Berengaria of Navarre, was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, along with the wrecks of several other vessels, including the treasure ship. Survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island&#x27;s ruler, Isaac Komnenos.

On 1 May 1191, Richard&#x27;s fleet arrived in the port of Lemesos on Cyprus. He ordered Isaac to release the prisoners and treasure. Isaac refused, so Richard landed his troops and took Lemesos. Various princes of the Holy Land arrived in Lemesos at the same time, in particular Guy of Lusignan. All declared their support for Richard provided that he support Guy against his rival, Conrad of Montferrat.

The local magnates abandoned Isaac, who considered making peace with Richard, joining him on the crusade, and offering his daughter in marriage to the person named by Richard. Isaac changed his mind, however, and tried to escape. Richard&#x27;s troops, led by Guy de Lusignan, conquered the whole island by 1 June. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. Richard named Richard de Camville and Robert of Thornham as governors. He later sold the island to the master of Knights Templar, Robert de Sablé, and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy of Lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom.

The rapid conquest of the island by Richard was of strategic importance. The island occupies a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea. Cyprus remained a Christian stronghold until the Ottoman invasion in 1570. Richard&#x27;s exploit was well publicised and contributed to his reputation, and he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island. Richard left Cyprus for Acre on 5 June with his allies.

===Marriage===

Before leaving Cyprus on crusade, Richard married Berengaria, the first-born daughter of King Sancho VI of Navarre. Richard had first grown close to her at a tournament held in her native Navarre. The wedding was held in Lemesos on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St George and was attended by Richard&#x27;s sister Joan, whom he had brought from Sicily. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour, many feasts and entertainments, and public parades and celebrations followed, commemorating the event. When Richard married Berengaria he was still officially betrothed to Alys, and he pushed for the match in order to obtain the Kingdom of Navarre as a fief, as Aquitaine had been for his father. Further, Eleanor championed the match, as Navarre bordered Aquitaine, thereby securing the southern border of her ancestral lands. Richard took his new wife on crusade with him briefly, though they returned separately. Berengaria had almost as much difficulty in making the journey home as her husband did, and she did not see England until after his death. After his release from German captivity, Richard showed some regret for his earlier conduct, but he was not reunited with his wife. The marriage remained childless.

===In the Holy Land===

Richard landed at Acre on 8 June 1191. He gave his support to his Poitevin vassal Guy of Lusignan, who had brought troops to help him in Cyprus. Guy was the widower of his father&#x27;s cousin Sibylla of Jerusalem and was trying to retain the kingship of Jerusalem, despite his wife&#x27;s death during the Siege of Acre the previous year. Guy&#x27;s claim was challenged by Conrad of Montferrat, second husband of Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister, Isabella: Conrad, whose defence of Tyre had saved the kingdom in 1187, was supported by Philip of France, son of his first cousin Louis VII of France, and by another cousin, Leopold V, Duke of Austria. Richard also allied with Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella&#x27;s first husband, from whom she had been forcibly divorced in 1190. Humphrey was loyal to Guy and spoke Arabic fluently, so Richard used him as a translator and negotiator.

Richard and his forces aided in the capture of Acre, despite Richard&#x27;s serious illness. At one point, while sick from &quot;arnaldia&quot;, a disease similar to scurvy, he picked off guards on the walls with a crossbow, while being carried on a stretcher covered &quot;in a great silken quilt&quot;. Eventually, Conrad of Montferrat concluded the surrender negotiations with Saladin&#x27;s forces inside Acre and raised the banners of the kings in the city. Richard quarrelled with Leopold over the deposition of Isaac Komnenos (related to Leopold&#x27;s Byzantine mother) and his position within the crusade. Leopold&#x27;s banner had been raised alongside the English and French standards. This was interpreted as arrogance by both Richard and Philip, as Leopold was a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor (although he was the highest-ranking surviving leader of the imperial forces). Richard&#x27;s men tore the flag down and threw it in the moat of Acre. Leopold left the crusade immediately. Philip also left soon afterwards, in poor health and after further disputes with Richard over the status of Cyprus (Philip demanded half the island) and the kingship of Jerusalem. Richard, suddenly, found himself without allies.

Richard had kept 2,700 Muslim prisoners as hostages against Saladin fulfilling all the terms of the surrender of the lands around Acre. Philip, before leaving, had entrusted his prisoners to Conrad, but Richard forced him to hand them over to him. Richard feared his forces being bottled up in Acre as he believed his campaign could not advance with the prisoners in train. He, therefore, ordered all the prisoners executed. He then moved south, defeating Saladin&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Arsuf north of Jaffa on 7 September 1191. Saladin attempted to harass Richard&#x27;s army into breaking its formation in order to defeat it in detail. Richard maintained his army&#x27;s defensive formation, however, until the Hospitallers broke ranks to charge the right wing of Saladin&#x27;s forces. Richard then ordered a general counterattack, which won the battle. Arsuf was an important victory. The Muslim army was not destroyed, despite the considerable casualties it suffered, but it did rout; this was considered shameful by the Muslims and boosted the morale of the Crusaders. In November 1191, following the fall of Jaffa, the Crusader army advanced inland towards Jerusalem. The army then marched to Beit Nuba, only from Jerusalem. Muslim morale in Jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the Crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly. However, the weather was appallingly bad, cold with heavy rain and hailstorms; this, combined with the fear that the Crusader army, if it besieged Jerusalem, might be trapped by a relieving force, led to the decision to retreat back to the coast. Richard attempted to negotiate with Saladin, but this was unsuccessful. In the first half of 1192, he and his troops refortified Ascalon.

An election forced Richard to accept Conrad of Montferrat as King of Jerusalem, and he sold Cyprus to his defeated protégé, Guy. Only days later, on 28 April 1192, Conrad was stabbed to death by the Assassins before he could be crowned. Eight days later Richard&#x27;s own nephew Henry II of Champagne was married to the widowed Isabella, although she was carrying Conrad&#x27;s child. The murder was never conclusively solved, and Richard&#x27;s contemporaries widely suspected his involvement.

The crusader army made another advance on Jerusalem, and, in June 1192, it came within sight of the city before being forced to retreat once again, this time because of dissension amongst its leaders. In particular, Richard and the majority of the army council wanted to force Saladin to relinquish Jerusalem by attacking the basis of his power through an invasion of Egypt. The leader of the French contingent, Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, however, was adamant that a direct attack on Jerusalem should be made. This split the Crusader army into two factions, and neither was strong enough to achieve its objective. Richard stated that he would accompany any attack on Jerusalem but only as a simple soldier; he refused to lead the army. Without a united command the army had little choice but to retreat back to the coast.

A period of minor skirmishes with Saladin&#x27;s forces commenced, punctuated by another defeat in the field for the Ayyubid army at the Battle of Jaffa. Baha&#x27; al-Din, a contemporary Muslim soldier and biographer of Saladin, recorded a tribute to Richard&#x27;s martial prowess at this battle: &quot;I have been assured ... that on that day the king of England, lance in hand, rode along the whole length of our army from right to left, and not one of our soldiers left the ranks to attack him. The Sultan was wroth thereat and left the battlefield in anger...&quot;. Both sides realised that their respective positions were growing untenable. Richard knew that both Philip and his own brother John were starting to plot against him, and the morale of Saladin&#x27;s army had been badly eroded by repeated defeats. However, Saladin insisted on the razing of Ascalon&#x27;s fortifications, which Richard&#x27;s men had rebuilt, and a few other points. Richard made one last attempt to strengthen his bargaining position by attempting to invade Egypt – Saladin&#x27;s chief supply-base – but failed. In the end, time ran out for Richard. He realised that his return could be postponed no longer, since both Philip and John were taking advantage of his absence. He and Saladin finally came to a settlement on 2 September 1192. The terms provided for the destruction of Ascalon&#x27;s fortifications, allowed Christian pilgrims and merchants access to Jerusalem, and initiated a three-year truce. Richard, being ill with &quot;arnaldia&quot;, left for England on 9 October 1192.

==Life after the Third Crusade==
===Captivity, ransom and return===

Bad weather forced Richard&#x27;s ship to put in at Corfu, in the lands of Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who objected to Richard&#x27;s annexation of Cyprus, formerly Byzantine territory. Disguised as a Knight Templar, Richard sailed from Corfu with four attendants, but his ship was wrecked near Aquileia, forcing Richard and his party into taking a dangerous land route through central Europe. On his way to the territory of his brother-in-law Henry the Lion, Richard was captured shortly before Christmas 1192 near Vienna by Leopold of Austria, who accused Richard of arranging the murder of his cousin Conrad of Montferrat. Moreover, Richard had personally offended Leopold by casting down his standard from the walls of Acre.

Leopold kept Richard prisoner at Dürnstein Castle under the care of Leopold&#x27;s Hadmar of Kuenring. This mishap was soon known in England, but the regents were for some weeks uncertain of his whereabouts. While in prison, Richard wrote the musical piece &#x27; or &#x27; (&quot;No man who is imprisoned&quot;), which is addressed to his half-sister Marie. He wrote the song, in French and Occitan versions, to express his feelings of abandonment by his people and his sister. The detention of a crusader was contrary to public law, and on these grounds Pope Celestine III excommunicated Leopold.

On 28 March 1193, Richard was brought to Speyer and handed over to Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, who imprisoned him in Trifels Castle. The Emperor was aggrieved by the support the Plantagenets had given to the family of Henry the Lion and by Richard&#x27;s recognition of Tancred in Sicily. Henry VI needed money to raise an army and assert his rights over southern Italy and continued to hold Richard for ransom. Nevertheless, to Richard&#x27;s irritation, Pope Celestine hesitated to excommunicate Henry VI, as he had Duke Leopold, for the continued wrongful imprisonment of Richard. He famously refused to show deference to the Emperor and declared to him, &quot;&quot;. The King was at first shown a certain measure of respect, but later, at the prompting of Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais and Philip of France&#x27;s cousin, the conditions of Richard&#x27;s captivity worsened, and he was kept in chains, &quot;so heavy,&quot; Richard declared, &quot;that a horse or ass would have struggled to move under them.&quot;

The Emperor demanded that marks (100,000 pounds of silver) be delivered to him before he would release the King, the same amount raised by the Saladin tithe only a few years earlier, and two to three times the annual income of the English Crown under Richard. Meanwhile, Eleanor worked tirelessly to raise the ransom for her son&#x27;s release. Leopold also requested Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany, niece of Richard, marry his heir Frederick. Both clergy and laymen were taxed for a quarter of the value of their property, the gold and silver treasures of the churches were confiscated, and money was raised from the scutage and the carucage taxes. At the same time, Richard&#x27;s brother John and King Philip of France offered marks for Henry VI to hold Richard prisoner until Michaelmas 1194. Henry turned down the offer. The money to release the King was transferred to Germany by the Emperor&#x27;s ambassadors, but &quot;at the king&#x27;s peril&quot; (had it been lost along the way, Richard would have been held responsible), and finally, on 4 February 1194, Richard was released. Philip sent a message to John: &quot;Look to yourself; the devil is loose&quot;. Furthermore, upon the sudden death of Leopold, under the pressure of the Pope, the new duke Frederick was forced to abandon his marriage plan with Eleanor of Brittany.

===War against Philip of France===
In Richard&#x27;s absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip&#x27;s conquests in the period of Richard&#x27;s imprisonment was a part of Normandy called Norman Vexin facing French Vexin. Richard forgave John when they met again and named him as his heir in place of their nephew Arthur. At Winchester, on 11 March 1194, Richard was crowned a second time to nullify the shame of his captivity.

Richard began his reconquest of the lost lands in Normandy. The fall of the Château de Gisors to the French in 1193 opened a gap in the Norman defences. The search began for a fresh site for a new castle to defend the duchy of Normandy and act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back Vexin from French control. A naturally defensible position was identified, perched high above the River Seine, an important transport route, in the manor of Andeli. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (December 1195) between Richard and Philip II, neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build the vast Château Gaillard. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor, as it was one of the diocese&#x27;s most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in Normandy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Catholic Church. The archbishop issued an interdict against performing church services in the duchy of Normandy; Roger of Howden detailed &quot;unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of Normandy&quot;. The interdict was still in force when work began on the castle, but Pope Celestine III repealed it in April 1197 after Richard made gifts of land to the archbishop and the diocese of Rouen, including two manors and the prosperous port of Dieppe.

Royal expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent under Henry II, attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard&#x27;s war with the king of France. However, the work at Château Gaillard was some of the most expensive of its time and cost an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 between 1196 and 1198. This was more than double Richard&#x27;s spending on castles in England, an estimated £7,000. Unprecedented in its speed of construction, the castle was mostly complete in two years, when most construction on such a scale would have taken the better part of a decade. According to William of Newburgh, in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a &quot;rain of blood&quot;. While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred.
As no master-mason is mentioned in the otherwise detailed records of the castle&#x27;s construction, military historian Richard Allen Brown has suggested that Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard showed in the work through his frequent presence. In his final years, the castle became Richard&#x27;s favourite residence, and writs and charters were written at Château Gaillard bearing &quot;&quot; (at the Fair Castle of the Rock).

Château Gaillard was ahead of its time, featuring innovations that would be adopted in castle architecture nearly a century later. Allen Brown described Château Gaillard as &quot;one of the finest castles in Europe&quot;, and military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that it was considered &quot;the masterpiece of its time. The reputation of its builder, Cœur de Lion, as a great military engineer might stand firm on this single structure. He was no mere copyist of the models he had seen in the East, but introduced many original details of his own invention into the stronghold&quot;.

Determined to resist Philip&#x27;s designs on contested Angevin lands such as the Vexin and Berry, Richard poured all his military expertise and vast resources into the war on the French King. He organised an alliance against Philip, including Baldwin IX of Flanders, Renaud, Count of Boulogne, and his father-in-law, King Sancho VI of Navarre, who raided Philip&#x27;s lands from the south. Most importantly, he managed to secure the Welf inheritance in Saxony for his nephew, Henry the Lion&#x27;s son, who was elected Otto IV of Germany in 1198.

Partly as a result of these and other intrigues, Richard won several victories over Philip. At Fréteval in 1194, just after Richard&#x27;s return to France from captivity and money-raising in England, Philip fled, leaving his entire archive of financial audits and documents to be captured by Richard. At the Battle of Gisors (sometimes called Courcelles) in 1198, Richard took &quot;&quot;&quot;God and my Right&quot;as his motto (still used by the British monarchy today), echoing his earlier boast to Emperor Henry that his rank acknowledged no superior but God.

===Death===

In March 1199, Richard was in Limousin suppressing a revolt by Viscount Aimar V of Limoges. Although it was Lent, he &quot;devastated the Viscount&#x27;s land with fire and sword&quot;. He besieged the tiny, virtually unarmed castle of Châlus-Chabrol. Some chroniclers claimed that this was because a local peasant had uncovered a treasure trove of Roman gold.

On 26 March 1199, Richard was hit in the shoulder by a crossbow bolt, and the wound turned gangrenous. Richard asked to have the crossbowman brought before him; called alternatively Pierre (or Peter) Basile, John Sabroz, Dudo, and Bertrand de Gourdon (from the town of Gourdon) by chroniclers, the man turned out (according to some sources, but not all) to be a boy. He said Richard had killed his father and two brothers, and that he had intended to kill Richard in revenge. He expected to be executed, but as a final act of mercy Richard forgave him, saying &quot;Live on, and by my bounty behold the light of day&quot;, before he ordered the boy to be freed and sent away with 100 shillings.
Richard died on 6 April 1199 in the arms of his mother, and thus &quot;ended his earthly day.&quot; Because of the nature of his death, it was later said that &quot;the Lion by the Ant was slain&quot;. According to one chronicler, Richard&#x27;s last act of chivalry proved fruitless when the infamous mercenary captain Mercadier had the boy flayed alive and hanged as soon as Richard died.

Richard&#x27;s heart was buried at Rouen in Normandy, his entrails in Châlus (where he died), and the rest of his body at the feet of his father at Fontevraud Abbey in Anjou. In 2012, scientists analysed the remains of Richard&#x27;s heart and found that it had been embalmed with various substances, including frankincense, a symbolically important substance because it had been present both at the birth and embalming of Christ.

Henry Sandford, Bishop of Rochester (1226–1235), announced that he had seen a vision of Richard ascending to Heaven in March 1232 (along with Stephen Langton, the former archbishop of Canterbury), the King having presumably spent 33 years in purgatory as expiation for his sins.

Richard produced no legitimate heirs and acknowledged only one illegitimate son, Philip of Cognac. He was succeeded by his brother John as king. His French territories, with the exception of Rouen, initially rejected John as a successor, preferring his nephew Arthur. The lack of any direct heirs from Richard was the first step in the dissolution of the Angevin Empire.

==Character==
Contemporaries considered Richard as both a king and a knight famed for personal martial prowess; this was, apparently, the first such instance of this combination. He was known as a valiant, competent military leader and individual fighter who was courageous and generous. At the same time, he was considered prone to the sins of lust, pride, greed and, above all, excessive cruelty. Ralph of Coggeshall, summarising Richard&#x27;s career, deplores that the King was one of &quot;the immense cohort of sinners&quot;. He was criticised by clergy chroniclers for having taxed the clergy both for the Crusade and for his ransom, whereas the church and the clergy were usually exempt from taxes.

Richard was a patron and a protector of the trouvères and troubadours of his entourage; he was also a poet himself. He was interested in writing and music, and two poems are attributed to him. The first one is a sirventes in Old French, &quot;Dalfin je us voill desrenier&quot;, and the second one is a lament that he wrote during his imprisonment at Dürnstein Castle, &quot;Ja nus hons pris&quot;, with a version in Old Occitan and a version in Old French.

=== Speculation regarding sexuality ===
In the historiography of the second half of the 20th century, much interest was shown in Richard&#x27;s sexuality, in particular whether there was evidence of homosexuality. The topic had not been raised by Victorian or Edwardian historians, a fact denounced as a &quot;conspiracy of silence&quot; by John Harvey (1948). The argument primarily drew on accounts of Richard&#x27;s behaviour, as well as of his confessions and penitences, and of his childless marriage. Richard did have at least one illegitimate child, Philip of Cognac, and there are reports on his sexual relations with local women during his campaigns. Historians remain divided on the question of Richard&#x27;s sexuality. Harvey argued in favour of his homosexuality but has been disputed by other historians, most notably John Gillingham (1994), who argues that Richard was probably heterosexual. Flori (1999) again argued in favour of Richard&#x27;s homosexuality, based on Richard&#x27;s two public confessions and penitences (in 1191 and 1195) which, according to Flori, &quot;must have&quot; referred to the sin of sodomy. But Flori concedes that contemporary accounts of Richard taking women by force exist, concluding that he probably had sexual relations with both men and women. Flori and Gillingham nevertheless agree that accounts of bed-sharing do not support the suggestion that Richard had a sexual relationship with King Philip II, as other modern authors had suggested.

==Legacy==

===Heraldry===
The second Great Seal of Richard I (1198) shows him bearing a shield depicting &quot;three lions passant-guardant&quot;. This is the first instance of the appearance of this blazon, which later became established as the Royal Arms of England. It is likely, therefore, that Richard introduced this heraldic design. In his earlier Great Seal of 1189, he had used either one &quot;lion rampant&quot; or two &quot;lions rampants combatants&quot;, arms which he may have adopted from his father.

Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a &quot;lion statant&quot; (now &quot;statant-guardant&quot;). The coat of three lions continues to represent England on several coins of the pound sterling, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (such as the England national football team, and the team&#x27;s &quot;Three Lions&quot; anthem), and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.

===Medieval folklore===
Around the middle of the 13th century, various legends developed that, after Richard&#x27;s capture, his minstrel Blondel travelled Europe from castle to castle, loudly singing a song known only to the two of them (they had composed it together). Eventually, he came to the place where Richard was being held, and Richard heard the song and answered with the appropriate refrain, thus revealing where the King was incarcerated. The story was the basis of André Ernest Modeste Grétry&#x27;s opera &quot;Richard Cœur-de-Lion&quot; and seems to be the inspiration for the opening to Richard Thorpe&#x27;s film version of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. It seems unconnected to the real Jean &#x27;Blondel&#x27; de Nesle, an aristocratic . It also does not correspond to the historical reality, since the King&#x27;s jailers did not hide the fact; on the contrary, they publicised it. An early account of this legend is to be found in Claude Fauchet&#x27;s &quot;Recueil de l&#x27;origine de la langue et poesie françoise&quot; (1581).

At some time around the 16th century, tales of Robin Hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of King Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry, during the misrule of Richard&#x27;s evil brother John, while Richard was away at the Third Crusade.

===Historical reputation and modern reception===

Richard&#x27;s reputation over the years has &quot;fluctuated wildly&quot;, according to historian John Gillingham. 
According to Gillingham, &quot;Richard&#x27;s reputation, above all as a crusader, meant that the tone of contemporaries and near contemporaries, whether writing in the West or the Middle East, was overwhelmingly favourable.&quot; Even historians attached to the court of his enemy Philip Augustus believed that if Richard had not fought against Philip then England would never have had a better king. A German contemporary, Walther von der Vogelweide, believed that Richard&#x27;s generosity was what made his subjects willing to raise a king&#x27;s ransom on his behalf. Richard&#x27;s character was also praised by figures in Saladin&#x27;s court such as Baha ad-Din and Ibn al-Athir, who judged him the most remarkable ruler of his time. Even in Scotland he won a high place in historical tradition.

After Richard&#x27;s death his image was further romanticized and for at least four centuries Richard was considered a model king by historians such as Holinshed and John Speed. However, in 1621 the Stuart courtier and poet and historian Samuel Daniel criticized Richard for wasting English resources on the crusade and wars in France. This &quot;remarkably original and consciously anachronistic interpretation&quot; eventually became the common opinion of scholars. Though Richard&#x27;s popular image tended to be dominated by the positive qualities of chivalry and military competence, his reputation among historians was typified by Steven Runciman&#x27;s verdict: &quot;he was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier&quot; (&quot;History of the Crusades&quot; Vol. III).

Victorian England was divided on Richard: many admired him as a crusader and man of God, erecting an heroic statue to him outside the Houses of Parliament. The late-Victorian scholar William Stubbs, however, thought him &quot;a bad son, a bad husband, a selfish ruler, and a vicious man&quot;. During his ten years&#x27; reign, Richard was in England for no more than six months, and totally absent for the last five years., which led to Stubbs argue that Richard had no sympathy, &quot;or even consideration, for his people. He was no Englishman,&quot; and &quot;his ambition was that of a mere warrior.&quot;

However, since 1978 this approach has been increasingly questioned for its insularity. According to Gillingham, &quot;it is now more widely acknowledged that Richard was head of a dynasty with far wider responsibilities than merely English ones, and that in judging a ruler&#x27;s political acumen more weight might be attached to contemporary opinion than to views which occurred to no one until many centuries after his death.&quot;

In World War I, when British troops commanded by General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem, the British press printed cartoons of Richard looking down from the heavens with the caption reading, &quot;At last my dream has come true&quot;. General Allenby protested against his campaign being presented as a latter-day Crusade, stating &quot;The importance of Jerusalem lay in its strategic importance, there was no religious impulse in this campaign&quot;.

<text>The RFPolicy states a method of contacting vendors about security vulnerabilities found in their products. It was originally written in 2000 by hacker and security consultant Rain Forest Puppy. It was perhaps the second disclosure policy, following Simple Nomad&#x27;s. 

The policy gives the vendor five working days to respond to the reporter of the bug. If the vendor fails to contact the reporter in those five days, the issue is recommended to be disclosed to the general community. The reporter should help the vendor reproduce the bug and work out a fix. The reporter should delay notifying the general community about the bug if the vendor provides feasible reasons for requiring so.

If the vendor fails to respond or shuts down communication with the reporter of the problem in more than five working days, the reporter should disclose the issue to the general community. When issuing an alert or fix, the vendor should give the reporter proper credits about reporting the bug.

Context for the history of vulnerability disclosure is available in a history article.

<text>James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 – September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is known best for his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; (finished using Jordan’s notes by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan&#x27;s death) which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. He is one of several writers to have written original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered by fans to be some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts. Jordan also published historical fiction using the pseudonym Reagan O&#x27;Neal, a western as Jackson O&#x27;Reilly, and dance criticism as Chang Lung. Jordan claimed to have ghostwritten an &quot;international thriller&quot; that is still believed to have been written by someone else.

==Early life==
Jordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He went to Clemson University after high school, but dropped out after one year and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with &quot;V&quot; and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm.

After returning from Vietnam in 1970, Jordan studied physics at The Citadel. He graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree and began working for the U.S. Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977.

==Personal life==
Robert Jordan was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe-collecting. He described himself as a &quot;High church&quot; Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. Politically, he described himself as a &quot;libertarian monarchist&quot;. He lived with his wife, Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan&#x27;s editor) in a house built in 1797. He listed John D. MacDonald, Jane Austen, Louis L&#x27;Amour, Charles Dickens, Robert A. Heinlein, Mark Twain and Montaigne as his favorite authors.

===Illness and death===
On March 23, 2006, Jordan revealed that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and that, with treatment, his median life expectancy was four years. In a separate weblog post, he encouraged his fans not to worry about him and stated that he intended to have a long and creative life.

He began chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic during early April 2006. He participated in a study of the drug Revlimid, which had been approved recently for multiple myeloma but not yet tested for primary amyloidosis.

Jordan died on September 16, 2007. His funeral service was on September 19, 2007. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.

Jordan&#x27;s papers can be found in the special collections of the College of Charleston.

==Selected works==
===The Wheel of Time===

Jordan published 11 books of 14 in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series. Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments written solely by Jordan owing to the expansion of the scale of the series as a whole. Because of his health problems, Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment &quot;A Memory of Light&quot; (later split into three volumes beginning with &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;), but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death, and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died. He maintained that in doing so the book would get published even if &quot;the worst actually happens&quot;. On December 7, 2007, Tor Books announced that Brandon Sanderson had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series. Harriet McDougal, Jordan&#x27;s widow, chose him after reading &quot;&quot;.
All paperback (PB) page totals given are for the most widely available mass-market paperback editions. The page count for the hardback (HB) editions does not include glossary or appendix page counts.

&quot;The World of Robert Jordan&#x27;s The Wheel of Time&quot; is an encyclopedia for the series about the unnamed world where the plot takes place, which is often referred to by fans of the series as the World of the Wheel. It is published in the United States by Tor Books and in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books. The bulk of the text was written by Teresa Patterson based on notes and information provided by Jordan, who also served as the overall editor on the project. While the information in the guide is broadly canonical, the book is deliberately written with vague, biased, or even downright false (or guessed) information in places, as Patterson felt this would reflect a key theme of the series (the mutability of knowledge across time and distance).

===Conan the Barbarian===

Jordan was one of several writers who has written Conan the Barbarian stories. When Tom Doherty obtained the rights, he needed a novel very quickly, so Jordan&#x27;s wife Harriet McDougal recommended him because she knew he had written his first novel, &quot;Warriors of the Altaii&quot;, in thirteen days.
So he thought I could write something fast, and he was right, and I liked it. It was fun writing something completely over the top, full of purple prose, and in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and the novelization of the second Conan movie. I&#x27;ve decided that those things were very good discipline for me. I had to work with a character and a world that had already been created and yet find a way to say something new about the character and the world. That was a very good exercise.

Jordan also compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.

<text>In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr (Old Norse, generally considered to mean &quot;drill-tooth&quot; or &quot;bore-tooth&quot;) is a squirrel who runs up and down the world tree Yggdrasil to carry messages between the eagles perched atop it and the serpent Níðhöggr who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree. Ratatoskr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ratatoskr&quot; contains two elements: &quot;rata-&quot; and &quot;-toskr&quot;. The element &quot;toskr&quot; is generally held to mean &quot;tusk&quot;. Guðbrandur Vigfússon theorized that the &quot;rati-&quot; element means &quot;the traveller&quot;. He says that the name of the legendary drill Rati may feature the same term. According to Vigfússon, &quot;Ratatoskr&quot; means &quot;tusk the traveller&quot; or &quot;the climber tusk.&quot;

Sophus Bugge theorized that the name &quot;Ratatoskr&quot; is a loanword from Old English meaning &quot;Rat-tooth.&quot; Bugge&#x27;s basis hinges on the fact that the &quot;-toskr&quot; element of the compound does not appear anywhere else in Old Norse. Bugge proposed that the &quot;-toskr&quot; element is a reformation of the Old English word &quot;tūsc&quot; (Old Frisian &quot;tusk&quot;) and, in turn, that the element &quot;Rata-&quot; represents Old English &quot;ræt&quot; (&quot;rat&quot;).

According to Albert Sturtevant, &quot;[as] far as the element &quot;Rata-&quot; is concerned, Bugge&#x27;s hypothesis has no valid foundation in view of the fact that the [Old Norse] word &quot;Rata&quot; (gen. form of &quot;Rati&quot;*) is used in &quot;Háv[amál]&quot; (106, 1) to signify the instrument which Odin employed for &quot;boring&quot; his way through the rocks in quest of the poet&#x27;s mead [...]&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Rati*&quot; must then be considered a native [Old Norse] word meaning &quot;The Borer, Gnawer&quot; [...]&quot;.

Sturtevant says that Bugge&#x27;s theory regarding the element &quot;-toskr&quot; may appear to be supported by the fact that the word does not appear elsewhere in Old Norse. However, Sturtevant says that the Old Norse proper name &quot;Tunne&quot; (derived from Proto-Norse &quot;*Tunþē&quot;) refers to &quot;a person who is characterized as having some peculiar sort of &quot;tooth&quot;&quot; and theorizes a Proto-Germanic form of &quot;-toskr&quot;. Sturtevant concludes that &quot;the fact that the [Old Norse] word occurs only in the name &quot;Rata-toskr&quot; is no valid evidence against this assumption, for there are many [Old Norse] &quot;hapax legomena&quot; of native origin, as is attested by the equivalents in the Mod[ern] Scandinavian dialects.&quot; Modern scholars have accepted this etymology, listing the name &quot;Ratatoskr&quot; as meaning &quot;drill-tooth&quot; (Jesse Byock, Andy Orchard, Rudolf Simek) or &quot;bore-tooth&quot; (John Lindow).

==Attestations==

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the god Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;) says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and Níðhöggr below it:

Ratatoskr is described in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; chapter 16, in which High states that

An eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg.

==Theories==
According to Rudolf Simek, &quot;the squirrel probably only represents an embellishing detail to the mythological picture of the world-ash in &quot;Grímnismál&quot;. Hilda Ellis Davidson, describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said to gnaw at it—furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence. John Lindow points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting on one side and as being chewed on by four harts and Níðhöggr, and that, according to the account in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that &quot;in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal&quot;.

Richard W. Thorington Jr. and Katie Ferrell theorize that &quot;the role of Ratatosk probably derived from the habit of European tree squirrels (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;) to give a scolding alarm call in response to danger. It takes little imagination for you to think that the squirrel is saying nasty things about you.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Ratatoskr is a character in Marvel comics, first introduced by Ryan North in The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl (2015) Issue #7 and #8, with subsequent appearances in the Squirrel Girl War of the Realms tie-in issues (The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #43 through #46) and the Squirrel Girl fiction podcast, Marvel&#x27;s Squirrel Girl: The Unbeatable Radio Show.

In the video game &quot;La-Mulana 2&quot;, Ratatoskr is a recurring boss enemy. While initially weak, he becomes stronger and gains more abilities in subsequent battles. Within the game&#x27;s mythos, Ratatoskr is an illusion created by Hræsvelgr, who is trapped in the Eternal Prison.

Ratatoskas (sic) are characters in Katherine Rundell&#x27;s novel Impossible Creatures.

Ratatoskr is an original character from the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes and is a lead character in the 8th book of the story.

Ratatoskr is featured as a prominent side character in the 2022 video game God of War Ragnarök as well as tangentially in the preceding title God of War.

Songs about Ratatoskr are featured on Ýdalir the sixth album of Icelandic viking metal band Skálmöld and on &quot;Fimbulvinter&quot;, the third album of Swedish viking metal band Brothers of Metal.

<text>The reel is a folk dance type as well as the accompanying dance tune type. Of Scottish origin, reels are also an important part of the repertoire of the fiddle traditions of Britain, Ireland and North America. In Scottish country dancing, the reel is one of the four traditional dances, the others being the jig, the strathspey and the waltz, and is also the name of a dance figure.
In Irish dance, a reel is any dance danced to music in &quot;reel time&quot; (see below). In Irish stepdance, the reel is danced in soft shoes and is one of the first dances taught to students. There is also a treble reel, danced in hard shoes to reel music.

==History==
The reel is indigenous to Scotland. The earliest reference was in a trial of 1590, where the accused was reported to have &quot;daunced this reill or short dance.&quot; However, the form may go back to the Middle Ages. The name may be cognate with or relate to an Old Norse form, with Suio-Gothic &quot;rulla&quot;, meaning &quot;to whirl.&quot; This became Anglo-Saxon &quot;hreol&quot; and Gaelic &quot;ruidhle&quot; or &quot;ruidhleadh&quot;, which is the origin of the word now. 

After being introduced to Ireland in the late eighteenth century it thrived. Later it was introduced to North America by English, Scottish, and Irish colonists and immigrants. In the United States, reels remain central in the traditions of Anglo and African-American Old-time music and square dancing, as well as Cajun and Zydeco. In Canada, they are important parts of Cape Breton, Acadian, Québécois, and Métis repertoires.

==Reel music==
Reel music is notated in simple metre, most commonly either in or . For example, the same reel &quot;Rakish Paddy&quot; is notated in a time signature in &quot;O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Music of Ireland, New &amp; Revisited,&quot; but in time in &quot;English, Welsh, Scottish &amp; Irish Fiddle Tunes,&quot; with no change to the note lengths.

All reels consist largely of quaver (eighth note) movement with an accent on the first and third beats of the bar. A reel is distinguished from a hornpipe in two ways. Firstly it is played with even beats, without swing or dotted rhythm. Secondly it is played twice as fast, implied by the time signature. Like most dance music originating in the British Isles, reels are usually composed in binary form, meaning they have two parts (A and B); in most reels each part is repeated (AABB), but in others it is not (ABAB). Each part (A and B) typically has eight bars, which in turn are divisible into four-bar and two-bar phrases. (An exception is the &quot;auld reel&quot; of Shetland which tends to irregular structure and may have been influenced by the Norwegian halling.) A reel usually has 32 bars (with structure AABB), but there are other common structures such as 40 bar reels (often played for the introduction of the Eightsome Reel) and 64 bar reels (with structure AABBCCDD).

Reels are popular in the folk music of South West England. They crossed the Atlantic ocean with Irish and British immigration and thus entered the musical tradition of Atlantic and French-speaking Canada including that of Quebecers and Acadians. Reels are featured in many pieces by Quebec singers and bands, such as La Bolduc, La Bottine Souriante and even the more modern &quot;néo-trad&quot; group Les Cowboys Fringants.

==&quot;Vorläufige Reichsmarine&quot;==
The () was formed after the end of World War I from the Imperial German Navy.

The provisions of the Treaty of Versailles restricted the German Navy to 15,000 men and no submarines, while the fleet was limited to six pre-dreadnought battleships, six light cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats. Replacements for the outdated battleships were restricted to a maximum size of 10,000 tons.

The fleet command of the () was headquartered at Kiel and consisted of a flag staff and fleet commander embarked on board the flagship of the German fleet. During the 1920s, the German flagship was the battleship with two naval officers serving as fleet commander, Hans Zenker and Konrad Mommsen, between 1923 and 1927. The fleet commander position was then left vacant, but the flag staff remained.

The purpose of the fleet command was to oversee the four major type commanders of German naval vessels. These commands were in turn responsible for the administration of various German ship classes to include equipment development, vessel deployments, and personnel assignment. Once at sea, operational control of the vessels switched to the commanders of the two main Naval Sea Stations. The four type commands were:

* – Commander of Ships of the Line, headquartered at Kiel, flagship in 1933 was the cruiser 
* – Commander of Reconnaissance Craft, flagship was the cruiser headquartered at Kiel
* – Leader of Torpedo-boats, headquartered at Swinemünde overseeing four flotillas of torpedo boats
* – Leader of Minesweepers, headquartered at Kiel commanding two minesweeper flotillas and one (&quot;R boat&quot;) mine auxiliary unit.

===Naval sea stations===
The did not maintain traditional at-sea fleets, but instead assigned two geographical areas (known as ) which oversaw all vessels operationally deployed in the North and Baltic Seas. Each naval station maintained a headquarters staff, general naval inspectorate, training department, artillery arsenal inspector, as well as a medical command unit. The naval stations also served as a senior officer for the commanders of the various German navy ports.

====Naval stations of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;====
* (North Sea naval station) – headquartered at Wilhelmshaven, overseeing the ports of Cuxhaven and Borkum
* (Baltic Sea naval station) – headquartered at Kiel, overseeing the ports of Swinemünde and Pillau

===Ships and equipment===
The Treaty of Versailles limited the size and armament of the and prevented it from introducing new technologies. The restrictions were intended to prevent the German Navy from becoming a threat to the Allied powers. On the other hand, the Allies had made certain that the would be in the foreseeable future the strongest power in the Baltic Sea, in order to serve as a counterweight against the new Soviet Union, which was viewed with distrust by the Allies.

Germany was only allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships (plus two in reserve), six cruisers (plus two in reserve), twelve destroyers (plus four in reserve), and twelve torpedo boats (plus four in reserve). The tried to meet the arms restrictions with secret armament and technical innovations such as the introduction of the pocket battleship.

<doc id="26378" wikidata="Q326638" url="?curid=26378" title="Rift Valley fever">
<text>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease of humans and livestock that can cause mild to severe symptoms. The mild symptoms may include: fever, muscle pains, and headaches which often last for up to a week. The severe symptoms may include: loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection, infections of the brain causing severe headaches and confusion, and bleeding together with liver problems which may occur within the first few days. Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.

The disease is caused by the RVF virus. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, drinking raw milk from an infected animal, or the bite of infected mosquitoes. Animals like cows, sheep, goats, and camels may be affected. In these animals it is spread mostly by mosquitoes. It does not appear that one person can infect another. The disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies against the virus or the virus itself in the blood.
Prevention of the disease in humans is accomplished by vaccinating animals against the disease. This must be done before an outbreak occurs because if it is done during an outbreak it may worsen the situation. Stopping the movement of animals during an outbreak may also be useful, as may decreasing mosquito numbers and avoiding their bites. There is a human vaccine; however, as of 2010, it is not widely available. There is no specific treatment and medical efforts are supportive.

Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia. Outbreaks usually occur during periods of increased rain which increases the number of mosquitoes. The disease was first reported among livestock in Rift Valley of Kenya in the early 1900s, and the virus was first isolated in 1931.

==Signs and symptoms==
In humans, the virus can cause several syndromes. Usually, they have either no symptoms or only a mild illness with fever, headache, muscle pains, and liver abnormalities. In a small percentage of cases (&lt; 2%), the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever syndrome, meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain and tissues lining the brain), or affect the eye. Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised weakness, back pain, dizziness, and weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, people recover within two to seven days after onset. About 1% of people with the disease die of it. In livestock, the fatality level is significantly higher. Pregnant livestock infected with RVF abort virtually 100% of foetuses. An epizootic (animal disease epidemic) of RVF is usually first indicated by a wave of unexplained abortions.

Other signs in livestock include vomiting and diarrhea, respiratory disease, fever, lethargy, anorexia, and sudden death in young animals.

==Cause==

===Virology===
The virus belongs to the &quot;Bunyavirales&quot; order. This is an order of enveloped negative single-stranded RNA viruses. All Bunyaviruses have an outer lipid envelope with two glycoproteins—G(N) and G(C)—required for cell entry. They deliver their genome into the host-cell cytoplasm by fusing their envelope with an endosomal membrane.

The virus&#x27; G(C) protein has a class II membrane fusion protein architecture similar to that found in flaviviruses and alphaviruses. This structural similarity suggests that there may be a common origin for these viral families.

The virus&#x27; 11.5 kb tripartite genome is composed of single-stranded RNA. As a &quot;Phlebovirus,&quot; it has an ambisense genome. Its L and M segments are negative-sense, but its S segment is ambisense. These three genome segments code for six major proteins: L protein (viral polymerase), the two glycoproteins G(N) and G(C), the nucleocapsid N protein, and the nonstructural NSs and NSm proteins.

===Transmission===

The virus is transmitted through mosquito vectors, as well as through contact with the tissue of infected animals. Two species—&quot;Culex tritaeniorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Aedes vexans&quot;—are known to transmit the virus. Other potential vectors include &quot;Aedes caspius&quot;, &quot;Aedes mcintosh&quot;, &quot;Aedes ochraceus,&quot; &quot;Culex pipiens&quot;, &quot;Culex antennatus&quot;, &quot;Culex perexiguus&quot;, &quot;Culex zombaensis&quot; and &quot;Culex quinquefasciatus&quot;. Contact with infected tissue is considered to be the main source of human infections. The virus has been isolated from two bat species: the Peter&#x27;s epauletted fruit bat (&quot;Micropteropus pusillus&quot;) and the aba roundleaf bat (&quot;Hipposideros abae&quot;), which are believed to be reservoirs for the virus.

== Pathogenesis ==
Although many components of the RVFV&#x27;s RNA play an important role in the virus&#x27; pathology, the nonstructural protein encoded on the S segment (NSs) is the only component that has been found to directly affect the host. NSs is hostile and combative against the host interferon (IFNs) antiviral response. IFNs are essential for the immune system to fight off viral infections in a host. This inhibitory mechanism is believed to be due to several reasons, the first being, competitive inhibition of the formation of the transcription factor. On this transcription factor, NSs interacts with and binds to a subunit that is needed for RNA polymerase I and II. This interaction cause competitive inhibition with another transcription factor component and prevents the assembly process of the transcription factor complex, which results in the suppression of the host antiviral response. Transcription suppression is believed to be another mechanism of this inhibitory process. This occurs when an area of NSs interacts with and binds to the host&#x27;s protein, SAP30 and forms a complex. This complex causes histone acetylation to regress, which is needed for transcriptional activation of the IFN promoter. This causes IFN expression to be obstructed. Lastly, NSs has also been known to affect regular activity of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R. This protein is involved in cellular antiviral responses in the host. When RVFV can enter the host&#x27;s DNA, NSs forms a filamentous structure in the nucleus. This allows the virus to interact with specific areas of the host&#x27;s DNA that relates to segregation defects and induction of chromosome continuity. This increases host infectivity and decreases the host&#x27;s antiviral response.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis relies on viral isolation from tissues, or serological testing with an ELISA. Other methods of diagnosis include Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), cell culture, and IgM antibody assays. As of September 2016, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has developed a product called Immunoline, designed to diagnose the disease in humans much faster than in previous methods.

==Prevention==

A person&#x27;s chances of becoming infected can be reduced by taking measures to decrease contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals and protect against mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects. The use of mosquito repellents and bed nets are two effective methods. For persons working with animals in RVF-endemic areas, wearing protective equipment to avoid any exposure to blood or tissues of animals that may potentially be infected is an important protective measure. Potentially, establishing environmental monitoring and case surveillance systems may aid in the prediction and control of future RVF outbreaks.

No vaccines are currently available for humans. While vaccines have been developed for humans, it has only been used experimentally for scientific personnel in high-risk environments. Trials of several vaccines, such as NDBR-103 and TSI-GSD 200, are ongoing. Different types of vaccines for veterinary use are available. The killed vaccines are impractical in routine animal field vaccination because of the need for multiple injections. Live vaccines require a single injection but are known to cause birth defects and abortions in sheep and induce only low-level protection in cattle. The live-attenuated vaccine, MP-12, has demonstrated promising results in laboratory trials in domesticated animals, but more research is needed before the vaccine can be used in the field. The live-attenuated clone 13 vaccine was recently registered and used in South Africa. Alternative vaccines using molecular recombinant constructs are in development and show promising results.

A vaccine has been conditionally approved for use in animals in the US. It has been shown that knockout of the NSs and NSm nonstructural proteins of this virus produces an effective vaccine in sheep as well.

==Epidemiology==

RVF outbreaks occur across sub-Saharan Africa, with outbreaks occurring elsewhere infrequently. Outbreaks of this disease usually correspond with the warm phases of the EI Niño/Southern Oscillation. During this time there is an increase in rainfall, flooding, and greenness of vegetation index, which leads to an increase in mosquito vectors. RVFV can be transmitted vertically in mosquitos, meaning that the virus can be passed from the mother to her offspring. During dry conditions, the virus can remain viable for many years in the egg. Mosquitos lay their eggs in water, where they eventually hatch. As water is essential for mosquito eggs to hatch, rainfall and flooding cause an increase in the mosquito population and an increased potential for the virus.

The first documented outbreak was identified in Kenya in 1931, in sheep, cattle, and humans; another severe outbreak in the country in 1950–1951 involved 100,000 deaths in livestock and an unrecorded number of humans with fever. An outbreak occurred in South Africa in 1974–1976, with more than 500,000 infected animals and the first deaths in humans. In Egypt in 1977–78, an estimated 200,000 people were infected and there were at least 594 deaths. In Kenya in 1998, the virus killed more than 400 people. Since then, there have been outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen (2000), East Africa (2006–2007), Sudan (2007), South Africa (2010), Uganda (2016), Kenya (2018), and Mayotte (2018–2019). 2020–2021 in Kenya, in 2022 an outbreak is ongoing in Burundi.

==Biological weapon==
Rift Valley fever was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program in 1969.

==Research==
The disease is one of several identified by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic in a new plan developed after the Ebola epidemic for urgent research and development toward new diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines.

<text>&quot;Rogue state&quot; (or sometimes &quot;outlaw state&quot;) is a term applied by some international theorists to states that they consider threatening to the world&#x27;s peace. These states meet certain criteria, such as being ruled by authoritarian or totalitarian governments that severely restrict human rights, sponsoring terrorism, or seeking to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. The term is used most by the United States (although the US State Department officially stopped using the term in 2000); in his speech at the United Nations (UN) in 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated this phrase. U.S. politicians have used the term to describe countries such as Iran, Syria, North Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba and Venezuela. However, the term has been applied to other countries, as well as to the United States itself.

== Usage by the United States ==
As early as July 1985, President Ronald Reagan stated that &quot;we are not going to tolerate … attacks from outlaw states by the strangest collection of misfits, looney tunes, and squalid criminals since the advent of the Third Reich,&quot; but it fell to the Clinton administration to elaborate on this concept. In the 1994 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, U.S. National Security Advisor Anthony Lake labelled five nations as &quot;rogue states&quot;: North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Libya under Muammar Gaddafi, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein. He described these regimes as &quot;recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family but also assault its basic values&quot;. Cuba was put on the list solely because of the political influence of the Cuban-American community and specifically that of the Cuban American National Foundation (pre-Jorge Mas Santos), whereas Syria and Pakistan avoided being added to the list because the United States hoped that Syria could play a constructive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process, and because Washington had long maintained close relations with Pakistan.

Three other nations, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Sudan, and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, were treated as &quot;rogue states&quot; as well. The US State Department at times labelled Yugoslavia as a &quot;rogue state&quot; because its leader, Slobodan Milošević, had been accused of violating the rights of his nation&#x27;s citizens, including but not limited to attempted genocide in Croatia and orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre in eastern Bosnia.

The United States employed several tools to isolate and punish &quot;rogue states&quot;. Tough unilateral economic sanctions, often at congressional behest, were imposed on or tightened against Iran, Libya, Cuba, Sudan, and Afghanistan. After the conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991, the United States selectively used airpower against Iraq for years during the Iraqi no-fly zones to force them in complying with various United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding disarmament (i.e., Resolution 687) and human rights (i.e., Resolution 688). Cruise missiles were fired at Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for terrorist attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998. In March 1999, NATO launched a massive air-bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in response to the Yugoslav Army&#x27;s crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo.

In the last six months of the Clinton administration, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that the term &quot;rogue state&quot; would be abolished in June 2000, in favour of the term &quot;states of concern&quot;, as three of the nations listed as &quot;rogue states&quot; (Libya, Iran, and North Korea) no longer met the conditions established to define a &quot;rogue state&quot;.

Libya was removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list in 2006 after achieving success through diplomacy. Relations with Libya also became more mutual following the eight month Libyan Civil War in 2011, which resulted in the National Transitional Council ousting longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from power.

In 2015, after the US reopened its embassy in Cuba and restarted diplomatic relations with the Cuban government, Cuba was removed from the list of State sponsors of terrorism and was no longer referred to as a &quot;rogue state&quot;.

More recently, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump labelled Venezuela a &quot;rogue state&quot;. During the 2017 UN general assembly, UN ambassador Nikki Haley called Venezuela a global threat and a &quot;dangerous narco-state&quot;. Some figures of the Venezuelan government, like Vice President Tareck el Aissami and Minister of Defense Vladimir Padrino López, were permanently banned from entering US territory, due to their involvement with human rights abuses and drug cartels. Later in 2017, the US government banned all high ranking Venezuelan government officials from entering US territory. Currently, due to the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Nicolas Maduro&#x27;s government (which controls Venezuela &quot;de facto&quot;) is not recognized as legitimate by the United States or most other states in the Western Hemisphere, with the exceptions of Cuba, Dominica, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname.

On 19 June 2020, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the People&#x27;s Republic of China a &quot;rogue actor&quot; at the Virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit, saying that &quot;General Secretary Xi Jinping has green-lighted a brutal campaign of repression against Chinese Muslims, a human rights violation on a scale we haven’t seen since World War II.&quot; In addition, Pompeo cited China&#x27;s handling of COVID-19, &quot;malicious cyber campaigns&quot; it conducted, and its treatment of Hong Kong citizens as reasons for labeling China as a rogue actor.

=== Later terms ===
In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration returned to using a similar term. The concept of &quot;rogue states&quot; was replaced by the Bush administration with the concept of an &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, which encompassed Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. U.S. President George W. Bush first spoke of this &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; during his January 2002 State of the Union Address. More terms, such as &quot;Outposts of Tyranny&quot;, would follow suit.

Because the U.S. government remains the most active proponent of the expression &quot;rogue state&quot;, the term has received much criticism from those who disagree with American foreign policy. Both the concepts of &quot;rogue states&quot; and the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; have been criticized by scholars, including philosopher Jacques Derrida and linguist Noam Chomsky, who considered it more or less a justification of imperialism and a useful word for propaganda. Some critics charge that &quot;rogue state&quot; merely means any state that is generally hostile to the U.S., or even one that opposes the U.S. without necessarily posing a wider threat. Others, such as author William Blum, argued that the term is also applicable to the U.S. and Israel. In his &quot;Rogue State: A Guide to the World&#x27;s Only Superpower&quot;, Blum claimed that the United States defines itself as a rogue state through its foreign policy.

== United States as a rogue state ==
Some critics of US foreign policy describe the United States as a rogue state. William Blum&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;Rogue State: A Guide to the World&#x27;s Only Superpower&quot; suggests that US-led interventions around the world during and after the Cold War have threatened the world&#x27;s peace. Noam Chomsky has also described the US as a rogue state after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. Its nuclear proliferation and large numbers of nuclear warheads (the second most in the world), sponsorship of terrorist or guerilla groups to overthrow opposing governments especially in Latin America, and violations of human rights in wartime are all suggested to be characteristics of a rogue state. The US has also passed a law threatening to invade The Hague if American officials or military personnel were to ever be prosecuted for war crimes called the American Service-Members&#x27; Protection Act. 

== Usage by Turkey ==
On 23 February 1999, Turkish President Süleyman Demirel described Greece as a &quot;rogue state&quot; because of its alleged support of the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK). Demirel said &quot;Greece serves as a sanctuary for members of the PKK seeking shelter and provides training facilities and logistics to the terrorists.&quot;

On 28 June 2012, after the shooting down of a Turkish warplane by the Syrian Army during the Syrian civil war, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared Syria to be a &quot;rogue state&quot;. In October 2020, Erdoğan described Armenia as a rogue state, referring to the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. He used the words &quot;countries supporting rogue state Armenia in its occupation of Karabakh would have to face the common conscience of humanity&quot;. Commentator Robert Ellis, writing in the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2016, claimed that Turkey under Erdoğan risks &quot;being regarded as a rogue state&quot; due to its increasingly authoritarian government, the deterioration of the human rights in the country, the Turkish government&#x27;s involvement in Syria and its alleged support of terrorist groups.

Similarly, Erdoğan said after a cabinet meeting on 5 October 2020: &quot;It is not possible for humanity to attain permanent peace and tranquility without saving the world from rogue states and their rogue rulers. Especially in our region, the number of rogue states is quite high. These rogue states, dating back to Israel, Greek Administration of Cyprus and the Syrian regime, persecute their own citizens and destabilize the world.&quot;

<text>Rebol ( ; historically REBOL) is a cross-platform data exchange language and a multi-paradigm dynamic programming language designed by Carl Sassenrath for network communications and distributed computing. It introduces the concept of dialecting: small, optimized, domain-specific languages for code and data, which is also the most notable property of the language according to its designer Carl Sassenrath:

Douglas Crockford, known for his involvement in the development of JavaScript, has described Rebol as &quot;a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it&#x27;s all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs&quot; and as one of JSON&#x27;s influences.

Originally, the language and its official implementation were proprietary and closed source, developed by REBOL Technologies. Following discussion with Lawrence Rosen, the Rebol version 3 interpreter was released under the Apache 2.0 license on December 12, 2012. Older versions are only available in binary form, and no source release for them is planned.

Rebol has been used to program Internet applications (both client- and server-side), database applications, utilities, and multimedia applications.

==Etymology==
Rebol was initially an acronym for Relative Expression Based Object Language written in all caps. To align with modern trends in language naming represented, e.g. by the change replacing historical name &quot;LISP&quot; by &quot;Lisp&quot;, programmers ceased the practice of writing &quot;REBOL&quot; in all caps. Sassenrath eventually put the naming question to the community debate on his blog. In subsequent writing, Sassenrath adopted the convention of writing the language name as &quot;Rebol&quot;.

==History==
First released in 1997, Rebol was designed over a 20-year period by Carl Sassenrath, the architect and primary developer of AmigaOS, based on his study of denotational semantics and using concepts from the programming languages Lisp, Forth, Logo, and Self.

# REBOL Technologies was founded in 1998.
# &quot;REBOL 2&quot;, the interpreter, which became the core of extended interpreter editions, was first released in 1999.
## &quot;REBOL/Command&quot;, which added strong encryption and ODBC access, was released in September 2000.
## &quot;REBOL/View&quot; was released in April 2001, adding graphical abilities on the core language.
## &quot;REBOL/IOS&quot;, an extensible collaboration environment built with REBOL was released in August 2001.
## &quot;REBOL/SDK&quot;, providing a choice of kernels to bind against, as well as a preprocessor, was released in December 2002.
# &quot;Rebol 3&quot; [R3], the newest version of the interpreter, had alpha versions released by REBOL Technologies since January 2008. Since its release as an Apache 2 project in December 2012, it is being developed by the Rebol community.

==Design==

===Ease of use===
One of the Rebol design principles is &quot;to do simple things in simple ways&quot;. In the following example the &quot;Visual interface dialect&quot; is used to describe a simple Hello world program with a graphical user interface:

view layout [text &quot;Hello world!&quot; button &quot;Quit&quot; [quit]]

This is how a similar example looks in R3-GUI:

view [text &quot;Hello world!&quot; button &quot;Quit&quot; on-action [quit]]

===Dialects===
Rebol domain-specific languages, called &quot;dialects&quot;, are micro-languages optimized for a specific purpose. Dialects can be used to define business rules, graphical user interfaces or sequences of screens during the installation of a program. Users can define their own dialects, reusing any existing Rebol word and giving it a specific meaning in that dialect. Dialects are interpreted by functions processing Rebol blocks (or parsing strings) in a specific way.

An example of Rebol&#x27;s dialecting abilities can be seen with the word codice_1. In the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot; codice_1 is just a word not having any specific meaning. In the &quot;do dialect&quot;, codice_1 is a global variable referring to a native function passing back a function result value. In the &quot;visual interface dialect (VID)&quot;, codice_1 is a keyword causing the layout engine to simulate a carriage return, moving the &quot;rendering pen&quot; down to the beginning of the next line.

A Rebol interpreter with graphical abilities must understand and interpret many dialects. The table below lists the most important ones in order of significance.
===Syntax===
Rebol syntax is free-form, not requiring specific positioning. However, indentation is often used to better convey the structure of the text to human readers.

Syntactic properties of different dialects may differ. The common platform for all Rebol dialects is the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot;; other dialects are usually derived from it. In addition to being the common platform for all dialects, the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot; is directly used to represent data and metadata, populate data structures, send data over Internet, and save them in data storage.

In contrast to programming languages like C, the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot; does not consist of declarations, statements, expressions or keywords. A valid &quot;data exchange dialect&quot; text stream is a tree data structure consisting of blocks (the root block is implicit, subblocks are delimited by square brackets), parens (delimited by round brackets), strings (delimited by double quotes or curly brackets suitable for multi-line strings; caret notation is used for unprintable characters), URLs, e-mail addresses, files, paths or other composite values. Unlike ALGOL blocks, Rebol blocks are composite values similar to quoted s-expressions in Lisp. The fact that code is written in the form of Rebol blocks makes the language homoiconic.

Blocks as well as parens may contain other composite values (a block may contain subblocks, parens, strings, ...) or scalar values like words, set-words (words suffixed by the colon), get-words (words prefixed by the colon), lit-words (words prefixed by the apostrophe), numbers, money, characters, etc., separated by whitespace. Special characters are allowed in words, so codice_5 is a word unlike codice_6, which is a sequence of three words separated by spaces.

Comments may appear following the semicolon until the end of the line. Multi-line comments or comments not ignored by the lexical parser can be written using &quot;ordinary&quot; datatypes like multi-line strings.

===Semantics===
Blocks containing domain-specific language can be submitted as arguments to specific &quot;evaluator&quot; functions.

====do====
The most frequently used evaluator is the codice_7 function. It is used by default to interpret the text input to the interpreter console.

The &quot;do dialect&quot; interpreted by the codice_7 function, is an expression-oriented sublanguage of the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot;. The main semantic unit of the language is the expression. In contrast to imperative programming languages descending from ALGOL, the &quot;do dialect&quot; has neither keywords, nor statements.

Words are used as case-insensitive variables. Like in all dynamically typed languages, variables don&#x27;t have an associated type, type is associated with values. The result, i.e. the evaluation of a word is returned, when a word is encountered by the codice_7 function. The set-word form of a word can be used for assignment. While not having statements, assignment, together with functions with side-effects can be used for imperative programming.

Subblocks of the root block evaluate to themselves. This property is used to handle data blocks, for structured programming by submitting blocks as arguments to control functions like codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, etc., and for dialecting, when a block is passed to a specific interpreter function.

A specific problem worth noting is that composite values, assigned to variables, are not copied. To make a copy, the value must be passed to the codice_13 function.

The codice_7 function normally follows a prefix style of evaluation, where a function processes the arguments that follow it. However, infix evaluation using infix operators exists too. Infix evaluation takes precedence over the prefix evaluation. For example,
 abs -2 + 3
returns 1, since the infix addition takes precedence over the computation of the absolute value. When evaluating infix expressions, the order of evaluation is left to right, no operator takes precedence over another. For example,

2 + 3 * 4

returns 20, while an evaluation giving precedence to multiplication would yield 14. All operators have prefix versions. codice_15 usually evaluates arguments before passing them to a function. So, the below expression:

 print read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol

first reads the Wikipedia Rebol page and then passes the result to the codice_16 function. Parentheses can be used to change the order of evaluation. Using prefix notation, the usage of parentheses in expressions can be avoided.

The simple precedence rules are both an advantage:
* No need to &quot;consult&quot; precedence tables when writing expressions
* No need to rewrite precedence tables when a new operator is defined
* Expressions can be easily transliterated from infix to prefix notation and vice versa
as well as a disadvantage:
* Users accustomed to more conventional precedence rules may easily make a mistake

====parse====
The codice_17 function is preferably used to specify, validate, transform and interpret dialects. It does so by matching &quot;parse expressions&quot; at run time.

&quot;Parse expressions&quot; are written in the &quot;parse dialect&quot;, which, like the &quot;do dialect&quot;, is an expression-oriented sublanguage of the &quot;data exchange dialect&quot;. Unlike the &quot;do dialect&quot;, the &quot;parse dialect&quot; uses keywords representing operators and the most important nonterminals, infix parsing operators don&#x27;t have prefix equivalents and use precedence rules (&quot;sequence&quot; has higher precedence than &quot;choice&quot;).

Actions can be included to be taken during the parsing process as well and the codice_17 function can be used to process blocks or strings. At the &quot;string parsing&quot; level codice_17 must handle the &quot;low level&quot; parsing, taking into account characters and delimiters. &quot;Block parsing&quot; is higher level, handling the scanning at the level of Rebol values.

The parse dialect belongs to the family of grammars represented by the top-down parsing language or the parsing expression grammar (PEG). The main similarity is the presence of the &quot;sequence&quot; and &quot;choice&quot; operators all the family members have. Parse dialect syntax and the similarities between the parse dialect and the PEG are illustrated by this transliteration of a PEG example that parses an arithmetic expression:

Digit: charset [#&quot;0&quot; - #&quot;9&quot;]
Value: [some Digit | &quot;(&quot; Expr &quot;)&quot;]
Product: [Value any &quot;/&quot;] Value
Sum: [Product any &quot;-&quot;] Product
Expr: Sum
parse/all &quot;12+13&quot; Expr

==Implementations==
The official Rebol 2.7.8 implementation is available in several editions (&quot;/Core&quot;, &quot;/View&quot;, &quot;/Command&quot;, &quot;/SDK&quot; and &quot;/IOS&quot;). Both &quot;/Core&quot; and &quot;/View&quot; editions are freely redistributable software.

The runtime environment is stored in a single executable file. &quot;Rebol/Core&quot; 2.7.8, the console edition, is about 300 KB and &quot;Rebol/View&quot; 2.7.8, the graphical user interface edition, is about 650 KB in size.

&quot;Rebol/View&quot; provides platform-independent graphics and sound access, and comes with its own windowing toolkit and extensible set of styles (GUI widgets). Extended editions, such as &quot;Rebol/Command&quot; 2.7.8 or &quot;Rebol/SDK&quot; 2.7.8 require a paid license; they add features like ODBC data access, and the option to create standalone executable files.

==Legacy==
* Rebol was named by Douglas Crockford as one of the inspirations of JavaScript Object Notation.
* Rebol inspired the open-source Orca project, which is an interpreted Rebol-like language.
* Boron is an interpreted, homoiconic language inspired by and similar to Rebol, which is meant for embedding domain specific languages. It is implemented as a C library licensed under the terms of the LGPLv3.
* The Red programming language was directly inspired by Rebol, yet the implementation choices of Red were geared specifically to overcoming its perceived limitations.

<text>Red Hat, Inc. (formerly Red Hat Software, Inc.) is an American software company that provides open source software products to enterprises and is a subsidiary of IBM. Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, with other offices worldwide.

Red Hat has become associated to a large extent with its enterprise operating system Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With the acquisition of open-source enterprise middleware vendor JBoss, Red Hat also offers Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), an enterprise virtualization product. Red Hat provides storage, operating system platforms, middleware, applications, management products, support, training, and consulting services.

Red Hat creates, maintains, and contributes to many free software projects. It has acquired the codebases of several proprietary software products through corporate mergers and acquisitions, and has released such software under open source licenses. , Red Hat is the second largest corporate contributor to the Linux kernel version 4.14 after Intel.

On October 28, 2018, IBM announced its intent to acquire Red Hat for $34 billion. The acquisition closed on July 9, 2019. It now operates as an independent subsidiary.

==History==
In 1993, Bob Young incorporated the ACC Corporation, a catalog business that sold Linux and Unix software accessories. In 1994, Marc Ewing created his own Linux distribution, which he named Red Hat Linux (associated with the time Ewing wore a red Cornell University lacrosse hat, given to him by his grandfather, while attending Carnegie Mellon University). Ewing released the software in October, and it became known as the Halloween release. Young bought Ewing&#x27;s business in 1995, and the two merged to become Red Hat Software, with Young serving as chief executive officer (CEO).

Red Hat went public on August 11, 1999, achieving—at the time—the eighth-biggest first-day gain in the history of Wall Street. Matthew Szulik succeeded Bob Young as CEO in December of that year. Bob Young went on to found the online print on demand and self-publishing company, Lulu in 2002.

<doc id="26388" wikidata="Q49225" url="?curid=26388" title="Reno, Nevada">
<text>Reno ( ) is a city in the northwest section of the U.S. state of Nevada, along the Nevada–California border. It is the county seat and most populous city of Washoe County. Sitting in the High Eastern Sierra foothills, in the Truckee River valley, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, it is about northeast of Lake Tahoe. Known as &quot;The Biggest Little City in the World&quot;, Reno is the 80th most populous city in the United States, the third most populous city in Nevada, and the most populous in Nevada outside the Las Vegas Valley. The city had a population of 264,165 at the 2020 census.

The city is named after Civil War Union major general Jesse L. Reno, who was killed in action during the American Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain, on Fox&#x27;s Gap.

Reno is part of the Reno–Sparks metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Nevada after the Las Vegas Valley. Known as Greater Reno, it includes Washoe, Storey, and Lyon Counties; the independent city and state capital Carson City; and parts of Placer and Nevada Counties in California. The Reno metro area (along with the neighboring city Sparks) occupies a valley colloquially known as the Truckee Meadows.

For much of the twentieth century Reno saw a significant number of migrants seeking to take advantage of Nevada&#x27;s relatively lax divorce laws and the city gained a national reputation as a divorce mill. Today Reno is a tourist destination known for its casino gambling and proximity to Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada.

==History==

===Early history===
Archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric Martis people in the Reno area. As early as the mid-1850s, a few pioneers settled in the Truckee Meadows, a relatively fertile valley through which the Truckee River made its way from Lake Tahoe to Pyramid Lake. In addition to subsistence farming, these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the California Trail, which followed the Truckee westward, before branching off towards Donner Lake, where the formidable obstacle of the Sierra Nevada began.

Gold was discovered in the vicinity of Virginia City in 1850, and a modest mining community developed, but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the Comstock Lode led to a mining rush, and thousands of emigrants left their homes, bound for the West, hoping to find a fortune.

To provide the necessary connection between Virginia City and the California Trail, Charles W. Fuller built a log toll bridge across the Truckee River in 1859. A small community that served travelers soon grew near the bridge. After two years, Fuller sold the bridge to Myron C. Lake, who continued to develop the community by adding a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it &quot;Lake&#x27;s Crossing&quot;. Most of what is present-day western Nevada was formed as the Nevada Territory from part of Utah Territory in 1861.

By January 1863, the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from Sacramento, California, eventually connecting with the Union Pacific Railroad at Promontory, Utah, to form the First transcontinental railroad. Lake deeded land to the CPRR in exchange for its promise to build a depot at Lake&#x27;s Crossing. In 1864, Washoe County was consolidated with Roop County, and Lake&#x27;s Crossing became the county&#x27;s largest town. Lake had earned himself the title &quot;founder of Reno&quot;. Once the railroad station was established, the town of Reno officially came into being on May 9, 1868. CPRR construction superintendent Charles Crocker named the community after Major General Jesse Lee Reno, a Union officer killed in the Civil War at the Battle of South Mountain.

In 1871, Reno became the county seat of the newly expanded Washoe County, replacing the county seat in Washoe City. However, political power in Nevada remained with the mining communities, first Virginia City and later Tonopah and Goldfield.

The extension of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to Reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new city&#x27;s economy. In the following decades, Reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between Sacramento and Salt Lake City.
As the mining boom waned early in the 20th century, Nevada&#x27;s centers of political and business activity shifted to the nonmining communities, especially Reno and Las Vegas. Nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world, after South Africa and Australia; the state yielded 6.9% of the world&#x27;s supply in 2005 world gold production.

The Reno Arch was erected on Virginia Street in 1926 to promote the upcoming Transcontinental Highways Exposition of 1927. The arch included the words &quot;Nevada&#x27;s Transcontinental Highways Exposition&quot; and the dates of the exposition. After the exposition, the Reno City Council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway, and Mayor E.E. Roberts asked the citizens of Reno to suggest a slogan for the arch. No acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered, and G.A. Burns of Sacramento was declared the winner on March 14, 1929, with &quot;Reno, the Biggest Little City in the World&quot;.

===The divorce capital of the world===
In the early twentieth century Nevada became a popular destination for migratory divorce in an era when most states had highly restrictive laws on the subject. Legislation passed in 1931 completed the gradual reduction of residency requirement from six months to six weeks, and Reno openly advertised itself as the &quot;Divorce Capital of the World&quot;. Nevada&#x27;s laws, which were fairly progressive for the time, allowed numerous grounds for divorce and Reno&#x27;s courts quickly gained a reputation for handling cases with both celerity and sympathy for those seeking to &quot;untie the knot&quot;. From the 1930s through the 1960s Reno became synonymous with speedy divorce, often referred to colloquially as &quot;the six week cure&quot;. During these decades the city&#x27;s reputation drew thousands of divorcees annually, and they in turn became an important part of the local economy. These temporary residents flocked to hotels, boardinghouses, and hospitality ranches, many of which catered primarily to those waiting out the six week residency requirement before their court date.

Numerous local businesses openly courted these visitors, such as R. Herz &amp; Bro, a jewelry store that offered ring resetting services to the recently divorced and the luxurious El Cortez Hotel, which was built in part to accommodate the more affluent among Reno&#x27;s six week guests. The majority of those who came to Reno for divorce were women as Nevada did not require both parties in a divorce case to be present in court, and men often could not take that much time off from work. Although new &quot;residents&quot; seeking divorce were required to swear under oath that they intended to make Nevada their permanent home, most left soon after obtaining their divorce decree, which often occurred on the same day as the initial court hearing.

In addition to tens of thousands of ordinary people, Reno also became a major destination for celebrities, and the very wealthy looking to end their marriages as quickly as possible. Some of the many famous personages who got divorced in Reno include Mary Pickford, Jack Dempsey, General Douglas MacArthur, Carol Lombard, Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson II, Lana Turner, Nelson Rockefeller, Georges Simenon, Rita Hayworth, Gloria Vanderbilt and Cornelius Vanderbilt IV. The latter was married seven times and had five of his six divorces in Nevada. Mr. Vanderbilt was so taken with Reno that, unlike most migrant divorcees, he eventually settled there permanently.

In the 1939 film &quot;The Women&quot;, Reno and its divorce culture serve as a backdrop to a significant part of the plot. Ernie Pyle once wrote in one of his columns, &quot;All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were obviously there to get divorces.&quot; In Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, &quot;I am going to Reno,&quot; which was understood as declaring their intention to get a divorce.

The divorce business eventually died out during the 1970s, as other states began relaxing their laws, and especially with the widespread introduction of no fault divorce.

===Gambling and modern Reno===
Reno took a leap forward when the state of Nevada legalized open gambling on March 19, 1931, at the same time as it liberalized its divorce laws. The statewide push for legal Nevada gaming was led by Reno entrepreneur Bill Graham, who owned the Bank Club Casino in Reno, which was on Center Street. No other state offered legalized casino gaming like Nevada had in the 1930s, and casinos such as the Bank Club and Palace were popular. A few states had legal parimutuel horse racing, but no other state had legal casino gambling.

Within a few years, the Bank Club, owned by George Wingfield, Bill Graham, and Jim McKay, was the state&#x27;s largest employer and the largest casino in the world. Wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits, along with his rent.

As the divorce industry declined, gambling became the major Reno industry. While gaming pioneers such as &quot;Pappy&quot; and Harold Smith of Harold&#x27;s Club and Bill Harrah of the soon-to-dominate Harrah&#x27;s Casino set up shop in the 1930s, the war years of the 1940s cemented Reno as the place to play for two decades. Beginning in the 1950s, the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation.

At 1:03 pm, on February 5, 1957, two explosions, caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city, and an ensuing fire, destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of Sierra and First Streets along the Truckee River. The disaster killed two people and injured 49. The first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of Sierra Street (now the site of the Century Riverside), the second, across Sierra Street, now the site of the Palladio.

The presence of a main east–west rail line, the emerging interstate highway system, favorable state tax climate, and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods.

In the 1980s, Indian gaming rules were relaxed, and starting in 2000, Californian Native casinos began to cut into Reno casino revenues. Major new construction projects have been completed in the Reno and Sparks areas. A few new luxury communities were built in Truckee, California, about west of Reno on Interstate 80. Reno also is an outdoor recreation destination, due to its proximity to the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe, and numerous ski resorts in the region.

In 2018, the city officially changed its flag after a local contest was held. In recent years, the Reno metro area − spurred by large-scale investments from Greater Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area companies such as Amazon, Tesla, Panasonic, Microsoft, Apple, and Google − has become a new major technology center in the United States.

==Geography==

===Geology===

Reno is just east of the Sierra Nevada, on the western edge of the Great Basin at an elevation of about above sea level. Numerous faults exist throughout the region. Most of these are normal (vertical motion) faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada.

In February 2008, an earthquake swarm began to occur, lasting for several months, with the largest quake registering at 4.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, although some geologic estimates put it at 5.0. The earthquakes were centered on the Somersett community in western Reno near Mogul and Verdi. Many homes in these areas were damaged.

The unique high desert geological features cause many to &quot;describe Nevada as a rockhound&#x27;s paradise ... access to millions of acres of government land&quot; allows geologists, miners, and amateur rockhounds in Nevada &quot;to hunt to your heart&#x27;s content ... being able to find agate, opal, jasper, fossils, fluorescent minerals, obsidian, chalcedony, wonderstone, malachite, petrified wood, limb casts, and much more means paradise.&quot;
===Environmental considerations===
The Reno area is often subject to wildfires that cause property damage and sometimes loss of life. Roughly 80% of homes in the area have a risk of being impacted by wildfire. In August 1960, the Donner Ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days. In November 2011, arcing from powerlines caused a fire in Caughlin in southwest Reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one man. Just two months later, a fire in Washoe Drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one woman. Around 10,000 residents were evacuated, and a state of emergency was declared. The fires came at the end of Reno&#x27;s longest recorded dry spell. In September 2024, the Davis Fire burned heavily forested regions in Southwest Reno. Fourteen structures burned in the area, and twenty thousand people were evacuated.
Wetlands are an important part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the Great Basin. The area&#x27;s wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with soil, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.

===Climate===
Reno has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) to the west. It experiences moderately cold winters and hot summers; it is influenced by the Sierra Nevada mountains to the west and the more arid Great Basin to the east. It is situated across a varied geographic landscape, which extends from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada into the Truckee River valley. While Reno experiences a rain shadow effect from the surrounding mountains, its western portions can receive three to four times as much precipitation as those extending eastward. Annual rainfall patterns in Reno adhere to a Mediterranean climate, with most precipitation occurring in fall, winter, and spring, followed by long, hot, dry summers. However, Reno&#x27;s average annual rainfall is slightly lower than that of Californian cities more typically associated with Mediterranean climates. The area&#x27;s low evapotranspiration stemming from its moderate annual average temperature also bears similarity to semi-arid climates found in Nevada&#x27;s Great Basin.

The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July, with the diurnal temperature variation occasionally reaching in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east. There are 6.0 days of + highs, 65 days of + highs, 1.6 days with + lows, and 1.9 days with sub- lows annually; the temperature reaches or dips below the freezing point on 122 days, and does not rise above freezing on only 4.1 of those days. The all-time record high temperature is , which occurred on July 10 and 11, 2002, again on July 5, 2007, and again on July 16, 2023. The all-time record low temperature is , which occurred on January 21, 1916; the lowest temperature recorded at the airport is , which occurred on four occasions, most recently on February 7, 1989. In addition, the region is windy throughout the year; observers such as Mark Twain have commented about the &quot;Washoe Zephyr&quot;, northwestern Nevada&#x27;s distinctive wind.

Annual precipitation has ranged from in 1947 to in 2017. The most precipitation in one month was in January 1916 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was on January 28, 1903. At Reno–Tahoe International Airport, where records go back to 1937, the most precipitation in one month was in January 2017 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was on January 21, 1943.

Most rainfall occurs in winter and spring. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a &quot;Washoe Zephyr&quot;, can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upward against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.

Winter snowfall is usually light to moderate, but can be heavy some days, averaging annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19–23 inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the airport at , while the foothills of the Carson Range to the west ranging from in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the Virginia Range to the east, meanwhile, can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above . However, snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in Reno in one winter was in 1915–1916, with an astonishing in January, the most in a calendar month, as well as on January 17, the most in a calendar day; the most snowfall in a calendar year was in 1916.

Reno lies north of the Nevada state capital, Carson City, and northeast of Lake Tahoe in a shrub-steppe environment. Reno shares its eastern border with the city of Sparks and is the larger of the principal cities of the Reno–Sparks, Nevada Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a metropolitan area that covers Storey and Washoe counties. The MSA had a combined population of 425,417 at the 2010 census.

There is an Italian-American community in Reno.

==Economy==

Until the 1960s, Reno was the gambling capital of the United States, but Las Vegas&#x27;s rapid growth, American Airlines&#x27; 2000 buyout of Reno Air and the growth of Native American gaming in California have reduced its gambling economy. Older casinos were torn down (Mapes Hotel, Fitzgerald&#x27;s Nevada Club, Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, Harold&#x27;s Club, Palace Club), and smaller casinos like the Comstock, Sundowner, Golden Phoenix, Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into residential units.

Because of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento while Las Vegas has historically served more tourists from Southern California and the Phoenix area.

Several local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the Atlantis, the Peppermill and the Grand Sierra Resort. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by &quot;Casino Player&quot; and &quot;Nevada&quot; magazines. In 2005, the Peppermill Reno began a $300 million Tuscan-themed expansion.

Reno holds several events throughout the year to draw tourists to the area. They include Hot August Nights (a classic car convention), Street Vibrations (a motorcycle fan gathering and rally), the Great Reno Balloon Race, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, bowling tournaments (held in the National Bowling Stadium), and the Reno Air Races.

Several large commercial developments were constructed during the mid-2000s boom, such as The Summit in 2007 and Legends at Sparks Marina in 2008.

Reno is the location of the corporate headquarters for several companies, including Braeburn Capital, Hamilton, Server Technology, EE Technologies, Caesars Entertainment, and Port of Subs. Companies based in the Reno metropolitan area include Sierra Nevada Corporation and U.S. Ordnance. International Game Technology, Bally Technologies and GameTech have a development and manufacturing presence.

Since the turn of the 21st century, greater Reno saw an influx of technology companies entering the area, following major initiatives and investments by investors from Seattle &amp; the Bay Area. The first one in 1999 was Amazon.com in Fernley. After the Great Recession, the state placed an increased focus on economic development. Thousands of new jobs were created.

The Tesla Gigafactory at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is one of the largest buildings in the country, purportedly covering 5.8 million square feet. Although it was originally Tesla&#x27;s largest factory, it&#x27;s since been superseded by Gigafactory Texas, which has 10 million square feet. It employs roughly 11,000 people, making Tesla larger than any employer in the city of Reno, though the Industrial Center is located just outside of the city. In 2023 Tesla announced a $3.6 billion expansion of the facility that would incorporate an additional four million square feet, including an all-new plant for Semis and a much larger one for battery development. The new facilities are expected to add up to 3,000 new Tesla employees to the region upon completion.

The arrival of several data centers at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is further diversifying a region that was best known for distribution and logistics outside gaming and tourism. Switch&#x27;s new SUPERNAP campus at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is shaping up to be the largest data center in the world once completed. Apple is expanding its data center at the adjacent Reno Technology Park and recently built a warehouse on land in downtown Reno.

The greater Reno area also hosts distribution facilities for Amazon, Walmart, PetSmart and Zulily.

===Top employers===
According to Reno&#x27;s 2023 Fiscal Year Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Reno also hosts a number of music venues, such as the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts, the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Reno Pops Orchestra. The Reno Youth Symphony Orchestra (YSO), affiliated with the Reno Philharmonic, gives talented youth the opportunity to play advanced music and perform nationwide. In 2016 they had the honor of performing at Carnegie Hall. A.V.A. Ballet Theatre is the resident ballet company of the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. All of their classical performances are with the Reno Philharmonic Orchestra.

Every July, Reno celebrates Artown, a visual and performing arts festival that lasts the entire month of July throughout the city. Along with performances, Artown partners with other institutions throughout the Reno Tahoe area to hold workshops, camps, and classes for all ages. All events are free of charge or low cost.

==Sports==


Reno is home to the Reno Aces, the minor league baseball Triple-A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, playing in Greater Nevada Field, a downtown ballpark opened in 2009. Reno has hosted multiple professional baseball teams in the past, most under the Reno Silver Sox name. The Reno Astros, a former professional, unaffiliated baseball team, played at Moana Stadium until 2009.

In basketball, the Reno Bighorns of the NBA G League played at the Reno Events Center from 2008 to 2018. They were primarily an affiliate of the Sacramento Kings throughout its existence. The Sacramento Kings bought the team in 2016 and moved the franchise to become the Stockton Kings in 2018.

Reno is host to both amateur and professional combat sporting events such as mixed martial arts and boxing. The &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; between Jack Johnson and James J. Jeffries was held in Reno in 1910. Boxer Ray Mancini fought four of his last five fights in Reno against Bobby Chacon, Livingstone Bramble, Héctor Camacho and Greg Haugen.

Reno expected to be the future home of an ECHL ice hockey team, named the Reno Raiders, but construction on a suitable arena never began. The franchise was dormant since 1998, when it was named the Reno Rage, and earlier the Reno Renegades, and played in the now-defunct West Coast Hockey League (WCHL). In 2016, Reno was removed from the ECHL&#x27;s Future Markets page.

The Reno–Tahoe Open is northern Nevada&#x27;s only PGA Tour event, held at Montrêux Golf &amp; Country Club in Reno. As part of the FedEx Cup, the tournament follows 132 PGA Tour professionals competing for a share of the event&#x27;s $3 million purse. The Reno-Tahoe Open Foundation has donated more than $1.8 million to local charities.

Reno has a college sports scene, with the Nevada Wolf Pack appearing in football bowl games and an Associated Press and Coaches Poll Top Ten ranking in basketball in 2018.
In 2004, the city completed a $1.5 million whitewater park on the Truckee River in downtown Reno which hosts whitewater events throughout the year. The course runs Class 2 and 3 rapids with year-round public access. The north channel features more aggressive rapids, drop pools and &quot;holes&quot; for rodeo kayak-type maneuvers. The milder south channel is set up as a kayak slalom course and a beginner area.

Reno is home to two roller derby teams, the Battle Born Derby Demons and the Reno Roller Girls. The Battle Born Derby Demons compete on flat tracks locally and nationally. They are the only derby team locally to compete in a national Derby league.

Reno is the home of the National Bowling Stadium, which hosts the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) Open Championships every three years.

==Parks and recreation==

Reno is home to a variety of recreation activities including both seasonal and year-round. In the summer, Reno locals can be found near three major bodies of water: Lake Tahoe, the Truckee River, and Pyramid Lake. The Truckee River originates at Lake Tahoe and flows west to east through the center of downtown Reno before terminating at Pyramid Lake to the north. The river is a major part of Artown, held in the summer at Wingfield Park. Washoe Lake is a popular kite and windsurfing location because of its high wind speeds during the summer.

Skiing and snowboarding are among the most popular winter sports and draw many tourists. There are 18 ski resorts (8 major resorts) as close as and as far as from the Reno–Tahoe International Airport, including Northstar California, Sierra-at-Tahoe, Alpine Meadows, Palisades Tahoe, Sugar Bowl, Diamond Peak, Heavenly Mountain, and Mount Rose. Other popular Reno winter activities include snowshoeing, ice skating, and snowmobiling. There are many bike paths to ride in the summer time. Lake Tahoe hosts international bike competitions each summer.

===Air races===

The Reno Air Races, also known as the National Championship Air Races, are held each September at the Reno Stead Airport. 2023 will mark the final year for the races in Reno after 60 years, as a result of the Reno Tahoe Airport Authority decision to sundown the event, citing growth around the airport amongst other nonspecific concerns not stated from the RTAA.

==Government==

Reno has a democratic municipal government. The city council is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the primary by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.

There is an elected city attorney who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.

The city&#x27;s charter calls for a council-manager form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the city manager, who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the city clerk. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.

In 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body. Fifty-four percent of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.

===Fire department===
The city of Reno is protected by the Reno Fire Department (RFD) manning 14 fire stations.

The Reno Fire Department (RFD) provides all-risk emergency service to the City of Reno residents. All-risk emergency service is the national model of municipal fire departments, providing the services needed in the most efficient way possible.

The department provides paramedic-level service to the citizens and visitors of Reno.

In addition to responding to fires of all kinds, the fire department also provides rescue capabilities for almost any type of emergency situation. This includes quick and efficient emergency medical care for the citizens, a hazardous materials team capable of identifying unknown materials and controlling a release disaster, and preparedness and management of large-scale incidents.

==Education==
===Universities and colleges===

* The University of Nevada, Reno is the oldest university in Nevada and Nevada System of Higher Education. In 1886, the state university, previously only a college preparatory school, moved from Elko in remote northeastern Nevada to north of downtown Reno, where it became a full-fledged state college. The university grew slowly over the decades, but it now has an enrollment of 21,353, with most students from within Nevada. Its specialties include mining engineering, agriculture, journalism, business, and one of only two Basque Studies programs in the nation. It houses the National Judicial College. The university was named one of the top 200 colleges in the nation in the most recent &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; National Universities category index.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
Reno was historically served by the Victory Highway and a branch of the Lincoln Highway. After the formation of the U.S. Numbered Highways system, U.S. Route 40 was routed along 4th Street through downtown Reno, before being replaced by Interstate 80. The primary north–south highway through Reno is U.S. Route 395/Interstate 580.

===Bus===
The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County (RTC) has a bus system that provides intracity buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons. The system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at Meadowood Mall in south Reno.

Numerous shuttle and excursion services are offered connecting the Reno–Tahoe International Airport to various destinations:
* North Lake Tahoe Express provides connecting shuttle service to North Lake Tahoe Resorts
* South Tahoe Airporter provides connecting shuttle service to South Lake Tahoe resorts.
* Eastern Sierra Transit Authority provides shuttles to destinations south along the US-395 corridor in California, such as Mammoth Mountain and Lancaster
* Modoc Sage Stage provides shuttles to Alturas and Susanville, California, along the northern US-395 corridor.
* Salt Lake Express provides service to Las Vegas mainly along the southern US-95 corridor.

Greyhound stops at a downtown terminal. Megabus stopped at the Silver Legacy Reno, but has since discontinued service to Reno.

===Rail===
Reno was historically a stopover along the First transcontinental railroad; the modern Overland Route continues to run through Reno. Reno was additionally the southern terminus of the Nevada–California–Oregon Railway (NCO) and the northern terminus of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad. Using the NCO depot and right of way, the Western Pacific Railroad also provided rail service to Reno. In the early 20th century, Reno also had a modest streetcar system. Downtown Reno has two historic train depots, the inactive Nevada-California-Oregon Railroad Depot and the active Amtrak depot at Reno station, originally built by the Southern Pacific Railroad.

Amtrak provides daily passenger service to Reno via the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; at Reno station and via multiple Amtrak Thruway buses that connect to trains departing from Sacramento.

===Air===
The city is served by Reno–Tahoe International Airport, with general aviation traffic handled by Reno Stead Airport. Reno–Tahoe International Airport is the second busiest commercial airport in the state of Nevada after Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Reno was the hub and headquarters of the defunct airline Reno Air.

==Utilities==
The Truckee Meadows Water Authority provides potable water for the city. The Truckee River is the primary water source. It supplies Reno with of water a day during the summer, and of water per day in the winter. The two water treatment plants are Chalk Bluff and Glendale. The Chalk Bluff plant&#x27;s main intakes are west of Reno and south of Verdi, with the water flowing through a series of flumes and ditches to the plant. Alternative intakes are below the plant along the banks of the Truckee River itself. The Glendale plant is alongside the river, and is fed by a rock and concrete rubble diversion dam a short distance upstream.

Sewage treatment for most of the Truckee Meadows region takes place at the Truckee Meadows Water Reclamation Facility at the eastern edge of the valley. Treated effluent returns to the Truckee River by way of Steamboat Creek. In the 1990s, this capacity was increased from 20 to 30 million U.S. gallons (70 to 110 million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, nitrogen, and phosphorus, aggravating water-quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of Pyramid Lake. Local agencies working with the Environmental Protection Agency have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the DSSAM Model was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set. The resulting management strategies included measures such as land use controls in the Lake Tahoe basin, urban runoff controls in Reno and Sparks, and best management practices for wastewater discharge. Golf courses in Reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of Reno&#x27;s water plants.

NV Energy, formerly Sierra Pacific, provides electric power and natural gas. Power comes from multiple sources, including Tracy-Clark Station to the east, and the Steamboat Springs binary cycle power plants at the southern end of town.

<text>In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval. It was presented to the faculty at the University of Göttingen in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868. For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration, or simulated using Monte Carlo integration.

== Overview ==

Imagine you have a curve on a graph, and the curve stays above the x-axis between two points, a and b. The area under that curve, from a to b, is what we want to figure out. This area can be described as the set of all points (x, y) on the graph that follow these rules: a ≤ x ≤ b (the x-coordinate is between a and b) and 0 &lt; y &lt; f(x) (the y-coordinate is between 0 and the height of the curve f(x)). Mathematically, this region can be expressed in set-builder notation as
formula_1

To measure this area, we use a Riemann integral, which is written as:
formula_2

This notation means “the integral of f(x) from a to b,” and it represents the exact area under the curve f(x) and above the x-axis, between x = a and x = b.

The idea behind the Riemann integral is to break the area into small, simple shapes (like rectangles), add up their areas, and then make the rectangles smaller and smaller to get a better estimate. In the end, when the rectangles are infinitely small, the sum gives the exact area, which is what the integral represents.

If the curve dips below the x-axis, the integral gives a signed area. This means the integral adds the part above the x-axis as positive and subtracts the part below the x-axis as negative. So, the result of formula_3 can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on how much of the curve is above or below the x-axis.

== Definition ==

=== Partitions of an interval ===

A partition of an interval is a finite sequence of numbers of the form
formula_4

Each is called a sub-interval of the partition. The mesh or norm of a partition is defined to be the length of the longest sub-interval, that is,
formula_5

A tagged partition of an interval is a partition together with a choice of a sample point within each sub-interval: that is, numbers with for each . The mesh of a tagged partition is the same as that of an ordinary partition.

Suppose that two partitions and are both partitions of the interval . We say that is a refinement of if for each integer , with , there exists an integer such that and such that for some with . That is, a tagged partition breaks up some of the sub-intervals and adds sample points where necessary, &quot;refining&quot; the accuracy of the partition.

We can turn the set of all tagged partitions into a directed set by saying that one tagged partition is greater than or equal to another if the former is a refinement of the latter.

=== Riemann sum ===
Let be a real-valued function defined on the interval . The &quot;Riemann sum&quot; of with respect to the tagged partition together with is
formula_6

Each term in the sum is the product of the value of the function at a given point and the length of an interval. Consequently, each term represents the (signed) area of a rectangle with height and width . The Riemann sum is the (signed) area of all the rectangles.

Closely related concepts are the &quot;lower and upper Darboux sums&quot;. These are similar to Riemann sums, but the tags are replaced by the infimum and supremum (respectively) of on each sub-interval:
formula_7

If is continuous, then the lower and upper Darboux sums for an untagged partition are equal to the Riemann sum for that partition, where the tags are chosen to be the minimum or maximum (respectively) of on each subinterval. (When is discontinuous on a subinterval, there may not be a tag that achieves the infimum or supremum on that subinterval.) The Darboux integral, which is similar to the Riemann integral but based on Darboux sums, is equivalent to the Riemann integral.

=== Riemann integral ===
Loosely speaking, the Riemann integral is the limit of the Riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer. If the limit exists then the function is said to be integrable (or more specifically Riemann-integrable). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann integral by making the partition fine enough.

One important requirement is that the mesh of the partitions must become smaller and smaller, so that it has the limit zero. If this were not so, then we would not be getting a good approximation to the function on certain subintervals. In fact, this is enough to define an integral. To be specific, we say that the Riemann integral of exists and equals if the following condition holds:

For all , there exists such that for any tagged partition and whose mesh is less than , we have
formula_8

Unfortunately, this definition is very difficult to use. It would help to develop an equivalent definition of the Riemann integral which is easier to work with. We develop this definition now, with a proof of equivalence following. Our new definition says that the Riemann integral of exists and equals if the following condition holds:

For all , there exists a tagged partition and such that for any tagged partition and which is a refinement of and , we have
formula_8

Both of these mean that eventually, the Riemann sum of with respect to any partition gets trapped close to . Since this is true no matter how close we demand the sums be trapped, we say that the Riemann sums converge to . These definitions are actually a special case of a more general concept, a net.

As we stated earlier, these two definitions are equivalent. In other words, works in the first definition if and only if works in the second definition. To show that the first definition implies the second, start with an , and choose a that satisfies the condition. Choose any tagged partition whose mesh is less than . Its Riemann sum is within of , and any refinement of this partition will also have mesh less than , so the Riemann sum of the refinement will also be within of .

To show that the second definition implies the first, it is easiest to use the Darboux integral. First, one shows that the second definition is equivalent to the definition of the Darboux integral; for this see the Darboux integral article. Now we will show that a Darboux integrable function satisfies the first definition. Fix , and choose a partition such that the lower and upper Darboux sums with respect to this partition are within of the value of the Darboux integral. Let
formula_10

If , then is the zero function, which is clearly both Darboux and Riemann integrable with integral zero. Therefore, we will assume that . If , then we choose such that
formula_11

If , then we choose to be less than one. Choose a tagged partition and with mesh smaller than . We must show that the Riemann sum is within of .

To see this, choose an interval . If this interval is contained within some , then
formula_12
where and are respectively, the infimum and the supremum of &quot;f&quot; on . If all intervals had this property, then this would conclude the proof, because each term in the Riemann sum would be bounded by a corresponding term in the Darboux sums, and we chose the Darboux sums to be near . This is the case when , so the proof is finished in that case.

Therefore, we may assume that . In this case, it is possible that one of the is not contained in any . Instead, it may stretch across two of the intervals determined by . (It cannot meet three intervals because is assumed to be smaller than the length of any one interval.) In symbols, it may happen that
formula_13

(We may assume that all the inequalities are strict because otherwise we are in the previous case by our assumption on the length of .) This can happen at most times.

To handle this case, we will estimate the difference between the Riemann sum and the Darboux sum by subdividing the partition at . The term in the Riemann sum splits into two terms:
formula_14

Suppose, without loss of generality, that . Then
formula_15
so this term is bounded by the corresponding term in the Darboux sum for . To bound the other term, notice that
formula_16

It follows that, for some (indeed any) ,
formula_17

Since this happens at most times, the distance between the Riemann sum and a Darboux sum is at most . Therefore, the distance between the Riemann sum and is at most .

== Examples ==
Let formula_18 be the function which takes the value 1 at every point. Any Riemann sum of on will have the value 1, therefore the Riemann integral of on is 1.

Let formula_19 be the indicator function of the rational numbers in ; that is, formula_20 takes the value 1 on rational numbers and 0 on irrational numbers. This function does not have a Riemann integral. To prove this, we will show how to construct tagged partitions whose Riemann sums get arbitrarily close to both zero and one.

To start, let and be a tagged partition (each is between and ). Choose . The have already been chosen, and we can&#x27;t change the value of at those points. But if we cut the partition into tiny pieces around each , we can minimize the effect of the . Then, by carefully choosing the new tags, we can make the value of the Riemann sum turn out to be within of either zero or one.

Our first step is to cut up the partition. There are of the , and we want their total effect to be less than . If we confine each of them to an interval of length less than , then the contribution of each to the Riemann sum will be at least and at most . This makes the total sum at least zero and at most . So let be a positive number less than . If it happens that two of the are within of each other, choose smaller. If it happens that some is within of some , and is not equal to , choose smaller. Since there are only finitely many and , we can always choose sufficiently small.

Now we add two cuts to the partition for each . One of the cuts will be at , and the other will be at . If one of these leaves the interval [0, 1], then we leave it out. will be the tag corresponding to the subinterval
formula_21

If is directly on top of one of the , then we let be the tag for both intervals:
formula_22

We still have to choose tags for the other subintervals. We will choose them in two different ways. The first way is to always choose a rational point, so that the Riemann sum is as large as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at least . The second way is to always choose an irrational point, so that the Riemann sum is as small as possible. This will make the value of the Riemann sum at most .

Since we started from an arbitrary partition and ended up as close as we wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is beyond the reach of the Riemann integral.

There are even worse examples. formula_20 is equivalent (that is, equal almost everywhere) to a Riemann integrable function, but there are non-Riemann integrable bounded functions which are not equivalent to any Riemann integrable function. For example, let be the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set, and let be its indicator function. Because is not Jordan measurable, is not Riemann integrable. Moreover, no function equivalent to is Riemann integrable: , like , must be zero on a dense set, so as in the previous example, any Riemann sum of has a refinement which is within of 0 for any positive number . But if the Riemann integral of exists, then it must equal the Lebesgue integral of , which is . Therefore, is not Riemann integrable.

== Similar concepts ==

It is popular to define the Riemann integral as the Darboux integral. This is because the Darboux integral is technically simpler and because a function is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is Darboux-integrable.

Some calculus books do not use general tagged partitions, but limit themselves to specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions may appear to be integrable.

One popular restriction is the use of &quot;left-hand&quot; and &quot;right-hand&quot; Riemann sums. In a left-hand Riemann sum, for all , and in a right-hand Riemann sum, for all . Alone this restriction does not impose a problem: we can refine any partition in a way that makes it a left-hand or right-hand sum by subdividing it at each . In more formal language, the set of all left-hand Riemann sums and the set of all right-hand Riemann sums is cofinal in the set of all tagged partitions.

Another popular restriction is the use of regular subdivisions of an interval. For example, the th regular subdivision of consists of the intervals
formula_24

Again, alone this restriction does not impose a problem, but the reasoning required to see this fact is more difficult than in the case of left-hand and right-hand Riemann sums.

However, combining these restrictions, so that one uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous. If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the indicator function formula_20 will appear to be integrable on with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one. The problem with this definition becomes apparent when we try to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold:
formula_26

If we use regular subdivisions and left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums, then the two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as we have seen the term on the right will equal 1.

As defined above, the Riemann integral avoids this problem by refusing to integrate formula_27 The Lebesgue integral is defined in such a way that all these integrals are 0.

== Properties ==

=== Linearity ===
The Riemann integral is a linear transformation; that is, if and are Riemann-integrable on and and are constants, then
formula_28

Because the Riemann integral of a function is a number, this makes the Riemann integral a linear functional on the vector space of Riemann-integrable functions.

== Integrability ==
A bounded function on a compact interval is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere (the set of its points of discontinuity has measure zero, in the sense of Lebesgue measure). This is the (of characterization of the Riemann integrable functions). It has been proven independently by Giuseppe Vitali and by Henri Lebesgue in 1907, and uses the notion of measure zero, but makes use of neither Lebesgue&#x27;s general measure or integral.

The integrability condition can be proven in various ways, one of which is sketched below.

In particular, any set that is at most countable has Lebesgue measure zero, and thus a bounded function (on a compact interval) with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is Riemann integrable. Another sufficient criterion to Riemann integrability over , but which does not involve the concept of measure, is the existence of a right-hand (or left-hand) limit at &quot;every&quot; point in (or ).

An indicator function of a bounded set is Riemann-integrable if and only if the set is Jordan measurable. The Riemann integral can be interpreted measure-theoretically as the integral with respect to the Jordan measure.

If a real-valued function is monotone on the interval it is Riemann integrable, since its set of discontinuities is at most countable, and therefore of Lebesgue measure zero. If a real-valued function on is Riemann integrable, it is Lebesgue integrable. That is, Riemann-integrability is a &quot;stronger&quot; (meaning more difficult to satisfy) condition than Lebesgue-integrability. The converse does not hold; not all Lebesgue-integrable functions are Riemann integrable.

The Lebesgue–Vitali theorem does not imply that all type of discontinuities have the same weight on the obstruction that a real-valued bounded function be Riemann integrable on . In fact, certain discontinuities have absolutely no role on the Riemann integrability of the function—a consequence of the classification of the discontinuities of a function.

If is a uniformly convergent sequence on with limit , then Riemann integrability of all implies Riemann integrability of , and
formula_29

However, the Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem (on a monotone pointwise limit) does not hold for Riemann integrals. Thus, in Riemann integration, taking limits under the integral sign is far more difficult to logically justify than in Lebesgue integration.

== Generalizations ==
It is easy to extend the Riemann integral to functions with values in the Euclidean vector space formula_30 for any . The integral is defined component-wise; in other words, if then
formula_31

In particular, since the complex numbers are a real vector space, this allows the integration of complex valued functions.

The Riemann integral is only defined on bounded intervals, and it does not extend well to unbounded intervals. The simplest possible extension is to define such an integral as a limit, in other words, as an improper integral:
formula_32

This definition carries with it some subtleties, such as the fact that it is not always equivalent to compute the Cauchy principal value
formula_33

For example, consider the sign function which is 0 at , 1 for , and −1 for . By symmetry,
formula_34
always, regardless of . But there are many ways for the interval of integration to expand to fill the real line, and other ways can produce different results; in other words, the multivariate limit does not always exist. We can compute
formula_35

In general, this improper Riemann integral is undefined. Even standardizing a way for the interval to approach the real line does not work because it leads to disturbingly counterintuitive results. If we agree (for instance) that the improper integral should always be
formula_36
then the integral of the translation is −2, so this definition is not invariant under shifts, a highly undesirable property. In fact, not only does this function not have an improper Riemann integral, its Lebesgue integral is also undefined (it equals ).

Unfortunately, the improper Riemann integral is not powerful enough. The most severe problem is that there are no widely applicable theorems for commuting improper Riemann integrals with limits of functions. In applications such as Fourier series it is important to be able to approximate the integral of a function using integrals of approximations to the function. For proper Riemann integrals, a standard theorem states that if is a sequence of functions that converge uniformly to on a compact set , then
formula_37

On non-compact intervals such as the real line, this is false. For example, take to be on and zero elsewhere. For all we have:
formula_38

The sequence converges uniformly to the zero function, and clearly the integral of the zero function is zero. Consequently,
formula_39

This demonstrates that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is not strong enough to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral unworkable in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands.

A better route is to abandon the Riemann integral for the Lebesgue integral. The definition of the Lebesgue integral is not obviously a generalization of the Riemann integral, but it is not hard to prove that every Riemann-integrable function is Lebesgue-integrable and that the values of the two integrals agree whenever they are both defined. Moreover, a function defined on a bounded interval is Riemann-integrable if and only if it is bounded and the set of points where is discontinuous has Lebesgue measure zero.

An integral which is in fact a direct generalization of the Riemann integral is the Henstock–Kurzweil integral.

Another way of generalizing the Riemann integral is to replace the factors in the definition of a Riemann sum by something else; roughly speaking, this gives the interval of integration a different notion of length. This is the approach taken by the Riemann–Stieltjes integral.

In multivariable calculus, the Riemann integrals for functions from formula_40 are multiple integrals.

==Comparison with other theories of integration==
The Riemann integral is unsuitable for many theoretical purposes. Some of the technical deficiencies in Riemann integration can be remedied with the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, and most disappear with the Lebesgue integral, though the latter does not have a satisfactory treatment of improper integrals. The gauge integral is a generalisation of the Lebesgue integral that is at the same time closer to the Riemann integral. 
These more general theories allow for the integration of more &quot;jagged&quot; or &quot;highly oscillating&quot; functions whose Riemann integral does not exist; but the theories give the same value as the Riemann integral when it does exist.

In educational settings, the Darboux integral offers a simpler definition that is easier to work with; it can be used to introduce the Riemann integral. The Darboux integral is defined whenever the Riemann integral is, and always gives the same result. Conversely, the gauge integral is a simple but more powerful generalization of the Riemann integral and has led some educators to advocate that it should replace the Riemann integral in introductory calculus courses.

<text>Run-length encoding (RLE) is a form of lossless data compression in which &quot;runs&quot; of data (consecutive occurrences of the same data value) are stored as a single occurrence of that data value and a count of its consecutive occurrences, rather than as the original run. As an imaginary example of the concept, when encoding an image built up from colored dots, the sequence &quot;green green green green green green green green green&quot; is shortened to &quot;green x 9&quot;. This is most efficient on data that contains many such runs, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, games, and animations. For files that do not have many runs, encoding them with RLE could increase the file size.

RLE may also refer in particular to an early graphics file format supported by CompuServe for compressing black and white images, that was widely supplanted by their later Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).

RLE also refers to a little-used image format in Windows 3.x that is saved with the file extension codice_1; it is a run-length encoded bitmap, and was used as the format for the Windows 3.x startup screen.

==History and applications==

Run-length encoding (RLE) schemes were employed in the transmission of analog television signals as far back as 1967. In 1983, run-length encoding was patented by Hitachi. RLE is particularly well suited to palette-based bitmap images (which use relatively few colours) such as computer icons, and was a popular image compression method on early online services such as CompuServe before the advent of more sophisticated formats such as GIF. It does not work well on continuous-tone images (which use very many colours) such as photographs, although JPEG uses it on the coefficients that remain after transforming and quantizing image blocks.

Common formats for run-length encoded data include Truevision TGA, PackBits (by Apple, used in MacPaint), PCX and ILBM. The International Telecommunication Union also describes a standard to encode run-length colour for fax machines, known as T.45. That fax colour coding standard, which along with other techniques is incorporated into Modified Huffman coding, is relatively efficient because most faxed documents are primarily white space, with occasional interruptions of black.

== Algorithm ==
RLE has a space complexity of , where is the size of the input data.

=== Encoding algorithm ===
Run-length encoding compresses data by reducing the physical size of a repeating string of characters. This process involves converting the input data into a compressed format by identifying and counting consecutive occurrences of each character. The steps are as follows:

# Traverse the input data.
# Count the number of consecutive repeating characters (run length).
# Store the character and its run length.

==== Python implementation ====

def rle_encode(iterable, *, length_first=True):
 »&gt; &quot;&quot;.join(rle_encode(&quot;AAAABBBCCDAA&quot;))
 &#x27;4A3B2C1D2A&#x27;
 »&gt; &quot;&quot;.join(rle_encode(&quot;AAAABBBCCDAA&quot;, length_first=False))
 &#x27;A4B3C2D1A2&#x27;
 return (
 f&quot;{ilen(g)}{k}&quot; if length_first else f&quot;{k}{ilen(g)}&quot; # ilen(g): length of iterable g
 for k, g in groupby(iterable)


=== Decoding algorithm ===
The decoding process involves reconstructing the original data from the encoded format by repeating characters according to their counts. The steps are as follows:

# Traverse the encoded data.
# For each count-character pair, repeat the character count times.
# Append these characters to the result string.

==== Python implementation ====
def rle_decode(iterable, *, length_first=True):
 »&gt; &quot;&quot;.join(rle_decode(&quot;4A3B2C1D2A&quot;))
 &#x27;AAAABBBCCDAA&#x27;
 »&gt; &quot;&quot;.join(rle_decode(&quot;A4B3C2D1A2&quot;, length_first=False))
 &#x27;AAAABBBCCDAA&#x27;
 return chain.from_iterable(
 repeat(b, int(a)) if length_first else repeat(a, int(b))
 for a, b in batched(iterable, 2)


==Example==

Consider a screen containing plain black text on a solid white background. There will be many long runs of white pixels in the blank space, and many short runs of black pixels within the text. A hypothetical scan line, with B representing a black pixel and W representing white, might read as follows:

: codice_2

With a run-length encoding (RLE) data compression algorithm applied to the above hypothetical scan line, it can be rendered as follows:

: codice_3

This can be interpreted as a sequence of twelve Ws, one B, twelve Ws, three Bs, etc., and represents the original 67 characters in only 18. While the actual format used for the storage of images is generally binary rather than ASCII characters like this, the principle remains the same. Even binary data files can be compressed with this method; file format specifications often dictate repeated bytes in files as padding space. However, newer compression methods such as DEFLATE often use LZ77-based algorithms, a generalization of run-length encoding that can take advantage of runs of strings of characters (such as codice_4).

Run-length encoding can be expressed in multiple ways to accommodate data properties as well as additional compression algorithms. For instance, one popular method encodes run lengths for runs of two or more characters only, using an &quot;escape&quot; symbol to identify runs, or using the character itself as the escape, so that any time a character appears twice it denotes a run. On the previous example, this would give the following:
: codice_5

This would be interpreted as a run of twelve Ws, a B, a run of twelve Ws, a run of three Bs, etc. In data where runs are less frequent, this can significantly improve the compression rate.

One other matter is the application of additional compression algorithms. Even with the runs extracted, the frequencies of different characters may be large, allowing for further compression; however, if the run lengths are written in the file in the locations where the runs occurred, the presence of these numbers interrupts the normal flow and makes it harder to compress. To overcome this, some run-length encoders separate the data and escape symbols from the run lengths, so that the two can be handled independently. For the example data, this would result in two outputs, the string &quot;codice_6&quot; and the numbers (codice_7).

== Variants ==

* Sequential RLE: This method processes data one line at a time, scanning from left to right. It is commonly employed in image compression. Other variations of this technique include scanning the data vertically, diagonally, or in blocks.
* Lossy RLE: In this variation, some bits are intentionally discarded during compression (often by setting one or two significant bits of each pixel to 0). This leads to higher compression rates while minimally impacting the visual quality of the image.
*Adaptive RLE: Uses different encoding schemes depending on the length of runs to optimize compression ratios. For example, short runs might use a different encoding format than long runs.

<text>In computer science, a red–black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure noted for fast storage and retrieval of ordered information. The nodes in a red-black tree hold an extra &quot;color&quot; bit, often drawn as red and black, which help ensure that the tree is always approximately balanced.

When the tree is modified, the new tree is rearranged and &quot;repainted&quot; to restore the coloring properties that constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. The properties are designed such that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently.

The (re-)balancing is not perfect, but guarantees searching in formula_1 time, where formula_2 is the number of entries in the tree. The insert and delete operations, along with tree rearrangement and recoloring, also execute in formula_1 time.

Tracking the color of each node requires only one bit of information per node because there are only two colors (due to memory alignment present in some programming languages, the real memory consumption may differ). The tree does not contain any other data specific to it being a red–black tree, so its memory footprint is almost identical to that of a classic (uncolored) binary search tree. In some cases, the added bit of information can be stored at no added memory cost.

== History ==
In 1972, Rudolf Bayer invented a data structure that was a special order-4 case of a B-tree. These trees maintained all paths from root to leaf with the same number of nodes, creating perfectly balanced trees. However, they were not &quot;binary&quot; search trees. Bayer called them a &quot;symmetric binary B-tree&quot; in his paper and later they became popular as 2–3–4 trees or even 2–3 trees.

In a 1978 paper, &quot;A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees&quot;, Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick derived the red–black tree from the symmetric binary B-tree. The color &quot;red&quot; was chosen because it was the best-looking color produced by the color laser printer available to the authors while working at Xerox PARC. Another response from Guibas states that it was because of the red and black pens available to them to draw the trees.

In 1993, Arne Andersson introduced the idea of a right leaning tree to simplify insert and delete operations.

In 1999, Chris Okasaki showed how to make the insert operation purely functional. Its balance function needed to take care of only 4 unbalanced cases and one default balanced case.

The original algorithm used 8 unbalanced cases, but reduced that to 6 unbalanced cases. Sedgewick showed that the insert operation can be implemented in just 46 lines of Java code.
In 2008, Sedgewick proposed the left-leaning red–black tree, leveraging Andersson’s idea that simplified the insert and delete operations. Sedgewick originally allowed nodes whose two children are red, making his trees more like 2–3–4 trees, but later this restriction was added, making new trees more like 2–3 trees. Sedgewick implemented the insert algorithm in just 33 lines, significantly shortening his original 46 lines of code.

== Terminology ==

A red–black tree is a special type of binary search tree, used in computer science to organize pieces of comparable data, such as text fragments or numbers (as e.g. the numbers in figures 1 and 2). The nodes carrying keys and/or data are frequently called &quot;internal nodes&quot;, but to make this very specific they are also called non-NIL nodes in this article.

The leaf nodes of red–black trees ( NIL  in figure 1) do not contain keys or data. These &quot;leaves&quot; need not be explicit individuals in computer memory: a NULL pointer can—as in all binary tree data structures— encode the fact that there is no child node at this position in the (parent) node. Nevertheless, by their position in the tree, these objects are in relation to other nodes that is relevant to the RB-structure, it may have parent, sibling (i.e., the other child of the parent), uncle, even nephew node; and may be child—but never parent—of another node.
It is not really necessary to attribute a &quot;color&quot; to these end-of-path objects, because the condition &quot;is codice_1 or codice_2&quot; is implied by the condition &quot;is codice_1&quot; (see also this remark).

Figure 2 shows the conceptually same red–black tree without these NIL leaves. To arrive at the same notion of a path, one must notice that e.g., 3 paths run through the node 1, namely a path through 1left plus 2 added paths through 1right, namely the paths through 6left and 6right. This way, these ends of the paths are also docking points for new nodes to be inserted, fully equivalent to the NIL leaves of figure 1.

Instead, to save a marginal amount of execution time, these (possibly many) NIL leaves may be implemented as pointers to one unique (and black) sentinel node (instead of pointers of value NULL).

As a conclusion, the fact that a child does not exist (is not a true node, does not contain data) can in all occurrences be specified by the very same NULL pointer or as the very same pointer to a sentinel node. Throughout this article, either choice is called NIL node and has the constant value codice_1.

The black depth of a node is defined as the number of black nodes from the root to that node (i.e. the number of black ancestors). The black height of a red–black tree is the number of black nodes in any path from the root to the leaves, which, by requirement 4, is constant (alternatively, it could be defined as the black depth of any leaf node).
The black height of a node is the black height of the subtree rooted by it. In this article, the black height of a NIL node shall be set to 0, because its subtree is empty as suggested by figure 2, and its tree height is also 0.

== Properties ==
In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a 

# Every node is either red or black.
# All NIL nodes (figure 1) are considered black.
# A red node does not have a red child.
# Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.
#(Conclusion) If a node N has exactly one child, the child must be red, because if it were black, its NIL descendants would sit at a different black depth than N&#x27;s NIL child, violating requirement 4.

Some authors, e.g. Cormen &amp; al., claim &quot;the root is black&quot; as fifth requirement; but not Mehlhorn &amp; Sanders or Sedgewick &amp; Wayne. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, this rule has little effect on analysis.
This article also omits it, because it slightly disturbs the recursive algorithms and proofs.

As an example, every perfect binary tree that consists only of black nodes is a red–black tree.

The read-only operations, such as search or tree traversal, do not affect any of the requirements. In contrast, the modifying operations insert and delete easily maintain requirements 1 and 2, but with respect to the other requirements some extra effort must be made, to avoid introducing a violation of requirement 3, called a red-violation, or of requirement 4, called a black-violation.

The requirements enforce a critical property of red–black trees: &quot;the path from the root to the farthest leaf is no more than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf&quot;. The result is that the tree is height-balanced. Since operations such as inserting, deleting, and finding values require worst-case time proportional to the height formula_4 of the tree, this upper bound on the height allows red–black trees to be efficient in the worst case, namely logarithmic in the number formula_2 of entries, i.e. which is not the case for ordinary binary search trees. For a mathematical proof see section Proof of bounds.

Red–black trees, like all binary search trees, allow quite efficient sequential access (e.g. in-order traversal, that is: in the order Left–Root–Right) of their elements. But they support also asymptotically optimal direct access via a traversal from root to leaf, resulting in formula_1 search time.

== Analogy to 2–3–4 trees ==
Red–black trees are similar in structure to 2–3–4 trees, which are B-trees of order 4. In 2–3–4 trees, each node can contain between 1 and 3 values and have between 2 and 4 children. These 2–3–4 nodes correspond to black node – red children groups in red-black trees, as shown in figure 3. It is not a 1-to-1 correspondence, because 3-nodes have two equivalent representations: the red child may lie either to the left or right. The left-leaning red-black tree variant makes this relationship exactly 1-to-1, by only allowing the left child representation. Since every 2–3–4 node has a corresponding black node, invariant 4 of red-black trees is equivalent to saying that the leaves of a 2–3–4 tree all lie at the same level.

Despite structural similarities, operations on red–black trees are more economical than B-trees. B-trees require management of vectors of variable length, whereas red-black trees are simply binary trees.

== Applications and related data structures ==
Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees. For example, many data structures used in computational geometry are based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler and epoll system call of the Linux kernel use red–black trees.
The AVL tree is another structure supporting formula_1 search, insertion, and removal. AVL trees can be colored red–black, and thus are a subset of red-black trees. The worst-case height of AVL is 0.720 times the worst-case height of red-black trees, so AVL trees are more rigidly balanced. The performance measurements of Ben Pfaff with realistic test cases in 79 runs find AVL to RB ratios between 0.677 and 1.077, median at 0.947, and geometric mean 0.910. The performance of WAVL trees lie in between AVL trees and red-black trees.

Red–black trees are also particularly valuable in functional programming, where they are one of the most common persistent data structures, used to construct associative arrays and sets that can retain previous versions after mutations. The persistent version of red–black trees requires formula_1 space for each insertion or deletion, in addition to time.

For every 2–3–4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2–3–4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2–3–4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2–3–4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2–3–4 trees are not often used in practice.

In 2008, Sedgewick introduced a simpler version of the red–black tree called the left-leaning red–black tree by eliminating a previously unspecified degree of freedom in the implementation. The LLRB maintains an additional invariant that all red links must lean left except during inserts and deletes. Red–black trees can be made isometric to either 2–3 trees, or 2–3–4 trees, for any sequence of operations. The 2–3–4 tree isometry was described in 1978 by Sedgewick. With 2–3–4 trees, the isometry is resolved by a &quot;color flip,&quot; corresponding to a split, in which the red color of two children nodes leaves the children and moves to the parent node.

The original description of the tango tree, a type of tree optimised for fast searches, specifically uses red–black trees as part of its data structure.

As of Java 8, the HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store different elements with colliding hashcodes, a red–black tree is used. This results in the improvement of time complexity of searching such an element from formula_9 to formula_10 where formula_11 is the number of elements with colliding hashcodes.

== Operations ==
The read-only operations, such as search or tree traversal, on a red–black tree require no modification from those used for binary search trees, because every red–black tree is a special case of a simple binary search tree. However, the immediate result of an insertion or removal may violate the properties of a red–black tree, the restoration of which is called &quot;rebalancing&quot; so that red–black trees become self-balancing.
It requires in the &quot;worst case&quot; a small number, formula_1 in Big O notation, where formula_2 is the number of objects in the tree, on average or &quot;amortized&quot; formula_14, a constant number, of color changes (which are very quick in practice); and no more than three tree rotations (two for insertion).

If the example implementation below is not suitable, other implementations with explanations may be found in Ben Pfaff’s annotated C library GNU libavl (v2.0.3 as of June 2019).

The details of the insert and removal operations will be demonstrated with example C++ code, which uses the type definitions, macros below, and the helper function for rotations:
// Basic type definitions:

enum color_t { BLACK, RED };

struct RBnode { // node of red–black tree
 RBnode* parent; // == NIL if root of the tree
 RBnode* child[2]; // == NIL if child is empty
 // The index is:
 // LEFT := 0, if (key &lt; parent-&gt;key)
 // RIGHT := 1, if (key &gt; parent-&gt;key)
 enum color_t color;
 int key;

#define NIL NULL // null pointer or pointer to sentinel node
#define LEFT 0
#define RIGHT 1
#define left child[LEFT]
#define right child[RIGHT]

struct RBtree { // red–black tree
 RBnode* root; // == NIL if tree is empty

// Get the child direction (∈ { LEFT, RIGHT })
// of the non-root non-NIL RBnode* N:
#define childDir(N) ( N == (N-&gt;parent)-&gt;right ? RIGHT : LEFT )


RBnode* RotateDirRoot(
 RBtree* T, // red–black tree
 RBnode* P, // root of subtree (may be the root of T)
 int dir) { // dir ∈ { LEFT, RIGHT }
 RBnode* G = P-&gt;parent;
 RBnode* S = P-&gt;child[1-dir];
 RBnode* C;
 assert(S != NIL); // pointer to true node required
 C = S-&gt;child[dir];
 P-&gt;child[1-dir] = C; if (C != NIL) C-&gt;parent = P;
 S-&gt;child[ dir] = P; P-&gt;parent = S;
 S-&gt;parent = G;
 if (G != NULL)
 G-&gt;child[ P == G-&gt;right ? RIGHT : LEFT ] = S;
 else
 T-&gt;root = S;
 return S; // new root of subtree

#define RotateDir(N,dir) RotateDirRoot(T,N,dir)
#define RotateLeft(N) RotateDirRoot(T,N,LEFT)
#define RotateRight(N) RotateDirRoot(T,N,RIGHT)


=== Notes to the sample code and diagrams of insertion and removal ===
The proposal breaks down both, insertion and removal (not mentioning some very simple cases), into six constellations of nodes, edges and colors, which are called cases. The proposal contains for both, insertion and removal, exactly one case that advances one black level closer to the root and loops, the other five cases rebalance the tree of their own. The more complicated cases are pictured in a diagram.

* symbolises a red node and a (non-NIL) black node (of black height ≥ 1), symbolises the color red or black of a non-NIL node, but the same color throughout the same diagram. NIL nodes are not represented in the diagrams.
* The variable N denotes the current node, which is labeled  N  or  N  in the diagrams.
* A diagram contains three columns and two to four actions. The left column shows the first iteration, the right column the higher iterations, the middle column shows the segmentation of a case into its different actions.
# The action &quot;entry&quot; shows the constellation of nodes with their colors which defines a case and mostly violates some of the requirements.A blue border rings the current node N and the other nodes are labeled according to their relation to N.
# If a rotation is considered useful, this is pictured in the next action, which is labeled &quot;rotation&quot;.
# If some recoloring is considered useful, this is pictured in the next action, which is labeled &quot;color&quot;.
# If there is still some need to repair, the cases make use of code of other cases and this after a reassignment of the current node N, which then again carries a blue ring and relative to which other nodes may have to be reassigned also. This action is labeled &quot;reassign&quot;.For both, insert and delete, there is (exactly) one case which iterates one black level closer to the root; then the reassigned constellation satisfies the respective loop invariant.
* A possibly numbered triangle with a black circle atop represents a red–black subtree (connected to its parent according to requirement 3) with a black height equal to the iteration level minus one, i.e. zero in the first iteration. Its root may be red or black.A possibly numbered triangle represents a red–black subtree with a black height one less, i.e. its parent has black height zero in the second iteration.
; Remark
: For simplicity, the sample code uses the disjunction:
:: codice_5
: and the conjunction:
:: codice_6
: Thereby, it must be kept in mind that both statements are &quot;not&quot; evaluated in total, if codice_7. Then in both cases codice_8 is not touched (see Short-circuit evaluation).(The comment codice_9 is in accordance with requirement 2.)
: The related codice_10-statements have to occur far less frequently if the proposal is realised.

=== Insertion ===
Insertion begins by placing the new (non-NIL) node, say N, at the position in the binary search tree of a NIL node whose in-order predecessor’s key compares less than the new node’s key, which in turn compares less than the key of its in-order successor.
(Frequently, this positioning is the result of a search within the tree immediately preceding the insert operation and consists of a node codice_11 together with a direction codice_12 with 
The newly inserted node is temporarily colored red so that all paths contain the same number of black nodes as before.
But if its parent, say P, is also red then this action introduces a red-violation.
void RBinsert1(
 RBtree* T, // -&gt; red–black tree
 struct RBnode* N, // -&gt; node to be inserted
 struct RBnode* P, // -&gt; parent node of N ( may be NULL )
 int dir) // side ( LEFT or RIGHT ) of P where to insert N
 struct RBnode* G; // -&gt; parent node of P
 struct RBnode* U; // -&gt; uncle of N

 N-&gt;color = RED;
 N-&gt;left = NIL;
 N-&gt;right = NIL;
 N-&gt;parent = P;
 if (P == NULL) { // There is no parent
 T-&gt;root = N; // N is the new root of the tree T.
 return; // insertion complete
 P-&gt;child[dir] = N; // insert N as dir-child of P
 // start of the (do while)-loop:
 do {
The rebalancing loop of the insert operation has the following invariant:
* The variable N, representing the current node N and initially the insertion node, is made the variable running through the loop.
* N is (red) at the beginning of each iteration.
* Requirement 3 is satisfied for all pairs node←parent with the possible exception N←P when P is also red (a red-violation at N).
* All other properties (including requirement 4) are satisfied throughout the tree.

* In the diagrams, P is used for N’s parent, G for its grandparent, and U for its uncle. In the table a — sign indicates root.
* The diagrams show the parent node P as the left child of its parent G even though it is possible for P to be on either side. The sample code covers both possibilities by means of the side variable codice_12.
* The diagrams show the cases where P is red also, the red-violation.
* The column &quot;x&quot; indicates the change in child direction, i.e. o (for &quot;outer&quot;) means that P and N are both left or both right children, whereas i (for &quot;inner&quot;) means that the child direction changes from P’s to N’s.
* The column group &quot;before&quot; defines the case, whose name is given in the column &quot;case&quot;. Thereby possible values in cells left empty are ignored. So in case I2 the sample code covers both possibilities of child directions of N, although the corresponding diagram shows only one.
* The rows in the synopsis are ordered such that the coverage of all possible RB cases is easily comprehensible.
* The column &quot;rotation&quot; indicates whether a rotation contributes to the rebalancing.
* The column &quot;assignment&quot; shows an assignment of N before entering a subsequent step. This possibly induces a reassignment of the other nodes P, G, U also.
* If something has been changed by the case, this is shown in the column group &quot;after&quot;.
* A ✓ sign in column &quot;next&quot; signifies that the rebalancing is complete with this step. If the column &quot;after&quot; determines exactly one case, this case is given as the subsequent one, otherwise there are question marks.
* The loop is contained in the sections &quot;Insert case I1&quot; and &quot;Insert case I2&quot;, where in case I2 the problem of rebalancing is escalated formula_15 tree levels or 1 black level higher in the tree, in that the grandfather G becomes the new current node N. So it takes maximally formula_16 steps of iteration to repair the tree (where formula_4 is the height of the tree). Because the probability of escalation decreases exponentially with each step the total rebalancing cost is constant on average, indeed amortized constant.
* From the body of the loop, case I1 exits by itself and there are exiting branches to cases I4, I6, I5 + I6, and I3.
* Rotations occur in cases I6 and I5 + I6 – outside the loop. Therefore, at most two rotations occur in total.

==== Insert case I1 ====
The current node’s parent P is black, so requirement 3 holds. Requirement 4 holds also according to the loop invariant.

 if (P-&gt;color == BLACK) {
 // Case_I1 (P black):
 return; // insertion complete
 // From now on P is red.
 if ((G = P-&gt;parent) == NULL) 
 goto Case_I4; // P red and root
 // else: P red and G!=NULL.
 dir = childDir(P); // the side of parent G on which node P is located
 U = G-&gt;child[1-dir]; // uncle
 if (U == NIL || U-&gt;color == BLACK) // considered black
 goto Case_I56; // P red &amp;&amp; U black
==== Insert case I2 ====


If both the parent P and the uncle U are red, then both of them can be repainted black and the grandparent G becomes red for maintaining requirement 4. Since any path through the parent or uncle must pass through the grandparent, the number of black nodes on these paths has not changed. However, the grandparent G may now violate requirement 3, if it has a red parent. After relabeling G to N the loop invariant is fulfilled so that the rebalancing can be iterated on one black level (= 2 tree levels) higher.

 // Case_I2 (P+U red):
 P-&gt;color = BLACK;
 U-&gt;color = BLACK;
 G-&gt;color = RED;
 N = G; // new current node
 // iterate 1 black level higher
 // (= 2 tree levels)
 } while ((P = N-&gt;parent) != NULL);
 // end of the (do while)-loop
==== Insert case I3 ====
Insert case I2 has been executed for formula_18 times and the total height of the tree has increased by 1, now being formula_19
The current node N is the (red) root of the tree, and all RB-properties are satisfied.

 // Leaving the (do while)-loop (after having fallen through from Case_I2).
 // Case_I3: N is the root and red.
 return; // insertion complete
==== Insert case I4 ====
The parent P is red and the root.
Because N is also red, requirement 3 is violated. But after switching P’s color the tree is in RB-shape.
The black height of the tree increases by 1.

Case_I4: // P is the root and red:
 P-&gt;color = BLACK;
 return; // insertion complete
==== Insert case I5 ====

The parent P is red but the uncle U is black. The ultimate goal is to rotate the parent node P to the grandparent position, but this will not work if N is an &quot;inner&quot; grandchild of G (i.e., if N is the left child of the right child of G or the right child of the left child of G). A at P switches the roles of the current node N and its parent P. The rotation adds paths through N (those in the subtree labeled 2, see diagram) and removes paths through P (those in the subtree labeled 4). But both P and N are red, so requirement 4 is preserved. Requirement 3 is restored in case 6.

Case_I56: // P red &amp;&amp; U black:
 if (N == P-&gt;child[1-dir])
 { // Case_I5 (P red &amp;&amp; U black &amp;&amp; N inner grandchild of G):
 RotateDir(P,dir); // P is never the root
 N = P; // new current node
 P = G-&gt;child[dir]; // new parent of N
 // fall through to Case_I6


==== Insert case I6 ====

The current node N is now certain to be an &quot;outer&quot; grandchild of G (left of left child or right of right child). Now at G, putting P in place of G and making P the parent of N and G. G is black and its former child P is red, since requirement 3 was violated. After switching the colors of P and G the resulting tree satisfies requirement 3. Requirement 4 also remains satisfied, since all paths that went through the black G now go through the black P.

 // Case_I6 (P red &amp;&amp; U black &amp;&amp; N outer grandchild of G):
 RotateDirRoot(T,G,1-dir); // G may be the root
 P-&gt;color = BLACK;
 G-&gt;color = RED;
 return; // insertion complete
} // end of RBinsert1
Because the algorithm transforms the input without using an auxiliary data structure and using only a small amount of extra storage space for auxiliary variables it is in-place.

=== Removal ===
==== Simple cases ====
- When the deleted node has 2 children (non-NIL), then we can swap its value with its in-order successor (the leftmost child of the right subtree), and then delete the successor instead. Since the successor is leftmost, it can only have a right child (non-NIL) or no child at all.

- When the deleted node has only 1 child (non-NIL). In this case, just replace the node with its child, and color it black.&lt;br&gt;
The single child (non-NIL) must be red according to conclusion 5, and the deleted node must be black according to requirement 3.

- When the deleted node has no children (both NIL) and is the root, replace it with NIL. The tree is empty.

- When the deleted node has no children (both NIL), and is red, simply remove the leaf node.

- When the deleted node has no children (both NIL), and is black, deleting it will create an imbalance, and requires a fixup, as covered in the next section.

==== Removal of a black non-root leaf ====
The complex case is when N is not the root, colored black and has no proper child (⇔ only NIL children).
In the first iteration, N is replaced by NIL.
void RBdelete2(
 RBtree* T, // -&gt; red–black tree
 struct RBnode* N) // -&gt; node to be deleted
 struct RBnode* P = N-&gt;parent; // -&gt; parent node of N
 byte dir; // side of P on which N is located (∈ { LEFT, RIGHT })
 struct RBnode* S; // -&gt; sibling of N
 struct RBnode* C; // -&gt; close nephew
 struct RBnode* D; // -&gt; distant nephew

 // P != NULL, since N is not the root.
 dir = childDir(N); // side of parent P on which the node N is located
 // Replace N at its parent P by NIL:
 P-&gt;child[dir] = NIL;
 goto Start_D; // jump into the loop

 // start of the (do while)-loop:
 do {
 dir = childDir(N); // side of parent P on which node N is located
Start_D:
 S = P-&gt;child[1-dir]; // sibling of N (has black height &gt;= 1)
 D = S-&gt;child[1-dir]; // distant nephew
 C = S-&gt;child[ dir]; // close nephew
 if (S-&gt;color == RED)
 goto Case_D3; // S red ===&gt; P+C+D black
 // S is black:
 if (D != NIL &amp;&amp; D-&gt;color == RED) // not considered black
 goto Case_D6; // D red &amp;&amp; S black
 if (C != NIL &amp;&amp; C-&gt;color == RED) // not considered black
 goto Case_D5; // C red &amp;&amp; S+D black
 // Here both nephews are == NIL (first iteration) or black (later).
 if (P-&gt;color == RED)
 goto Case_D4; // P red &amp;&amp; C+S+D black
The rebalancing loop of the delete operation has the following invariant:
* At the beginning of each iteration the black height of N equals the iteration number minus one, which means that in the first iteration it is zero and that N is a true black node in higher iterations.
* The number of black nodes on the paths through N is one less than before the deletion, whereas it is unchanged on all other paths, so that there is a black-violation at P if other paths exist.
* All other properties (including requirement 3) are satisfied throughout the tree.

==== Notes to the delete diagrams ====

* In the diagrams below, P is used for N’s parent, S for the sibling of N, C (meaning &quot;close&quot; nephew) for S’s child in the same direction as N, and D (meaning &quot;distant&quot; nephew) for S’s other child (S cannot be a NIL node in the first iteration, because it must have black height one, which was the black height of N before its deletion, but C and D may be NIL nodes).
* The diagrams show the current node N as the left child of its parent P even though it is possible for N to be on either side. The code samples cover both possibilities by means of the side variable codice_12.
* At the beginning (in the first iteration) of removal, N is the NIL node replacing the node to be deleted. Because its location in parent’s node is the only thing of importance, it is symbolised by (meaning: the current node N is a NIL node and left child) in the left column of the delete diagrams. As the operation proceeds also proper nodes (of black height ≥ 1) may become current (see e.g. case D2).
* By counting the black bullets ( and ) in a delete diagram it can be observed that the paths through N have one bullet less than the other paths. This means a black-violation at P—if it exists.
* The color constellation in column group &quot;before&quot; defines the case, whose name is given in the column &quot;case&quot;. Thereby possible values in cells left empty are ignored.
* The rows in the synopsis are ordered such that the coverage of all possible RB cases is easily comprehensible.
* The column &quot;rotation&quot; indicates whether a rotation contributes to the rebalancing.
* The column &quot;assignment&quot; shows an assignment of N before entering a subsequent iteration step. This possibly induces a reassignment of the other nodes P, C, S, D also.
* If something has been changed by the case, this is shown in the column group &quot;after&quot;.
* A ✓ sign in column &quot;next&quot; signifies that the rebalancing is complete with this step. If the column &quot;after&quot; determines exactly one case, this case is given as the subsequent one, otherwise there are question marks.
* The loop is contained in the sections from codice_15 through &quot;Delete case D2&quot;, where the problem of rebalancing is escalated formula_20 level higher in the tree in that the parent P becomes the new current node N. So it takes maximally formula_4 iterations to repair the tree (where formula_4 is the height of the tree). Because the probability of escalation decreases exponentially with each iteration the total rebalancing cost is constant on average, indeed amortized constant. (Just as an aside: Mehlhorn &amp; Sanders point out: &quot;AVL trees do &quot;not&quot; support constant amortized update costs.&quot; This is true for the rebalancing after a deletion, but not AVL insertion.)
* Out of the body of the loop there are exiting branches to the cases D3, D6, D5 + D6, D4, and D1; section &quot;Delete case D3&quot; of its own has three different exiting branches to the cases D6, D5 and D4.
* Rotations occur in cases D6 and D5 + D6 and D3 + D5 + D6 – all outside the loop. Therefore, at most three rotations occur in total.

==== Delete case D1 ====
The current node N is the new root. One black node has been removed from every path, so the RB-properties are preserved.
The black height of the tree decreases by 1.

 // Case_D1 (P == NULL):
 return; // deletion complete
==== Delete case D2 ====

P, S, and S’s children are black. After painting S red all paths passing through S, which are precisely those paths &quot;not&quot; passing through N, have one less black node. Now all paths in the subtree rooted by P have the same number of black nodes, but one fewer than the paths that do not pass through P, so requirement 4 may still be violated. After relabeling P to N the loop invariant is fulfilled so that the rebalancing can be iterated on one black level (= 1 tree level) higher.

 // Case_D2 (P+C+S+D black):
 S-&gt;color = RED;
 N = P; // new current node (maybe the root)
 // iterate 1 black level
 // (= 1 tree level) higher
 } while ((P = N-&gt;parent) != NULL);
 // end of the (do while)-loop
 // (with return;)
==== Delete case D3 ====

The sibling S is red, so P and the nephews C and D have to be black. A at P turns S into N’s grandparent.
Then after reversing the colors of P and S, the path through N is still short one black node. But N now has a red parent P and after the reassignment a black sibling S, so the transformations in cases D4, D5, or D6 are able to restore the RB-shape.

Case_D3: // S red &amp;&amp; P+C+D black:
 RotateDirRoot(T,P,dir); // P may be the root
 P-&gt;color = RED;
 S-&gt;color = BLACK;
 S = C; // != NIL
 // now: P red &amp;&amp; S black
 D = S-&gt;child[1-dir]; // distant nephew
 if (D != NIL &amp;&amp; D-&gt;color == RED)
 goto Case_D6; // D red &amp;&amp; S black
 C = S-&gt;child[ dir]; // close nephew
 if (C != NIL &amp;&amp; C-&gt;color == RED)
 goto Case_D5; // C red &amp;&amp; S+D black
 // Otherwise C+D considered black.
 // fall through to Case_D4
==== Delete case D4 ====

The sibling S and S’s children are black, but P is red. Exchanging the colors of S and P does not affect the number of black nodes on paths going through S, but it does add one to the number of black nodes on paths going through N, making up for the deleted black node on those paths.
Case_D4: // P red &amp;&amp; S+C+D black:
 S-&gt;color = RED;
 P-&gt;color = BLACK;
 return; // deletion complete
==== Delete case D5 ====

The sibling S is black, S’s close child C is red, and S’s distant child D is black. After a at S the nephew C becomes S’s parent and N’s new sibling. The colors of S and C are exchanged.
All paths still have the same number of black nodes, but now N has a black sibling whose distant child is red, so the constellation is fit for case D6. Neither N nor its parent P are affected by this transformation, and P may be red or black ( in the diagram).

Case_D5: // C red &amp;&amp; S+D black:
 RotateDir(S,1-dir); // S is never the root
 S-&gt;color = RED;
 C-&gt;color = BLACK;
 D = S;
 S = C;
 // now: D red &amp;&amp; S black
 // fall through to Case_D6
==== Delete case D6 ====

The sibling S is black, S’s distant child D is red. After a at P the sibling S becomes the parent of P and S’s distant child D. The colors of P and S are exchanged, and D is made black. The whole subtree still has the same color at its root S, namely either red or black ( in the diagram), which refers to the same color both before and after the transformation. This way requirement 3 is preserved. The paths in the subtree not passing through N (i.o.w. passing through D and node 3 in the diagram) pass through the same number of black nodes as before, but N now has one additional black ancestor: either P has become black, or it was black and S was added as a black grandparent. Thus, the paths passing through N pass through one additional black node, so that requirement 4 is restored and the total tree is in RB-shape.

Case_D6: // D red &amp;&amp; S black:
 RotateDirRoot(T,P,dir); // P may be the root
 S-&gt;color = P-&gt;color;
 P-&gt;color = BLACK;
 D-&gt;color = BLACK;
 return; // deletion complete
} // end of RBdelete2
Because the algorithm transforms the input without using an auxiliary data structure and using only a small amount of extra storage space for auxiliary variables it is in-place.

== Proof of bounds ==

For formula_23 there is a red–black tree of height formula_4 with
nodes (formula_25 is the floor function) and there is no red–black tree of this tree height with fewer nodes—therefore it is minimal.Its black height is   formula_26   (with black root) or for odd formula_4 (then with a red root) also   formula_28

;Proof
For a red–black tree of a certain height to have minimal number of nodes, it must have exactly one longest path with maximal number of red nodes, to achieve a maximal tree height with a minimal black height. Besides this path all other nodes have to be black. If a node is taken off this tree it either loses height or some RB property.

The RB tree of height formula_29 with red root is minimal. This is in agreement with
: formula_30

A minimal RB tree (RB&quot;h&quot; in figure 4) of height formula_31 has a root whose two child subtrees are of different height. The higher child subtree is also a minimal RB tree, containing also a longest path that defines its height it has formula_32 nodes and the black height formula_33 The other subtree is a perfect binary tree of (black) height formula_34 having formula_35 black nodes—and no red node. Then the number of nodes is by induction
The graph of the function formula_36 is convex and piecewise linear with breakpoints at formula_37 where formula_38 The function has been tabulated as formula_39 A027383(&quot;h&quot;–1) for formula_40 

;Solving the function for formula_4
The inequality formula_42 leads to formula_43, which for odd formula_4 leads to
: formula_45.
So in both, the even and the odd case, formula_4 is in the interval

with formula_47 being the number of nodes.

;Conclusion
A red–black tree with formula_2 nodes (keys) has tree height formula_49

== Set operations and bulk operations ==
In addition to the single-element insert, delete and lookup operations, several set operations have been defined on union, intersection and set difference. Then fast &quot;bulk&quot; operations on insertions or deletions can be implemented based on these set functions. These set operations rely on two helper operations, &quot;Split&quot; and &quot;Join&quot;. With the new operations, the implementation of red–black trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable. In order to achieve its time complexities this implementation requires that the root is allowed to be either red or black, and that every node stores its own black height.

* &quot;Join&quot;: The function &quot;Join&quot; is on two red–black trees and and a key , where , i.e. all keys in are less than , and all keys in are greater than . It returns a tree containing all elements in , also as .
: If the two trees have the same black height, &quot;Join&quot; simply creates a new node with left subtree , root and right subtree . If both and have black root, set to be red. Otherwise is set black. 
: If the black heights are unequal, suppose that has larger black height than (the other case is symmetric). &quot;Join&quot; follows the right spine of until a black node , which is balanced with . At this point a new node with left child , root (set to be red) and right child is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the red–black invariant because at most three red nodes can appear in a row. This can be fixed with a double rotation. If double red issue propagates to the root, the root is then set to be black, restoring the properties. The cost of this function is the difference of the black heights between the two input trees.

* &quot;Split&quot;: To split a red–black tree into two smaller trees, those smaller than key , and those larger than key , first draw a path from the root by inserting into the red–black tree. After this insertion, all values less than will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than will be found on the right. By applying &quot;Join&quot;, all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is symmetric.
: For some applications, &quot;Split&quot; also returns a boolean value denoting if appears in the tree. The cost of &quot;Split&quot; is formula_50 order of the height of the tree. This algorithm actually has nothing to do with any special properties of a red–black tree, and may be used on any tree with a &quot;join&quot; operation, such as an AVL tree.

The join algorithm is as follows:

 function joinRightRB(TL, k, TR):
 if (TL.color=black) and (TL.blackHeight=TR.blackHeight):
 return Node(TL,⟨k,red⟩,TR)
 T&#x27;=Node(TL.left,⟨TL.key,TL.color⟩,joinRightRB(TL.right,k,TR))
 if (TL.color=black) and (T&#x27;.right.color=T&#x27;.right.right.color=red):
 T&#x27;.right.right.color=black;
 return rotateLeft(T&#x27;)
 return T&#x27; /* T[recte T&#x27;] */
 function joinLeftRB(TL, k, TR):
 /* symmetric to joinRightRB */
 function join(TL, k, TR):
 if TL.blackHeight&gt;TR.blackHeight:
 T&#x27;=joinRightRB(TL,k,TR)
 if (T&#x27;.color=red) and (T&#x27;.right.color=red):
 T&#x27;.color=black
 return T&#x27;
 if TR.blackHeight&gt;TL.blackHeight:
 /* symmetric */
 if (TL.color=black) and (TR.color=black):
 return Node(TL,⟨k,red⟩,TR)
 return Node(TL,⟨k,black⟩,TR)

The split algorithm is as follows:

 function split(T, k):
 if (T = nil) return (nil, false, nil)
 if (k = T.key) return (T.left, true, T.right)
 if (k &lt; T.key):
 (L&#x27;,b,R&#x27;) = split(T.left, k)
 return (L&#x27;,b,join(R&#x27;,T.key,T.right))
 (L&#x27;,b,R&#x27;) = split(T.right, k)
 return (join(T.left,T.key,L&#x27;),b,T.right)

The union of two red–black trees and representing sets and , is a red–black tree that represents . The following recursive function computes this union:

 function union(t1, t2):
 if t1 = nil return t2
 if t2 = nil return t1
 (L1,b,R1)=split(t1,t2.key)
 proc1=start:
 TL=union(L1,t2.left)
 proc2=start:
 TR=union(R1,t2.right)
 wait all proc1,proc2
 return join(TL, t2.key, TR)

Here, &quot;split&quot; is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key, one holding the greater keys. (The algorithm is non-destructive, but an in-place destructive version exists also.)

The algorithm for intersection or difference is similar, but requires the &quot;Join2&quot; helper routine that is the same as &quot;Join&quot; but without the middle key. Based on the new functions for union, intersection or difference, either one key or multiple keys can be inserted to or deleted from the red–black tree. Since &quot;Split&quot; calls &quot;Join&quot; but does not deal with the balancing criteria of red–black trees directly, such an implementation is usually called the &quot;join-based&quot; implementation.

The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is formula_51 for two red–black trees of sizes formula_11 and formula_53. This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed in parallel with a parallel depth formula_54. When formula_55, the join-based implementation has the same computational directed acyclic graph (DAG) as single-element insertion and deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree.

== Parallel algorithms ==
Parallel algorithms for constructing red–black trees from sorted lists of items can run in constant time or formula_56 time, depending on the computer model, if the number of processors available is asymptotically proportional to the number formula_2 of items where formula_58. Fast search, insertion, and deletion parallel algorithms are also known.

The join-based algorithms for red–black trees are parallel for bulk operations, including union, intersection, construction, filter, map-reduce, and so on.

=== Parallel bulk operations ===
Basic operations like insertion, removal or update can be parallelised by defining operations that process bulks of multiple elements. It is also possible to process bulks with several basic operations, for example bulks may contain elements to insert and also elements to remove from the tree.

The algorithms for bulk operations aren&#x27;t just applicable to the red–black tree, but can be adapted to other sorted sequence data structures also, like the 2–3 tree, 2–3–4 tree and (a,b)-tree. In the following different algorithms for bulk insert will be explained, but the same algorithms can also be applied to removal and update. Bulk insert is an operation that inserts each element of a sequence formula_59 into a tree formula_60.

==== Join-based ====
This approach can be applied to every sorted sequence data structure that supports efficient join- and split-operations.
The general idea is to split formula_59 and formula_60 in multiple parts and perform the insertions on these parts in parallel.

# First the bulk formula_59 of elements to insert must be sorted.
# After that, the algorithm splits formula_59 into formula_65 parts formula_66 of about equal sizes.
# Next the tree formula_60 must be split into formula_68 parts formula_69 in a way, so that for every formula_70 following constraints hold:
##formula_71
## formula_72
# Now the algorithm inserts each element of formula_73 into formula_74 sequentially. This step must be performed for every formula_75, which can be done by up to formula_68 processors in parallel.
# Finally, the resulting trees will be joined to form the final result of the entire operation.

Note that in Step 3 the constraints for splitting formula_59 assure that in Step 5 the trees can be joined again and the resulting sequence is sorted.
The pseudo code shows a simple divide-and-conquer implementation of the join-based algorithm for bulk-insert.
Both recursive calls can be executed in parallel.
The join operation used here differs from the version explained in this article, instead join2 is used, which misses the second parameter k.

 bulkInsert(T, I, k):
 I.sort()
 bulklInsertRec(T, I, k)
 bulkInsertRec(T, I, k):
 if k = 1:
 forall e in I: T.insert(e)
 else
 m := ⌊size(I) / 2⌋
 (T1, _, T2) := split(T, I[m])
 bulkInsertRec(T1, I[0 .. m], ⌈k / 2⌉)
 || bulkInsertRec(T2, I[m + 1 .. size(I) - 1], ⌊k / 2⌋)
 T ← join2(T1, T2)

===== Execution time =====
Sorting formula_59 is not considered in this analysis.

This can be improved by using parallel algorithms for splitting and joining.
In this case the execution time is formula_79.

===== Work =====
==== Pipelining ====
Another method of parallelizing bulk operations is to use a pipelining approach.
This can be done by breaking the task of processing a basic operation up into a sequence of subtasks.
For multiple basic operations the subtasks can be processed in parallel by assigning each subtask to a separate processor.

# First the bulk formula_59 of elements to insert must be sorted.
# For each element in formula_59 the algorithm locates the according insertion position in formula_60. This can be done in parallel for each element formula_83 since formula_60 won&#x27;t be mutated in this process. Now formula_59 must be divided into subsequences formula_86 according to the insertion position of each element. For example formula_87 is the subsequence of formula_59 that contains the elements whose insertion position would be to the left of node formula_2.
# The middle element formula_90 of every subsequence formula_91 will be inserted into formula_60 as a new node formula_93. This can be done in parallel for each formula_90 since by definition the insertion position of each formula_90 is unique. If formula_91 contains elements to the left or to the right of formula_90, those will be contained in a new set of subsequences formula_86 as formula_99 or formula_100.
# Now formula_60 possibly contains up to two consecutive red nodes at the end of the paths form the root to the leaves, which needs to be repaired. Note that, while repairing, the insertion position of elements formula_102 have to be updated, if the corresponding nodes are affected by rotations.If two nodes have different nearest black ancestors, they can be repaired in parallel. Since at most four nodes can have the same nearest black ancestor, the nodes at the lowest level can be repaired in a constant number of parallel steps.This step will be applied successively to the black levels above until formula_60 is fully repaired.
# The steps 3 to 5 will be repeated on the new subsequences until formula_86 is empty. At this point every element formula_83 has been inserted. Each application of these steps is called a &quot;stage&quot;. Since the length of the subsequences in formula_86 is formula_107 and in every stage the subsequences are being cut in half, the number of stages is formula_108.Since all stages move up the black levels of the tree, they can be parallelised in a pipeline. Once a stage has finished processing one black level, the next stage is able to move up and continue at that level.
===== Execution time =====
Sorting formula_59 is not considered in this analysis.
Also, formula_110 is assumed to be smaller than formula_111, otherwise it would be more efficient to construct the resulting tree from scratch.

<doc id="26400" wikidata="Q517361" url="?curid=26400" title="Retroactive continuity">
<text>Retroactive continuity, or retcon for short, is a literary device in which facts in the world of a fictional work that have been established through the narrative itself are adjusted, ignored, supplemented, or contradicted by a subsequently published work that recontextualizes or breaks continuity with the former.

There are various motivations for applying retroactive continuity, including:
* To accommodate desired aspects of sequels or derivative works which would otherwise be ruled out.
* To respond to negative fan reception of previous stories.
* To correct and overcome errors or problems identified in the prior work since its publication.
* To change or clarify how the prior work should be interpreted.
* To match reality, when assumptions or projections of the future are later proven wrong.

Retcons are used by authors to increase their creative freedom, on the assumption that the changes are unimportant to the audience compared to the new story which can be told. Retcons can be diegetic or nondiegetic. For instance, by using time travel or parallel universes, an author may diegetically reintroduce a popular character they had previously killed off. More subtle and nondiegetic methods would be ignoring or expunging minor plot points to remove narrative elements the author doesn&#x27;t have interest in writing.

Retcons are common in pulp fiction, and especially in comic books by long-established publishers such as DC and Marvel. The long history of popular titles and the number of writers who contribute stories can often create situations that demand clarification or revision. Retcons also appear in manga, soap operas, serial dramas, movie sequels, cartoons, professional wrestling angles, video games, radio series, role-playing games, and other forms of serial fiction.

==Origins==
An early published use of the phrase &quot;retroactive continuity&quot; is found in theologian E. Frank Tupper&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;The Theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg&quot;: &quot;Pannenberg&#x27;s conception of retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past, that the future is not basically a product of the past.&quot;

A printed use of &quot;retroactive continuity&quot; referring to the altering of history in a fictional work is in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #18 (February 1983) from DC Comics. The series was set on DC&#x27;s Earth-Two, an alternate universe in which Golden Age comic characters age in real time. &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; was set during World War II on Earth-Two; as it was in the past of an alternate universe, all its events had repercussions on the contemporary continuity of the DC multiverse. Each issue changed the history of the fictional world in which it was set. In the letters column, a reader remarked that the comic &quot;must make you [the creators] feel at times as if you&#x27;re painting yourself into a corner&quot;, and, &quot;Your matching of Golden Age comics history with new plotlines has been an artistic (and I hope financial!) success.&quot; Writer Roy Thomas responded, &quot;we like to think that an enthusiastic ALL-STAR booster at one of Adam Malin&#x27;s Creation Conventions in San Diego came up with the best name for it a few months back: &#x27;Retroactive Continuity&#x27;. Has kind of a ring to it, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;

==Types==

===Alteration===
Retcons sometimes add information that seemingly contradicts previous information. This frequently takes the form of a character who was shown to have died but is later revealed to have somehow survived. This is a common practice in horror films, which may end with the death of a monster that goes on to appear in one or more sequels. The technique is so common in superhero comics that the term &quot;comic book death&quot; has been coined for it.

An early example of this type of retcon is the return of Sherlock Holmes, whom writer Arthur Conan Doyle apparently killed off in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in 1893, only to bring him back, in large part because of readers&#x27; responses, with &quot;The Empty House&quot; in 1903.

The character Zorro was retconned early in his existence. In the original 1919 novel, &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot;, Zorro ends his adventures by revealing his identity, a plot point that was carried over to the 1920 film adaptation &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;. In order to have further stories starring Zorro, author Johnston McCulley kept all the elements of his original story, but retroactively ignored its ending.

One notable example is Isaac Asimov’s 1950 fixup novel &quot;I, Robot&quot;, a collection of science fiction short stories originally published in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; and &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; from 1940 to 1950. Compiled into a single publication by Gnome Press in 1950, the collection features a framing sequence in which the stories are told to a reporter by Dr. Susan Calvin, chief robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc. Changes necessary to fit the new version included the name of the company (originally the Finmark Robot Corporation), new, earlier references to the Three Laws of Robotics, and new interpolated scenes featuring Dr. Calvin herself.

The TV series &quot;Dallas&quot; annulled its entire ninth season as just the dream of one of its characters, Pam Ewing. Writers did this to offer a supposedly plausible reason for the major character of Bobby Ewing, who had died onscreen at the end of season eight, to be still alive when actor Patrick Duffy wanted to return to the series. This season is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Dream Season&quot; and was referred to humorously in later TV series such as &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;Community&quot; as a &quot;gas-leak year&quot;. Other series such as &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, and &quot;Roseanne&quot; employed the same technique.

===Subtraction===
Unpopular stories are sometimes later ignored by publishers, and effectively erased from a series&#x27; continuity. Later stories may contradict the previous ones or explicitly establish that they never happened.

A notable example of subtractive retconning is the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series. After &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; faced criticism for abruptly killing off characters such as Cyclops and Jean Grey, its sequel, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past,&quot; features the character Wolverine traveling back in time to 1973 to prevent an assassination that, if carried out, would lead to mutant extinction. The result of this is a new timeline where Jean and Cyclops never died.

==Related concepts==
Retroactive continuity is similar to, but not the same as, plot inconsistencies introduced accidentally or through lack of concern for continuity; retconning, by comparison, is done deliberately. For example, the ongoing continuity contradictions on episodic TV series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (in which the timeline of the family&#x27;s history must be continually shifted forward to explain why they are not getting any older) reflects intentionally lost continuity, not genuine retcons. However, in series with generally tight continuity, retcons are sometimes created after the fact to explain continuity errors. Such was the case in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, where Wilma Flintstone was mistakenly given two separate maiden names over the course of the series: &quot;Pebble&quot; and &quot;Slaghoople&quot;.

Though the term &quot;retcon&quot; did not yet exist when George Orwell wrote &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the totalitarian regime depicted in that book is involved in a constant, large-scale retconning of past records. For example, when it is suddenly announced that &quot;Oceania was not after all in war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia and Eurasia was an ally&quot; (Part Two, Ch. 9), there is an immediate intensive effort to change &quot;all reports and records, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks and photographs&quot; and make them all record a war with Eastasia rather than one with Eurasia. &quot;Often it was enough to merely substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.&quot; See historical revisionism (negationism).

<text>Rosół () is a traditional Polish soup based primarily on meat broth. Its most popular variety is the &quot;rosół z kury&quot;, or clear chicken soup. It is commonly served with capellini pasta (polish &quot;makaron nitki&quot;). A vegetarian version can be made, substituting meat with oil or butter.

It is one of the most popular Polish soups, served during family dinners and a traditional soup for weddings; it is also a traditional cold remedy. In the past it was a dish made of salted meat (an old conservation method) cooked in water to make it more edible. Later on, fresh meat was used instead. Over time the dish evolved to that of cooked meat in a soup that is commonly known today.

The name &quot;rosół&quot; derives from an Old Polish &quot;rozsół&quot; and &quot;rozsol&quot;, which is description of desalting conserved meat (polish &quot;sól&quot; meaning salt).

There are many types of &quot;rosół&quot;, as:
&quot;Rosół Królewski&quot; (Royal rosół), made of three meats: beef or veal, white poultry (hen, turkey or chicken) and dark poultry as duck, goose (crop only), just a couple of dried king boletes, one single cabbage leaf and a variety of vegetables such as parsley, celery, carrot, and leek. The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling over a small fire. At the end, softly burnt onion is added to the soup.

&quot;Rosół myśliwski&quot; (the hunter&#x27;s rosół) is made of a variety of wild birds as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse, or grey partridge, with a small addition of roe deer meat, a couple of wild mushrooms, and 2–3 juniper fruits. Instead of wild poultry, helmeted guinea fowl can also be used.

The most important thing about making &quot;rosół&quot; is that there can be no addition of pork, since that would no longer make the broth clear. It cannot be boiled too quickly for the same reason.
