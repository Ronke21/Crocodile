It is mostly targeted towards adults (and sometimes families). It is used by the major television networks to broadcast their season&#x27;s nightly programming. The term &quot;prime-time&quot; is often defined in terms of a fixed time period—for example (in the United States), from 8:00p.m. to 11:00p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) or 7:00p.m. to 10:00p.m. (Central and Mountain Time). In India and some Middle Eastern countries, prime time consists of programmes that are aired on television between 8:00p.m. and 10:00p.m. local time.

The two biggest private broadcasters set the start of prime-time programming at 20:20 (Markíza) and 20:30 (TV JOJ). Generally, however, prime time is considered to be from 20:00 to 23:00.

===Slovenia===

===Spain===
In Spain, prime time refers to the time period in which the most-watched shows are broadcast. Prime time in Spain starts quite late when compared to most nations as it runs from 22:30 till 01:00. Most news programmes in Spain air at 21:00 for an hour and prime time follows. However, due to fierce competition, especially among the private stations prime time has even been delayed until 23:00. Most channels are delaying prime time in order to protect their top shows from sporting events.

In the 1990s, prime time in Spain began at 21:00, moving to 21:30 in the latter half of the 1990s and 22:00 in the early 2000s. Commercial broadcaster LaSexta and the second channel from the Public broadcasting La 2 have attempted to shift prime time back to 21:30 in 2006 and Spring 2007, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. Fellow public channel La 1 also tried to pull prime time back to 21:00 in early 2015, to no avail.

The lateness in the start of prime time in Spain is also due to Spanish culture. Spanish people generally work from 09:00–14:00 and then from 17:00–20:00 as opposed to the 09:00–17:00 which is common in other countries. The popular late-night show &quot;Crónicas marcianas&quot; during the late 1990s–2000 also helped to extend prime time well into the early hours with the show being watched by a share of 40%, despite finishing at 02:00.

Spain might also be unique in that it has a second prime time, running from 14:30–17:00 which coincides with the extended Spanish lunch break. Shows airing in the secondary prime time period on many occasions beat those prime-time shows at night on a daily basis. The second prime time occurs only on weekdays, though and the slot is usually filled with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, news, soap operas and talk shows.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, prime time starts at 20:00. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:30 and local news at 19:50.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, prime time () runs from 18:30 to 21:30 on working days and from 15:00 to 01:00 on holidays.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, prime time (also known as peak time) runs from 19:00 to 23:00.

==North America==

In North America, television networks feed their prime-time programming in two blocks: one for the Eastern and Central time zones, and the other, on a three-hour tape delay, for the Pacific Time Zone, to their local network affiliates. In Atlantic Canada (including Newfoundland and Labrador), as well as Alaska and Hawaii, there is no change in the interpretation or usage of &quot;prime time&quot;, as the concept is not attached to time zones in any way. Affiliates in the Mountain, Alaskan, and Hawaiian zones are either on their own to delay broadcast by an hour or two, or collectively form a small, regional network feed with others in the same time zone.

Prime time is commonly defined as 8:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific and 7:00–10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain. On Sundays, the major broadcast television networks traditionally begin their primetime programming at 7:00 p.m. (Eastern/Pacific, 6:00 p.m. Central/Mountain). Some networks, such as Fox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV broadcast only from 8:00–10:00 p.m., a time period known as &quot;common prime&quot;. Most networks air primetime programming nightly, but the smaller MyNetworkTV has programmed only on weekday evenings since its 2009 retreat towards a programming service. The CW returned to Sunday broadcasting in 2019, then added Saturday for the first time in 2021. In Canada, CTV and Global both follow the same model as the larger U.S. networks (although both may occasionally air programming in the 7:00 p.m. hour in the event of scheduling conflicts with other U.S. imports), while CBC Television, Citytv, and CTV 2 schedule prime-time programs only within the common prime period (with the 10:00p.m. hour dedicated to syndicated programming on Citytv and CTV 2, and CBC airing its news program &quot;The National&quot;). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has alternatively defined prime time as ranging from 6 pm to 11 pm to 7 pm to 11 pm.

Since the early 2000s, the major networks have come to consider Saturday prime time as a graveyard slot and have largely abandoned scheduling of new scripted programming on that night. The major networks still maintain a prime-time programming schedule on Saturdays, with a mix of live sporting events (most commonly college football in the United States and ice hockey in Canada), encores of programs aired earlier in the week, films, non-scripted reality programs, true crime programs produced by their news divisions, and, occasionally, burning off episodes of low-rated or cancelled series.

Prime time can be extended or truncated if coverage of sporting events run past their allotted end time. Since the &quot;Heidi Game&quot; incident in 1968, in which NBC cut away from coverage of a New York Jets/Oakland Raiders football game on the east coast in order to show a movie (and, in the process, causing viewers to miss an unexpected comeback by the Raiders to win the game), the present-day National Football League mandates that all games be broadcast in their entirety in the markets of the teams involved. Due to this rule, game telecasts may sometimes overrun into the 7:00 p.m. ET hour. Fox previously scheduled repeats of its animated series in the 7:00 hour, allowing themselves to simply pre-empt the reruns if a game ran long. This was later replaced by a half-hour-long wrap-up show, &quot;The OT&quot;. In contrast, CBS does not, as its weekly newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; has traditionally aired as close to 7:00 p.m. ET as possible. Even if a game runs past that hour, CBS shows &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in its entirety after the conclusion of coverage, and the rest of the prime-time schedule on the East Coast is shifted to compensate. For example, if game coverage were to end at 7:30 p.m., prime time would end at 11:30 p.m.

However, in the rare case where the NFL game runs excessively late (8p.m. or later), the series scheduled to air at 10p.m. is preempted, with the West Coast and eastern markets airing only an early afternoon game usually receiving a repeat of the 10p.m. series instead. In an extreme case, CBS&#x27;s prime time can be extended past midnight during broadcasts of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. This does not necessarily apply universally; in 2001, after an XFL game went into double overtime, causing a 45-minute delay of a highly promoted episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, NBC made a decision to cut off all future XFL broadcasts at 11:00 p.m. ET. Since the launch of NBCSN, NBC has occasionally invoked this curfew by moving sports overruns to that channel if necessary.

Until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulated time slots prior to prime time with the now-defunct Prime Time Access Rule in the 1971–1972 season, networks began programming at 7:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific/6:30 p.m. Central and Mountain on weeknights. The change helped instigate what is colloquially known as the &quot;rural purge&quot;—a long-term trend away from programs appealing to older and rural audiences in favor of programs catering towards younger, &quot;urban&quot; viewers. As a result, the prime access hour became a lucrative timeslot for syndicated programming in the years that followed, with game shows and variety shows, as well as syndicated reruns, becoming popular.

The vast majority of prime-time programming in English-speaking North America comes from the United States, with only a limited amount produced in Canada. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission mandates quotas for Canadian content in prime time; these quotas indicate at least half of Canadian prime-time programs must be Canadian in origin, but the majority of this is served by national and local news or localized entertainment gossip shows such as Global Television Network&#x27;s &quot;Entertainment Tonight Canada&quot; and CTV Television Network&#x27;s &quot;ETalk&quot;.

Likewise, the vast majority of Spanish-language programming in North America comes from Mexico. Televisa, a Mexican network, provides the majority of programming to the dominant U.S.-based Spanish broadcaster, Univision. Univision does produce a fairly large amount of unscripted Spanish-language programming, the best known having been the long-running variety show &quot;Sábado Gigante&quot;, hosted and created by Chilean national Don Francisco. Univision&#x27;s distant second-place competitor, Telemundo, produces a much greater share of in-house content, including a long line of telenovelas.

In Quebec, the largest Francophone area of North America, French-language programming consists of originally produced programs (most of which are produced in Montreal, with a few produced in Quebec City) and a few French-language dubs of English language programs. On all of the Quebec networks, entertainment programming is scheduled only between 8 and 10p.m., with the 10–11p.m. hour given over to a network newscast or a nightly talk show.

===United States===
Prime time is the daypart (a block of a day&#x27;s programming schedule) with the most viewers and is generally where television networks and local stations reap much of their advertising revenues. In recent years, television advertising expenditure in the US has been highest during prime-time drama shows.

The Nielsen ratings system is explicitly designed for the optimum measurement of audience viewership by dayparts, with prime time being of most interest. Television viewership is, in general, highest on weekday evenings, as most Americans are at work during daytime, asleep during the overnights, and out taking part in social events on weekends; thus, television has its highest audience at times when people are unlikely to be away from home.

Prime time for radio is called drive time and, in Eastern and Pacific Time, is 6–10a.m. and 3–7p.m. and, for Mountain and Central Time, is 5–9a.m. and 2–6p.m. The difference between peak radio listenership and television viewership times is due to the fact that people listen to their radios most often while driving to and from work (hence the name &quot;drive time&quot;).

A survey by Nielsen revealed that viewers watched almost two hours&#x27; worth of TV during prime time.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, central time normally starts at 7:30 p.m. and periodically ends at 10:30 p.m. The main networks, such as Las Estrellas, Azteca Uno, and Imagen Televisión, broadcast telenovelas produced by themselves or productions acquired from other countries such as Turkey and Brazil, among others.

==South America==
In many Latin American countries, prime time (known in most countries as &quot;horario central&quot; or &quot;Central Time&quot;, &quot;horario estelar&quot; (&quot;Stellar Time&quot;) or &quot;horário nobre&quot; (&quot;noble time&quot;) in Brazil) is considered to be from Monday to Friday from 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. The time slot is usually used for news, telenovelas and television shows, and special time slots are used for reality television, with great popularity, especially in Mexico and Brazil. In Brazil, the three most famous telenovelas in the country are shown each weekday and on Saturdays on prime time. There are also news programs, reality shows, and sitcoms.

===Argentina===
In Argentina, prime time is considered to be from 8:00p.m. until 12:00a.m., including the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as &quot;Los Roldán&quot; and &quot;Valientes&quot;) and entertainment shows, like CQC (Caiga Quien Caiga) or Showmatch (Showmatch).

===Chile===
In Chile, prime time is considered to be from 10:30p.m. until 1:00a.m., including the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as &quot;Socias&quot; and &quot;Las Vega&#x27;s&quot;). Investigation entertainment shows (like &quot;Informe Especial&quot;, &quot;Contacto&quot;, and &quot;Apuesto por ti&quot;) also air.

=== Paraguay ===
In Paraguay, prime time occurs between 19:00 and 23:00. Usually, programmes during prime time are newscasts and entertainment shows.

<text>The Pelton wheel or Pelton Turbine is an impulse-type water turbine invented by American inventor Lester Allan Pelton in the 1870s. The Pelton wheel extracts energy from the impulse of moving water, as opposed to water&#x27;s dead weight like the traditional overshot water wheel. Many earlier variations of impulse turbines existed, but they were less efficient than Pelton&#x27;s design. Water leaving those wheels typically still had high speed, carrying away much of the dynamic energy brought to the wheels. Pelton&#x27;s paddle geometry was designed so that when the rim ran at half the speed of the water jet, the water left the wheel with very little speed; thus his design extracted almost all of the water&#x27;s impulse energywhich made for a very efficient turbine.

== History ==
Lester Allan Pelton was born in Vermillion, Ohio in 1829. In 1850, he traveled overland to take part in the California Gold Rush. Pelton worked by selling fish he caught in the Sacramento River. In 1860, he moved to Camptonville, a center of placer mining activity. At this time many mining operations were powered by steam engines which consumed vast amounts of wood as their fuel. Some water wheels were used in the larger rivers, but they were ineffective in the smaller streams that were found near the mines. Pelton worked on a design for a water wheel that would work with the relatively small flow found in these streams.

By the mid 1870s, Pelton had developed a wooden prototype of his new wheel. In 1876, he approached the Miners Foundry in Nevada City, California to build the first commercial models in iron. The first Pelton Wheel was installed at the Mayflower Mine in Nevada City in 1878. The efficiency advantages of Pelton&#x27;s invention were quickly recognized and his product was soon in high demand. He patented his invention on 26 October 1880. By the mid-1880s, the Miners Foundry could not meet the demand, and in 1888, Pelton sold the rights to his name and the patents to his invention to the Pelton Water Wheel Company in San Francisco. The company established a factory at 121/123 Main Street in San Francisco.

The Pelton Water Wheel Company manufactured a large number of Pelton Wheels in San Francisco which were shipped around the world. In 1892, the Company added a branch on the east coast at 143 Liberty Street in New York City. By 1900, over 11,000 turbines were in use. In 1914, the company moved manufacturing to new, larger premises at 612 Alabama Street in San Francisco. In 1956, the company was acquired by the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Company, which company ended manufacture of Pelton Wheels.

In New Zealand, A &amp; G Price in Thames, New Zealand produced Pelton waterwheels for the local market. One of these is on outdoor display at the Thames Goldmine Experience.

== Design ==

Nozzles direct forceful, high-speed streams of water against a series of spoon-shaped buckets, also known as impulse blades, which are mounted around the outer rim of a drive wheel (also called a &quot;runner&quot;). As the water jet hits the blades, the direction of water velocity is changed to follow the contours of the blades. The impulse energy of the water jet exerts torque on the bucket-and-wheel system, spinning the wheel; the water jet does a &quot;u-turn&quot; and exits at the outer sides of the bucket, decelerated to a low velocity. In the process, the water jet&#x27;s momentum is transferred to the wheel and hence to a turbine. Thus, &quot;impulse&quot; energy does work on the turbine.

Maximum power and efficiency are achieved when the velocity of the water jet is twice the velocity of the rotating buckets, which, assuming that water jet collides elastically with the bucket, would mean the water leaves the bucket with zero velocity, thus imparting all kinetic energy to the wheel. In practice, a very small percentage of the water jet&#x27;s original kinetic energy will remain in the water, which causes the bucket to be emptied at the same rate it is filled, and thereby allows the high-pressure input flow to continue uninterrupted and without waste of energy.

Typically two buckets are mounted side-by-side on the wheel, with the water jet split into two equal streams; this balances the side-load forces on the wheel and helps to ensure smooth, efficient transfer of momentum from the water jet to the turbine wheel.

Because water is nearly incompressible, almost all of the available energy is extracted in the first stage of the hydraulic turbine. &quot;Therefore, Pelton wheels have only one turbine stage, unlike gas turbines that operate with compressible fluid.&quot;

== Applications ==
Pelton wheels are the preferred turbine for hydro-power where the available water source has relatively high hydraulic head at low flow rates. Pelton wheels are made in all sizes. There exist multi-ton Pelton wheels mounted on vertical oil pad bearings in hydroelectric plants. The largest units – the Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station at the Grande Dixence Dam complex in Switzerland – are over 400 megawatts.

The smallest Pelton wheels are only a few inches across, and can be used to tap power from mountain streams having flows of a few gallons per minute. Some of these systems use household plumbing fixtures for water delivery. These small units are recommended for use with or more of head, in order to generate significant power levels. Depending on water flow and design, Pelton wheels operate best with heads from , although there is no theoretical limit. Such &quot;peltric sets&quot;, consisting of a Pelton wheel, an induction generator and a control mechanism, are used in Nepal.

== Design rules ==

The specific speed formula_1 parameter is independent of a particular turbine&#x27;s size.

Compared to other turbine designs, the relatively low specific speed of the Pelton wheel implies that the geometry is inherently a &quot;low gear&quot; design. Thus it is most suitable to being fed by a hydro source with a low ratio of flow to pressure (meaning relatively low flow and/or relatively high pressure).

The specific speed is the main criterion for matching a specific hydro-electric site with the optimal turbine type. It also allows a new turbine design to be scaled from an existing design of known performance.

formula_2 (dimensionless parameter), 

where:
* formula_3 = Frequency of rotation (rpm)
* formula_4 = Power (W)
* formula_5 = Water head (m)
* formula_6 = Density (kg/m3)

The formula implies that the Pelton turbine is &quot;geared&quot; most suitably for applications with relatively high hydraulic head &quot;H&quot;, due to the 5/4 exponent being greater than unity, and given the characteristically low specific speed of the Pelton.

== Turbine physics and derivation ==

=== Energy and initial jet velocity ===

In the ideal (frictionless) case, all of the hydraulic potential energy (&quot;E&quot;&quot;p&quot; = &quot;mgh&quot;) is converted into kinetic energy (&quot;E&quot;&quot;k&quot; = &quot;mv&quot;2/2) (see Bernoulli&#x27;s principle). Equating these two equations and solving for the initial jet velocity (&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;) indicates that the theoretical (maximum) jet velocity is &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; = . For simplicity, assume that all of the velocity vectors are parallel to each other. Defining the velocity of the wheel runner as: (&quot;u&quot;), then as the jet approaches the runner, the initial jet velocity relative to the runner is: (&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;u&quot;).
The initial velocity of jet is &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;

=== Final jet velocity ===

Assuming that the jet velocity is higher than the runner velocity, if the water is not to become backed-up in runner, then due to conservation of mass, the mass entering the runner must equal the mass leaving the runner. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible (an accurate assumption for most liquids). Also, it is assumed that the cross-sectional area of the jet is constant. The fluid impacts the runner, slowing down and transferring momentum from the jet to the wheel. Assuming no loses, the fluid leaving the runner&#x27;s velocity is reduced by the velocity difference between the jet and the runner. The jet &quot;speed&quot; remains constant relative to the runner. So as the jet recedes from the runner, the jet velocity relative to the runner is: − (&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;u&quot;) = −&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;u&quot;. Note the minus sign indicates the reduction in stream velocity from impacting the runner. With the assumption that jet velocity is higher than runner velocity, the result is a &quot;rebound&quot; resulting in the jet flowing away from the runner. In the standard reference frame (relative to the earth), the final velocity is then: &quot;V&quot;&quot;f&quot; = (−&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; + u) + &quot;u&quot; = −&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 2&quot;u&quot;.

The value &quot;V&quot;&quot;f&quot; is bounded by two cases: a stationary runner and a runner moving at the velocity of the stream, &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;. For the stationary runner case, the stream velocity is -Vf, indicating the fluid fully reversed direction. In this case the force on the wheel is the highest (due to the largest possible velocity change), but power delivered is zero, since there is no movement. For the case where the runner is moving at the speed of the stream, the velocity of the wheel is the highest, but power delivered is also zero, since there is no torque or force imparted on the wheel (due to no change is stream velocity). 
=== Optimal wheel speed ===

The ideal runner speed will cause all of the kinetic energy in the jet to be transferred to the wheel. In this case the final jet velocity must be zero. If −&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 2&quot;u&quot; = 0, then the optimal runner speed will be &quot;u&quot; = &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; /2, or half the initial jet velocity.

=== Torque ===

By Newton&#x27;s second and third laws, the force &quot;F&quot; imposed by the jet on the runner is equal but opposite to the rate of momentum change of the fluid, so
: &quot;F&quot; = −&quot;m&quot;(&quot;V&quot;f − &quot;V&quot;i)/&quot;t&quot; = −&quot;ρQ&quot;[(−&quot;V&quot;i + 2&quot;u&quot;) − &quot;V&quot;i] = −&quot;ρQ&quot;(−2&quot;V&quot;i + 2&quot;u&quot;) = 2&quot;ρQ&quot;(&quot;V&quot;i − &quot;u&quot;),
where &quot;ρ&quot; is the density, and &quot;Q&quot; is the volume rate of flow of fluid. If &quot;D&quot; is the wheel diameter, the torque on the runner is.
: &quot;T&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;D&quot;/2) = &quot;ρQD&quot;(&quot;V&quot;i − &quot;u&quot;).
The torque is maximal when the runner is stopped (i.e. when &quot;u&quot; = 0, &quot;T&quot; = &quot;ρQDV&quot;i). When the speed of the runner is equal to the initial jet velocity, the torque is zero (i.e., when &quot;u&quot; = &quot;V&quot;i, then &quot;T&quot; = 0). On a plot of torque versus runner speed, the torque curve is straight between these two points: (0, &quot;pQDV&quot;i) and (&quot;V&quot;i, 0).
Nozzle efficiency is the ratio of the jet power to the waterpower at the base of the nozzle.

=== Power ===

The power &quot;P&quot; = &quot;Fu&quot; = &quot;Tω&quot;, where &quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity of the wheel. Substituting for &quot;F&quot;, we have &quot;P&quot; = 2&quot;ρQ&quot;(&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;u&quot;)&quot;u&quot;. To find the runner speed at maximum power, take the derivative of &quot;P&quot; with respect to &quot;u&quot; and set it equal to zero, [&quot;dP&quot;/&quot;du&quot; = 2&quot;ρQ&quot;(&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; − 2&quot;u&quot;)]. Maximum power occurs when &quot;u&quot; = &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; /2. &quot;P&quot;max = &quot;ρQV&quot;&quot;i&quot;2/2. Substituting the initial jet power &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; = , this simplifies to &quot;P&quot;max = &quot;ρghQ&quot;. This quantity exactly equals the kinetic power of the jet, so in this ideal case, the efficiency is 100%, since all the energy in the jet is converted to shaft output.

=== Efficiency ===

A wheel power divided by the initial jet power, is the turbine efficiency, &quot;η&quot; = 4&quot;u&quot;(&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;u&quot;)/&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;2. It is zero for &quot;u&quot; = 0 and for &quot;u&quot; = &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;. As the equations indicate, when a real Pelton wheel is working close to maximum efficiency, the fluid flows off the wheel with very little residual velocity. In theory, the energy efficiency varies only with the efficiency of the nozzle and wheel, and does not vary with hydraulic head.
The term &quot;efficiency&quot; can refer to: Hydraulic, Mechanical, Volumetric, Wheel, or overall efficiency.

== System components ==
The conduit bringing high-pressure water to the impulse wheel is called the penstock. Originally the penstock was the name of the valve, but the term has been extended to include all of the fluid supply hydraulics. Penstock is now used as a general term for a water passage and control that is under pressure, whether it supplies an impulse turbine or not.

<doc id="24975" wikidata="Q183759" url="?curid=24975" title="Piezoelectricity">
<text>Piezoelectricity (, ) is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials—such as crystals, certain ceramics, and biological matter such as bone, DNA, and various proteins—in response to applied mechanical stress. The word &quot;piezoelectricity&quot; means electricity resulting from pressure and latent heat. It is derived (an ancient source of static electricity). The German form of the word (&quot;Piezoelektricität&quot;) was coined in 1881 by the German physicist Wilhelm Gottlieb Hankel; the English word was coined in 1883.

The piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process: materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect, the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electric field. For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field is applied. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasound waves.

French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie discovered piezoelectricity in 1880. The piezoelectric effect has been exploited in many useful applications, including the production and detection of sound, piezoelectric inkjet printing, generation of high voltage electricity, as a clock generator in electronic devices, in microbalances, to drive an ultrasonic nozzle, and in ultrafine focusing of optical assemblies. It forms the basis for scanning probe microscopes that resolve images at the scale of atoms. It is used in the pickups of some electronically amplified guitars and as triggers in most modern electronic drums. The piezoelectric effect also finds everyday uses, such as generating sparks to ignite gas cooking and heating devices, torches, and cigarette lighters.

==History==
===Discovery and early research===
The pyroelectric effect, by which a material generates an electric potential in response to a temperature change, was studied by Carl Linnaeus and Franz Aepinus in the mid-18th century. Drawing on this knowledge, both René Just Haüy and Antoine César Becquerel posited a relationship between mechanical stress and electric charge; however, experiments by both proved inconclusive.
The first demonstration of the direct piezoelectric effect was in 1880 by the brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie. They combined their knowledge of pyroelectricity with their understanding of the underlying crystal structures that gave rise to pyroelectricity to predict crystal behavior, and demonstrated the effect using crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate). Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.

The Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed the existence of the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.

For the next few decades, piezoelectricity remained something of a laboratory curiosity, though it was a vital tool in the discovery of polonium and radium by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1898. More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited piezoelectricity. This culminated in 1910 with the publication of Woldemar Voigt&#x27;s &quot;Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik&quot; (&quot;Textbook on Crystal Physics&quot;), which described the 20 natural crystal classes capable of piezoelectricity, and rigorously defined the piezoelectric constants using tensor analysis.

===World War I and inter-war years===
The first practical application for piezoelectric devices was sonar, first developed during World War I. The superior performance of piezoelectric devices, operating at ultrasonic frequencies, superseded the earlier Fessenden oscillator. In France in 1917, Paul Langevin and his coworkers developed an ultrasonic submarine detector. The detector consisted of a transducer, made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a hydrophone to detect the returned echo. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.

Piezoelectric devices found homes in many fields. Ceramic phonograph cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.

===World War II and post-war===
During World War II, independent research groups in the United States, USSR, and Japan discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called ferroelectrics, which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop barium titanate and later lead zirconate titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.

One significant example of the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the &quot;AT cut&quot; crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide range of temperatures. Lack&#x27;s crystal did not need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on the aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.

Development of piezoelectric devices and materials in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and in the interests of securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed—quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited piezoelectric material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan&#x27;s did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States&#x27; piezoelectric industry suffered.

In contrast, Japanese manufacturers shared their information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut was developed by Issac Koga. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the piezoelectric igniter, which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed for quite some time but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several car models as an echolocation device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.

==Mechanism==

The nature of the piezoelectric effect is closely related to the occurrence of electric dipole moments in solids. The latter may either be induced for ions on crystal lattice sites with asymmetric charge surroundings (as in BaTiO3 and PZTs) or may directly be carried by molecular groups (as in cane sugar). The dipole density or polarization (dimensionality [C·m/m3] ) may easily be calculated for crystals by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic unit cell. As every dipole is a vector, the dipole density P is a vector field. Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of &quot;poling&quot; (not the same as magnetic poling), a process by which a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.

Of decisive importance for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either be caused by a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1 cm3 cube of quartz with 2 kN (500 lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.

Piezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, called the converse piezoelectric effect, where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.

===Mathematical description===
Linear piezoelectricity is the combined effect of
* The linear electrical behavior of the material:
:: formula_1 formula_2
: where D is the electric flux density (electric displacement), ε is the permittivity (free-body dielectric constant), E is the electric field strength, and formula_3 , formula_4.
* Hooke&#x27;s law for linear elastic materials:
::formula_5
: where S is the linearized strain, s is compliance under short-circuit conditions, T is stress, and
::formula_6
: where u is the &quot;displacement vector&quot;.

These may be combined into so-called &quot;coupled equations&quot;, of which the strain-charge form is:
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the piezoelectric tensor and the superscript t stands for its transpose. Due to the symmetry of formula_8, formula_10.

In matrix form,
:formula_11
where [&quot;d&quot;] is the matrix for the direct piezoelectric effect and [&quot;d&quot;] is the matrix for the converse piezoelectric effect. The superscript &quot;E&quot; indicates a zero, or constant, electric field; the superscript &quot;T&quot; indicates a zero, or constant, stress field; and the superscript t stands for transposition of a matrix.

Notice that the third order tensor formula_8 maps vectors into symmetric matrices. There are no non-trivial rotation-invariant tensors that have this property, which is why there are no isotropic piezoelectric materials.

The strain-charge for a material of the 4mm (C4v) crystal class (such as a poled piezoelectric ceramic such as tetragonal PZT or BaTiO3) as well as the 6mm crystal class may also be written as (ANSI IEEE 176):
:formula_13
where the first equation represents the relationship for the converse piezoelectric effect and the latter for the direct piezoelectric effect.

Although the above equations are the most used form in literature, some comments about the notation are necessary. Generally, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are vectors, that is, Cartesian tensors of rank 1; and permittivity &quot;ε&quot; is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 tensors. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11 → 1; 22 → 2; 33 → 3; 23 → 4; 13 → 5; 12 → 6. (Different conventions may be used by different authors in literature. For example, some use 12 → 4; 23 → 5; 31 → 6 instead.) That is why &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; appear to have the &quot;vector form&quot; of six components. Consequently, &quot;s&quot; appears to be a 6-by-6 matrix instead of a rank-3 tensor. Such a relabeled notation is often called Voigt notation. Whether the shear strain components &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;5, &quot;S&quot;6 are tensor components or engineering strains is another question. In the equation above, they must be engineering strains for the 6,6 coefficient of the compliance matrix to be written as shown, i.e., 2(&quot;s&quot; − &quot;s&quot;). Engineering shear strains are double the value of the corresponding tensor shear, such as &quot;S&quot;6 = 2&quot;S&quot;12 and so on. This also means that &quot;s&quot;66 = , where &quot;G&quot;12 is the shear modulus.

In total, there are four piezoelectric coefficients, &quot;dij&quot;, &quot;eij&quot;, &quot;gij&quot;, and &quot;hij&quot; defined as follows:

:formula_14
where the first set of four terms corresponds to the direct piezoelectric effect and the second set of four terms corresponds to the converse piezoelectric effect. The equality between the direct piezoelectric tensor and the transpose of the converse piezoelectric tensor originates from the Maxwell relations of thermodynamics. For those piezoelectric crystals for which the polarization is of the crystal-field induced type, a formalism has been worked out that allows for the calculation of piezoelectrical coefficients &quot;dij&quot; from electrostatic lattice constants or higher-order Madelung constants.

==Crystal classes==

Of the 32 crystal classes, 21 are non-centrosymmetric (not having a centre of symmetry), and of these, 20 exhibit direct piezoelectricity (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of these represent the polar crystal classes, which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress due to a non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell, and which exhibit pyroelectricity. If the dipole moment can be reversed by applying an external electric field, the material is said to be ferroelectric.
* The 10 polar (pyroelectric) crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, , 3, 3m, 6, .
* The other 10 piezoelectric crystal classes: 222, , 422, 2m, 32, , 622, 2m, 23, 3m.

For polar crystals, for which P ≠ 0 holds without applying a mechanical load, the piezoelectric effect manifests itself by changing the magnitude or the direction of P or both.

For the nonpolar but piezoelectric crystals, on the other hand, a polarization P different from zero is only elicited by applying a mechanical load. For them the stress can be imagined to transform the material from a nonpolar crystal class (P = 0) to a polar one, having P ≠ 0.

==Materials==

Many materials exhibit piezoelectricity.
===Crystalline materials===
* Langasite (La3Ga5SiO14) – a quartz-analogous crystal
* Gallium orthophosphate (GaPO4) – a quartz-analogous crystal
* Lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
* Lithium tantalate (LiTaO3)
* Quartz
* Berlinite (AlPO4) – a rare phosphate mineral that is structurally identical to quartz
* Rochelle salt
* Topaz – piezoelectricity in topaz can probably be attributed to ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties, which are attributed to such ordering.
* Tourmaline-group minerals
* Lead titanate (PbTiO3) – although it occurs in nature as mineral macedonite, it is synthesized for research and applications.

===Ceramics===

Ceramics with randomly oriented grains must be ferroelectric to exhibit piezoelectricity. The occurrence of abnormal grain growth (AGG) in sintered polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics has detrimental effects on the piezoelectric performance in such systems and should be avoided, as the microstructure in piezoceramics exhibiting AGG tends to consist of few abnormally large elongated grains in a matrix of randomly oriented finer grains. Macroscopic piezoelectricity is possible in textured polycrystalline non-ferroelectric piezoelectric materials, such as AlN and ZnO.
The families of ceramics with perovskite, tungsten-bronze, and related structures exhibit piezoelectricity:
* Lead zirconate titanate ( with 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ 1) – more commonly known as PZT, the most common piezoelectric ceramic in use today.
* Potassium niobate (KNbO3)
* Sodium tungstate (Na2WO3)
* Ba2NaNb5O5
* Pb2KNb5O15
* Zinc oxide (ZnO) – Wurtzite structure. While single crystals of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, polycrystalline ZnO cannot be poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and polycrystalline thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity only if they are textured (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in polycrystalline thin films.

===Lead-free piezoceramics===
* Sodium potassium niobate ((K,Na)NbO3). This material is also known as NKN or KNN. In 2004, a group of Japanese researchers led by Yasuyoshi Saito discovered a sodium potassium niobate composition with properties close to those of PZT, including a high &quot;T&quot;C. Certain compositions of this material have been shown to retain a high mechanical quality factor (&quot;Q&quot;m ≈ 900) with increasing vibration levels, whereas the mechanical quality factor of hard PZT degrades in such conditions. This fact makes NKN a promising replacement for high power resonance applications, such as piezoelectric transformers.
* Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3)  – a promising candidate for the replacement of lead-based ceramics.
* Sodium niobate (NaNbO3)
* Barium titanate (BaTiO3) – Barium titanate was the first piezoelectric ceramic discovered.
* Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12)
* Sodium bismuth titanate (NaBi(TiO3)2)
The fabrication of lead-free piezoceramics pose multiple challenges, from an environmental standpoint and their ability to replicate the properties of their lead-based counterparts. By removing the lead component of the piezoceramic, the risk of toxicity to humans decreases, but the mining and extraction of the materials can be harmful to the environment. Analysis of the environmental profile of PZT versus sodium potassium niobate (NKN or KNN) shows that across the four indicators considered (primary energy consumption, toxicological footprint, eco-indicator 99, and input-output upstream greenhouse gas emissions), KNN is actually more harmful to the environment. Most of the concerns with KNN, specifically its Nb2O5 component, are in the early phase of its life cycle before it reaches manufacturers. Since the harmful impacts are focused on these early phases, some actions can be taken to minimize the effects. Returning the land as close to its original form after Nb2O5 mining via dam deconstruction or replacing a stockpile of utilizable soil are known aids for any extraction event. For minimizing air quality effects, modeling and simulation still needs to occur to fully understand what mitigation methods are required. The extraction of lead-free piezoceramic components has not grown to a significant scale at this time, but from early analysis, experts encourage caution when it comes to environmental effects.

Fabricating lead-free piezoceramics faces the challenge of maintaining the performance and stability of their lead-based counterparts. In general, the main fabrication challenge is creating the &quot;morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs)&quot; that provide the materials with their stable piezoelectric properties without introducing the &quot;polymorphic phase boundaries (PPBs)&quot; that decrease the temperature stability of the material. New phase boundaries are created by varying additive concentrations so that the phase transition temperatures converge at room temperature. The introduction of the MPB improves piezoelectric properties, but if a PPB is introduced, the material becomes negatively affected by temperature. Research is ongoing to control the type of phase boundaries that are introduced through phase engineering, diffusing phase transitions, domain engineering, and chemical modification.

===III–V and II–VI semiconductors===
A piezoelectric potential can be created in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied stress and strain. This property is common to both the zincblende and wurtzite crystal structures. To first order, there is only one independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain. In wurtzite, there are instead three independent piezoelectric coefficients: &quot;e&quot;31, &quot;e&quot;33 and &quot;e&quot;15.
The semiconductors where the strongest piezoelectricity is observed are those commonly found in the wurtzite structure, i.e. GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO (see piezotronics).

Since 2006, there have also been a number of reports of strong non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors.
Such effects are generally recognized to be at least important if not of the same order of magnitude as the first order approximation.

===Polymers===

The piezo-response of polymers is not as high as the response for ceramics; however, polymers hold properties that ceramics do not. Over the last few decades, non-toxic, piezoelectric polymers have been studied and applied due to their flexibility and smaller acoustical impedance. Other properties that make these materials significant include their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low cost, and low power consumption compared to other piezo-materials (ceramics, etc.). Piezoelectric polymers and non-toxic polymer composites can be used given their different physical properties.

Piezoelectric polymers can be classified by bulk polymers, voided charged polymers (&quot;piezoelectrets&quot;), and polymer composites. A piezo-response observed by bulk polymers is mostly due to its molecular structure. There are two types of bulk polymers: amorphous and semi-crystalline. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its copolymers, polyamides, and parylene-C. Non-crystalline polymers, such as polyimide and polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), fall under amorphous bulk polymers. Voided charged polymers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to charge induced by poling of a porous polymeric film. Under an electric field, charges form on the surface of the voids forming dipoles. Electric responses can be caused by any deformation of these voids. The piezoelectric effect can also be observed in polymer composites by integrating piezoelectric ceramic particles into a polymer film. A polymer does not have to be piezo-active to be an effective material for a polymer composite. In this case, a material could be made up of an inert matrix with a separate piezo-active component.

PVDF exhibits piezoelectricity several times greater than quartz. The piezo-response observed from PVDF is about 20–30 pC/N. That is an order of 5–50 times less than that of piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT). The thermal stability of the piezoelectric effect of polymers in the PVDF family (i.e. vinylidene fluoride co-poly trifluoroethylene) goes up to 125 °C. Some applications of PVDF are pressure sensors, hydrophones, and shock wave sensors.

Due to their flexibility, piezoelectric composites have been proposed as energy harvesters and nanogenerators. In 2018, it was reported by Zhu et al. that a piezoelectric response of about 17 pC/N could be obtained from PDMS/PZT nanocomposite at 60% porosity. Another PDMS nanocomposite was reported in 2017, in which BaTiO3 was integrated into PDMS to make a stretchable, transparent nanogenerator for self-powered physiological monitoring. In 2016, polar molecules were introduced into a polyurethane foam in which high responses of up to 244 pC/N were reported.

===Other materials===
Most materials exhibit at least weak piezoelectric responses. Trivial examples include sucrose (table sugar), DNA, viral proteins, including those from bacteriophage. An actuator based on wood fibers, called cellulose fibers, has been reported. D33 responses for cellular polypropylene are around 200 pC/N. Some applications of cellular polypropylene are musical key pads, microphones, and ultrasound-based echolocation systems. Recently, single amino acid such as β-glycine also displayed high piezoelectric (178 pmV−1) as compared to other biological materials.

Ionic liquids were recently identified as the first piezoelectric liquid.

==Application==
===High voltage and power sources===

Direct piezoelectricity of some substances, like quartz, can generate potential differences of thousands of volts.
* The best-known application is the electric cigarette lighter: pressing the button causes a spring-loaded hammer to hit a piezoelectric crystal, producing a sufficiently high-voltage electric current that flows across a small spark gap, thus heating and igniting the gas. The portable sparkers used to ignite gas stoves work the same way, and many types of gas burners now have built-in piezo-based ignition systems.
* A similar idea is being researched by DARPA in the United States in a project called energy harvesting, which includes an attempt to power battlefield equipment by piezoelectric generators embedded in soldiers&#x27; boots. However, these energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. DARPA&#x27;s effort to harness 1–2 watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes. Other energy harvesting ideas include Crowd Farm, harvesting the energy from human movements in train stations or other public places and converting a dance floor to generate electricity. Vibrations from industrial machinery can also be harvested by piezoelectric materials to charge batteries for backup supplies or to power low-power microprocessors and wireless radios.
* A piezoelectric transformer is a type of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike a conventional transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100 kilohertz to 1 megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers are some of the most compact high voltage sources.

===Sensors===


The principle of operation of a piezoelectric sensor is that a physical dimension, transformed into a force, acts on two opposing faces of the sensing element. Depending on the design of a sensor, different &quot;modes&quot; to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.

Detection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric microphones (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric pickups for acoustic-electric guitars. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a contact microphone.

Piezoelectric sensors especially are used with high frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial nondestructive testing (NDT).

For many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator—often the term &quot;transducer&quot; is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.

In addition to those mentioned above, various sensor and transducer applications include:
* Piezoelectric elements are also used in the detection and generation of sonar waves.
* Piezoelectric materials are used in single-axis and dual-axis tilt sensing.
* Power monitoring in high power applications (e.g. medical treatment, sonochemistry and industrial processing).
* Piezoelectric microbalances are used as very sensitive chemical and biological sensors.
* Piezoelectrics are sometimes used in strain gauges. More commonly however, a Piezoresistive effect element is used. 
* A piezoelectric transducer was used in the penetrometer instrument on the Huygens Probe.
* Piezoelectric transducers are used in electronic drum pads to detect the impact of the drummer&#x27;s sticks, and to detect muscle movements in medical acceleromyography.
* Automotive engine management systems use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), also known as detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.
* Ultrasonic piezo sensors are used in the detection of acoustic emissions in acoustic emission testing.
* Piezoelectric transducers can be used in transit-time ultrasonic flow meters.

===Actuators===

As very high electric fields correspond to only tiny changes in the width of the crystal, this width can be changed with better-than-μm precision, making piezo crystals the most important tool for positioning objects with extreme accuracy—thus their use in actuators.
Multilayer ceramics, using layers thinner than , allow reaching high electric fields with voltage lower than . These ceramics are used within two kinds of actuators: direct piezo actuators and amplified piezoelectric actuators. While direct actuator&#x27;s stroke is generally lower than , amplified piezo actuators can reach millimeter strokes.
* Loudspeakers: Voltage is converted to mechanical movement of a metallic diaphragm.
* Ultrasonic cleaning usually uses piezoelectric elements to produce intense sound waves in liquid.
* Piezoelectric motors: Piezoelectric elements apply a directional force to an axle, causing it to rotate. Due to the extremely small distances involved, the piezo motor is viewed as a high-precision replacement for the stepper motor.
* Piezoelectric elements can be used in laser mirror alignment, where their ability to move a large mass (the mirror mount) over microscopic distances is exploited to electronically align some laser mirrors. By precisely controlling the distance between mirrors, the laser electronics can accurately maintain optical conditions inside the laser cavity to optimize the beam output.
* A related application is the acousto-optic modulator, a device that scatters light off soundwaves in a crystal, generated by piezoelectric elements. This is useful for fine-tuning a laser&#x27;s frequency.
* Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes employ converse piezoelectricity to keep the sensing needle close to the specimen.
* Inkjet printers: On many inkjet printers, piezoelectric crystals are used to drive the ejection of ink from the inkjet print head towards the paper.
* Diesel engines: High-performance common rail diesel engines use piezoelectric fuel injectors, first developed by Robert Bosch GmbH, instead of the more common solenoid valve devices.
* Active vibration control using amplified actuators.
* X-ray shutters.
* XY stages for micro scanning used in infrared cameras.
* Moving the patient precisely inside active CT and MRI scanners where the strong radiation or magnetism precludes electric motors.
* Crystal earpieces are sometimes used in old or low power radios.
* High-intensity focused ultrasound for localized heating or creating a localized cavitation can be achieved, for example, in patient&#x27;s body or in an industrial chemical process.
* Refreshable braille display. A small crystal is expanded by applying a current that moves a lever to raise individual braille cells.
* Piezoelectric actuator. A single crystal or a number of crystals are expanded by applying a voltage for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.
* Piezoelectric actuators are used for fine servo positioning in hard disc drives.

===Frequency standard===
The piezoelectrical properties of quartz are useful as a standard of frequency.
* Quartz clocks employ a crystal oscillator made from a quartz crystal that uses a combination of both direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any elastic material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to oscillate, and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.
* The same principle is used in some radio transmitters and receivers, and in computers where it creates a clock pulse. Both of these usually use a frequency multiplier to reach gigahertz ranges.

===Piezoelectric motors===
Types of piezoelectric motor include:
* The ultrasonic motor used for auto-focus in reflex cameras
* Inchworm motors for linear motion
* Rectangular four-quadrant motors with high power density (2.5 W/cm3) and speed ranging from 10 nm/s to 800 mm/s.
* Stepping piezo motor, using stick-slip effect.

Aside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.

A stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.

===Reduction of vibrations and noise===

Different teams of researchers have been investigating ways to reduce vibrations in materials by attaching piezo elements to the material. When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. Further applications to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.

In a demonstration at the Material Vision Fair in Frankfurt in November 2005, a team from TU Darmstadt in Germany showed several panels that were hit with a rubber mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.

Piezoelectric ceramic fiber technology is being used as an electronic damping system on some HEAD tennis rackets.

All piezo transducers have a fundamental resonant frequency and many harmonic frequencies. Piezo driven Drop-On-Demand fluid systems are sensitive to extra vibrations in the piezo structure that must be reduced or eliminated. One inkjet company, Howtek, Inc solved this problem by replacing glass(rigid) inkjet nozzles with Tefzel (soft) inkjet nozzles. This novel idea popularized single nozzle inkjets and they are now used in 3D Inkjet printers that run for years if kept clean inside and not overheated (Tefzel creeps under pressure at very high temperatures)

===Infertility treatment===
In people with previous total fertilization failure, piezoelectric activation of oocytes together with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) seems to improve fertilization outcomes.

===Surgery===
Piezosurgery is a minimally invasive technique that aims to cut a target tissue with little damage to neighboring tissues. For example, Hoigne &quot;et al.&quot; uses frequencies in the range 25–29 kHz, causing microvibrations of 60–210 μm. It has the ability to cut mineralized tissue without cutting neurovascular tissue and other soft tissue, thereby maintaining a blood-free operating area, better visibility and greater precision.

===Impact Energy Absorption and Smart Sensing Devices===
Recent advancements in piezoelectric materials have led to the development of multifunctional composites that integrate mechanical protection with sensing capabilities.
One notable innovation involves the growth of Rochelle salt (RS) crystals within 3D-printed, bioinspired structures. Researchers have used cuttlefish bone as a model for designing porous frameworks, which provide high stiffness and impact absorption due to their chambered microstructure. By growing RS crystals within these structures, the resulting composite achieves enhanced piezoelectric properties while maintaining significant mechanical strength.

These RS-based composites demonstrate remarkable impact energy absorption and real-time sensing capabilities. Under cyclic impacts, they maintain stable piezoelectric output for thousands of cycles, with peak output voltages reaching approximately 8 V and a measured piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of around 30 pC/N. Such performance enables the detection of both the magnitude and location of impacts, making the material suitable for applications in wearable protective gear, including smart armor for athletes and fall detection devices for elderly individuals.

A distinguishing feature of these composites is their sustainability and recyclability. Rochelle salt crystals can be dissolved and regrown within the structure, allowing damaged materials to be repaired. Recycled samples retain up to 95% of their original performance, significantly extending the material&#x27;s lifespan and promoting eco-friendly usage.
Applications extend beyond sports and medical devices, with potential use in aerospace, military armor, and structural health monitoring systems. These advancements highlight the evolving versatility of piezoelectric materials in modern technology.

===Potential applications===
In 2015, Cambridge University researchers working in conjunction with researchers from the National Physical Laboratory and Cambridge-based dielectric antenna company Antenova Ltd, using thin films of piezoelectric materials found that at a certain frequency, these materials become not only efficient resonators, but efficient radiators as well, meaning that they can potentially be used as antennas. The researchers found that by subjecting the piezoelectric thin films to an asymmetric excitation, the symmetry of the system is similarly broken, resulting in a corresponding symmetry breaking of the electric field, and the generation of electromagnetic radiation.

Several attempts at the macro-scale application of the piezoelectric technology have emerged to harvest kinetic energy from walking pedestrians.

In this case, locating high traffic areas is critical for optimization of the energy harvesting efficiency, as well as the orientation of the tile pavement significantly affects the total amount of the harvested energy. A density flow evaluation is recommended to qualitatively evaluate the piezoelectric power harvesting potential of the considered area based on the number of pedestrian crossings per unit time. In X. Li&#x27;s study, the potential application of a commercial piezoelectric energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the piezoelectric tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with piezoelectric tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1 MWh/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building. In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is enough to power street lights, billboards, and signs.

Tire company Goodyear has plans to develop an electricity generating tire which has piezoelectric material lined inside it. As the tire moves, it deforms and thus electricity is generated.

The efficiency of a hybrid photovoltaic cell that contains piezoelectric materials can be increased simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10 kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field set up by the vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.

<text>In mathematics, a product is the result of multiplication, or an expression that identifies objects (numbers or variables) to be multiplied, called &quot;factors&quot;. For example, 21 is the product of 3 and 7 (the result of multiplication), and formula_1 is the product of formula_2 and formula_3 (indicating that the two factors should be multiplied together).
When one factor is an integer, the product is called a &quot;multiple&quot;.

The order in which real or complex numbers are multiplied has no bearing on the product; this is known as the &quot;commutative law&quot; of multiplication. When matrices or members of various other associative algebras are multiplied, the product usually depends on the order of the factors. Matrix multiplication, for example, is non-commutative, and so is multiplication in other algebras in general as well.

There are many different kinds of products in mathematics: besides being able to multiply just numbers, polynomials or matrices, one can also define products on many different algebraic structures.

==Product of two numbers==
Originally, a product was and is still the result of the multiplication of two or more numbers. For example, is the product of and . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every composite number is a product of prime numbers, that is unique up to the order of the factors.

With the introduction of mathematical notation and variables at the end of the 15th century, it became common to consider the multiplication of numbers that are either unspecified (coefficients and parameters), or to be found (unknowns). These multiplications that cannot be effectively performed are called &quot;products&quot;. For example, in the linear equation formula_4 the term formula_5 denotes the &quot;product&quot; of the coefficient formula_6 and the unknown formula_7

Later and essentially from the 19th century on, new binary operations have been introduced, which do not involve numbers at all, and have been called &quot;products&quot;; for example, the dot product. Most of this article is devoted to such non-numerical products.

==Product of a sequence==

The product operator for the product of a sequence is denoted by the capital Greek letter pi Π (in analogy to the use of the capital Sigma Σ as summation symbol). For example, the expression formula_8 is another way of writing .

The product of a sequence consisting of only one number is just that number itself; the product of no factors at all is known as the empty product, and is equal to 1.

==Commutative rings==
Commutative rings have a product operation.

===Residue classes of integers===

Residue classes in the rings formula_9 can be added:

:formula_10

and multiplied:

:formula_11

===Convolution===

Two functions from the reals to itself can be multiplied in another way, called the convolution.

If
:formula_12

then the integral

:formula_13

is well defined and is called the convolution.

Under the Fourier transform, convolution becomes point-wise function multiplication.

===Polynomial rings===

The product of two polynomials is given by the following:
:formula_14

with

:formula_15

==Products in linear algebra==
There are many different kinds of products in linear algebra. Some of these have confusingly similar names (outer product, exterior product) with very different meanings, while others have very different names (outer product, tensor product, Kronecker product) and yet convey essentially the same idea. A brief overview of these is given in the following sections.

===Scalar multiplication===

By the very definition of a vector space, one can form the product of any scalar with any vector, giving a map formula_16.

===Scalar product===

A scalar product is a bi-linear map:

:formula_17

with the following conditions, that formula_18 for all formula_19.

From the scalar product, one can define a norm by letting formula_20.

The scalar product also allows one to define an angle between two vectors:

:formula_21

In formula_22-dimensional Euclidean space, the standard scalar product (called the dot product) is given by:

:formula_23

===Cross product in 3-dimensional space===

The cross product of two vectors in 3-dimensions is a vector perpendicular to the two factors, with length equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two factors.

The cross product can also be expressed as the formal determinant:
:formula_24

===Composition of linear mappings===

A linear mapping can be defined as a function &quot;f&quot; between two vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; with underlying field F, satisfying
:formula_25

If one only considers finite dimensional vector spaces, then
:formula_26
in which bV and bW denote the bases of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;vi&quot; denotes the component of v on bV&quot;i&quot;, and Einstein summation convention is applied.

Now we consider the composition of two linear mappings between finite dimensional vector spaces. Let the linear mapping &quot;f&quot; map &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot;, and let the linear mapping &quot;g&quot; map &quot;W&quot; to &quot;U&quot;. Then one can get
:formula_27

Or in matrix form:
:formula_28
in which the &quot;i&quot;-row, &quot;j&quot;-column element of F, denoted by &quot;Fij&quot;, is &quot;fji&quot;, and &quot;Gij=gji&quot;.

The composition of more than two linear mappings can be similarly represented by a chain of matrix multiplication.

===Product of two matrices===
Given two matrices

:formula_29 and formula_30

their product is given by

:formula_31

===Composition of linear functions as matrix product===
There is a relationship between the composition of linear functions and the product of two matrices. To see this, let r = dim(U), s = dim(V) and t = dim(W) be the (finite) dimensions of vector spaces U, V and W. Let 
formula_32 be a basis of U, 
formula_33 be a basis of V and 
formula_34 be a basis of W. In terms of this basis, let
formula_35
be the matrix representing f : U → V and 
formula_36 
be the matrix representing g : V → W. Then

:formula_37

is the matrix representing formula_38.

In other words: the matrix product is the description in coordinates of the composition of linear functions.

===Tensor product of vector spaces===
Given two finite dimensional vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, the tensor product of them can be defined as a (2,0)-tensor satisfying:
:formula_39
where &quot;V*&quot; and &quot;W*&quot; denote the dual spaces of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;.

For infinite-dimensional vector spaces, one also has the:
* Tensor product of Hilbert spaces
* Topological tensor product.

The tensor product, outer product and Kronecker product all convey the same general idea. The differences between these are that the Kronecker product is just a tensor product of matrices, with respect to a previously-fixed basis, whereas the tensor product is usually given in its intrinsic definition. The outer product is simply the Kronecker product, limited to vectors (instead of matrices).

===The class of all objects with a tensor product===
In general, whenever one has two mathematical objects that can be combined in a way that behaves like a linear algebra tensor product, then this can be most generally understood as the internal product of a monoidal category. That is, the monoidal category captures precisely the meaning of a tensor product; it captures exactly the notion of why it is that tensor products behave the way they do. More precisely, a monoidal category is the class of all things (of a given type) that have a tensor product.

===Other products in linear algebra===
Other kinds of products in linear algebra include:

* Hadamard product
* Kronecker product
* The product of tensors:
** Wedge product or exterior product
** Interior product
** Outer product
** Tensor product

==Cartesian product==
In set theory, a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation which returns a set (or product set) from multiple sets. That is, for sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs —where and .

The class of all things (of a given type) that have Cartesian products is called a Cartesian category. Many of these are Cartesian closed categories. Sets are an example of such objects.

==Empty product==
The empty product on numbers and most algebraic structures has the value of 1 (the identity element of multiplication), just like the empty sum has the value of 0 (the identity element of addition). However, the concept of the empty product is more general, and requires special treatment in logic, set theory, computer programming and category theory.

==Products over other algebraic structures==
Products over other kinds of algebraic structures include:
* the Cartesian product of sets
* the direct product of groups, and also the semidirect product, knit product and wreath product
* the free product of groups
* the product of rings
* the product of ideals
* the product of topological spaces
* the Wick product of random variables
* the cap, cup, Massey and slant product in algebraic topology
* the smash product and wedge sum (sometimes called the wedge product) in homotopy

A few of the above products are examples of the general notion of an internal product in a monoidal category; the rest are describable by the general notion of a product in category theory.

==Products in category theory==
All of the previous examples are special cases or examples of the general notion of a product. For the general treatment of the concept of a product, see product (category theory), which describes how to combine two objects of some kind to create an object, possibly of a different kind. But also, in category theory, one has:
* the fiber product or pullback,
* the product category, a category that is the product of categories.
* the ultraproduct, in model theory.
* the internal product of a monoidal category, which captures the essence of a tensor product.

==Other products==
* A function&#x27;s product integral (as a continuous equivalent to the product of a sequence or as the multiplicative version of the normal/standard/additive integral. The product integral is also known as &quot;continuous product&quot; or &quot;multiplical&quot;.
* Complex multiplication, a theory of elliptic curves.

<text>In geometry, a 4-polytope (sometimes also called a polychoron, polycell, or polyhedroid) is a four-dimensional polytope. It is a connected and closed figure, composed of lower-dimensional polytopal elements: vertices, edges, faces (polygons), and cells (polyhedra). Each face is shared by exactly two cells. The 4-polytopes were discovered by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli before 1853. 

The two-dimensional analogue of a 4-polytope is a polygon, and the three-dimensional analogue is a polyhedron.

Topologically 4-polytopes are closely related to the uniform honeycombs, such as the cubic honeycomb, which tessellate 3-space; similarly the 3D cube is related to the infinite 2D square tiling. Convex 4-polytopes can be &quot;cut and unfolded&quot; as nets in 3-space.

==Definition==
A 4-polytope is a closed four-dimensional figure. It comprises vertices (corner points), edges, faces and cells. A cell is the three-dimensional analogue of a face, and is therefore a polyhedron. Each face must join exactly two cells, analogous to the way in which each edge of a polyhedron joins just two faces. Like any polytope, the elements of a 4-polytope cannot be subdivided into two or more sets which are also 4-polytopes, i.e. it is not a compound.

==Geometry==
The convex regular 4-polytopes are the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids. The most familiar 4-polytope is the tesseract or hypercube, the 4D analogue of the cube.

The convex regular 4-polytopes can be ordered by size as a measure of 4-dimensional content (hypervolume) for the same radius. Each greater polytope in the sequence is &quot;rounder&quot; than its predecessor, enclosing more content within the same radius. The 4-simplex (5-cell) is the limit smallest case, and the 120-cell is the largest. Complexity (as measured by comparing configuration matrices or simply the number of vertices) follows the same ordering.

==Visualisation==
4-polytopes cannot be seen in three-dimensional space due to their extra dimension. Several techniques are used to help visualise them.

;Orthogonal projection
Orthogonal projections can be used to show various symmetry orientations of a 4-polytope. They can be drawn in 2D as vertex-edge graphs, and can be shown in 3D with solid faces as visible projective envelopes.
;Perspective projection
Just as a 3D shape can be projected onto a flat sheet, so a 4-D shape can be projected onto 3-space or even onto a flat sheet. One common projection is a Schlegel diagram which uses stereographic projection of points on the surface of a 3-sphere into three dimensions, connected by straight edges, faces, and cells drawn in 3-space.

;Sectioning
Just as a slice through a polyhedron reveals a cut surface, so a slice through a 4-polytope reveals a cut &quot;hypersurface&quot; in three dimensions. A sequence of such sections can be used to build up an understanding of the overall shape. The extra dimension can be equated with time to produce a smooth animation of these cross sections.

;Nets
A net of a 4-polytope is composed of polyhedral cells that are connected by their faces and all occupy the same three-dimensional space, just as the polygon faces of a net of a polyhedron are connected by their edges and all occupy the same plane.

== Topological characteristics ==
The topology of any given 4-polytope is defined by its Betti numbers and torsion coefficients.

The value of the Euler characteristic used to characterise polyhedra does not generalize usefully to higher dimensions, and is zero for all 4-polytopes, whatever their underlying topology. This inadequacy of the Euler characteristic to reliably distinguish between different topologies in higher dimensions led to the discovery of the more sophisticated Betti numbers.

Similarly, the notion of orientability of a polyhedron is insufficient to characterise the surface twistings of toroidal 4-polytopes, and this led to the use of torsion coefficients.

==Classification==

===Criteria===
Like all polytopes, 4-polytopes may be classified based on properties like &quot;convexity&quot; and &quot;symmetry&quot;.

*A 4-polytope is &quot;convex&quot; if its boundary (including its cells, faces and edges) does not intersect itself and the line segment joining any two points of the 4-polytope is contained in the 4-polytope or its interior; otherwise, it is &quot;non-convex&quot;. Self-intersecting 4-polytopes are also known as star 4-polytopes, from analogy with the star-like shapes of the non-convex star polygons and Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra.
* A 4-polytope is &quot;regular&quot; if it is transitive on its flags. This means that its cells are all congruent regular polyhedra, and similarly its vertex figures are congruent and of another kind of regular polyhedron.
*A convex 4-polytope is &quot;semi-regular&quot; if it has a symmetry group under which all vertices are equivalent (vertex-transitive) and its cells are regular polyhedra. The cells may be of two or more kinds, provided that they have the same kind of face. There are only 3 cases identified by Thorold Gosset in 1900: the rectified 5-cell, rectified 600-cell, and snub 24-cell.
*A 4-polytope is &quot;uniform&quot; if it has a symmetry group under which all vertices are equivalent, and its cells are uniform polyhedra. The faces of a uniform 4-polytope must be regular.
* A 4-polytope is &quot;scaliform&quot; if it is vertex-transitive, and has all equal length edges. This allows cells which are not uniform, such as the regular-faced convex Johnson solids.
*A regular 4-polytope which is also convex is said to be a convex regular 4-polytope.
*A 4-polytope is &quot;prismatic&quot; if it is the Cartesian product of two or more lower-dimensional polytopes. A prismatic 4-polytope is uniform if its factors are uniform. The hypercube is prismatic (product of two squares, or of a cube and line segment), but is considered separately because it has symmetries other than those inherited from its factors.
*A &quot;tiling or honeycomb of 3-space&quot; is the division of three-dimensional Euclidean space into a repetitive grid of polyhedral cells. Such tilings or tessellations are infinite and do not bound a &quot;4D&quot; volume, and are examples of infinite 4-polytopes. A &quot;uniform tiling of 3-space&quot; is one whose vertices are congruent and related by a space group and whose cells are uniform polyhedra.

=== Classes ===

The following lists the various categories of 4-polytopes classified according to the criteria above:

Uniform 4-polytope (vertex-transitive):
* Convex uniform 4-polytopes (64, plus two infinite families)
** 47 non-prismatic convex uniform 4-polytope including:
*** 6 Convex regular 4-polytope
** Prismatic uniform 4-polytopes:
*** {} × {p,q} : 18 polyhedral hyperprisms (including cubic hyperprism, the regular hypercube)
*** Prisms built on antiprisms (infinite family)
*** {p} × {q} : duoprisms (infinite family)
* Non-convex uniform 4-polytopes (10 + unknown)
** 10 (regular) Schläfli-Hess polytopes
** 57 hyperprisms built on nonconvex uniform polyhedra
** Unknown total number of nonconvex uniform 4-polytopes: Norman Johnson and other collaborators have identified 2191 forms (convex and star, excluding the infinite families), all constructed by vertex figures by Stella4D software.

Other convex 4-polytopes:
* Polyhedral pyramid
* Polyhedral bipyramid
* Polyhedral prism
Infinite uniform 4-polytopes of Euclidean 3-space (uniform tessellations of convex uniform cells)
* 28 convex uniform honeycombs: uniform convex polyhedral tessellations, including:
** 1 regular tessellation, cubic honeycomb: {4,3,4}

Infinite uniform 4-polytopes of hyperbolic 3-space (uniform tessellations of convex uniform cells)
* 76 Wythoffian convex uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space, including:
** 4 regular tessellation of compact hyperbolic 3-space: {3,5,3}, {4,3,5}, {5,3,4}, {5,3,5}

Dual uniform 4-polytope (cell-transitive):
* 41 unique dual convex uniform 4-polytopes
* 17 unique dual convex uniform polyhedral prisms
* infinite family of dual convex uniform duoprisms (irregular tetrahedral cells)
* 27 unique convex dual uniform honeycombs, including:
** Rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb
** Disphenoid tetrahedral honeycomb

Others:
* Weaire–Phelan structure periodic space-filling honeycomb with irregular cells

Abstract regular 4-polytopes:
* 11-cell
* 57-cell

These categories include only the 4-polytopes that exhibit a high degree of symmetry. Many other 4-polytopes are possible, but they have not been studied as extensively as the ones included in these categories.

==See also==

*Regular 4-polytope
*3-sphere – analogue of a sphere in 4-dimensional space. This is not a 4-polytope, since it is not bounded by polyhedral cells.
*The duocylinder is a figure in 4-dimensional space related to the duoprisms. It is also not a 4-polytope because its bounding volumes are not polyhedral.

<text>In evolutionary biology, punctuated equilibrium (also called punctuated equilibria) is a theory that proposes that once a species appears in the fossil record, the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history. This state of little or no morphological change is called &quot;stasis&quot;. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.

Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted with phyletic gradualism, the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (anagenesis).

In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot;. Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr&#x27;s model of geographic speciation, I. M. Lerner&#x27;s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis,
and their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin
is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.

== History ==

Punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of Ernst Mayr&#x27;s concept of genetic revolutions by allopatric and especially peripatric speciation as applied to the fossil record. Although the sudden appearance of species and its relationship to speciation was proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954, historians of science generally recognize the 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper as the basis of the new paleobiological research program. Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr&#x27;s ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or &quot;sudden jumps&quot;) found in the fossil record. Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould&#x27;s paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been &quot;unexpected by most evolutionary biologists&quot; and that punctuated equilibrium &quot;had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.&quot;

A year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, Niles Eldredge published a paper in the journal &quot;Evolution&quot; which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr&#x27;s standard mechanism of allopatric speciation might suggest a possible resolution.

The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The symposium focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year&#x27;s meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that &quot;Eldredge&#x27;s 1971 publication [on Paleozoic trilobites] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly.&quot; According to Gould &quot;the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould.&quot; In his book &quot;Time Frames&quot; Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair &quot;each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould&#x27;s snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day.&quot;

John Wilkins and Gareth Nelson have argued that French architect Pierre Trémaux proposed an &quot;anticipation of the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould and Eldredge.&quot;

==Evidence from the fossil record==
The fossil record includes well documented examples of both phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution. As such, much debate persists over the prominence of stasis in the fossil record. Before punctuated equilibrium, most evolution biologists considered stasis to be rare or unimportant. The paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, for example, believed that phyletic gradual evolution (called &quot;horotely&quot; in his terminology) comprised 90% of evolution. More modern studies, including a meta-analysis examining 58 published studies on speciation patterns in the fossil record showed that 71% of species exhibited stasis, and 63% were associated with punctuated patterns of evolutionary change. According to Michael Benton, &quot;it seems clear then that stasis is common, and that had not been predicted from modern genetic studies.&quot; A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern &quot;Osmunda claytoniana&quot;. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.

==Theoretical mechanisms==
===Punctuational change===

When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, allopatric speciation was considered the &quot;standard&quot; model of speciation. This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper &quot;Change of genetic environment and evolution,&quot; and his classic volume &quot;Animal Species and Evolution&quot; (1963).

Allopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of gene flow. New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population&#x27;s large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from natural selection is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This hypothesis was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper:

Although punctuated equilibrium generally applies to sexually reproducing organisms, some biologists have applied the model to non-sexual species like viruses, which cannot be stabilized by conventional gene flow. As time went on biologists like Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation. Gould, for example, was particularly attracted to Douglas Futuyma&#x27;s work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.

===Stasis===
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the causes of stasis. Gould was initially attracted to I. Michael Lerner&#x27;s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis. However this hypothesis was rejected over time, as evidence accumulated against it. Other plausible mechanisms which have been suggested include: habitat tracking, stabilizing selection, the Stenseth-Maynard Smith stability hypothesis, constraints imposed by the nature of subdivided populations, normalizing clade selection, and koinophilia.

Evidence for stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years. Fossil evidence of reproductively isolated extant species of sympatric Olive Shells (&quot;Amalda&quot; sp.) also confirm morphological stasis in multiple lineages over three million years.

According to Gould, &quot;stasis may emerge as the theory&#x27;s most important contribution to evolutionary science.&quot; Philosopher Kim Sterelny in clarifying the meaning of stasis adds, &quot;In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner&#x27;s &quot;The Beak of the Finch&quot; describes this very process.&quot;

===Hierarchical evolution===
Punctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution.

==Common misconceptions==
Much confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, how fast the punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like saltationism, quantum evolution, and mass extinction.

===Saltationism===
The punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould&#x27;s theory. Gould&#x27;s sympathetic treatment of Richard Goldschmidt, the controversial geneticist who advocated the idea of &quot;hopeful monsters,&quot; led some biologists to conclude that Gould&#x27;s punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps. This interpretation has frequently been used by creationists to characterize the weakness of the paleontological record, and to portray contemporary evolutionary biology as advancing neo-saltationism.

In an often quoted remark, Gould stated,
: &quot;Since we proposed punctuated equilibria to explain trends, it is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists – whether through design or stupidity, I do not know – as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level, but they are abundant between larger groups.&quot;

Although there exist some debate over how long the punctuations last, supporters of punctuated equilibrium generally place the figure between 50,000 and 100,000 years.

===Quantum evolution===

Quantum evolution was a controversial hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, regarded by Gould as &quot;the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century.&quot; Simpson&#x27;s conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families, orders, and classes of organisms. This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the species level. Simpson&#x27;s idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups. Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a synergistic interaction between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape, Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr&#x27;s concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution. In his &quot;Major Features of Evolution&quot; Simpson stated, &quot;Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it.&quot; Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.

===Multiple meanings of gradualism===
Punctuated equilibrium is often portrayed to oppose the concept of gradualism, when it is actually a form of gradualism. This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that &quot;Most of our paleontological colleagues missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about allopatric speciation or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our evolutionary colleagues also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales&quot;.

Richard Dawkins dedicates a chapter in &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding &quot;rates of change&quot;. His first point is to argue that phyletic gradualism—understood in the sense that evolution proceeds at a single uniform speed, called &quot;constant speedism&quot; by Dawkins—is a &quot;caricature of Darwinism&quot; and &quot;does not really exist&quot;. His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of &quot;constant speedism&quot; is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms &quot;variable speedism&quot;. Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: &quot;&quot;discrete variable&quot; speedism&quot; and &quot;&quot;continuously variable&quot; speedism&quot;. Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as &quot;discrete variable speedists&quot;, and &quot;in this respect they are genuinely radical.&quot; They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. &quot;Continuously variable speedists&quot;, on the other hand, advance that &quot;evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis.&quot;

==Criticism==
Richard Dawkins regards the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record as documenting migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly occurred but &quot;probably gradually&quot; elsewhere. However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observation of stasis and examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.

Dawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been &quot;oversold by some journalists&quot;, but partly due to Eldredge and Gould&#x27;s &quot;later writings&quot;. Dawkins contends that the hypothesis &quot;does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity&quot;. It is a &quot;minor gloss,&quot; an &quot;interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory,&quot; and &quot;lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis&quot;.

In his book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, philosopher Daniel Dennett is especially critical of Gould&#x27;s presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position. Gould responded to Dennett&#x27;s claims in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and in his technical volume &quot;The Structure of Evolutionary Theory&quot;.

English professor Heidi Scott argues that Gould&#x27;s talent for writing vivid prose, his use of metaphor, and his success in building a popular audience of nonspecialist readers altered the &quot;climate of specialized scientific discourse&quot; favorably in his promotion of punctuated equilibrium. While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould&#x27;s rhetorical skills. Philosopher John Lyne and biologist Henry Howe believed punctuated equilibrium&#x27;s success has much more to do with the nature of the geological record than the nature of Gould&#x27;s rhetoric. They state, a &quot;re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change.&quot;

Evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers accused Gould of being &quot;something of an intellectual fraud&quot; for using claims that were &quot;well known from the time of Darwin&quot; (that evolution displayed &quot;periods of long stasis interspersed with periods of rapid change&quot;) to support distinct but more &quot;grandiose&quot; claims regarding species selection, despite the &quot;rate of species turnover [having] nothing to do with the traits within species—only with the relative frequency of species showing these traits&quot;.

Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as &quot;evolution by jerks&quot;, which reportedly prompted punctuationists to describe phyletic gradualism as &quot;evolution by creeps.&quot;

==Darwin&#x27;s theory==
The sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most species—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has long been noted, including by Charles Darwin, who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation. When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of catastrophism and progressive creationism, which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of evolution in accordance with the gradualism promoted by his friend Charles Lyell. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 &quot;Essay&quot;, &quot;Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false.&quot;

It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; states that &quot;Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian &quot;Lingula&quot; differs but little from the living species of this genus&quot;. &quot;Lingula&quot; is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old. In the fourth edition (1866) of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; Darwin wrote that &quot;the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.&quot; Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin&#x27;s conception of evolution.

According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, &quot;peripheral isolates&quot; are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, &quot;&quot;I can by no means agree&quot; ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements. ... Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely.&quot;

The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin&#x27;s early thinking, as shown in his &quot;Essay&quot; of 1844. But by the time he wrote the &quot;Origin&quot; he had downplayed its importance. He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:
Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms ... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.

Thus punctuated equilibrium is incongruous with some of Darwin&#x27;s ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection.

==Supplemental modes of rapid evolution==

Recent work in developmental biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume &quot;Origination of Organismal Form&quot; (MIT Press; 2003).

==Language change==

In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has proposed a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference particularly to the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.

Separately, recent work using computational phylogenetic methods claims to show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when languages split from one another, accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.

==Mythology==
Punctuational evolution has been argued to explain changes in folktales and mythology over time.

<text>Pioneer 11 (also known as Pioneer G) is a NASA robotic space probe launched on April 5, 1973, to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter and Saturn, the solar wind, and cosmic rays. It was the first probe to encounter Saturn, the second to fly through the asteroid belt, and the second to fly by Jupiter. Later, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; became the second of five artificial objects to achieve an escape velocity allowing it to leave the Solar System. Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995.

==Mission background==
===History===
Approved in February 1969, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; and its twin probe, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, were the first to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s, early mission objectives were defined as:
* Explore the interplanetary medium beyond the orbit of Mars
* Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belt&#x27;s possible hazard to missions to the outer planets.
* Explore the environment of Jupiter.

Subsequent planning for an encounter with Saturn added many more goals:
* Map the magnetic field of Saturn and determine its intensity, direction, and structure.
* Determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the Saturn system.
* Map the interaction of the Saturn system with the solar wind.
* Measure the temperature of Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere and that of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn.
* Determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of Saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere.
* Map the thermal structure of Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere by infrared observations coupled with radio occultation data.
* Obtain spin-scan images of the Saturnian system in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet.
* Probe the ring system and the atmosphere of Saturn with S-band radio occultation.
* Determine more precisely the masses of Saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft.
* As a precursor to the Mariner Jupiter/Saturn mission, verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the Mariner spacecraft without serious damage.

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was built by TRW and managed as part of the Pioneer program by NASA Ames Research Center. A backup unit, Pioneer H, is currently on display in the &quot;Milestones of Flight&quot; exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the &quot;Voyager&quot; program.

===Spacecraft design===
The &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; bus measures deep and with six panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus houses propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the twelve scientific instruments. The spacecraft has a mass of 259 kilograms.

====Attitude control and propulsion====
:Orientation of the spacecraft was maintained with six 4.5-N, hydrazine monopropellant thrusters: pair one maintains a constant spin-rate of 4.8 rpm, pair two controls the forward thrust, pair three controls attitude. Information for the orientation is provided by performing conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit, a star sensor able to reference Canopus, and two Sun sensors.

====Communications====
:The space probe includes a redundant system transceivers, one attached to the high-gain antenna, the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. Each transceiver is 8 watts and transmits data across the S-band using 2110 MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292 MHz for the downlink to Earth with the Deep Space Network tracking the signal. Prior to transmitting data, the probe uses a convolutional encoder to allow correction of errors in the received data on Earth.

====Power====

:&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; uses four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) (see diagram). They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155 watts at launch, and decayed to 140 W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft requires 100 W to power all systems.

====Computer====
:Much of the computation for the mission was performed on Earth and transmitted to the probe, where it is able to retain in memory, up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144 bytes of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit is then used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.

====Scientific instruments====
&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; has one additional instrument more than &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, a flux-gate magnetometer.
==Mission profile==

===Launch and trajectory===
The &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; probe was launched on April 6, 1973, at 02:11:00 UTC, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 36A at Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard an Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle, with a Star-37E propulsion module. Its twin probe, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, had been launched on March 3, 1972.

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was launched on a trajectory directly aimed at Jupiter without any prior gravitational assists. In May 1974, Pioneer was retargeted to fly past Jupiter on a north–south trajectory, enabling a Saturn flyby in 1979. The maneuver used of propellant, lasted 42 minutes and 36 seconds, and increased &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;&#x27;s speed by 230 km/h. It also made two mid-course corrections, on April 11, 1973 and November 7, 1974.

===Encounter with Jupiter===

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; flew past Jupiter in November and December 1974. During its closest approach, on December 2, it passed above the cloud tops. The probe obtained detailed images of the Great Red Spot, transmitted the first images of the immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter&#x27;s moon Callisto. Using the gravitational pull of Jupiter, a gravity assist was used to alter the trajectory of the probe towards Saturn and gain velocity. On April 16, 1975, following the Jupiter encounter, the micrometeoroid detector was turned off.


===Encounter with Saturn===
&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; passed by Saturn on September 1, 1979, at a distance of from Saturn&#x27;s cloud tops.

By this time, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; had already passed Jupiter and were en route to Saturn, so it was decided &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; would pass through the Saturn ring plane at the same position Voyager 2 would later have to fly through in order to reach Uranus and Neptune. If there were faint ring particles capable of damaging a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was acting as a &quot;pioneer&quot; in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then Voyager 2 could be redirected further away from the rings but miss the opportunity to visit the ice giants in the process.

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; imaged—and nearly collided with—one of Saturn&#x27;s small moons, passing at a distance of no more than . The object was tentatively identified as Epimetheus, a moon discovered the previous day from &quot;Pioneer&quot;″s imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the Voyager flybys, it became known that there are two similarly sized moons (Epimetheus and Janus) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer&#x27;s near-miss. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; encountered Janus on September 1, 1979, at 14:52 UTC, at a distance of . At 16:20 UTC the same day, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; encountered Mimas at a distance of .

Besides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere and magnetic field, and found its planet-sized moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn&#x27;s rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.


===Interstellar mission===
On February 25, 1990, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; became the fourth human-made object to pass beyond the orbit of the planets.

By 1995, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; could no longer power any of its detectors, so the decision was made to shut it down. On September 29, 1995, NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, responsible for managing the project, issued a press release that began, &quot;After nearly 22 years of exploration out to the farthest reaches of the Solar System, one of the most durable and productive space missions in history will come to a close.&quot; It indicated NASA would use its Deep Space Network antennas to listen &quot;once or twice a month&quot; for the spacecraft&#x27;s signal, until &quot;some time in late 1996&quot; when &quot;its transmitter will fall silent altogether.&quot; NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin characterized &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; as &quot;the little spacecraft that could, a venerable explorer that has taught us a great deal about the Solar System and, in the end, about our own innate drive to learn. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; is what NASA is all about – exploration beyond the frontier.&quot; Besides announcing the end of operations, the dispatch provided a historical list of &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; mission achievements.

NASA terminated routine contact with the spacecraft on September 30, 1995, but continued to make contact for about two hours every two to four weeks. Scientists received a few minutes of good engineering data on November 24, 1995, but then lost final contact once Earth moved out of view of the spacecraft&#x27;s antenna.

=== Timeline ===

==Current status==
Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995.

As of June 24, 2024, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; is estimated to be from the Earth and from the Sun. It was traveling at relative to the Sun and traveling outward at about 2.35 AU per year. The spacecraft is heading in the direction of the constellation Scutum near the current position (June 2024) RA 18h 54m dec -8° 46&#x27; (J2000.0), close to Messier 26. In 928,000 years, it will pass within of the K dwarf TYC 992-192-1 and will pass near the star Lambda Aquilae in about four million years.

&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; has been overtaken by the two Voyager probes launched in 1977. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; has become the most distant object built by humans and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as no probe launched since Voyager has the speed to overtake it.

==Pioneer anomaly==

Analysis of the radio tracking data from the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; spacecraft at distances between 20 and 70 AU from the Sun had consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous Doppler frequency drift. The drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of directed towards the Sun. Although it was suspected that there was a systematic origin to the effect, none was found. As a result, there has been sustained interest in the nature of this so-called &quot;Pioneer anomaly&quot;. Extended analysis of mission data by Slava Turyshev and colleagues determined the source of the anomaly to be asymmetric thermal radiation and the resulting thermal recoil force acting on the face of the &quot;Pioneer&quot;s away from the Sun.

==Pioneer plaque==
&quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; both carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent lifeforms from other planetary systems. The plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft.

==Commemoration==
In 1991, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was honored on one of 10 United States Postage Service stamps commemorating uncrewed spacecraft exploring each of the then nine planets and the Moon. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; was the spacecraft featured with Jupiter. Pluto was listed as &quot;Not yet explored&quot;.

<text>Psychometrics is a field of study within psychology concerned with the theory and technique of measurement. Psychometrics generally covers specialized fields within psychology and education devoted to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities. Psychometrics is concerned with the objective measurement of latent constructs that cannot be directly observed. Examples of latent constructs include intelligence, introversion, mental disorders, and educational achievement. The levels of individuals on nonobservable latent variables are inferred through mathematical modeling based on what is observed from individuals&#x27; responses to items on tests and scales. 

Practitioners are described as psychometricians, although not all who engage in psychometric research go by this title. Psychometricians usually possess specific qualifications, such as degrees or certifications, and most are psychologists with advanced graduate training in psychometrics and measurement theory. In addition to traditional academic institutions, practitioners also work for organizations, such as Pearson and the Educational Testing Service. Some psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment instruments, including surveys, scales, and open- or close-ended questionnaires. Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e.g., item response theory, intraclass correlation) or specialize as learning and development professionals.

== Historical foundation ==
Psychological testing has come from two streams of thought: the first, from Darwin, Galton, and Cattell, on the measurement of individual differences and the second, from Herbart, Weber, Fechner, and Wundt and their psychophysical measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their research is what has led to the development of experimental psychology and standardized testing.

=== Victorian stream ===
Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Francis Galton, a scientist who advanced the development of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. Darwin described the role of natural selection in the emergence, over time, of different populations of species of plants and animals. The book showed how individual members of a species differ among themselves and how they possess characteristics that are more or less adaptive to their environment. Those with more adaptive characteristics are more likely to survive to procreate and give rise to another generation. Those with less adaptive characteristics are less likely. These ideas stimulated Galton&#x27;s interest in the study of human beings and how they differ one from another and how to measure those differences.

Galton wrote a book entitled &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot; which was first published in 1869. The book described different characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make some more &quot;fit&quot; than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength), are important domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure intelligence. Galton often referred to as &quot;the father of psychometrics,&quot; devised and included mental tests among his anthropometric measures. James McKeen Cattell, a pioneer in the field of psychometrics, went on to extend Galton&#x27;s work. Cattell coined the term &quot;mental test&quot;, and is responsible for research and knowledge that ultimately led to the development of modern tests.

=== German stream ===
The origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of psychophysics. Around the same time that Darwin, Galton, and Cattell were making their discoveries, Herbart was also interested in &quot;unlocking the mysteries of human consciousness&quot; through the scientific method. Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind, which were influential in educational practices for years to come.

E.H. Weber built upon Herbart&#x27;s work and tried to prove the existence of a psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to activate a sensory system. After Weber, G.T. Fechner expanded upon the knowledge he gleaned from Herbart and Weber, to devise the law that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. A follower of Weber and Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt is credited with founding the science of psychology. It is Wundt&#x27;s influence that paved the way for others to develop psychological testing.

=== 20th century ===
In 1936, the psychometrician L. L. Thurstone, founder and first president of the Psychometric Society, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the law of comparative judgment, an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Fechner. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of factor analysis, a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics. In the late 1950s, Leopold Szondi made a historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking on psychology during previous few decades: &quot;in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking. Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today.&quot;

More recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of , attitudes and beliefs, and academic achievement. These latent constructs cannot truly be measured, and much of the research and science in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to measure these constructs as close to the true score as possible. 

Figures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include Karl Pearson, Henry F. Kaiser, Carl Brigham, L. L. Thurstone, E. L. Thorndike, Georg Rasch, Eugene Galanter, Johnson O&#x27;Connor, Frederic M. Lord, Ledyard R Tucker, Louis Guttman, and Jane Loevinger.

== Definition of measurement in the social sciences ==
The definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history. A current widespread definition, proposed by Stanley Smith Stevens, is that measurement is &quot;the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to some rule.&quot; This definition was introduced in a 1946 &quot;Science&quot; article in which Stevens proposed four levels of measurement. Although widely adopted, this definition differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement adopted in the physical sciences, namely that scientific measurement entails &quot;the estimation or discovery of the ratio of some magnitude of a quantitative attribute to a unit of the same attribute&quot; (p. 358)

Indeed, Stevens&#x27;s definition of measurement was put forward in response to the British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist. The committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory events. Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee also included several psychologists. The committee&#x27;s report highlighted the importance of the definition of measurement. While Stevens&#x27;s response was to propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field, this was by no means the only response to the report. Another, notably different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the following statement:

:Measurement in psychology and physics are in no sense different. Physicists can measure when they can find the operations by which they may meet the necessary criteria; psychologists have to do the same. They need not worry about the mysterious differences between the meaning of measurement in the two sciences (Reese, 1943, p. 49).

These divergent responses are reflected in alternative approaches to measurement. For example, methods based on covariance matrices are typically employed on the premise that numbers, such as raw scores derived from assessments, are measurements. Such approaches implicitly entail Stevens&#x27;s definition of measurement, which requires only that numbers are &quot;assigned&quot; according to some rule. The main research task, then, is generally considered to be the discovery of associations between scores, and of factors posited to underlie such associations.

On the other hand, when measurement models such as the Rasch model are employed, numbers are not assigned based on a rule. Instead, in keeping with Reese&#x27;s statement above, specific criteria for measurement are stated, and the goal is to construct procedures or operations that provide data that meet the relevant criteria. Measurements are estimated based on the models, and tests are conducted to ascertain whether the relevant criteria have been met.

== Instruments and procedures ==
The first psychometric instruments were designed to measure intelligence. One early approach to measuring intelligence was the test developed in France by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon. That test was known as the .The French test was adapted for use in the U. S. by Lewis Terman of Stanford University, and named the Stanford-Binet IQ test.

Another major focus in psychometrics has been on personality testing. There has been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality, though there is no widely agreed upon theory. Some of the better-known instruments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Five-Factor Model (or &quot;Big 5&quot;) and tools such as Personality and Preference Inventory and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches. An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).

== Theoretical approaches ==
Psychometricians have developed a number of different measurement theories. These include classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). An approach that seems mathematically to be similar to IRT but also quite distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the Rasch model for measurement. The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences.

Psychometricians have also developed methods for working with large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: factor analysis, a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data. One of the main challenges faced by users of factor analysis is a lack of consensus on appropriate procedures for determining the number of latent factors. A usual procedure is to stop factoring when eigenvalues drop below one because the original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other multivariate methods, also.

Multidimensional scaling is a method for finding a simple representation for data with a large number of latent dimensions. Cluster analysis is an approach to finding objects that are like each other. Factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis are all multivariate descriptive methods used to distill from large amounts of data simpler structures.

More recently, structural equation modeling and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits. Because at a granular level psychometric research is concerned with the extent and nature of multidimensionality in each of the items of interest, a relatively new procedure known as bi-factor analysis can be helpful. Bi-factor analysis can decompose &quot;an item&#x27;s systematic variance in terms of, ideally, two sources, a general factor and one source of additional systematic variance.&quot;

=== Key concepts ===
Key concepts in classical test theory are reliability and validity. A reliable measure is one that measures a construct consistently across time, individuals, and situations. A valid measure is one that measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for validity.

Both reliability and validity can be assessed statistically. Consistency over repeated measures of the same test can be assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and is often called &quot;test-retest reliability.&quot; Similarly, the equivalence of different versions of the same measure can be indexed by a Pearson correlation, and is called &quot;equivalent forms reliability&quot; or a similar term.

Internal consistency, which addresses the homogeneity of a single test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed &quot;split-half reliability&quot;; the value of this Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for two half-tests is adjusted with the Spearman–Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is Cronbach&#x27;s α, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Other approaches include the intra-class correlation, which is the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets.

There are a number of different forms of validity. Criterion-related validity refers to the extent to which a test or scale predicts a sample of behavior, i.e., the criterion, that is &quot;external to the measuring instrument itself.&quot; That external sample of behavior can be many things including another test; college grade point average as when the high school SAT is used to predict performance in college; and even behavior that occurred in the past, for example, when a test of current psychological symptoms is used to predict the occurrence of past victimization (which would accurately represent postdiction). When the criterion measure is collected at the same time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish &quot;concurrent validity&quot;; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish &quot;predictive validity&quot;. A measure has &quot;construct validity&quot; if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. &quot;Content validity&quot; is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a &quot;job analysis&quot;.

Item response theory models the relationship between latent traits and responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student&#x27;s knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student&#x27;s knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a &quot;norm group&quot; randomly selected from the population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item response theory are not.

== Standards of quality ==
The considerations of validity and reliability typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any test. However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing standards and making overall judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.

=== Testing standards ===
In 2014, the American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) published a revision of the &quot;Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing&quot;, which describes standards for test development, evaluation, and use. The &quot;Standards&quot; cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing. The book also establishes standards related to testing operations—including test design and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users. Finally, the &quot;Standards&quot; cover topics related to testing applications, including psychological testing and assessment, workplace testing and credentialing, educational testing and assessment, and testing in program evaluation and public policy.

=== Evaluation standards ===
In the field of evaluation, and in particular educational evaluation, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has published three sets of standards for evaluations. &quot;The Personnel Evaluation Standards&quot; was published in 1988, &quot;The Program Evaluation Standards&quot; (2nd edition) was published in 1994, and &quot;The Student Evaluation Standards&quot; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing, and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

== Controversy and criticism ==
Because psychometrics is based on latent psychological processes measured through correlations, there has been controversy about some psychometric measures. Critics, including practitioners in the physical sciences, have argued that such definition and quantification is difficult, and that such measurements are often misused by laymen, such as with personality tests used in employment procedures. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Measurement gives the following statement on test validity: &quot;validity refers to the degree to which evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores entailed by proposed uses of tests&quot;. Simply put, a test is not valid unless it is used and interpreted in the way it is intended. 

Two types of tools used to measure personality traits are objective tests and projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five Inventory (BFI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006, or Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. Some of these tests are helpful because they have adequate reliability and validity, two factors that make tests consistent and accurate reflections of the underlying construct. The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), however, has questionable validity and has been the subject of much criticism. Psychometric specialist Robert Hogan wrote of the measure: &quot;Most personality psychologists regard the MBTI as little more than an elaborate Chinese fortune cookie.&quot;

Lee Cronbach noted in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; (1957) that, &quot;correlational psychology, though fully as old as experimentation, was slower to mature. It qualifies equally as a discipline, however, because it asks a distinctive type of question and has technical methods of examining whether the question has been properly put and the data properly interpreted.&quot; He would go on to say, &quot;The correlation method, for its part, can study what man has not learned to control or can never hope to control ... A true federation of the disciplines is required. Kept independent, they can give only wrong answers or no answers at all regarding certain important problems.&quot;

== Non-human: animals and machines ==
Psychometrics addresses &quot;human&quot; abilities, attitudes, traits, and educational evolution. Notably, the study of behavior, mental processes, and abilities of non-human &quot;animals&quot; is usually addressed by comparative psychology, or with a continuum between non-human animals and the rest of animals by evolutionary psychology. Nonetheless, there are some advocators for a more gradual transition between the approach taken for humans and the approach taken for (non-human) animals.

The evaluation of abilities, traits and learning evolution of &quot;machines&quot; has been mostly unrelated to the case of humans and non-human animals, with specific approaches in the area of artificial intelligence. A more integrated approach, under the name of universal psychometrics, has also been proposed.

<text>The philosophy of education is the branch of applied philosophy that investigates the nature of education as well as its aims and problems. It also examines the concepts and presuppositions of education theories. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws inspiration from various disciplines both within and outside philosophy, like ethics, political philosophy, psychology, and sociology. Many of its theories focus specifically on education in schools but it also encompasses other forms of education. Its theories are often divided into descriptive theories, which provide a value-neutral description of what education is, and normative theories, which investigate how education should be practiced.

A great variety of topics is discussed in the philosophy of education. Some studies provide a conceptual analysis of the fundamental concepts of education. Others center around the aims or purpose of education, like passing on knowledge and the development of the abilities of good reasoning, judging, and acting. An influential discussion concerning the epistemic aims of education is whether education should focus mainly on the transmission of true beliefs or rather on the abilities to reason and arrive at new knowledge. In this context, many theorists emphasize the importance of critical thinking in contrast to indoctrination. Another debate about the aims of education is whether the primary beneficiary is the student or the society to which the student belongs.

Many of the more specific discussions in the philosophy of education concern the contents of the curriculum. This involves the questions of whether, when, and in what detail a certain topic, like sex education or religion, should be taught. Other debates focus on the specific contents and methods used in moral, art, and science education. Some philosophers investigate the relation between education and power, often specifically regarding the power used by modern states to compel children to attend school. A different issue is the problem of the equality of education and factors threatening it, like discrimination and unequal distribution of wealth. Some philosophers of education promote a quantitative approach to educational research, which follows the example of the natural sciences by using wide experimental studies. Others prefer a qualitative approach, which is closer to the methodology of the social sciences and tends to give more prominence to individual case studies.

Various schools of philosophy have developed their own perspective on the main issues of education. Existentialists emphasize the role of authenticity while pragmatists give particular prominence to active learning and discovery. Feminists and postmodernists often try to uncover and challenge biases and forms of discrimination present in current educational practices. Other philosophical movements include perennialism, classical education, essentialism, critical pedagogy, and progressivism. The history of the philosophy of education started in ancient philosophy but only emerged as a systematic branch of philosophy in the latter half of the 20th century.

== Definition ==
The philosophy of education is the branch of philosophy that examines the nature, aims, and problems of education. As the philosophical study of education, it investigates its topic similar to how other discipline-specific branches of philosophy, like the philosophy of science or the philosophy of law, study their topics. A central task for the philosophy of education is to make explicit the various fundamental assumptions and disagreements at work in its field and to evaluate the arguments raised for and against the different positions. The issue of education has a great many manifestations in various fields. Because of this, both the breadth and the influence of the philosophy of education are significant and wide-ranging, touching many other branches of philosophy, such as ethics, political philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. Its theories are often formulated from the perspective of these other philosophical disciplines. But due to its interdisciplinary nature, it also attracts contributions from scholars belonging to fields outside the domain of philosophy.

While there is wide agreement on the general topics discussed in the philosophy of education, it has proven difficult to give a precise definition of it. The philosophy of education belongs mainly to applied philosophy. According to some definitions, it can be characterized as an offshoot of ethics. But not everyone agrees with this characterization since the philosophy of education has a more theoretical side as well, which includes the examination of the fundamental concepts and theories of education as well as their philosophical implications. These two sides are sometimes referred to as the outward and the inward looking nature of the philosophy of education. Its topics can range from very general questions, like the nature of the knowledge worth teaching, to more specific issues, like how to teach art or whether public schools should implement standardized curricula and testing.

The problem of education was already an important topic in ancient philosophy and has remained so to the present day. But it only emerged as a distinct branch of philosophy in the latter half of the 20th century, when it became the subject of a systematic study and analysis. The term &quot;education&quot; can refer either to the process of educating or to the field of study investigating education as this process. This ambiguity is also reflected on the level of the philosophy of education, which encompasses the study of the philosophical presuppositions and issues both of education as a process and as a discipline. Many works in the philosophy of education focus explicitly or implicitly on the education happening in schools. But in its widest sense, education takes place in various other fields as well, such as at home, in libraries, in museums, or in the public media. Different types of education can be distinguished, such as formal and informal education or private and public education.

== Subdivisions ==
Different subdivisions of the philosophy of education have been suggested. One categorization distinguishes between descriptive and normative issues. Descriptive theories aim to describe what education is and how to understand its related concepts. This includes also epistemological questions, which ask not whether a theory about education is true or false, but how one can arrive at the knowledge to answer such questions. Normative theories, on the other hand, try to give an account of how education should be practiced or what is the right form of education. Some normative theories are built on a wider ethical framework of what is right or good and then arrive at their educational normative theories by applying this framework to the practice of education. But the descriptive and the normative approaches are intertwined and cannot always be clearly separated since descriptive findings often directly imply various normative attitudes.

Another categorization divides topics in the philosophy of education into the nature and aims of education on the one hand, and the methods and circumstances of education on the other hand. The latter section may again be divided into concrete normative theories and the study of the conceptual and methodological presuppositions of these theories. Other classifications additionally include areas for topics such as the role of reasoning and morality as well as issues pertaining to social and political topics and the curriculum.

The theories within the philosophy of education can also be subdivided based on the school of philosophy they belong to. Various schools of philosophy, such as existentialism, pragmatism, Marxism, postmodernism, and feminism, have developed their own perspective on the main issues of education. They often include normative theories about how education should or should not be practiced and are in most cases controversial.

Another approach is to simply list all topics discussed in the philosophy of education. Among them are the issues and presuppositions concerning sex education, science education, aesthetic education, religious education, moral education, multicultural education, professional education, theories of teaching and learning, the measurement of learning, knowledge and its value, cultivating reason, epistemic and moral aims of education, authority, fallibilism, and fallibility.

Finally, yet another way that philosophy of education is often tacitly divided is in terms of &quot;western&quot; versus non-western and “global south” perspectives. For many generations, philosophy of education has maintained a relatively ethnocentric orientation, with little attention paid to ideas from outside Europe and North America, but this is starting to change in the 21st century due to decolonization and related movements.

== Main topics ==
=== Fundamental concepts of education ===
The starting point of many philosophical inquiries into a field is the examination and clarification of the fundamental concepts used in this field, often in the form of conceptual analysis. This approach is particularly prominent in the analytic tradition. It aims to make ambiguities explicit and to uncover various implicit and potentially false assumptions associated with these terms.

Theorists in this field often emphasize the importance of this form of investigation since all subsequent work on more specific issues already has to assume at least implicitly what their central terms mean to demarcate their field. For example, in order to study what constitutes good education, one has to have a notion of what the term &quot;education&quot; means and how to achieve, measure, and evaluate it. Definitions of education can be divided into thin and thick definitions. Thin definitions are neutral and descriptive. They usually emphasize the role of the transmission of knowledge and understanding in education. Thick definitions include additional normative components, for example, by stating that the process in question has to have certain positive results to be called education. According to one thick definition, education means that the person educated has acquired knowledge and intellectual skills, values these factors, and has thus changed for the better. These characteristics can then be used to distinguish education from other closely related terms, such as &quot;indoctrination&quot;. Other fundamental notions in the philosophy of education include the concepts of teaching, learning, student, schooling, and rearing.

=== Aims of education ===
A central question in the philosophy of education concerns the aims of education, i.e. the question of why people should be educated and what goals should be pursued in the process of education. This issue is highly relevant for evaluating educational practices and products by assessing how well they manage to realize these goals. There is a lot of disagreement and various theories have been proposed concerning the aims of education. Prominent suggestions include that education should foster knowledge, curiosity, creativity, rationality, and critical thinking while also promoting the tendency to think, feel, and act morally. The individual should thereby develop as a person, and achieve self-actualization by realizing their potential. Some theorists emphasize the cultivation of liberal ideals, such as freedom, autonomy, and open-mindedness, while others stress the importance of docility, obedience to authority, and ideological purity, sometimes also with a focus on piety and religious faith. Many suggestions concern the social domain, such as fostering a sense of community and solidarity and thus turning the individual into a productive member of society while protecting them from the potentially negative influences of society. The discussion of these positions and the arguments cited for and against them often include references to various disciplines in their justifications, such as ethics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology.

There is wide consensus concerning certain general aims of education, like that it should foster all students, help them in the development of their ability to reason, and guide them in how to judge and act. But these general characteristics are usually too vague to be of much help and there are many disagreements about the more specific suggestions of what education should aim for. Some attempts have been made to provide an overarching framework of these different aims. According to one approach, education should at its core help the individual lead a good life. All the different more specific goals are aims of education to the extent that they serve this ultimate purpose. On this view, it may be argued that fostering rationality and autonomy in the students are aims of education to the extent that increased rationality and autonomy will result in the student leading a better life.

The different theories of the aims of education are sometimes divided into &quot;goods-based&quot;, &quot;skills-based&quot;, and &quot;character-based&quot; accounts. &quot;Goods-based&quot; accounts hold that the ultimate aim of education is to produce some form of epistemic good, such as truth, knowledge, and understanding. &quot;Skills-based&quot; accounts, on the other hand, see the development of certain skills, like rationality as well as critical and independent thinking as the goal of education. For &quot;character-based&quot; accounts, the character traits or virtues of the learner play the central role, often with an emphasis on moral and civic traits like kindness, justice, and honesty.

==== Epistemic ====
Many theories emphasize the epistemic aims of education. According to the epistemic approach, the central aim of education has to do with knowledge, for example, to pass on knowledge accumulated in the societal effort from one generation to the next. This process may be seen both as the development of the student&#x27;s mind as well as the transmission of a valuable heritage. Such an approach is sometimes rejected by pragmatists, who emphasize experimentation and critical thinking over the transmission of knowledge. Others have argued that this constitutes a false dichotomy: that the transmission of knowledge and the development of a rational and critical mind are intertwined aims of education that depend on and support each other. In this sense, education aims also at fostering the ability to acquire new knowledge. This includes both instilling true beliefs in the students as well as teaching the methods and forms of evidence responsible for verifying existing beliefs and arriving at new knowledge. It promotes the epistemic autonomy of students and may help them challenge unwarranted claims by epistemic authorities. In its widest sense, the epistemic approach includes various related goals, such as imparting true beliefs or knowledge to the students as well as teaching dispositions and abilities, such as rationality, critical thinking, understanding, and other intellectual virtues.

==== Critical thinking and indoctrination ====
Critical thinking is often cited as one of the central aims of education. There is no generally accepted definition of critical thinking. But there is wide agreement that it is reasonable, reflective, careful, and focused on determining what to believe or how to act. It has clarity and rationality as its standards and includes a metacognitive component monitoring not just the solution of the problem at hand but also ensuring that it complies with its own standards in the process. In this sense, education is not just about conveying many true beliefs to the students. Instead, the students&#x27; ability to arrive at conclusions by themselves and the disposition to question pre-existing beliefs should also be fostered, often with the goal of benefitting not just the student but society at large. But not everyone agrees with the positive role ascribed to critical thinking in education. Objections are often based on disagreements about what it means to reason well. Some critics argue that there is no universally correct form of reasoning. According to them, education should focus more on teaching subject-specific skills and less on imparting a universal method of thinking. Other objections focus on the allegation that critical thinking is not as neutral, universal, and presuppositionless as some of its proponents claim. On this view, it involves various implicit biases, like egocentrism or distanced objectivity, and culture-specific values arising from its roots in the philosophical movement of the European Enlightenment.

The problem of critical thinking is closely connected to that of indoctrination. Many theorists hold that indoctrination is in important ways different from education and should be avoided in education. But others contend that indoctrination should be part of education or even that there is no difference between the two. These different positions depend a lot on how &quot;indoctrination&quot; is to be defined. Most definitions of indoctrination agree that its goal is to get the student to accept and embrace certain beliefs. It has this in common with most forms of education but differs from it in other ways. According to one definition, the belief acquisition in indoctrination happens without regard for the evidential support of these beliefs, i.e. without presenting proper arguments and reasons for adopting them. According to another, the beliefs are instilled in such a way as to discourage the student to question or assess for themselves the believed contents. In this sense, the goals of indoctrination are exactly opposite to other aims of education, such as rationality and critical thinking. In this sense, education tries to impart not just beliefs but also make the students more open-minded and conscious of human fallibility. An intimately related issue is whether the aim of education is to mold the mind of the pupil or to liberate it by strengthening its capacity for critical and independent inquiry.

An important consequence of this debate concerns the problem of testimony, i.e to what extent students should trust the claims of teachers and books. It has been argued that this issue depends a lot on the age and the intellectual development of the student. In the earlier stages of education, a high level of trust on the side of the students may be necessary. But the more their intellectual capacities develop, the more they should use them when trying to assess the plausibility of claims and the reasons for and against them. In this regard, it has been argued that, especially for young children, weaker forms of indoctrination may be necessary while they still lack the intellectual capacities to evaluate the reasons for and against certain claims and thus to critically assess them. In this sense, one can distinguish unavoidable or acceptable forms of indoctrination from their avoidable or unacceptable counterparts. But this distinction is not always affirmed and some theorists contend that all forms of indoctrination are bad or unacceptable.

==== Individual and society ====
A recurrent source of disagreement about the aims of education concerns the question of who is the primary beneficiary of education: the individual educated or the society having this individual as its member. In many cases, the interests of both are aligned. On the one hand, many new opportunities in life open to the individual through education, especially concerning their career. On the other hand, education makes it more likely that the person becomes a good, law-abiding, and productive member of society. But this issue becomes more problematic in cases where the interests of the individual and society conflict with each other. This poses the question of whether individual autonomy should take precedence over communal welfare. According to &quot;comprehensive liberals&quot;, for example, education should emphasize the self-directedness of the students. On this view, it is up to the student to choose their own path in life. The role of education is to provide them with the necessary resources but it does not direct the student with respect to what constitutes an ethically good path in life. This position is usually rejected by communitarians, who stress the importance of social cohesion by being part of the community and sharing a common good.

=== Curriculum ===
An important and controversial issue in the philosophy of education concerns the contents of the curriculum, i.e. the question of what should be taught to students. This includes both the selection of subjects to be taught and the consideration of arguments for and against the inclusion of a particular topic. This issue is intimately tied to the aims of education: one may argue that a certain subject should be included in the curriculum because it serves one of the aims of education.

While many positions about what subjects to include in the curriculum are controversial, some particular issues stand out where these controversies go beyond the academic discourse to a wide public discourse, like questions about sexual and religious education. Controversies in sex education involve both biological aspects, such as the functioning of sex organs, and social aspects, such as sexual practices and gender identities. Disagreements in this area concern which aspects are taught and in which detail as well as to which age groups these teachings should be directed. Debates on religious education include questions like whether religion should be taught as a distinct subject and, if so, whether it should be compulsory. Other questions include which religion or religions should be taught and to what degree religious views should influence other topics, such as ethics or sex education.

Another prominent topic in this field concerns the subject of moral education. This field is sometimes referred to as &quot;educational ethics&quot;. Disagreements in this field concern which moral beliefs and values should be taught to the students. This way, many of the disagreements in moral philosophy are reflected in the field of moral education. Some theorists in the Kantian tradition emphasize the importance of moral reasoning and enabling children to become morally autonomous agents who can tell right from wrong. Theorists in the Aristotelian tradition, on the other hand, focus more on moral habituation through the development of virtues that concern both perception, affect, and judgment in regard to moral situations. A related issue, heavily discussed in ancient philosophy, is the extent to which morality can be taught at all instead of just being an inborn disposition.

Various discussions also concern the role of art and aesthetics in public education. It has been argued that the creativity learned in these areas can be applied to various other fields and may thereby benefit the student in various ways. It has been argued that aesthetic education also has indirect effects on various other issues, such as shaping the student&#x27;s sensibilities in the fields of morality and politics as well as heightening their awareness of self and others.

Some researchers reject the possibility of objectivity in general. They use this claim to argue against universal forms of education, which they see as hiding particular worldviews, beliefs, and interests under a false cover. This is sometimes utilized to advance an approach focused on more diversity, for example, by giving more prominence in education to the great variety of cultures, customs, languages, and lifestyles without giving preference to any of them.

Different approaches to solving these disputes are employed. In some cases, psychology in the field of child development, learning, and motivation can provide important general insights. More specific questions about the curriculum of a particular subject, such as mathematics, are often strongly influenced by the philosophy of this specific discipline, such as the philosophy of mathematics.

=== Power ===
The problem of power is another issue in the philosophy of education. Of specific interest on this topic is that the modern states compel children to attend school, so-called compulsory education. The children and their parents usually have few to no ways of opting out or changing the established curriculum. An important question in this respect is why or whether modern states are justified to use this form of power. For example, various liberationist movements belonging to the fields of deschooling and unschooling reject this power and argue that the children&#x27;s welfare is best served in the absence of compulsory schooling in general. This is sometimes based on the idea that the best form of learning does not happen while studying but instead occurs as a side-effect while doing something else. This position is often rejected by pointing out that it is based on overly optimistic presuppositions about the children&#x27;s natural and unguided development of rationality. While some objections focus on compulsory education in general, a less radical and more common criticism concerns specific compulsory topics in the curriculum, for example, in relation to sexuality or religion. Another contemporary debate in the United States concerns the practice of standardized testing: it has been argued that this discriminates against certain racial, cultural, or religious minorities since the standardized test may implicitly assume various presuppositions not shared by these minorities. Other issues in relation to power concern the authority and responsibility teachers have towards their students.

Postmodern theorists often see established educational practices as instruments of power used by elites in society to further their own interests. Important aspects in this regard are the unequal power relation between the state and its institutions in contrast to the individual as well as the control that can thus be employed due to the close connection between power and knowledge, specifically the knowledge passed on through education.

=== Equality ===
A recurrent demand on public education is that all students should be treated equally and in a fair manner. One reason for this demand is that education plays a central role for the child&#x27;s path and prospects in life, which should not be limited by unfair or arbitrary external circumstances. But there are various disagreements about how this demand is best understood and whether it is applicable in all cases. An initial problem concerns what is meant by &quot;equality&quot;. In the field of education, it is often understood as equality of opportunity. In this sense, the demand for equality implies that education should open the same opportunities to everyone. This means, among other things, that students from higher social classes should not enjoy a competitive advantage over others. One difficulty with this demand, when understood in a wide sense, is that there are many sources of educational inequality and it is not always in the best interest to eliminate all of them. For example, parents who are concerned with their young children&#x27;s education may read them bedtime stories early on and thereby provide them with a certain advantage over other children who do not enjoy this privilege. But disallowing such practices to level the field would have serious negative side-effects. A weaker position on this issue does not demand full equality but holds instead that educational policies should ensure that certain factors, like race, native language, and disabilities, do not pose obstacles to the equality of opportunity.

A closely related topic is whether all students, both high and low performers, should be treated equally. According to some, more resources should be dedicated to low performers, to help them get to an average level, while others recommend a preferential treatment for high performers in order to help them fully develop their exceptional abilities and thereby benefit society at large. A similar problem is the issue of specialization. It concerns the question of whether all students should follow the same curriculum or to what extent they should specialize early on in specific fields according to their interests and skills.

Marxist critiques of the school systems in capitalist societies often focus on the inequality they cause by sorting students for different economic positions. While overtly this process happens based on individual effort and desert, they argue that this just masks and reinforces the underlying influence of the preexisting social class structure. This is sometimes integrated into a wider Marxist perspective on society which holds that education in capitalist societies plays the role of upholding this inequality and thereby reproduces the capitalist relations of production.

Other criticisms of the dominant paradigms in education are often voiced by feminist and postmodern theorists. They usually point to alleged biases and forms of discrimination present in current practices that should be eliminated. Feminists often hold that traditional education is overly man-oriented and thereby oppresses women in some form. This bias was present to severe degrees in earlier forms of education and a lot of progress has been made towards more gender-equal forms of education. Nonetheless, feminists often contend that certain problems still persist in contemporary education. Some argue, for example, that this manifests itself in the prominence given to cognitive development in education, which is said to be associated primarily with masculinity in contrast to a more feminine approach based on emotion and intuition. A related criticism holds that there is an overemphasis on abilities belonging to the public sphere, like reason and objectivity, in contrast to equally important characteristics belonging to the private sphere, like compassion and empathy.

=== Epistemology ===
The philosophy of education is also interested in the &quot;epistemology of education&quot;. This term is often used to talk about the epistemic aims of education, i.e. questions like whether educators should aim at transmitting justified true beliefs rather than merely true beliefs or should additionally foster other epistemic virtues like critical thinking. In a different sense, the epistemology of education concerns the issue of how we arrive at knowledge on educational matters. This is especially relevant in the field of educational research, which is an active field of investigation with many studies being published on a regular basis. It is also quite influential in regard to educational policy and practice. Epistemological questions in this field concern the objectivity of its insights.

An important methodological divide in this area, often referred to as the &quot;paradigm wars&quot;, is between the &quot;quantitative&quot; or &quot;statistical approach&quot; in contrast to the &quot;qualitative&quot; or &quot;ethnographical approach&quot;. The quantitative approach usually focuses on wide experimental studies and employs statistical methods to uncover the general causal factors responsible for educational phenomena. It has been criticized based on the claim that its method, which is inspired by the natural sciences, is inappropriate for understanding the complex cultural and motivational patterns investigated by the social sciences. The qualitative approach, on the other hand, gives more weight to particular case studies for reaching its conclusions. Its opponents hold that this approach lacks the methodological rigor to arrive at well-warranted knowledge. The &quot;mixed-method research&quot; is a recent contemporary approach in which the methods of both camps are combined. The question of the most promising approach is relevant to how funding budgets are spent on research, which in its turn has important implications for policymaking.

=== Others ===
One question concerns how the learners are to be conceptualized. John Locke sees the mind as a blank slate or a tabula rasa that passively absorbs information and is filled with contents through experience. This view contrasts with a more pragmatist perspective, which in its emphasis on practice sees students not as passive absorbers but as active learners that should be encouraged to discover and learn things by themselves.

Another disputed topic is the role of testing in public education. Some theorists have argued that it is counterproductive since it puts undue pressure on the students. But testing also plays various critical roles, such as providing feedback on the learning progress both to the student, their parents, and their teachers. Concrete discussions on the role of testing often focus less on whether it should be done at all and more on how much importance should be ascribed to the test results. This also includes questions about the form of testing, for example, whether it should be standardized. Standardized tests present the same questions and scoring system to all students taking the test and are often motivated by a desire for objective and fair evaluations both of students and schools. Opponents have argued that this approach tends to favor certain social groups over others and severely limits the creativity and effectiveness of teachers.

== Philosophical movements ==
=== Existentialist ===
The existentialist sees the world as one&#x27;s personal subjectivity, where goodness, truth, and reality are individually defined. Reality is a world of existing, truth subjectively chosen, and goodness a matter of freedom. The subject matter of existentialist classrooms should be a matter of personal choice. Teachers view the individual as an entity within a social context in which the learner must confront others&#x27; views to clarify his or her own. Character development emphasizes individual responsibility for decisions. Real answers come from within the individual, not from outside authority. Examining life through authentic thinking involves students in genuine learning experiences. Existentialists are opposed to thinking about students as objects to be measured, tracked, or standardized. Such educators want the educational experience to focus on creating opportunities for self-direction and self-actualization. They start with the student, rather than on curriculum content.

===Perennialism===

Perennialists believe that one should teach the things that one deems to be of everlasting importance to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics. The focus is primarily on teaching reasoning and wisdom rather than facts, the liberal arts rather than vocational training.

=== Classical education ===

The Classical education movement advocates a form of education based in the traditions of Western culture, with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in the Middle Ages. The term &quot;classical education&quot; has been used in English for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics. By the end of the 18th century, in addition to the trivium and quadrivium of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages. In the 20th and 21st centuries it is used to refer to a broad-based study of the liberal arts and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program. Classical Education can be described as rigorous and systematic, separating children and their learning into three rigid categories, Grammar, Dialectic, and Rhetoric.

===Essentialism===

According to educational essentialism, there are certain essential facts about the world that every student needs to learn and master. It is a form of traditional education that relies on long-standing and established subjects and teaching methods. Essentialists usually focus on subjects like reading, writing, mathematics, and science, usually starting with very basic skills while progressively increasing complexity. They prefer a teacher-centered approach, meaning that the teacher acts as the authority figure guiding the learning activity while students are expected to follow their lead.

===Social reconstructionism and critical pedagogy===

Critical pedagogy is an &quot;educational movement, guided by passion and principle, to help students develop consciousness of freedom, recognize authoritarian tendencies, and connect knowledge to power and the ability to take constructive action.&quot; Based in Marxist theory, critical pedagogy draws on radical democracy, anarchism, feminism, and other movements for social justice.

===Democratic education===

Democratic education is a theory of learning and school governance in which students and staff participate freely and equally in a school democracy. In a democratic school, there is typically shared decision-making among students and staff on matters concerning living, working, and learning together.

=== Progressivism ===

Educational progressivism is the belief that education must be based on the principle that humans are social animals who learn best in real-life activities with other people. Progressivists, like proponents of most educational theories, claim to rely on the best available scientific theories of learning. Most progressive educators believe that children learn as if they were scientists, following a process similar to John Dewey&#x27;s model of learning known as &quot;the pattern of inquiry&quot;: 1) Become aware of the problem. 2) Define the problem. 3) Propose hypotheses to solve it. 4) Evaluate the consequences of the hypotheses from one&#x27;s past experience. 5) Test the likeliest solution.

===Unschooling===

Unschooling is a range of educational philosophies and practices centered on allowing children to learn through their natural life experiences, including child directed play, game play, household responsibilities, work experience, and social interaction, rather than through a more traditional school curriculum. Unschooling encourages exploration of activities led by the children themselves, facilitated by the adults. Unschooling differs from conventional schooling principally in the thesis that standard curricula and conventional grading methods, as well as other features of traditional schooling, are counterproductive to the goal of maximizing the education of each child.

===Contemplative education===
Contemplative education focuses on bringing introspective practices such as mindfulness and yoga into curricular and pedagogical processes for diverse aims grounded in secular, spiritual, religious and post-secular perspectives. Contemplative approaches may be used in the classroom, especially in tertiary or (often in modified form) in secondary education. Parker Palmer is a recent pioneer in contemplative methods. The Center for Contemplative Mind in Society founded a branch focusing on education, The Association for Contemplative Mind in Higher Education.

Contemplative methods may also be used by teachers in their preparation; Waldorf education was one of the pioneers of the latter approach. In this case, inspiration for enriching the content, format, or teaching methods may be sought through various practices, such as consciously reviewing the previous day&#x27;s activities; actively holding the students in consciousness; and contemplating inspiring pedagogical texts. Zigler suggested that only through focusing on their own spiritual development could teachers positively impact the spiritual development of students.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
==== Plato ====

Plato&#x27;s educational philosophy was grounded in a vision of an ideal &quot;Republic&quot; wherein the individual was best served by being subordinated to a just society due to a shift in emphasis that departed from his predecessors. The mind and body were to be considered separate entities. In the dialogues of Phaedo, written in his &quot;middle period&quot; (360 BCE), Plato expressed his distinctive views about the nature of knowledge, reality, and the soul:When the soul and body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, and the body to obey and serve. Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine? and which to the mortal? Does not the divine appear ... to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is subject and servant?On this premise, Plato advocated removing children from their mothers&#x27; care and raising them as wards of the state, with great care being taken to differentiate children suitable to the various castes, the highest receiving the most education, so that they could act as guardians of the city and care for the less able. Education would be holistic, including facts, skills, physical discipline, and music and art, which he considered the highest form of endeavor.

Plato believed that talent was distributed non-genetically and thus must be found in children born in any social class. He built on this by insisting that those suitably gifted were to be trained by the state so that they might be qualified to assume the role of a ruling class. What this established was essentially a system of selective public education premised on the assumption that an educated minority of the population were, by virtue of their education (and inborn educability), sufficient for healthy governance.

Plato&#x27;s writings contain some of the following ideas:
Elementary education would be confined to the guardian class till the age of 18, followed by two years of compulsory military training and then by higher education for those who qualified. While elementary education made the soul responsive to the environment, higher education helped the soul to search for truth which illuminated it. Both boys and girls receive the same kind of education. Elementary education consisted of music and gymnastics, designed to train and blend gentle and fierce qualities in the individual and create a harmonious person.

At the age of 20, a selection was made. The best students would take an advanced course in mathematics, geometry, astronomy and harmonics. The first course in the scheme of higher education would last for ten years. It would be for those who had a flair for science. At the age of 30 there would be another selection; those who qualified would study dialectics and metaphysics, logic and philosophy for the next five years. After accepting junior positions in the army for 15 years, a man would have completed his theoretical and practical education by the age of 50.

====Aristotle====
Only fragments of Aristotle&#x27;s treatise &quot;On Education&quot; are still in existence. We thus know of his philosophy of education primarily through brief passages in other works. Aristotle considered human nature, habit and reason to be equally important forces to be cultivated in education. Thus, for example, he considered repetition to be a key tool to develop good habits. The teacher was to lead the student systematically; this differs, for example, from Socrates&#x27; emphasis on questioning his listeners to bring out their own ideas (though the comparison is perhaps incongruous since Socrates was dealing with adults).

Aristotle placed great emphasis on balancing the theoretical and practical aspects of subjects taught. Subjects he explicitly mentions as being important included reading, writing and mathematics; music; physical education; literature and history; and a wide range of sciences. He also mentioned the importance of play.

One of education&#x27;s primary missions for Aristotle, perhaps its most important, was to produce good and virtuous citizens for the polis. &quot;All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on the education of youth.&quot;

=== Medieval ===
====Ibn Sina====
In the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a &quot;maktab&quot;, which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madrasahs (which referred to higher education), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, Ibn Sina (known as &quot;Avicenna&quot; in the West), wrote a chapter dealing with the &quot;maktab&quot; entitled &quot;The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children&quot;, as a guide to teachers working at &quot;maktab&quot; schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. Ibn Sina described the curriculum of a &quot;maktab&quot; school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a &quot;maktab&quot; school.

Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a &quot;maktab&quot; school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the Qur&#x27;an, Islamic metaphysics, language, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).

Ibn Sina refers to the secondary education stage of &quot;maktab&quot; schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student&#x27;s emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.

The empiricist theory of &#x27;tabula rasa&#x27; was also developed by Ibn Sina. He argued that the &quot;human intellect at birth is rather like a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know&quot; and that knowledge is attained through &quot;empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts&quot; which is developed through a &quot;syllogistic method of reasoning; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts.&quot; He further argued that the intellect itself &quot;possesses levels of development from the material intellect (&quot;al-‘aql al-hayulani&quot;), that potentiality that can acquire knowledge to the active intellect (&quot;al-‘aql al-fa‘il&quot;), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge.&quot;

====Ibn Tufail====
In the 12th century, the Andalusian-Arabian philosopher and novelist Ibn Tufail (known as &quot;Abubacer&quot; or &quot;Ebn Tophail&quot; in the West) demonstrated the empiricist theory of &#x27;tabula rasa&#x27; as a thought experiment through his Arabic philosophical novel, &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot;, in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child &quot;from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society&quot; on a desert island, through experience alone. Some scholars have argued that the Latin translation of his philosophical novel, &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, published by Edward Pococke the Younger in 1671, had an influence on John Locke&#x27;s formulation of tabula rasa in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.

=== Modern ===
==== Michel de Montaigne ====
Child education was among the psychological topics that Michel de Montaigne wrote about. His essays &quot;On the Education of Children&quot;, &quot;On Pedantry&quot;, and &quot;On Experience&quot; explain the views he had on child education. Some of his views on child education are still relevant today.

Montaigne&#x27;s views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day. He found fault both with what was taught and how it was taught. Much of the education during Montaigne&#x27;s time was focused on the reading of the classics and learning through books.Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that, to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own.

At the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated. Education by a tutor was to be conducted at the pace of the student.He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor also should allow for discussions and debates to be had. Such a dialogue was intended to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.

Individualized learning was integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information already known with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information. Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage the natural curiosity of students and allow them to question things.He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child&#x27;s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that the child is curious about.

Experience also was a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of information often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults, blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.

Montaigne&#x27;s views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne&#x27;s ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience, over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practicing an active and socially interactive lifestyle.

====John Locke====

In &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; and &quot;Of the Conduct of the Understanding&quot; John Locke composed an outline on how to educate this mind in order to increase its powers and activity:

&quot;The business of education is not, as I think, to make them perfect in any one of the sciences, but so to open and dispose their minds as may best make them capable of any, when they shall apply themselves to it.&quot;

&quot;If men are for a long time accustomed only to one sort or method of thoughts, their minds grow stiff in it, and do not readily turn to another. It is therefore to give them this freedom, that I think they should be made to look into all sorts of knowledge, and exercise their understandings in so wide a variety and stock of knowledge. But I do not propose it as a variety and stock of knowledge, but a variety and freedom of thinking, as an increase of the powers and activity of the mind, not as an enlargement of its possessions.&quot; 

Locke expressed the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an &quot;empty cabinet&quot;, with the statement, &quot;I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.&quot;

Locke also wrote that &quot;the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences.&quot; He argued that the &quot;associations of ideas&quot; that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. In his &quot;Essay&quot;, in which is introduced both of these concepts, Locke warns against, for example, letting &quot;a foolish maid&quot; convince a child that &quot;goblins and sprites&quot; are associated with the night for &quot;darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.&quot;

&quot;Associationism&quot;, as this theory would come to be called, exerted a powerful influence over eighteenth-century thought, particularly educational theory, as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of psychology and other new disciplines with David Hartley&#x27;s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his &quot;Observations on Man&quot; (1749).

====Jean-Jacques Rousseau====

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, though he paid his respects to Plato&#x27;s philosophy, rejected it as impractical due to the decayed state of society. Rousseau also had a different theory of human development; where Plato held that people are born with skills appropriate to different castes (though he did not regard these skills as being inherited), Rousseau held that there was one developmental process common to all humans. This was an intrinsic, natural process, of which the primary behavioral manifestation was curiosity. This differed from Locke&#x27;s &#x27;tabula rasa&#x27; in that it was an active process deriving from the child&#x27;s nature, which drove the child to learn and adapt to its surroundings.

Rousseau wrote in his book &quot;&quot; that all children are perfectly designed organisms, ready to learn from their surroundings so as to grow into virtuous adults, but due to the malign influence of corrupt society, they often fail to do so. Rousseau advocated an educational method which consisted of removing the child from society—for example, to a country home—and alternately conditioning him through changes to his environment and setting traps and puzzles for him to solve or overcome.

Rousseau was unusual in that he recognized and addressed the potential of a problem of legitimation for teaching. He advocated that adults always be truthful with children, and in particular that they never hide the fact that the basis for their authority in teaching was purely one of physical coercion: &quot;I&#x27;m bigger than you.&quot; Once children reached the age of reason, at about 12, they would be engaged as free individuals in the ongoing process of their own.

He once said that a child should grow up without adult interference and that the child must be guided to suffer from the experience of the natural consequences of his own acts or behaviour. When he experiences the consequences of his own acts, he advises himself.

&quot;Rousseau divides development into five stages (a book is devoted to each). Education in the first two stages seeks to the senses: only when Émile is about 12 does the tutor begin to work to develop his mind. Later, in Book 5, Rousseau examines the education of Sophie (whom Émile is to marry). Here he sets out what he sees as the essential differences that flow from sex. &#x27;The man should be strong and active; the woman should be weak and passive&#x27; (Everyman edn: 322). From this difference comes a contrasting education. They are not to be brought up in ignorance and kept to housework: Nature means them to think, to will, to love to cultivate their minds as well as their persons; she puts these weapons in their hands to make up for their lack of strength and to enable them to direct the strength of men. They should learn many things, but only such things as suitable&#x27; (Everyman edn.: 327).&quot;
Émile

==== Immanuel Kant ====
Immanuel Kant believed that education differs from training in that the former involves thinking whereas the latter does not. In addition to educating reason, of central importance to him was the development of character and teaching of moral maxims. Kant was a proponent of public education and of learning by doing.

====Charlotte Mason====
Charlotte Mason was a British educator who invested her life in improving the quality of children&#x27;s education. Her ideas led to a method used by some homeschoolers. Mason&#x27;s philosophy of education is probably best summarized by the principles given at the beginning of each of her books. Two key mottos taken from those principles are &quot;Education is an atmosphere, a discipline, a life&quot; and &quot;Education is the science of relations.&quot; She believed that children were born persons and should be respected as such; they should also be taught the Way of the Will and the Way of Reason. Her motto for students was &quot;I am, I can, I ought, I will.&quot; Charlotte Mason believed that children should be introduced to subjects through living books, not through the use of &quot;compendiums, abstracts, or selections.&quot; She used abridged books only when the content was deemed inappropriate for children. She preferred that parents or teachers read aloud those texts (such as Plutarch and the Old Testament), making omissions only where necessary.

=== 20th and 21st century ===

====Rudolf Steiner (Waldorf education)====

Waldorf education (also known as Steiner or Steiner-Waldorf education) is a humanistic approach to pedagogy based upon the educational philosophy of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Now known as Waldorf or Steiner education, his pedagogy emphasizes a balanced development of cognitive, affective/artistic, and practical skills (head, heart, and hands). Schools are normally self-administered by faculty; emphasis is placed upon giving individual teachers the freedom to develop creative methods.

Steiner&#x27;s theory of child development divides education into three discrete developmental stages predating but with close similarities to the stages of development described by Piaget. Early childhood education occurs through imitation; teachers provide practical activities and a healthy environment. Steiner believed that young children should meet only goodness. Elementary education is strongly arts-based, centered on the teacher&#x27;s creative authority; the elementary school-age child should meet beauty. Secondary education seeks to develop the judgment, intellect, and practical idealism; the adolescent should meet truth.

Learning is interdisciplinary, integrating practical, artistic, and conceptual elements. The approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning, developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component. The educational philosophy&#x27;s overarching goals are to provide young people the basis on which to develop into free, morally responsible and integrated individuals, and to help every child fulfill his or her unique destiny, the existence of which anthroposophy posits. Schools and teachers are given considerable freedom to define curricula within collegial structures.

====John Dewey====

In &quot;Democracy and Education: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education&quot;, John Dewey stated that education, in its broadest sense, is the means of the &quot;social continuity of life&quot; given the &quot;primary ineluctable facts of the birth and death of each one of the constituent members in a social group&quot;. Education is therefore a necessity, for &quot;the life of the group goes on.&quot; Dewey was a proponent of Educational Progressivism and was a relentless campaigner for reform of education, pointing out that the authoritarian, strict, pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge, and not enough with understanding students&#x27; actual experiences.

In 1896, Dewey opened the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago in an institutional effort to pursue together rather than apart &quot;utility and culture, absorption and expression, theory and practice, [which] are [indispensable] elements in any educational scheme. As the unified head of the departments of Philosophy, Psychology and Pedagogy, John Dewey articulated a desire to organize an educational experience where children could be more creative than the best of progressive models of his day. Transactionalism as a pragmatic philosophy grew out of the work he did in the Laboratory School. The two most influential works that stemmed from his research and study were &quot;The Child and the Curriculum&quot; (1902) and &quot;Democracy and Education&quot; (1916). Dewey wrote of the dualisms that plagued educational philosophy in the latter book: &quot;Instead of seeing the educative process steadily and as a whole, we see conflicting terms. We get the case of the child vs. the curriculum; of the individual nature vs. social culture.&quot; Dewey found that the preoccupation with facts as knowledge in the educative process led students to memorize &quot;ill-understood rules and principles&quot; and while second-hand knowledge learned in mere words is a beginning in study, mere words can never replace the ability to organize knowledge into both useful and valuable experience.

====Maria Montessori====

The Montessori method arose from Dr. Maria Montessori&#x27;s discovery of what she referred to as &quot;the child&#x27;s true normal nature&quot; in 1907, which happened in the process of her experimental observation of young children given freedom in an environment prepared with materials designed for their self-directed learning activity. The method itself aims to duplicate this experimental observation of children to bring about, sustain and support their true natural way of being.

====William Heard Kilpatrick====
William Heard Kilpatrick was a US American philosopher of education and a colleague and a successor of John Dewey. He was a major figure in the progressive education movement of the early 20th century. Kilpatrick developed the Project Method for early childhood education, which was a form of Progressive Education organized curriculum and classroom activities around a subject&#x27;s central theme. He believed that the role of a teacher should be that of a &quot;guide&quot; as opposed to an authoritarian figure. Kilpatrick believed that children should direct their own learning according to their interests and should be allowed to explore their environment, experiencing their learning through the natural senses. Proponents of Progressive Education and the Project Method reject traditional schooling that focuses on memorization, rote learning, strictly organized classrooms (desks in rows; students always seated), and typical forms of assessment.

====William Chandler Bagley====
William Chandler Bagley taught in elementary schools before becoming a professor of education at the University of Illinois, where he served as the Director of the School of Education from 1908 until 1917. He was a professor of education at Teachers College, Columbia, from 1917 to 1940. An opponent of pragmatism and progressive education, Bagley insisted on the value of knowledge for its own sake, not merely as an instrument, and he criticized his colleagues for their failure to emphasize systematic study of academic subjects. Bagley was a proponent of educational essentialism.

====A. S. Neill====
A. S. Neill founded Summerhill School, the oldest existing democratic school in Suffolk, England, in 1921. He wrote a number of books that now define much of contemporary democratic education philosophy. Neill believed that the happiness of the child should be the paramount consideration in decisions about the child&#x27;s upbringing, and that this happiness grew from a sense of personal freedom. He felt that deprivation of this sense of freedom during childhood, and the consequent unhappiness experienced by the repressed child, was responsible for many of the psychological disorders of adulthood.

====Martin Heidegger====
Martin Heidegger&#x27;s philosophizing about education was primarily related to higher education. He believed that teaching and research in the university should be unified and that students should be taught &quot;to focus on and explicitly investigate the ontological presuppositions which implicitly guide research in each domain of knowledge,” an approach he believed would &quot;encourage revolutionary transformation in the sciences and humanities.&quot;

====Jean Piaget====
Jean Piaget was a Swiss developmental psychologist known for his epistemological studies with children. His theory of cognitive development and epistemological view are together called &quot;genetic epistemology&quot;. Piaget placed great importance on the education of children. As the Director of the International Bureau of Education, he declared in 1934 that &quot;only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse, whether violent, or gradual.&quot; Piaget created the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva in 1955 and directed it until 1980. According to Ernst von Glasersfeld, Jean Piaget is &quot;the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing.&quot;

Jean Piaget described himself as an epistemologist, interested in the process of the qualitative development of knowledge. As he says in the introduction of his book &quot;Genetic Epistemology&quot; (): &quot;What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge.&quot;

====Mortimer Jerome Adler====
Mortimer Jerome Adler was an American philosopher, educator, and popular author. As a philosopher he worked within the Aristotelian and Thomistic traditions. He lived for the longest stretches in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, and San Mateo, California. He worked for Columbia University, the University of Chicago, Encyclopædia Britannica, and Adler&#x27;s own Institute for Philosophical Research. Adler was married twice and had four children. Adler was a proponent of educational perennialism.

====Harry S. Broudy====
Harry S. Broudy&#x27;s philosophical views were based on the tradition of classical realism, dealing with truth, goodness, and beauty. However he was also influenced by the modern philosophy existentialism and instrumentalism. In his textbook Building a Philosophy of Education he has two major ideas that are the main points to his philosophical outlook: The first is truth and the second is universal structures to be found in humanity&#x27;s struggle for education and the good life. Broudy also studied issues on society&#x27;s demands on school. He thought education would be a link to unify the diverse society and urged the society to put more trust and a commitment to the schools and a good education.

====Jerome Bruner====
Another important contributor to the inquiry method in education is Jerome Bruner. His books &quot;The Process of Education&quot; and &quot;Toward a Theory of Instruction&quot; are landmarks in conceptualizing learning and curriculum development. He argued that any subject can be taught in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of development. This notion was an underpinning for his concept of the &quot;spiral&quot; (helical) curriculum which posited the idea that a curriculum should revisit basic ideas, building on them until the student had grasped the full formal concept. He emphasized intuition as a neglected but essential feature of productive thinking. He felt that interest in the material being learned was the best stimulus for learning rather than external motivation such as grades. Bruner developed the concept of discovery learning which promoted learning as a process of constructing new ideas based on current or past knowledge. Students are encouraged to discover facts and relationships and continually build on what they already know.

====Paulo Freire====

A Brazilian philosopher and educator committed to the cause of educating the impoverished peasants of his nation and collaborating with them in the pursuit of their liberation from what he regarded as &quot;oppression&quot;, Paulo Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the &quot;banking concept of education&quot;, in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. Freire also suggests that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student; he comes close to suggesting that the teacher-student dichotomy be completely abolished, instead promoting the roles of the participants in the classroom as the teacher-student (a teacher who learns) and the student-teacher (a learner who teaches). In its early, strong form this kind of classroom has sometimes been criticized on the grounds that it can mask rather than overcome the teacher&#x27;s authority.

Aspects of the Freirian philosophy have been highly influential in academic debates over &quot;participatory development&quot; and development more generally. Freire&#x27;s emphasis on what he describes as &quot;emancipation&quot; through interactive participation has been used as a rationale for the participatory focus of development, as it is held that &#x27;participation&#x27; in any form can lead to empowerment of poor or marginalised groups. Freire was a proponent of critical pedagogy.
&quot;He participated in the import of European doctrines and ideas into Brazil,
assimilated them to the needs of a specific socio-economic situation, and thus expanded and refocused them in a thought-provoking way&quot;

====John Holt====
In 1964 John Holt published his first book, &quot;How Children Fail&quot;, asserting that the academic failure of schoolchildren was not &quot;despite&quot; the efforts of the schools, but actually &quot;because&quot; of the schools. &quot;How Children Fail&quot; ignited a firestorm of controversy. Holt was catapulted into the American national consciousness to the extent that he made appearances on major TV talk shows, wrote book reviews for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and was a guest on the &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; TV game show. In his follow-up work, &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, published in 1967, Holt tried to elucidate the learning process of children and why he believed school short circuits that process.

====Nel Noddings====
Nel Noddings&#x27; first sole-authored book &quot;Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education&quot; (1984) followed close on the 1982 publication of Carol Gilligan&#x27;s ground-breaking work in the ethics of care &quot;In a Different Voice&quot;. While her work on ethics continued, with the publication of &quot;Women and Evil&quot; (1989) and later works on moral education, most of her later publications have been on the philosophy of education and educational theory. Her most significant works in these areas have been &quot;Educating for Intelligent Belief or Unbelief&quot; (1993) and &quot;Philosophy of Education&quot; (1995).

Noddings&#x27; contribution to education philosophy centers around the ethic of care. Her belief was that a caring teacher-student relationship will result in the teacher designing a differentiated curriculum for each student, and that this curriculum would be based around the students&#x27; particular interests and needs. The teacher&#x27;s claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the students&#x27; welfare.

<text>Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that examines personality and its variation among individuals. It aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces. Its areas of focus include:

* Describing what personality is
* Documenting how personalities develop
* Explaining the mental processes of personality and how they affect functioning
* Providing a framework for understanding individuals

&quot;Personality&quot; is a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by an individual that uniquely influences their environment, cognition, emotions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations. The word &quot;personality&quot; originates from the Latin &quot;persona&quot;, which means &quot;mask&quot;.

Personality also pertains to the pattern of thoughts, feelings, social adjustments, and behaviors persistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one&#x27;s expectations, self-perceptions, values, and attitudes. Environmental and situational effects on behaviour are influenced by psychological mechanisms within a person. Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and stress. Gordon Allport (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the idiographic. &quot;Nomothetic psychology&quot; seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of self-actualization or the trait of extraversion. &quot;Idiographic psychology&quot; is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.

The study of personality has a broad and varied history in psychology, with an abundance of theoretical traditions. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. Many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven – such as dimensional models, based on multivariate statistics like factor analysis – or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the psychodynamic theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in abnormal psychology or clinical psychology.

==Philosophical assumptions==
Many of the ideas conceptualized by historical and modern personality theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of art, science, and philosophy to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:

* Freedom versus determinism – This is the question of whether humans have control over their own behavior and understand the motives behind it, or if their behavior is causally determined by forces beyond their control. Behavior is categorized as being either unconscious, environmental or biological by various theories.
* Heredity (nature) versus environment (nurture) – Personality is thought to be determined largely either by genetics and biology, or by environment and experiences. Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on the joint influence of genetics and environment. One of the forerunners in this arena is C. Robert Cloninger, who pioneered the Temperament and Character model.
* Uniqueness versus universality – This question discusses the extent of each human&#x27;s individuality (uniqueness) or similarity in nature (universality). Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and cognitive theorists, in contrast, emphasize the importance of universal principles, such as reinforcement and self-efficacy.
* Active versus reactive – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) or through outside stimuli. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans play a more active role. Most modern theorists agree that both are important, with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits and situational factors being the primary predictor of behavior in the short term.
* Optimistic versus pessimistic – Personality theories differ with regard to whether humans are integral in the changing of their own personalities. Theories that place a great deal of emphasis on learning are often more optimistic than those that do not.

== Personality theories ==

=== Type and trait theories ===

Personality type refers to the psychological classification of people into different classes. Personality types are distinguished from personality traits, which come in different degrees. For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle.

Personality is complex; a typical theory of personality contains several propositions or sub-theories, often growing over time as more psychologists explore the theory.

The most widely accepted empirical model of durable, universal personality descriptors is the system of Big Five personality traits: conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion-introversion. It is based on cluster analysis of verbal descriptions in self-reporting surveys. These traits demonstrate considerable genetic heritability.

Perhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the personality typology outlined by the Indian Buddhist Abhidharma schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive meditation practices used to counter those traits.

An influential European tradition of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of Carl Jung, specifically in his 1921 book &quot;Psychologische Typen&quot; (&quot;Psychological Types&quot;) and William Marston.

Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. This model was later used by David Keirsey with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers.

In the former Soviet Union, Lithuanian Aušra Augustinavičiūtė independently derived a model of personality type from Jung&#x27;s called socionics. Later on many other tests were developed on this model e.g. Golden, PTI-Pro and JTI.

Theories could also be considered an &quot;approach&quot; to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model. The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:

* &quot;Perceiving functions:&quot; sensing and intuition (trust in concrete, sensory-oriented facts vs. trust in abstract concepts and imagined possibilities)
* &quot;Judging functions:&quot; thinking and feeling (basing decisions primarily on logic vs. deciding based on emotion).

Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world. Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgement) or to keep options open (perception).

This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people&#x27;s behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics. In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into &quot;N&quot; (intuitive) or &quot;S&quot; (sensing) personality types. An &quot;N&quot; is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the &quot;NT&quot; (scientist, engineer) or &quot;NF&quot; (author, humanitarian) temperament. An &quot;S&quot;, in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the &quot;SJ&quot; (guardian, traditionalist) or &quot;SP&quot; (performer, artisan) temperament. These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions), and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice. This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances. (The MBTI is not designed to measure the &quot;work self&quot;, but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the &quot;shoes-off self.&quot;)

Type A and Type B personality theory: During the 1950s, Meyer Friedman and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are &quot;stress junkies.&quot; Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.

Health Psychology, a field of study, has been influenced by the Type A and Type B personality theories, which reveal how personality traits can impact cardiovascular health. Type A individuals, known for their competitiveness and urgency, may increase the risk of conditions like high blood pressure and coronary heart disease.

Day and Jreige (2002) investigate the Type A behavior pattern as a mediator in the relationship between job stressors and psychosocial outcomes. Their study, published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, demonstrates that individuals exhibiting Type A characteristics are more susceptible to adverse psychosocial effects, such as increased stress and lower job satisfaction, when exposed to workplace stressors. This research highlights the importance of considering personality traits in managing occupational health.

Eduard Spranger&#x27;s personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of &quot;value attitudes&quot;, described in his book &quot;Types of Men&quot; (&quot;Lebensformen&quot;; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).

The Enneagram of Personality, a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.

John L. Holland&#x27;s &quot;RIASEC&quot; vocational model, commonly referred to as the &quot;Holland Codes&quot;, focuses specifically on choice of occupation. It proposes that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.

=== Psychoanalytical theories ===

Psychoanalytic theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. Sigmund Freud was the founder of this school of thought. He drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term psychodynamics. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, Freud proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. His theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.

Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the id, ego and super-ego. The id acts according to the &quot;pleasure principle&quot;, demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the ego then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the &quot;reality principle&quot;. Finally, the superego (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.

The channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the &quot;Eros&quot; (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and &quot;Thanatos&quot; (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory. Freud&#x27;s broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.

Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five. Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.

One of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s earlier associates, Alfred Adler, agreed with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development, and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious. He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn&#x27;s achievements. He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed to their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.

Heinz Kohut thought similarly to Freud&#x27;s idea of transference. He used narcissism as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one&#x27;s low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud&#x27;s theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the &#x27;self-object transferences&#x27; of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally &quot;sink into&quot; and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. Such experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.

Another important figure in the world of personality theory is Karen Horney. She is credited with the development of &quot;Feminist Psychology&quot;. She disagrees with Freud on some key points, one being that women&#x27;s personalities are not just a function of &quot;Penis Envy&quot;, but that girl children have separate and different psychic lives unrelated to how they feel about their fathers or primary male role models. She talks about three basic Neurotic needs &quot;Basic Anxiety&quot;, &quot;Basic Hostility&quot; and &quot;Basic Evil&quot;. She posits that to any anxiety an individual experiences they would have one of three approaches, moving toward people, moving away from people or moving against people. It is these three that give us varying personality types and characteristics. She also places a high premium on concepts like Overvaluation of Love and romantic partners.

=== Behaviorist theories ===

Behaviorists explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior. The approaches used to evaluate the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or &quot;the organism&quot; with its environment. Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child&#x27;s crying in the past has led to attention. These are the &quot;response&quot;, and &quot;consequences&quot;. The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people&#x27;s behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. Skinner put forward a &quot;three term contingency model&quot; which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the &quot;Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model&quot; in which the critical question is: &quot;Under which circumstances or antecedent &#x27;stimuli&#x27; does the organism engage in a particular behavior or &#x27;response&#x27;, which in turn produces a particular &#x27;consequence&#x27;?&quot;

Richard Herrnstein extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits. An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable. Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion. Herrnstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.

Ivan Pavlov is another notable influence. He is well known for his classical conditioning experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.

=== Social cognitive theories ===

In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.

Albert Bandura, a social learning theorist suggested the forces of memory and emotions worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his &quot;Bobo doll experiment&quot;. During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.

Early examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982). These include Witkin&#x27;s (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner&#x27;s (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorize heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen&#x27;s (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to ego psychology. More central to this field have been:

* Attributional style theory dealing with different ways in which people explain events in their lives. This approach builds upon locus of control, but extends it by stating we also need to consider whether people attribute to stable causes or variable causes, and to global causes or specific causes.

Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale. Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Attributions Questionnaire, the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.

* Achievement style theory focuses upon identification of an individual&#x27;s Locus of Control tendency, such as by Rotter&#x27;s evaluations, and was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte to provide valuable information for improving academic performance of students. Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely to persist to better academic performance levels, presenting an achievement personality, according to Cassandra B. Whyte.

Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement. Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.

Walter Mischel (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to &quot;Cognitive Affective Units&quot;, and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term &quot;Cognitive Affective Units&quot; shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.

Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory. Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system. The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven. The rational system is slow and logic-driven. These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.

Personal construct psychology (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist George Kelly in the 1950s. Kelly&#x27;s fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one&#x27;s changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (mental disorders.)
From the theory, Kelly derived a psychotherapy approach and also a technique called &quot;The Repertory Grid Interview&quot; that helped his patients to uncover their own &quot;constructs&quot; with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The repertory grid was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people&#x27;s world-views.

=== Humanistic theories ===
Humanistic psychology emphasizes that people have free will and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior. Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers were proponents of this view, which is based on the &quot;phenomenal field&quot; theory of Combs and Snygg (1949). Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;. This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.

Robert W. White wrote the book &quot;The Abnormal Personality&quot; that became a standard text on abnormal psychology. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of Freud on the pathological elements of personality development.

Maslow spent much of his time studying what he called &quot;self-actualizing persons&quot;, those who are &quot;fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing&quot;. Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:
# Awareness – maintaining constant enjoyment and awe of life. These individuals often experienced a &quot;peak experience&quot;. He defined a peak experience as an &quot;intensification of any experience to the degree there is a loss or transcendence of self&quot;. A peak experience is one in which an individual perceives an expansion of themselves, and detects a unity and meaningfulness in life. Intense concentration on an activity one is involved in, such as running a marathon, may invoke a peak experience.
# Reality and problem centered – having a tendency to be concerned with &quot;problems&quot; in surroundings.
# Acceptance/Spontaneity – accepting surroundings and what cannot be changed.
# Unhostile sense of humor/democratic – do not take kindly to joking about others, which can be viewed as offensive. They have friends of all backgrounds and religions and hold very close friendships.

Maslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy – he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client&#x27;s viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, &quot;It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage&quot;. This response type seeks to clarify the therapist&#x27;s understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.

=== Biopsychological theories ===


Biology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities. Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of Phineas Gage. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage&#x27;s head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions of these psychological changes are usually exaggerated.

In general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and more recently functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain. This line of research has led to the developing field of personality neuroscience, which uses neuroscientific methods to study the neural underpinnings of personality traits. 

====Genetic basis of personality====
Ever since the Human Genome Project allowed for a much more in depth comprehension of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.

Previously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today&#x27;s view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as behavioral genetics. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.

DNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. While different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what leads to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.

Cattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a powerful influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from twin studies. This &quot;twin method&quot; compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical twins. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.

Twin studies have also been important in the creation of the five factor personality model: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. Individuals scoring high in trait extraversion more often display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. Individuals scoring high in trait neuroticism are more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20. It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one&#x27;s personality.

===Evolutionary theory===

Charles Darwin is the founder of the theory of the evolution of the species. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory. This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on natural selection. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism&#x27;s environment and how these traits aid in an organism&#x27;s survival and reproduction.

Polymorphisms, such as sex and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole. The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary biology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance. The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.

=== Drive theories===

In the 1930s, John Dollard and Neal Elgar Miller met at Yale University, and began an attempt to integrate drives (see Drive theory), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of Clark Hull. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives.

Secondary drives are internal needs directing the behavior of an individual that results from learning. Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by classical conditioning. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment. When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus. Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist&#x27;s office.

Secondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist. Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence. Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.

Secondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.

Secondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others. Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive). Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development. As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement. Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious. Dollard and Miller&#x27;s belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of psychosexual development. They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.

Dollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should. These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality. This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.

==Personality tests==

There are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.

&quot;Projective tests&quot; assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the Rorschach test and the Thematic Apperception Test.

The Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of &quot;perceived images&quot; and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual&#x27;s personality and their unique characteristics. The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person&#x27;s response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.

The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these &quot;scenes&quot; include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom. Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.

&quot;Objective tests&quot; assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on Carl Jung&#x27;s Psychological Types. However, the MBTI modified Jung&#x27;s theory into their own by disregarding certain processes held in the unconscious mind and the impact these have on personality.

===Personality theory assessment criteria===

* Verifiability – the theory should be formulated in such a way that the concepts, suggestions and hypotheses involved in it are defined clearly and unambiguously, and logically related to each other.
* Heuristic value – to what extent the theory stimulates scientists to conduct further research.
* Internal consistency – the theory should be free from internal contradictions.
* Economy – the fewer concepts and assumptions required by the theory to explain any phenomenon, the better it is 

Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain. In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is qualia. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one&#x27;s character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.

===Methods measuring inner experience===
Descriptive experience sampling (DES): Developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an idiographic method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual&#x27;s inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.

Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person&#x27;s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects&#x27; thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.

Experimental method: This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized. The experimental method does have some complications though. If researchers are manipulating a variable, it&#x27;s possible this change will affect a different variable, which in turn will change the measured result (not the original manipulated condition), introducing uncertainty. This method, in personality research, often requires deception, so the ethics of experiments are also brought into question.

<text>In linguistics and grammar, a pronoun (glossed ) is a word or a group of words that one may substitute for a noun or noun phrase.

Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform cross-linguistically. An example of a pronoun is &quot;you&quot;, which can be either singular or plural. Sub-types include personal and possessive pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative and interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.

The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. For example, in the sentence &quot;That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat&quot;, the meaning of the pronoun &quot;he&quot; is dependent on its antecedent, &quot;that poor man&quot;.

The adjective form of the word &quot;pronoun&quot; is &quot;pronominal&quot;. A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in &quot;That&#x27;s not the one I wanted&quot;, the phrase &quot;the one&quot; (containing the prop-word &quot;one&quot;) is a pronominal.

== Theory ==

=== Pronoun versus pro-form ===
Pronoun is a category of words. A pro-form is a type of function word or expression that stands in for (expresses the same content as) another word, phrase, clause or sentence where the meaning is recoverable from the context. In English, pronouns mostly function as pro-forms, but there are pronouns that are not pro-forms and pro-forms that are not pronouns.[p. 239]

Examples [1 &amp; 2] are pronouns and pro-forms. In [1], the pronoun &quot;it&quot; &quot;stands in&quot; for whatever was mentioned and is a good idea. In [2], the relative pronoun &quot;who&quot; stands in for &quot;the people&quot;.

Examples [3 &amp; 4] are pronouns but not pro-forms. In [3], the interrogative pronoun &quot;who&quot; does not stand in for anything. Similarly, in [4], &quot;it&quot; is a dummy pronoun, one that does not stand in for anything. No other word can function there with the same meaning; we do not say &quot;the sky is raining&quot; or &quot;the weather is raining&quot;.

A prop-word is a word with little or no semantic content used where grammar dictates a certain sentence member, e.g., to provide a &quot;support&quot; on which to hang a modifier. The word most commonly considered as a prop-word in English is &quot;one&quot; (with the plural form &quot;ones&quot;). The prop-word &quot;one&quot; takes the place of a countable noun in a noun phrase (or determiner phrase), normally in a context where it is clear which noun it is replacing. For example, in a context in which hats are being talked about, &quot;the red one&quot; means &quot;the red hat&quot;, and &quot;the ones we bought&quot; means &quot;the hats we bought&quot;. The prop-word thus functions somewhat similarly to a pronoun, except that a pronoun usually takes the place of a whole noun (determiner) phrase (for example, &quot;the red hat&quot; may be replaced by the pronoun &quot;it&quot;.)

Finally, in [5 &amp; 6], there are pro-forms that are not pronouns. In [5], &quot;did so&quot; is a verb phrase that stands in for &quot;helped&quot; (a &quot;pro-verb&quot;), inflected from &quot;to help&quot; stated earlier in the sentence. Similarly, in [6], &quot;others&quot; is a common noun, not a pronoun, but &quot;the others&quot; probably stands in for the names of other people involved (e.g., &quot;Sho, Alana, and Ali&quot;), all proper nouns.

=== Grammar ===
Pronouns () are listed as one of eight parts of speech in &quot;The Art of Grammar&quot;, a treatise on Greek grammar attributed to Dionysius Thrax and dating from the 2nd century BC. The pronoun is described there as &quot;a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person.&quot; Pronouns continued to be regarded as a part of speech in Latin grammar (the Latin term being , from which the English name – through Middle French – ultimately derives), and thus in the European tradition generally.

Because of the many different syntactic roles that they play, pronouns are less likely to be a single word class in more modern approaches to grammar.

=== Linguistics ===

Linguists in particular have trouble classifying pronouns in a single category, and some do not agree that pronouns substitute nouns or noun categories. Certain types of pronouns are often identical or similar in form to determiners with related meaning; some English examples are given in the table.
This observation has led some linguists, such as Paul Postal, to regard pronouns as determiners that have had their following noun or noun phrase deleted. (Such patterning can even be claimed for certain personal pronouns; for example, &quot;we&quot; and &quot;you&quot; might be analyzed as determiners in phrases like &quot;we Brits&quot; and &quot;you tennis players&quot;.) Other linguists have taken a similar view, uniting pronouns and determiners into a single class, sometimes called &quot;determiner-pronoun&quot;, or regarding determiners as a subclass of pronouns or vice versa. The distinction may be considered to be one of subcategorization or valency, rather like the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs – determiners take a noun phrase complement like transitive verbs do, while pronouns do not. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase. Cross-linguistically, it seems as though pronouns share 3 distinct categories: point of view, person, and number. The breadth of each subcategory however tends to differ among languages.

==== Binding theory and antecedents ====
The use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. The referent of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the antecedent of the pronoun. The grammatical behavior of certain types of pronouns, and in particular their possible relationship with their antecedents, has been the focus of studies in binding, notably in the Chomskyan government and binding theory. In this binding context, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns in English (such as &quot;himself&quot; and &quot;each other&quot;) are referred to as anaphors (in a specialized restricted sense) rather than as pronominal elements. Under binding theory, specific principles apply to different sets of pronouns. 
In English, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns must adhere to Principle A: an anaphor (reflexive or reciprocal, such as &quot;each other&quot;) must be bound in its governing category (roughly, the clause). Therefore, in syntactic structure it must be lower in structure (it must have an antecedent) and have a direct relationship with its referent. This is called a C-command relationship. For instance, we see that &quot;John cut himself&quot; is grammatical, but &quot;Himself cut John&quot; is not, despite having identical arguments, since &quot;himself&quot;, the reflexive, must be lower in structure to John, its referent. Additionally, we see examples like &quot;John said that Mary cut himself&quot; are not grammatical because there is an intermediary noun, &quot;Mary&quot;, that disallows the two referents from having a direct relationship.
On the other hand, personal pronouns (such as &quot;him&quot; or &quot;them&quot;) must adhere to Principle B: a pronoun must be free (i.e., not bound) within its governing category (roughly, the clause). This means that although the pronouns can have a referent, they cannot have a direct relationship with the referent where the referent selects the pronoun. For instance, &quot;John said Mary cut him&quot; is grammatical because the two co-referents, &quot;John&quot; and &quot;him&quot; are separated structurally by &quot;Mary&quot;. This is why a sentence like &quot;John cut him&quot; where &quot;him&quot; refers to &quot;John&quot; is ungrammatical.

===== Binding cross-linguistically =====

The type of binding that applies to subsets of pronouns varies cross-linguistically. For instance, in German linguistics, pronouns can be split into two distinct categories — personal pronouns and d-pronouns. Although personal pronouns act identically to English personal pronouns (i.e. follow Principle B), d-pronouns follow yet another principle, Principle C, and function similarly to nouns in that they cannot have a direct relationship to an antecedent.

===== Antecedents =====
The following sentences give examples of particular types of pronouns used with antecedents:

*Third-person personal pronouns:
**&quot;That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat.&quot; (the noun phrase &quot;that poor man&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;he&quot;)
**&quot;Julia arrived yesterday. I met her at the station.&quot; (&quot;Julia&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;her&quot;)
**&quot;When they saw us, the lions began roaring&quot; (&quot;the lions&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;they&quot;; as it comes after the pronoun it may be called a &quot;postcedent&quot;)
*Other personal pronouns in some circumstances:
**&quot;Terry and I were hoping no one would find us.&quot; (&quot;Terry and I&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;us&quot;)
**&quot;You and Alice can come if you like.&quot; (&quot;you and Alice&quot; is the antecedent of the second – plural – &quot;you&quot;)
*Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns:
**&quot;Jack hurt himself.&quot; (&quot;Jack&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;himself&quot;)
**&quot;We were teasing each other.&quot; (&quot;we&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;each other&quot;)
*Relative pronouns:
**&quot;The woman who looked at you is my sister.&quot; (&quot;the woman&quot; is the antecedent of &quot;who&quot;)

Some other types, such as indefinite pronouns, are usually used without antecedents. Relative pronouns are used without antecedents in free relative clauses. Even third-person personal pronouns are sometimes used without antecedents (&quot;unprecursed&quot;) – this applies to special uses such as dummy pronouns and generic &quot;they&quot;, as well as cases where the referent is implied by the context.

== English pronouns ==
English pronouns have often traditionally been classified as different from nouns, but at least one modern grammar defines them as a subclass of nouns.

English personal pronouns have a number of different syntactic contexts (Subject, Object, Possessive, Reflexive) and many features:

* person (1st, 2nd, 3rd);
* number (singular, plural);
* gender (masculine, feminine, neuter or inanimate, epicene)

English also has other pronoun types, including demonstrative, relative, indefinite, and interrogative pronouns:

===Personal and possessive===

==== Personal ====

Personal pronouns may be classified by person, number, gender and case. English has three persons (first, second and third) and two numbers (singular and plural); in the third person singular there are also distinct pronoun forms for male, female and neuter gender. Principal forms are shown in the adjacent table.

English personal pronouns have two cases, &quot;subject&quot; and &quot;object&quot;. Subject pronouns are used in subject position (I like to eat chips, but she does not&quot;). Object pronouns are used for the object of a verb or preposition (&quot;John likes me but not her).

Other distinct forms found in some languages include:

*Second person informal and formal pronouns (the T–V distinction), like &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;vous&quot; in French. Formal second person pronouns can also signify plurality in many languages. There is no such distinction in standard modern English, though Elizabethan English marked the distinction with &quot;thou&quot; (singular informal) and &quot;you&quot; (plural or singular formal). Some dialects of English have developed informal plural second person pronouns, for instance, &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; (Southern American English) and &quot;you guys&quot; (American English).
*Inclusive and exclusive first person plural pronouns, which indicate whether or not the audience is included, that is, whether &quot;we&quot; means &quot;you and I&quot; or &quot;they and I&quot;. There is no such distinction in English.
*Intensive (emphatic) pronouns, which re-emphasize a noun or pronoun that has already been mentioned. English uses the same forms as the reflexive pronouns; for example: &quot;I did it myself&quot; (contrast reflexive use, &quot;I did it to myself&quot;).
*Direct and indirect object pronouns, such as &quot;le&quot; and &quot;lui&quot; in French. English uses the same form for both; for example: &quot;Mary loves him&quot; (direct object); &quot;Mary sent him a letter&quot; (indirect object).
*Prepositional pronouns, used after a preposition. English uses ordinary object pronouns here: &quot;Mary looked at him&quot;.
*Disjunctive pronouns, used in isolation or in certain other special grammatical contexts, like &quot;moi&quot; in French. No distinct forms exist in English; for example: &quot;Who does this belong to? Me.&quot;
*Strong and weak forms of certain pronouns, found in some languages such as Polish.
*Pronoun avoidance, where personal pronouns are substituted by titles or kinship terms (particularly common in South-East Asia).

====Possessive====

Possessive pronouns are used to indicate possession (in a broad sense). Some occur as independent noun phrases: &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, &quot;hers&quot;, &quot;ours&quot;, &quot;theirs&quot;. An example is: &quot;Those clothes are mine.&quot; Others act as a determiner and must accompany a noun: &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, as in: &quot;I lost my wallet.&quot; (&quot;His&quot; and &quot;its&quot; can fall into either category, although &quot;its&quot; is nearly always found in the second.) Those of the second type have traditionally also been described as possessive adjectives, and in more modern terminology as possessive determiners. The term &quot;possessive pronoun&quot; is sometimes restricted to the first type. Both types replace possessive noun phrases. As an example, Their crusade to capture our attention&quot; could replace The advertisers&#x27; crusade to capture our attention.&quot;

===Reflexive and reciprocal===

Reflexive pronouns are used when a person or thing acts on itself, for example, &quot;John cut himself.&quot; In English they all end in &quot;-self&quot; or &quot;-selves&quot; and must refer to a noun phrase elsewhere in the same clause.

Reciprocal pronouns refer to a reciprocal relationship (&quot;each other&quot;, &quot;one another&quot;). They must refer to a noun phrase in the same clause. An example in English is: &quot;They do not like each other.&quot; In some languages, the same forms can be used as both reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.

===Demonstrative===

Demonstrative pronouns (in English, &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot; and their plurals &quot;these&quot;, &quot;those&quot;) often distinguish their targets by pointing or some other indication of position; for example, &quot;I&#x27;ll take these.&quot; They may also be &quot;anaphoric&quot;, depending on an earlier expression for context, for example, &quot;A kid actor would try to be all sweet, and who needs that?&quot;

===Indefinite===

Indefinite pronouns, the largest group of pronouns, refer to one or more unspecified persons or things. One group in English includes compounds of &quot;some-&quot;, &quot;any-&quot;, &quot;every-&quot; and &quot;no-&quot; with &quot;-thing&quot;, &quot;-one&quot; and &quot;-body&quot;, for example: &quot;Anyone can do that.&quot; Another group, including &quot;many&quot;, &quot;more&quot;, &quot;both&quot;, and &quot;most&quot;, can appear alone or followed by &quot;of&quot;. In addition,

*Distributive pronouns are used to refer to members of a group separately rather than collectively. (&quot;To each his own.&quot;)
*Negative pronouns indicate the non-existence of people or things. (&quot;Nobody thinks that.&quot;)
*Impersonal pronouns normally refer to a person but are not specific as to first, second or third person in the way that the personal pronouns are. (&quot;One does not clean one&#x27;s own windows.&quot;)

=== Relative and interrogative ===

==== Relative ====

Relative pronouns in English include &quot;who&quot;, &quot;whom&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;which&quot; and &quot;that&quot;. They rely on an antecedent, and refer back to people or things previously mentioned: &quot;People who smoke should quit now.&quot; They are used in relative clauses. Relative pronouns can also be used as complementizers.

==== Interrogative ====

Relative pronouns can be used in an interrogative setting as interrogative pronouns. Interrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use &quot;who&quot; (subject), &quot;whom&quot; (object) or &quot;whose&quot; (possessive); for example, &quot;Who did that?&quot; In colloquial speech, &quot;whom&quot; is generally replaced by &quot;who&quot;. English non-personal interrogative pronouns (&quot;which&quot; and &quot;what&quot;) have only one form.

In English and many other languages (e.g. French and Czech), the sets of relative and interrogative pronouns are nearly identical. Compare English: &quot;Who is that?&quot; (interrogative) and &quot;I know the woman who came&quot; (relative). In some other languages, interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns are frequently identical; for example, Standard Chinese means &quot;what?&quot; as well as &quot;something&quot; or &quot;anything&quot;.

===Archaic forms===
Though the personal pronouns described above are the current English pronouns, Early Modern English (as used by Shakespeare, for example) use a slightly different set of personal pronouns, shown in the table. The difference is entirely in the second person. Though one would rarely find these older forms used in recent literature, they are nevertheless considered part of Modern English.

===Kinship===
In English, kin terms like &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;cousin&quot; are a distinct word class from pronouns; however many Australian Aboriginal languages have more elaborated systems of encoding kinship in language including special kin forms of pronouns. In Murrinh-patha, for example, when selecting a nonsingular exclusive pronoun to refer to a group, the speaker will assess whether or not the members of the group belong to a common class of gender or kinship. If all of the members of the referent group are male, the MASCULINE form will be selected; if at least one is female, the FEMININE is selected, but if all the members are in a sibling-like kinship relation, a third SIBLING form is selected. In Arabana-Wangkangurru, the speaker will use entirely different sets of pronouns depending on whether the speaker and the referent are or are not in a common moiety. See the following example:

See Australian Aboriginal kinship for more details.

=== Special uses ===
Some special uses of personal pronouns include:

*Generic &quot;you&quot;, where second person pronouns are used in an indefinite sense: &quot;You can&#x27;t buy good old-fashioned bulbs these days.&quot;
*Generic &quot;they&quot;: &quot;In China they drive on the right.&quot;
*Gender non-specific uses, where a pronoun refers to a non-specific person or a person whose gender is not specified: English usage and acceptance varies (and has varied) regarding generic &quot;he&quot; and singular &quot;they&quot;, among others. 
**A closely related usage is the singular &quot;they&quot; to refer to a person whose gender is specified as non-binary, genderqueer, or other, which has gained popularity in LGBTQ+ culture in particular. Both themselves/themself work as the reflexive form of this pronoun.
*Vernacular usage of &quot;bro&quot; as a gender-neutral, but often masculine pronoun.
*Preferred gender pronoun selected to reflect gender identity
*Dummy pronouns (expletive pronouns), used to satisfy a grammatical requirement for a noun or pronoun, but contributing nothing to its meaning: &quot;It is raining.&quot;
*Royal we, used to refer to a single person who is a monarch: &quot;We are not amused.&quot;
*Nosism: The use of the pronoun we to refer to oneself.
*Resumptive pronouns, &quot;intrusive&quot; personal pronouns found (for example) in some relative clauses where a gap (trace) might be expected: &quot;This is the girl that I don&#x27;t know what she said.&quot;

<text>Pelagianism is a Christian theological position that holds that the fall did not taint human nature and that humans by divine grace have free will to achieve human perfection. Pelagius ( – AD), an ascetic and philosopher from the British Isles, taught that God could not command believers to do the impossible, and therefore it must be possible to satisfy all divine commandments. He also taught that it was unjust to punish one person for the sins of another; therefore, infants are born blameless. Pelagius accepted no excuse for sinful behaviour and taught that all Christians, regardless of their station in life, should live unimpeachable, sinless lives.

To a large degree, &quot;Pelagianism&quot; was defined by its opponent Augustine, and exact definitions remain elusive. Although Pelagianism had considerable support in the contemporary Christian world, especially among the Roman elite and monks, it was attacked by Augustine and his supporters, who had opposing views on grace, predestination and free will. Augustine proved victorious in the Pelagian controversy; Pelagianism was decisively condemned at the 418 Council of Carthage and is regarded as heretical by the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. For centuries afterward, &quot;Pelagianism&quot; was used in various forms as an accusation of heresy for Christians who hold unorthodox beliefs. However, more recent scholarship in both theology and religious studies has questioned how strongly Pelagius&#x27;s beliefs differed from those of his opponents and from modern mainstream Christians.

==Background==

During the fourth and fifth centuries, the Church was experiencing rapid change due to the Constantinian shift to Christianity. Many Romans were converting to Christianity, but they did not necessarily follow the faith strictly. As Christians were no longer persecuted, they faced a new problem: how to avoid backsliding and nominal adherence to the state religion while retaining the sense of urgency originally caused by persecution. For many, the solution was adopting Christian asceticism.

Early Christianity was theologically diverse. While Western Christianity taught that the inevitability of death was the result of the fall of man, a Syrian tradition including the second-century figures Theophilus and Irenaeus asserted that mortality preceded the fall. Around 400, the doctrine of original sin was just emerging in Western Christianity, deriving from the teaching of Cyprian that infants should be baptized for the sin of Adam. Other Christians followed Origen in the belief that infants are born in sin due to their failings in a previous life. Rufinus the Syrian, who came to Rome in 399 as a delegate for Jerome, followed the Syrian tradition, declaring that man had been created mortal and that each human is only punished for his own sin.

Pelagius (–) was an ascetic layman, probably from the British Isles, who moved to Rome in the early 380s. Like Jerome, Pelagius criticized what he saw as an increasing laxity among Christians, instead promoting higher moral standards and asceticism. He opposed Manicheanism because of its fatalism and determinism and argued for the possibility of a sinless life. Although Pelagius preached the renunciation of earthly wealth, his ideas became popular among parts of the Roman elite. Historian Peter Brown argued that Pelagianism appealed &quot;to a powerful centrifugal tendency in the aristocracy of Rome—a tendency to scatter, to form a pattern of little groups, each striving to be an elite, each anxious to rise above their neighbours and rivals—the average upper‐class residents of Rome.&quot; The powerful Roman administrator Paulinus of Nola was close to Pelagius and the Pelagian writer Julian of Eclanum, and the former Roman aristocrat Caelestius was described by Gerald Bonner as &quot;the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement&quot;. Many of the ideas Pelagius promoted were mainstream in contemporary Christianity, advocated by such figures as John Chrysostom, Athanasius of Alexandria, Jerome, and even the early Augustine.

==Pelagian controversy==
In 410, Pelagius and Caelestius fled Rome for Sicily and then North Africa due to the Sack of Rome by Visigoths. At the 411 Council of Carthage, Caelestius approached the bishop Aurelius for ordination, but instead he was condemned for his belief on sin and original sin. Caelestius defended himself by arguing that this original sin was still being debated and his beliefs were orthodox. His views on grace were not mentioned, although Augustine (who had not been present) later claimed that Caelestius had been condemned because of &quot;arguments against the grace of Christ.&quot; Unlike Caelestius, Pelagius refused to answer the question as to whether man had been created mortal, and, outside of Northern Africa, it was Caelestius&#x27; teachings which were the main targets of condemnation. In 412, Augustine read Pelagius&#x27; &quot;Commentary on Romans&quot; and described its author as a &quot;highly advanced Christian.&quot; Augustine maintained friendly relations with Pelagius until the next year, initially only condemning Caelestius&#x27; teachings, and considering his dispute with Pelagius to be an academic one.

Jerome attacked Pelagianism for saying that humans had the potential to be sinless, and connected it with other recognized heresies, including Origenism, Jovinianism, Manichaeanism, and Priscillianism. Scholar Michael Rackett noted that the linkage of Pelagianism and Origenism was &quot;dubious&quot; but influential. Jerome also disagreed with Pelagius&#x27; strong view of free will. In 415, he wrote to refute Pelagian statements. Noting that Jerome was also an ascetic and critical of earthly wealth, historian Wolf Liebeschuetz suggested that his motive for opposing Pelagianism was envy of Pelagius&#x27; success. In 415, Augustine&#x27;s emissary Orosius brought charges against Pelagius at a council in Jerusalem, which were referred to Rome for judgement. The same year, the exiled Gallic bishops Heros of Arles and Lazarus of Aix accused Pelagius of heresy, citing passages in Caelestius&#x27; . Pelagius defended himself by disavowing Caelestius&#x27; teachings, leading to his acquittal at the Synod of Diospolis in Lod, which proved to be a key turning point in the controversy. Following the verdict, Augustine convinced two synods in North Africa to condemn Pelagianism, whose findings were partially confirmed by Pope Innocent I. In January 417, shortly before his death, Innocent excommunicated Pelagius and two of his followers. Innocent&#x27;s successor, Zosimus, reversed the judgement against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops. Pelagianism was later condemned at the Council of Carthage in 418, after which Zosimus issued the excommunicating both Pelagius and Caelestius. Concern that Pelagianism undermined the role of the clergy and episcopacy was specifically cited in the judgement.

At the time, Pelagius&#x27; teachings had considerable support among Christians, especially other ascetics. Considerable parts of the Christian world had never heard of Augustine&#x27;s doctrine of original sin. Eighteen Italian bishops, including Julian of Eclanum, protested against the condemnation of Pelagius and refused to follow Zosimus&#x27; . Many of them later had to seek shelter with the Greek bishops Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius, leading to accusations that Pelagian errors lay beneath the Nestorian controversy over Christology. Both Pelagianism and Nestorianism were condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431. With its supporters either condemned or forced to move to the East, Pelagianism ceased to be a viable doctrine in the Latin West. Despite repeated attempts to suppress Pelagianism and similar teachings, some followers were still active in the Ostrogothic Kingdom (493–553), most notably in Picenum and Dalmatia during the rule of Theoderic the Great. Pelagianism was also reported to be popular in Britain, as Germanus of Auxerre made at least one visit (in 429) to denounce the heresy. Some scholars, including Nowell Myres and John Morris, have suggested that Pelagianism in Britain was understood as an attack on Roman decadence and corruption, but this idea has not gained general acceptance.

==Pelagius&#x27; teachings==
===Free will and original sin===
The idea that God had created anything or anyone who was evil by nature struck Pelagius as Manichean. Pelagius taught that humans were free of the burden of original sin, because it would be unjust for any person to be blamed for another&#x27;s actions. According to Pelagianism, humans were created in the image of God and had been granted conscience and reason to determine right from wrong, and the ability to carry out correct actions. If &quot;sin&quot; could not be avoided it could not be considered sin. In Pelagius&#x27; view, the doctrine of original sin placed too little emphasis on the human capacity for self-improvement, leading either to despair or to reliance on forgiveness without responsibility. He also argued that many young Christians were comforted with false security about their salvation leading them to relax their Christian practice.

Pelagius believed that Adam&#x27;s transgression had caused humans to become mortal, and given them a bad example, but not corrupted their nature, while Caelestius went even further, arguing that Adam had been created mortal. He did not even accept the idea that original sin had instilled fear of death among humans, as Augustine said. Instead, Pelagius taught that the fear of death could be overcome by devout Christians, and that death could be a release from toil rather than a punishment. Both Pelagius and Caelestius reasoned that it would be unreasonable for God to command the impossible, and therefore each human retained absolute freedom of action and full responsibility for all actions. Pelagius did not accept any limitation on free will, including necessity, compulsion, or limitations of nature. He believed that teaching a strong position on free will was the best motivation for individuals to reform their conduct.

===Sin and virtue===

In the Pelagian view, by corollary, sin was not an inevitable result of fallen human nature, but instead came about by free choice and bad habits; through repeated sinning, a person could corrupt their own nature and enslave themself to sin. Pelagius believed that God had given man the Old Testament and Mosaic Law in order to counter these ingrained bad habits, and when that wore off over time God revealed the New Testament. However, because Pelagius considered a person to always have the ability to choose the right action in each circumstance, it was therefore theoretically possible (though rare) to live a sinless life. Jesus Christ, held in Christian doctrine to have lived a life without sin, was the ultimate example for Pelagians seeking perfection in their own lives, but there were also other humans who were without sin—including some notable pagans and especially the Hebrew prophets. This view was at odds with that of Augustine and orthodox Christianity, which taught that Jesus was the only man free of sin. Pelagius did teach Jesus&#x27; vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind and the cleansing effect of baptism, but placed less emphasis on these aspects.

Pelagius taught that a human&#x27;s ability to act correctly was a gift of God, as well as divine revelation and the example and teachings of Jesus. Further spiritual development, including faith in Christianity, was up to individual choice, not divine benevolence. Pelagius accepted no excuse for sin, and argued that Christians should be like the church described in Ephesians 5:27, &quot;without spot or wrinkle&quot;. Instead of accepting the inherent imperfection of man, or arguing that the highest moral standards could only be applied to an elite, Pelagius taught that all Christians should strive for perfection. Like Jovinian, Pelagius taught that married life was not inferior to monasticism, but with the twist that all Christians regardless of life situation were called to a kind of asceticism. Pelagius taught that it was not sufficient for a person to call themselves a Christian and follow the commandments of scripture; it was also essential to actively do good works and cultivate virtue, setting themselves apart from the masses who were &quot;Christian in name only&quot;, and that Christians ought to be extraordinary and irreproachable in conduct. Specifically, he emphasized the importance of reading scripture, following religious commandments, charity, and taking responsibility for one&#x27;s actions, and maintaining modesty and moderation. Pelagius taught that true virtue was not reflected externally in social status, but was an internal spiritual state. He explicitly called on wealthy Christians to share their fortunes with the poor. (Augustine criticized Pelagius&#x27; call for wealth redistribution.)

===Baptism and judgment===
Because sin in the Pelagian view was deliberate, with people responsible only for their own actions, infants were considered without fault in Pelagianism, and unbaptized infants were not thought to be sent to hell. Like early Augustine, Pelagians believed that infants would be sent to purgatory. Although Pelagius rejected that infant baptism was necessary to cleanse original sin, he nevertheless supported the practice because he felt it improved their spirituality through a closer union with Jesus. For adults, baptism was essential because it was the mechanism for obtaining forgiveness of the sins that a person had personally committed and a new beginning in their relationship with God. After death, adults would be judged by their acts and omissions and consigned to everlasting fire if they had failed: &quot;not because of the evils they have done, but for their failures to do good&quot;. He did not accept purgatory as a possible destination for adults. Although Pelagius taught that the path of righteousness was open to all, in practice only a few would manage to follow it and be saved. Like many medieval theologians, Pelagius believed that instilling in Christians the fear of hell was often necessary to convince them to follow their religion where internal motivation was absent or insufficient.

==Comparison==

Significant influences on Pelagius included Eastern Christianity, which had a more positive view of human nature, and classical philosophy, from which he drew the ideas of personal autonomy and self-improvement. After having previously credited Cicero&#x27;s lost &quot;Hortensius&quot; for his eventual conversion to Christianity, Augustine accused Pelagius&#x27; idea of virtue of being &quot;Ciceronian&quot;, taking issue with the ideology of the dialogue&#x27;s author as having overemphasized the role of human intellect and will. Although his teachings on original sin were novel, Pelagius&#x27; views on grace, free will and predestination were similar to those of contemporary Greek-speaking theologians such as Origen, John Chrysostom, and Jerome.

Theologian Carol Harrison commented that Pelagianism is &quot;a radically different alternative to Western understandings of the human person, human responsibility and freedom, ethics and the nature of salvation&quot; which might have come about if Augustine had not been victorious in the Pelagian controversy. According to Harrison, &quot;Pelagianism represents an attempt to safeguard God&#x27;s justice, to preserve the integrity of human nature as created by God, and of human beings&#x27; obligation, responsibility and ability to attain a life of perfect righteousness.&quot; However, this is at the expense of downplaying human frailty and presenting &quot;the operation of divine grace as being merely external&quot;. According to scholar Rebecca Weaver, &quot;what most distinguished Pelagius was his conviction of an unrestricted freedom of choice, given by God and immune to alteration by sin or circumstance.&quot;

===Definition===
What Augustine called &quot;Pelagianism&quot; was more his own invention than that of Pelagius. According to Thomas Scheck, Pelagianism is the heresy of denying Catholic Church teaching on original sin, or more specifically the beliefs condemned as heretical in 417 and 418. In her study, Ali Bonner (a lecturer at the University of Cambridge) found that there was no one individual who held all the doctrines of &quot;Pelagianism&quot;, nor was there a coherent Pelagian movement, although these findings are disputed. Bonner argued that the two core ideas promoted by Pelagius were &quot;the goodness of human nature and effective free will&quot; although both were advocated by other Christian authors from the 360s. Because Pelagius did not invent these ideas, she recommended attributing them to the ascetic movement rather than using the word &quot;Pelagian&quot;. Later Christians used &quot;Pelagianism&quot; as an insult for theologically orthodox Christians who held positions that they disagreed with. Historian Eric Nelson defined genuine Pelagianism as rejection of original sin or denial of original sin&#x27;s effect on man&#x27;s ability to avoid sin. Even in recent scholarly literature, the term &quot;Pelagianism&quot; is not clearly or consistently defined.

===Pelagianism and Augustinianism===

Pelagius&#x27; teachings on human nature, divine grace, and sin were opposed to those of Augustine, who declared Pelagius &quot;the enemy of the grace of God&quot;. Augustine distilled what he called Pelagianism into three heretical tenets: &quot;to think that God redeems according to some scale of human merit; to imagine that some human beings are actually capable of a sinless life; to suppose that the descendants of the first human beings to sin are themselves born innocent&quot;. In Augustine&#x27;s writings, Pelagius is a symbol of humanism who excluded God from human salvation. Pelagianism shaped Augustine&#x27;s ideas in opposition to his own on free will, grace, and original sin, and much of &quot;The City of God&quot; is devoted to countering Pelagian arguments. Another major difference in the two thinkers was that Pelagius emphasized obedience to God for fear of hell, which Augustine considered servile. In contrast, Augustine argued that Christians should be motivated by the delight and blessings of the Holy Spirit and believed that it was treason &quot;to do the right deed for the wrong reason&quot;. According to Augustine, credit for all virtue and good works is due to God alone, and to say otherwise caused arrogance, which is the foundation of sin.

According to Peter Brown, &quot;For a sensitive man of the fifth century, Manichaeism, Pelagianism, and the views of Augustine were not as widely separated as we would now see them: they would have appeared to him as points along the great circle of problems raised by the Christian religion&quot;. John Cassian argued for a middle way between Pelagianism and Augustinianism, in which the human will is not negated but presented as intermittent, sick, and weak, and Jerome held a middle position on sinlessness. In Gaul, the so-called &quot;semi-Pelagians&quot; disagreed with Augustine on predestination (but recognized the three Pelagian doctrines as heretical) and were accused by Augustine of being seduced by Pelagian ideas. According to Ali Bonner, the crusade against Pelagianism and other heresies narrowed the range of acceptable opinions and reduced the intellectual freedom of classical Rome. When it came to grace and especially predestination, it was Augustine&#x27;s ideas, not Pelagius&#x27;, which were novel.
According to Nelson, Pelagianism is a solution to the problem of evil that invokes libertarian free will as both the cause of human suffering and a sufficient good to justify it. By positing that man could choose between good and evil without divine intercession, Pelagianism brought into question Christianity&#x27;s core doctrine of Jesus&#x27; act of substitutionary atonement to expiate the sins of mankind. For this reason, Pelagianism became associated with nontrinitarian interpretations of Christianity which rejected the divinity of Jesus, as well as other heresies such as Arianism, Socinianism, and mortalism (which rejected the existence of hell). Augustine argued that if man &quot;could have become just by the law of nature and free will . . . amounts to rendering the cross of Christ void&quot;. He argued that no suffering was truly undeserved, and that grace was equally undeserved but bestowed by God&#x27;s benevolence. Augustine&#x27;s solution, while it was faithful to orthodox Christology, worsened the problem of evil because according to Augustinian interpretations, God punishes sinners who by their very nature are unable not to sin. The Augustinian defense of God&#x27;s grace against accusations of arbitrariness is that God&#x27;s ways are incomprehensible to mere mortals. Yet, as later critics such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz asserted, asking &quot;it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just?&quot;, this defense (although accepted by many Catholic and Reformed theologians) creates a God-centered morality, which, in Leibniz&#x27; view &quot;would destroy the justice of God&quot; and make him into a tyrant.

===Pelagianism and Judaism===
One of the most important distinctions between Christianity and Judaism is that the former conventionally teaches justification by faith, while the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the absence of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil, Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of Judaism. Pelagius wrote positively of Jews and Judaism, recommending that Christians study Old Testament (i.e., the Tanakh) law—a sympathy not commonly encountered in Christianity after Paul. Augustine was the first to accuse Pelagianism of &quot;Judaizing&quot;, which became a commonly heard criticism of it. However, although contemporary rabbinic literature tends to take a Pelagian perspective on the major questions, and it could be argued that the rabbis shared a worldview with Pelagius, there were minority opinions within Judaism (such as the Essenes) which argued for ideas more similar to Augustine&#x27;s. Overall, Jewish discourse did not discuss free will and emphasized God&#x27;s goodness in his revelation of the Torah.

==Later responses==
===Semi-Pelagian controversy===

The resolution of the Pelagian controversy gave rise to a new controversy in southern Gaul in the fifth and sixth centuries, retrospectively called by the misnomer &quot;semi-Pelagianism&quot;. The &quot;semi-Pelagians&quot; all accepted the condemnation of Pelagius, believed grace was necessary for salvation, and were followers of Augustine. The controversy centered on differing interpretations of the verse 1 Timothy 2:4: &quot;For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.&quot; Augustine and Prosper of Aquitaine assumed that God&#x27;s will is always effective and that some are not saved (i.e., opposing universal reconciliation). Their opponents, based on the tradition of Eastern Christianity, argued that Augustinian predestination contradicted the biblical passage. Cassian, whose writings survived, argued for prevenient grace that individuals could accept or reject. Other semi-Pelagians were said to undermine the essential role of God&#x27;s grace in salvation and argue for a median between Augustinianism and Pelagianism, although these alleged writings are no longer extant. At the Council of Orange in 529, called and presided over by the Augustinian Caesarius of Arles, semi-Pelagianism was condemned but Augustinian ideas were also not accepted entirely: the synod advocated synergism, the idea that human freedom and divine grace work together for salvation.

Christians often used &quot;Pelagianism&quot; as a criticism to imply that the target denied God&#x27;s grace and strayed into heresy. Later Augustinians criticized those who asserted a meaningful role for human free will in their own salvation as covert &quot;Pelagians&quot; or &quot;semi-Pelagians&quot;.

===Pelagian manuscripts===
During the Middle Ages, Pelagius&#x27; writings were popular but usually attributed to other authors, especially Augustine and Jerome. Pelagius&#x27; &quot;Commentary on Romans&quot; circulated under two pseudonymous versions, &quot;Pseudo-Jerome&quot; (copied before 432) and &quot;Pseudo-Primasius&quot;, revised by Cassiodorus in the sixth century to remove the &quot;Pelagian errors&quot; that Cassiodorus found in it. During the Middle Ages, it passed as a work by Jerome. Erasmus of Rotterdam printed the commentary in 1516, in a volume of works by Jerome. Erasmus recognized that the work was not really Jerome&#x27;s, writing that he did not know who the author was. Erasmus admired the commentary because it followed the consensus interpretation of Paul in the Greek tradition. The nineteenth-century theologian Jacques Paul Migne suspected that Pelagius was the author, and William Ince recognized Pelagius&#x27; authorship as early as 1887. The original version of the commentary was found and published by Alexander Souter in 1926. According to French scholar , the Pelagian treatise &quot;On the Christian Life&quot; was the second-most copied work during the Middle Ages (behind Augustine&#x27;s &quot;The City of God&quot;) outside of the Bible and liturgical texts.

===Early modern era===
During the modern era, Pelagianism continued to be used as an epithet against orthodox Christians. However, there were also some authors who had essentially Pelagian views according to Nelson&#x27;s definition. Nelson argued that many of those considered the predecessors to modern liberalism took Pelagian or Pelagian-adjacent positions on the problem of evil. For instance, Leibniz, who coined the word theodicy in 1710, rejected Pelagianism but nevertheless proved to be &quot;a crucial conduit for Pelagian ideas&quot;. He argued that &quot;Freedom is deemed necessary in order that man may be deemed guilty and open to punishment.&quot; In , John Milton argued that &quot;if, because of God&#x27;s decree, man could not help but fall . . . then God&#x27;s restoration of fallen man was a matter of justice not grace&quot;. Milton also argued for other positions that could be considered Pelagian, such as that &quot;The knowledge and survey of vice, is in this world ... necessary to the constituting of human virtue.&quot; Jean-Jacques Rousseau made nearly identical arguments for that point. John Locke argued that the idea that &quot;all &quot;Adam&quot;″s Posterity [are] doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment, for the Transgression of &quot;Adam&quot;&quot; was &quot;little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God&quot;. He did not accept that original sin corrupted human nature, and argued that man could live a Christian life (although not &quot;void of slips and falls&quot;) and be entitled to justification.

Nelson argues that the drive for rational justification of religion, rather than a symptom of secularization, was actually &quot;a Pelagian response to the theodicy problem&quot; because &quot;the conviction that everything
necessary for salvation must be accessible to human reason was yet another inference from God&#x27;s justice&quot;. In Pelagianism, libertarian free will is necessary but not sufficient for God&#x27;s punishment of humans to be justified, because man must also understand God&#x27;s commands. As a result, thinkers such as Locke, Rousseau and Immanuel Kant argued that following natural law without revealed religion must be sufficient for the salvation of those who were never exposed to Christianity because, as Locke pointed out, access to revelation is a matter of moral luck. Early modern proto-liberals such as Milton, Locke, Leibniz, and Rousseau advocated religious toleration and freedom of private action (eventually codified as human rights), as only freely chosen actions could merit salvation.

19th-century philosopher Søren Kierkegaard dealt with the same problems (nature, grace, freedom, and sin) as Augustine and Pelagius, which he believed were opposites in a Hegelian dialectic. He rarely mentioned Pelagius explicitly even though he inclined towards a Pelagian viewpoint. However, Kierkegaard rejected the idea that man could perfect himself.

===Contemporary responses===
John Rawls was a critic of Pelagianism, an attitude that he retained even after becoming an atheist. His anti-Pelagian ideas influenced his book &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, in which he argued that differences in productivity between humans are a result of &quot;moral arbitrariness&quot; and therefore unequal wealth is undeserved. In contrast, the Pelagian position would be that human sufferings are largely the result of sin and are therefore deserved. According to Nelson, many contemporary social liberals follow Rawls rather than the older liberal-Pelagian tradition.

The conflict between Pelagius and the teachings of Augustine was a constant theme throughout the works of Anthony Burgess, in books including &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;, &quot;A Vision of Battlements&quot; and &quot;The Wanting Seed&quot;.

===Scholarly reassessment===
During the 20th century, Pelagius and his teachings underwent a reassessment. In 1956, John Ferguson wrote:
Thomas Scheck writes that although Pelagius&#x27; views on original sin are still considered &quot;one-sided and defective&quot;:

<text>In Christian theology, historically patripassianism (as it is referred to in the Western church) is a version of [[Sabellianism]] in the Eastern church (and a version of modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism). Modalism is the belief that God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit are three different &quot;modes&quot; or &quot;emanations&quot; of one monadic God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons within the Godhead and that there are no real or substantial differences between the three, such that the identity of the Spirit or the Son is that of the Father.

In the West, a version of this belief was known pejoratively as &quot;patripassianism&quot; by its critics (from Latin , &quot;father&quot;, and , &quot;suffering&quot;) because they alleged that the teaching required that since God the Father had become directly incarnate in Christ, the Father literally sacrificed himself on the cross.

==Trinitarian perspective==
From the standpoint of the doctrine of the Trinity, with one divine being existing in three persons, patripassianism is considered heretical by some Christian churches since &quot;it simply cannot make sense of the New Testament&#x27;s teaching on the interpersonal relationship of Father, Son, and Spirit.&quot; In this, patripassianism asserts that God the Father—rather than God the Son—became incarnate and suffered on the cross for humanity&#x27;s redemption. This amplifies the personhood of Jesus Christ as the personality of the Father, but is seen by trinitarians as distorting the &quot;spiritual transaction&quot; of atonement that was taking place at the cross, which the Apostle Paul described: &quot;God [the Trinity] was reconciling the world to himself in Christ [the Son], not counting people&#x27;s sins against them. [...] God [the Trinity] made him who had no sin [Jesus of Nazareth] to be sin for us, so that in him [the Son] we might become the righteousness of God [the Trinity].&quot;

It is possible, however, to modify patripassianism to acknowledge the Divine Being as having feelings toward and sharing in the experiences of both Jesus, whom Christians regard as both human and divine, and of other human beings. Full-orbed patripassianism denies Trinitarian distinctions, yet it does not contradict Christianity as defined in the Creeds to say that God feels or experiences things, including nonphysical forms of suffering. With regard to the crucifixion of Jesus, they claim it is consistent with Scriptural teaching to say that God the Father suffered—that is, felt emotional and spiritual pain as he watched his Son suffer on the cross, as it is written &quot;The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God [...] no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God [...] What we have received is [...] the Spirit who is from God.&quot;

==History==
Patripassianism is attested as early as the 2nd century; theologians such as Praxeas speak of God as unipersonal. Patripassianism was referred to as a belief ascribed to those following Sabellianism, after a chief proponent, Sabellius, especially by the chief opponent Tertullian, who also opposed Praexas. Sabellius, considered a founder of an early movement, was a priest who was excommunicated from the Church by Pope Callixtus I in 220 and lived in Rome. Sabellius advanced the doctrine of one God sometimes referred to as the &quot;economic Trinity&quot; and he opposed the orthodox doctrine of the &quot;essential Trinity&quot;. Praxeas and Noetus were some major followers.

Because the writings of Sabellius were destroyed, it is difficult to know if he actually believed in Patripassianism, but one early version of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, recorded by Rufinus, explicitly states that the Father is &#x27;impassible.&#x27; This reading dates to about 390 AD. This addition was made in response to patripassianism, which Rufinus evidently regarded as a heresy, and Ignatius believed the incarnate one is the impassible: &quot;being impassible, He was in a passible body, being immortal, He was in a mortal body&quot;.

Cyprian and Tertullian famously accused the Modalistic Monarchians of patripassianism. The Monarchians taught the unity of the Godhead in Christ and that as the Son suffered the Father also experienced the sufferings. They did not teach that the Father died on the cross though they were sometimes accused of that.

The term has been used by others such as F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone to describe other Oneness religions.

<doc id="24988" wikidata="Q2028784" url="?curid=24988" title="Denial of the virgin birth of Jesus">
<text>Denial of the virgin birth of Jesus is found among various groups and individuals throughout the history of Christianity. These groups and individuals often took an approach to Christology that understands Jesus to be human, the literal son of human parents.

In the 19th century, the view was sometimes called psilanthropism, a term that derives from the combination of the Greek (&quot;psilós&quot;), &quot;plain&quot;, &quot;mere&quot; or &quot;bare&quot;, and (&quot;ánthrōpos&quot;) &quot;human&quot;. Psilanthropists then generally denied both the virgin birth of Jesus and his divinity. Denial of the virgin birth is distinct from adoptionism and may or may not be present in beliefs described as adoptionist.

==Early Christianity==
The group most closely associated with denial of the virgin birth were the Ebionites. However, Jerome does not say that all Ebionites denied the virgin birth, but only contrasts their view with the acceptance of the doctrine on the part of a related group, the Nazarenes.

The view was rejected by the ecumenical councils, especially in the First Council of Nicaea, which was convened to deal directly with the nature of Christ&#x27;s divinity.

==Pagan and Jewish accounts==
In the 2nd century, the Greek philosopher Celsus claimed that Jesus was the illegitimate son of a soldier named Panthera. The same claim is made by the medieval Jewish text Toledot Yeshu.

==Reformation==
The turmoil of the Reformation gave rise to many radical groups and individuals, some of whom were accused of denying, or actually did deny, the virgin birth. For example, during the trial of Lorenzo Tizzano before the Inquisition at Venice in 1550, it was charged that the circle of the late Juan de Valdés (died 1541) at Naples had included such individuals. Early Unitarians, often called Socinians, after Laelio Sozzini who first published the first unitarian analysis of John&#x27;s &quot;Logos&quot; in 1550, were sometimes accused of denying the virgin birth, but mainly only denied the pre-existence of Christ in heaven. For Sozzini&#x27;s better known nephew Fausto Sozzini the miraculous virgin birth was the element in their belief which removed the need for the pre-existence to which they objected. The Socinians in fact excommunicated from their number the translator of the first Bible in Belarusian, Symon Budny, for his denial of the virgin birth.

A large scale change among Unitarians to acceptance of a human father for Jesus took place only in the time of Joseph Priestley. The young Samuel Taylor Coleridge was an example of what he called &quot;a psilanthropist, one of those who believe our Lord to have been the real son of Joseph&quot; but later in life Coleridge decisively rejected this idea and accepted traditional Christian belief in the virgin birth.

==19th–21st centuries==
Biblical scholars, churchmen, and theologians who have notably rejected the virgin birth include:
*Albrecht Ritschl, nineteenth-century German Lutheran theologian, considered one of the fathers of Liberal Protestantism.
*Harry Emerson Fosdick, American Baptist pastor, prominent proponent of Liberal Protestantism. In a famous 1922 sermon delivered from the pulpit of First Presbyterian Church in New York, titled &quot;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&quot;, Fosdick called the Virgin Birth into question, saying it required belief in &quot;a special biological miracle.&quot;
*Fritz Barth, Swiss Reformed minister, and father of Karl Barth. Fritz&#x27;s views cost him at least two significant promotions.
*James A. Pike, Episcopal bishop of California (1958–1966), who first declared his doubt about the Virgin Birth in the December 21, 1960 issue of the journal &quot;Christian Century&quot;.
* Martin Luther King&#x27;s private writings show that he rejected biblical literalism; he described the Bible as &quot;mythological&quot;, doubted that Jesus was born of a virgin and did not believe that the story of Jonah and the whale was true.
*John Shelby Spong, retired Episcopal bishop of Newark, author of &quot;Born of a Woman: A Bishop Rethinks the Birth of Jesus&quot;, who following feminist scholar Jane Schaberg, wrote that, &quot;A God who can be seen in the limp form of a convicted criminal dying alone on a cross on Calvary can surely also be seen in an illegitimate baby boy born through the aggressive and selfish act of a man sexually violating a teenage girl.&quot;
*Marcus J. Borg, prominent member of the Jesus Seminar, author of numerous books, and co-author of &quot;The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions&quot;, who viewed the birth stories as &quot;metaphorical narratives&quot;, and stated, &quot;I do not think the virginal conception is historical, and I do not think there was a special star or wise men or shepherds or birth in a stable in Bethlehem. Thus I do not see these stories as historical reports but as literary creations.&quot;
*John Dominic Crossan, prominent member of the Jesus Seminar, author of &quot;Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography&quot;, who has stated, &quot;I understand the virginal conception of Jesus to be a confessional statement about Jesus&#x27; status and not a biological statement about Mary&#x27;s body. It is later faith in Jesus as an adult retrojected mythologically onto Jesus as an infant.&quot;
*Robert Funk, founder of the Jesus Seminar, and author of &quot;Honest to Jesus&quot;, who has asserted, &quot;We can be certain that Mary did not conceive Jesus without the assistance of human sperm. It is unclear whether Joseph or some other unnamed male was the biological father of Jesus. It is possible that Jesus was illegitimate.&quot;
*Jane Schaberg, feminist biblical scholar and author of &quot;The Illegitimacy of Jesus&quot;, who contended that Matthew and Luke were aware that Jesus had been conceived illegitimately, probably as a result of rape, and had left hints of that knowledge, even though their main purpose was to explore the theological significance of Jesus&#x27; birth.
*Uta Ranke-Heinemann, who contends that the virgin birth of Jesus was meant—and should be understood—as an allegory of a special initiative of God, comparable to God&#x27;s creation of Adam, and in line with legends and allegories of antiquity.
*David Jenkins, Bishop of Durham from 1984 until 1994, was the first senior Anglican clergyman to come to the attention of the UK media for his position that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t put it past God to arrange a virgin birth if he wanted. But I don&#x27;t think he did.&quot;
*Gerd Lüdemann, German New Testament scholar and historian, member of the Jesus Seminar, and author of &quot;Virgin Birth? The Real Story of Mary and Her Son Jesus&quot;, argued that early Christians had developed the idea of a virgin birth as a later &quot;reaction to the report, meant as a slander but historically correct, that Jesus was conceived or born outside wedlock. ... It has a historical foundation in the fact that Jesus really did have another father than Joseph and was in fact fathered before Mary&#x27;s marriage, presumably through rape.&quot;
*Robin Meyers, United Church of Christ minister, proponent of Progressive Christianity, and author of &quot;Saving Jesus From the Church: How to Stop Worshiping Christ and Start Following Jesus&quot;. Asserts that &quot;A beautiful, but obviously contrived, tale is the virgin birth, which may have been used to cover a scandal.&quot;
===Sects and denominations===

The &quot;Divine Principle&quot;, the textbook of the Unification movement (also called the Unification Church), a new religious movement founded in South Korea, does not include the teaching that Zechariah was the father of Jesus; however some of its members hold that belief. Notably, this view is advanced by Young Oon Kim, citing the work of British liberal theologian Leslie Weatherhead in her book &quot;Unification Theology&quot; (1980).

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), founded by James Jesse Strang, rejects the virgin birth and believes that Jesus&#x27; father was Joseph, husband of Mary.

<doc id="24989" wikidata="Q41751" url="?curid=24989" title="Pendulum clock">
<text>A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element. The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is an approximate harmonic oscillator: It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates. From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, inspired by Galileo Galilei, until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world&#x27;s most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices, and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation. Their greater accuracy allowed for the faster pace of life which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution. The home pendulum clock was replaced by less-expensive synchronous electric clocks in the 1930s and 1940s. Pendulum clocks are now kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.

Pendulum clocks must be stationary to operate. Any motion or accelerations will affect the motion of the pendulum, causing inaccuracies, so other mechanisms must be used in portable timepieces.

==History==
The pendulum clock was invented on 25 December 1656 by Dutch scientist and inventor Christiaan Huygens, and patented the following year. He described it in his manuscript &quot;Horologium&quot; published in 1658. Huygens contracted the construction of his clock designs to clockmaker Salomon Coster, who actually built the clock. Huygens was inspired by investigations of pendulums by Galileo Galilei beginning around 1602. Galileo discovered the key property that makes pendulums useful timekeepers: they are isochronic, which means that the period of swing of a pendulum is approximately the same for different sized swings. Galileo in 1637 described to his son a mechanism which could keep a pendulum swinging, which has been called the first pendulum clock design &quot;(picture at top)&quot;. It was partly constructed by his son in 1649, but neither lived to finish it. The introduction of the pendulum, the first harmonic oscillator used in timekeeping, increased the accuracy of clocks enormously, from about 15 minutes per day to 15 seconds per day leading to their rapid spread as existing &#x27;verge and foliot&#x27; clocks were retrofitted with pendulums. By 1659 pendulum clocks were being manufactured in France by clockmaker Nicolaus Hanet, and in England by Ahasuerus Fromanteel.

These early clocks, due to their verge escapements, had wide pendulum swings of 80–100°. In his 1673 analysis of pendulums, &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;, Huygens showed that wide swings made the pendulum inaccurate, causing its period, and thus the rate of the clock, to vary with unavoidable variations in the driving force provided by the movement. Clockmakers&#x27; realization that only pendulums with small swings of a few degrees are isochronous motivated the invention of the anchor escapement by Robert Hooke around 1658, which reduced the pendulum&#x27;s swing to 4–6°. The anchor became the standard escapement used in pendulum clocks. In addition to increased accuracy, the anchor&#x27;s narrow pendulum swing allowed the clock&#x27;s case to accommodate longer, slower pendulums, which needed less power and caused less wear on the movement. The seconds pendulum (also called the Royal pendulum), long, in which the time period is two seconds, became widely used in quality clocks. The long narrow clocks built around these pendulums, first made by William Clement around 1680, who also claimed invention of the anchor escapement, became known as grandfather clocks. The increased accuracy resulting from these developments caused the minute hand, previously rare, to be added to clock faces beginning around 1690.

The 18th and 19th century wave of horological innovation that followed the invention of the pendulum brought many improvements to pendulum clocks. The deadbeat escapement invented in 1675 by Richard Towneley and popularized by George Graham around 1715 in his precision &quot;regulator&quot; clocks gradually replaced the anchor escapement and is now used in most modern pendulum clocks. Observation that pendulum clocks slowed down in summer brought the realization that thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum rod with changes in temperature was a source of error. This was solved by the invention of temperature-compensated pendulums; the mercury pendulum by Graham in 1721 and the gridiron pendulum by John Harrison in 1726. With these improvements, by the mid-18th century precision pendulum clocks achieved accuracies of a few seconds per week.

Until the 19th century, clocks were handmade by individual craftsmen and were very expensive. The rich ornamentation of pendulum clocks of this period indicates their value as status symbols of the wealthy. The clockmakers of each country and region in Europe developed their own distinctive styles. By the 19th century, factory production of clock parts gradually made pendulum clocks affordable by middle-class families.

During the Industrial Revolution, the faster pace of life and scheduling of shifts and public transportation like trains depended on the more accurate timekeeping made possible by the pendulum. Daily life was organized around the home pendulum clock. More accurate pendulum clocks, called &quot;regulators&quot;, were installed in places of business and railroad stations and used to schedule work and set other clocks. The need for extremely accurate timekeeping in celestial navigation to determine longitude on ships during long sea voyages drove the development of the most accurate pendulum clocks, called &quot;astronomical regulators&quot;. These precision instruments, installed in clock vaults in naval observatories and kept accurate within a fraction of a second by observation of star transits overhead, were used to set marine chronometers on naval and commercial vessels. Beginning in the 19th century, astronomical regulators in naval observatories served as primary standards for national time distribution services that distributed time signals over telegraph wires. From 1909, US National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the US time standard on Riefler pendulum clocks, accurate to about 10 milliseconds per day. In 1929 it switched to the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock before phasing in quartz standards in the 1930s.
 With an error of less than one second per year, the Shortt was the most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock.

Pendulum clocks remained the world standard for accurate timekeeping for 270 years, until the invention of the quartz clock in 1927, and were used as time standards through World War II. The French Time Service included pendulum clocks in their ensemble of standard clocks until 1954. The home pendulum clock began to be replaced as domestic timekeeper during the 1930s and 1940s by the synchronous electric clock, which kept more accurate time because it was synchronized to the oscillation of the electric power grid. The most accurate experimental pendulum clock ever made may be the Littlemore Clock built by Edward T. Hall in the 1990s
(donated in 2003 to the National Watch and Clock Museum, Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA). The largest pendulum clocks, exceeding , were built in Geneva (1972) and Gdańsk (2016).

==Mechanism==
The mechanism which runs a mechanical clock is called the movement. The movements of all mechanical pendulum clocks have these five parts:
* A power source; either a weight on a cord or chain that turns a pulley or sprocket, or a mainspring.
* A gear train (wheel train) that steps up the speed of the power so that the pendulum can use it. The gear ratios of the gear train also divide the rotation rate down to give wheels that rotate once every hour and once every 12 or 24 hours, to turn the hands of the clock.
* An escapement that gives the pendulum precisely timed impulses to keep it swinging, and which releases the gear train wheels to move forward a fixed amount at each swing. This is the source of the &quot;ticking&quot; sound of an operating pendulum clock.
* The pendulum, a weight on a rod, which is the timekeeping element of the clock.
* An indicator or dial that records how often the escapement has rotated and therefore how much time has passed, usually a traditional clock face with rotating hands.

Additional functions in clocks besides basic timekeeping are called complications. More elaborate pendulum clocks may include these complications:
* Striking train: strikes a bell or gong on every hour, with the number of strikes equal to the number of the hour. Some clocks will also signal the half hour with a single strike. More elaborate types, technically called &quot;chiming clocks&quot;, strike on the quarter hours, and may play melodies or Cathedral chimes, usually Westminster quarters.
* Calendar dials: show the day, date, and sometimes month.
* Moon phase dial: shows the phase of the moon, usually with a painted picture of the moon on a rotating disk. These were useful historically for people planning nighttime journeys.
* Equation of time dial: this rare complication was used in early days to set the clock by the passage of the sun overhead at noon. It displays the difference between the time indicated by the clock and the time indicated by the position of the sun, which varies by as much as ±16 minutes during the year.
* Repeater attachment: repeats the hour chimes when triggered by hand. This rare complication was used before artificial lighting to check what time it was at night.

In &quot;electromechanical pendulum clocks&quot; such as used in mechanical Master clocks the power source is replaced by an electrically powered solenoid that provides the impulses to the pendulum by magnetic force, and the escapement is replaced by a switch or photodetector that senses when the pendulum is in the right position to receive the impulse. These should not be confused with more recent quartz pendulum clocks in which an electronic quartz clock module swings a pendulum. These are not true pendulum clocks because the timekeeping is controlled by a quartz crystal in the module, and the swinging pendulum is merely a decorative simulation.

==Gravity-swing pendulum==
The pendulum in most clocks &quot;(see diagram)&quot; consists of a wood or metal rod &quot;(a)&quot; with a metal weight called the bob &quot;(b)&quot; on the end. The bob is traditionally lens-shaped to reduce air drag. Wooden rods were often used in quality clocks because wood had a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than metal. The rod is usually suspended from the clock frame with a short straight spring of metal ribbon &quot;(d)&quot;; this avoids instabilities that were introduced by a conventional pivot. In the most accurate regulator clocks the pendulum is suspended by metal knife edges resting on flat agate (a hard mineral that will retain a highly polished surface).

The pendulum is driven by an arm hanging behind it attached to the anchor piece &quot;(h)&quot; of the escapement, called the &quot;crutch&quot; &quot;(e)&quot;, ending in a &quot;fork&quot; &quot;(f)&quot; which embraces the pendulum rod. Each swing of the pendulum releases the escape wheel, and a tooth of the wheel presses against one of the pallets, exerting a brief push through the crutch and fork on the pendulum rod to keep it swinging.

Most quality clocks, including all grandfather clocks, have a &quot;seconds pendulum&quot;, in which each swing of the pendulum takes one second (a complete cycle takes two seconds), which is approximately long from pivot to center of bob. Mantel clocks often have a half-second pendulum, which is approximately long. Only a few tower clocks use longer pendulums, the 1.5 second pendulum, long, or occasionally the two-second pendulum, which is used in the Great Clock of Westminster which houses Big Ben.

The pendulum swings with a period that varies with the square root of its effective length. For small swings the period &quot;T&quot;, the time for one complete cycle (two swings), is

:formula_1

where &quot;L&quot; is the length of the pendulum and &quot;g&quot; is the local acceleration of gravity. All pendulum clocks have a means of adjusting the rate. This is usually an adjustment nut &quot;(c)&quot; under the pendulum bob which moves the bob up or down on its rod. Moving the bob up reduces the length of the pendulum, reducing the pendulum&#x27;s period so the clock gains time. In some pendulum clocks, fine adjustment is done with an auxiliary adjustment, which may be a small weight that is moved up or down the pendulum rod. In some master clocks and tower clocks, adjustment is accomplished by a small tray mounted on the rod where small weights are placed or removed to change the effective length, so the rate can be adjusted without stopping the clock.

The period of a pendulum increases slightly with the width (amplitude) of its swing. The &quot;rate&quot; of error increases with amplitude, so when limited to small swings of a few degrees the pendulum is nearly &quot;isochronous&quot;; its period is independent of changes in amplitude. Therefore, the swing of the pendulum in clocks is limited to 2° to 4°.

Small swing angles tend toward isochronous behavior due to the mathematical fact that the approximation formula_2 becomes valid as the angle approaches zero. With that substitution made, the pendulum equation becomes the equation of a harmonic oscillator, which has a fixed period in all cases. As the swing angle becomes larger, the approximation gradually fails and the period is no longer fixed.

=== Temperature compensation ===
A major source of error in pendulum clocks is thermal expansion; the pendulum rod changes in length slightly with changes in temperature, causing changes in the rate of the clock. An increase in temperature causes the rod to expand, making the pendulum longer, so its period increases and the clock loses time. Many older quality clocks used wooden pendulum rods to reduce this error, as wood expands less than metal.

The first pendulum to correct for this error was the &quot;mercury pendulum&quot; invented by Graham in 1721, which was used in precision regulator clocks into the 20th century. These had a bob consisting of a container of the liquid metal mercury. An increase in temperature would cause the pendulum rod to expand, but the mercury in the container would also expand and its level would rise slightly in the container, moving the center of gravity of the pendulum up toward the pivot. By using the correct amount of mercury, the centre of gravity of the pendulum remained at a constant height, and thus its period remained constant, despite changes in temperature.

The most widely used temperature-compensated pendulum was the gridiron pendulum invented by John Harrison around 1726. This consisted of a &quot;grid&quot; of parallel rods of high-thermal-expansion metal such as zinc or brass and low-thermal-expansion metal such as steel. If properly combined, the length change of the high-expansion rods compensated for the length change of the low-expansion rods, again achieving a constant period of the pendulum with temperature changes.
This type of pendulum became so associated with quality that decorative &quot;fake&quot; gridirons are often seen on pendulum clocks, that have no actual temperature compensation function.

Beginning around 1900, some of the highest precision scientific clocks had pendulums made of ultra-low-expansion materials such as the nickel steel alloy Invar or fused silica, which required very little compensation for the effects of temperature.

===Atmospheric drag===
The viscosity of the air through which the pendulum swings will vary with atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature. This drag also requires power that could otherwise be applied to extending the time between windings. Traditionally the pendulum bob is made with a narrow streamlined lens shape to reduce air drag, which is where most of the driving power goes in a quality clock. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, pendulums for precision regulator clocks in astronomical observatories were often operated in a chamber that had been pumped to a low pressure to reduce drag and make the pendulum&#x27;s operation even more accurate by avoiding changes in atmospheric pressure. Fine adjustment of the rate of the clock could be made by slight changes to the internal pressure in the sealed housing.

===Leveling and &quot;beat&quot;===
To keep time accurately, pendulum clocks must be level. If they are not, the pendulum swings more to one side than the other, upsetting the symmetrical operation of the escapement. This condition can often be heard audibly in the ticking sound of the clock. The ticks or &quot;beats&quot; should be at precisely equally spaced intervals to give a sound of, &quot;tick...tock...tick...tock&quot;; if they are not, and have the sound &quot;tick-tock...tick-tock...&quot; the clock is &quot;out of beat&quot; and needs to be leveled. This problem can easily cause the clock to stop working, and is one of the most common reasons for service calls. A spirit level or watch timing machine can achieve a higher accuracy than relying on the sound of the beat; precision regulators often have a built-in spirit level for the task. Older freestanding clocks often have feet with adjustable screws to level them, more recent ones have a leveling adjustment in the movement. Some modern pendulum clocks have &#x27;auto-beat&#x27; or &#x27;self-regulating beat adjustment&#x27; devices, and do not need this adjustment.

===Local gravity===

Since the pendulum rate will increase with an increase in gravity, and local gravitational acceleration formula_3 varies with latitude and elevation on Earth, the highest precision pendulum clocks must be readjusted to keep time after a move. For example, a pendulum clock moved from sea level to will lose 16 seconds per day. With the most accurate pendulum clocks, even moving the clock to the top of a tall building would cause it to lose measurable time due to lower gravity. The local gravity also varies by about 0.5% with latitude between the equator and the poles, with gravity increasing at higher latitudes due to the oblate shape of the Earth. Thus precision regulator clocks used for celestial navigation in the early 20th century had to be recalibrated when moved to a different latitude.

==Torsion pendulum==
Also called torsion-spring pendulum, this is a wheel-like mass (most often four spheres on cross spokes) suspended from a vertical strip (ribbon) of spring steel, used as the regulating mechanism in torsion pendulum clocks. Rotation of the mass winds and unwinds the suspension spring, with the energy impulse applied to the top of the spring. The main advantage of this type of pendulum is its low energy use; with a period of 12–15 seconds, compared to the gravity swing pendulum&#x27;s period of 0.5—2s, it is possible to make clocks that need to be wound only every 30 days, or even only once a year or more. Since the restoring force is provided by the elasticity of the spring, which varies with temperature, it is more affected by temperature changes than a gravity-swing pendulum. The most accurate torsion clocks use a spring of elinvar which has low temperature coefficient of elasticity.

A torsion pendulum clock requiring only annual winding is sometimes called a &quot;400-Day clock&quot; or &quot;anniversary clock&quot;, sometimes given as a wedding gift. Torsion pendulums are also used in &quot;perpetual&quot; clocks which do not need winding, as their mainspring is kept wound by changes in atmospheric temperature and pressure with a bellows arrangement. The Atmos clock, one example, uses a torsion pendulum with a long oscillation period of 60 seconds.

==Escapement==

The escapement is a mechanical linkage that converts the force from the clock&#x27;s wheel train into impulses that keep the pendulum swinging back and forth. It is the part that makes the &quot;ticking&quot; sound in a working pendulum clock. Most escapements consist of a wheel with pointed teeth called the &quot;escape wheel&quot; which is turned by the clock&#x27;s wheel train, and surfaces the teeth push against, called &quot;pallets&quot;. During most of the pendulum&#x27;s swing the wheel is prevented from turning because a tooth is resting against one of the pallets; this is called the &quot;locked&quot; state. Each swing of the pendulum a pallet releases a tooth of the escape wheel. The wheel rotates forward a fixed amount until a tooth catches on the other pallet. These releases allow the clock&#x27;s wheel train to advance a fixed amount with each swing, moving the hands forward at a constant rate, controlled by the pendulum.

Although the escapement is necessary, its force disturbs the natural motion of the pendulum, and in precision pendulum clocks this was often the limiting factor on the accuracy of the clock. Different escapements have been used in pendulum clocks over the years to try to solve this problem. In the 18th and 19th centuries, escapement design was at the forefront of timekeeping advances. The anchor escapement (see animation) was the standard escapement used until the 1800s when an improved version, the deadbeat escapement, took over in precision clocks. It is used in almost all pendulum clocks today. The remontoire, a small spring mechanism rewound at intervals which serves to isolate the escapement from the varying force of the wheel train, was used in a few precision clocks. In tower clocks the wheel train must turn the large hands on the clock face on the outside of the building, and the weight of these hands, varying with snow and ice buildup, put a varying load on the wheel train. Gravity escapements were used in tower clocks.

By the end of the 19th century specialized escapements were used in the most accurate clocks, called &quot;astronomical regulators&quot;, which were employed in naval observatories and for scientific research. The Riefler escapement, used in Clemens-Riefler regulator clocks was accurate to 10 milliseconds per day. Electromagnetic escapements, which used a switch or phototube to turn on a solenoid electromagnet to give the pendulum an impulse without requiring a mechanical linkage, were developed. The most accurate pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome clock, a complicated electromechanical clock with two pendulums developed in 1923 by W.H. Shortt and Frank Hope-Jones, which was accurate to better than one second per year. A slave pendulum in a separate clock was linked by an electric circuit and electromagnets to a master pendulum in a vacuum tank. The slave pendulum performed the timekeeping functions, leaving the master pendulum to swing virtually undisturbed by outside influences. In the 1920s the Shortt-Synchronome briefly became the highest standard for timekeeping in observatories before quartz clocks superseded pendulum clocks as precision time standards.

==Time indication==
The indicating system is almost always the traditional dial with moving hour and minute hands. Many clocks have a small third hand indicating seconds on a subsidiary dial. Pendulum clocks are usually designed to be set by opening the glass face cover and manually pushing the minute hand around the dial to the correct time. The minute hand is mounted on a slipping friction sleeve which allows it to be turned on its arbor. The hour hand is driven not from the wheel train but from the minute hand&#x27;s shaft through a small set of gears, so rotating the minute hand manually also sets the hour hand.

==Maintenance and Repair==

Pendulum clocks are long lived and don&#x27;t require a lot of maintenance, which is one reason for their popularity.

As in any mechanism with moving parts, regular cleaning and lubrication is required. Specific low viscosity lubricants have been developed for clocks, one of the most widely used being a polyalcanoate synthetic oil.

Springs and pins may wear out and break and need replacing.

==Styles==

Pendulum clocks were more than simply utilitarian timekeepers; due to their high cost they were status symbols that expressed the wealth and culture of their owners. They evolved in a number of traditional styles, specific to different countries and times as well as their intended use. Case styles somewhat reflect the furniture styles popular during the period. Experts can often pinpoint when an antique clock was made within a few decades by subtle differences in their cases and faces. These are some of the different styles of pendulum clocks:
* Act of Parliament clock
* Anniversary clock (uses a torsion pendulum)
* Banjo clock
* Bracket clock
* Cartel clock
* Comtoise or Morbier clock
* Crystal regulator
* Cuckoo clock
* Grandfather clock
* Lantern clock
* Mantel clock

<text>A programmable logic controller (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.

PLCs can range from small modular devices with tens of inputs and outputs (I/O), in a housing integral with the processor, to large rack-mounted modular devices with thousands of I/O, and which are often networked to other PLC and SCADA systems. They can be designed for many arrangements of digital and analog I/O, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact.

PLCs were first developed in the automobile manufacturing industry to provide flexible, rugged and easily programmable controllers to replace hard-wired relay logic systems. Dick Morley, who invented the first PLC, the Modicon 084, for General Motors in 1968, is considered the father of PLC.

A PLC is an example of a hard real-time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation may result. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory.

==Invention and early development==
The PLC originated in the late 1960s in the automotive industry in the US and was designed to replace relay logic systems. Before, control logic for manufacturing was mainly composed of relays, cam timers, drum sequencers, and dedicated closed-loop controllers.

The hard-wired nature of these components made it difficult for design engineers to alter the automation process. Changes would require rewiring and careful updating of the documentation. Troubleshooting was a tedious process. When general-purpose computers became available, they were soon applied to control logic in industrial processes. These early computers were unreliable and required specialist programmers and strict control of working conditions, such as temperature, cleanliness, and power quality.

The PLC provided several advantages over earlier automation systems. It was designed to tolerate the industrial environment better than systems intended for office use, and was more reliable, compact, and required less maintenance than relay systems. It was easily expandable with additional I/O modules. While relay systems required tedious and sometimes complicated hardware changes in case of reconfiguration, a PLC can be reconfigured by loading new or modified code. This allowed for easier iteration over manufacturing process design. With a simple programming language focused on logic and switching operations, it was more user-friendly than computers using general-purpose programming languages. Early PLCs were programmed in ladder logic, which strongly resembled a schematic diagram of relay logic. It also permitted its operation to be monitored.

===Modicon===
In 1968, GM Hydramatic, the automatic transmission division of General Motors, issued a request for proposals for an electronic replacement for hard-wired relay systems based on a white paper written by engineer Edward R. Clark. The winning proposal came from Bedford Associates from Bedford, Massachusetts. The result, built in 1969, was the first PLC and designated the &quot;084&quot;, because it was Bedford Associates&#x27; eighty-fourth project.

Bedford Associates started a company dedicated to developing, manufacturing, selling, and servicing this new product, which they named (standing for modular digital controller). One of the people who worked on that project was Dick Morley, who is considered to be the father of the PLC. The Modicon brand was sold in 1977 to Gould Electronics and later to Schneider Electric, its current owner. About this same time, Modicon created Modbus, a data communications protocol used with its PLCs. Modbus has since become a standard open protocol commonly used to connect many industrial electrical devices.

One of the first 084 models built is now on display at Schneider Electric&#x27;s facility in North Andover, Massachusetts. It was presented to Modicon by GM, when the unit was retired after nearly twenty years of uninterrupted service. Modicon used the 84 moniker at the end of its product range until after the 984 made its appearance.

===Allen-Bradley===
In a parallel development, Odo Josef Struger is sometimes known as the &quot;father of the programmable logic controller&quot; as well. He was involved in the invention of the Allen-Bradley programmable logic controller and is credited with coining the PLC acronym. Allen-Bradley (now a brand owned by Rockwell Automation) became a major PLC manufacturer in the United States during his tenure. Struger played a leadership role in developing IEC 61131-3 PLC programming language standards.

===Early methods of programming===
Many early PLC programming applications were not capable of graphical representation of the logic, and so it was instead represented as a series of logic expressions in some kind of Boolean format, similar to Boolean algebra. As programming terminals evolved, because ladder logic was a familiar format used for electro-mechanical control panels, it became more commonly used. Newer formats, such as state logic, function block diagrams, and structured text exist. Ladder logic remains popular because PLCs solve the logic in a predictable and repeating sequence, and ladder logic allows the person writing the logic to see any issues with the timing of the logic sequence more easily than would be possible in other formats.

Up to the mid-1990s, PLCs were programmed using proprietary programming panels or special-purpose programming terminals, which often had dedicated function keys representing the various logical elements of PLC programs. Some proprietary programming terminals displayed the elements of PLC programs as graphic symbols, but plain ASCII character representations of contacts, coils, and wires were common. Programs were stored on cassette tape cartridges. Facilities for printing and documentation were minimal due to a lack of memory capacity. The oldest PLCs used magnetic-core memory.

==Architecture==
A PLC is an industrial microprocessor-based controller with programmable memory used to store program instructions and various functions. It consists of:
* A processor unit (CPU) which interprets inputs, executes the control program stored in memory and sends output signals,
* A power supply unit which converts AC voltage to DC,
* A memory unit storing data from inputs and program to be executed by the processor,
* An input and output interface, where the controller receives and sends data from and to external devices,
* A communications interface to receive and transmit data on communication networks from and to remote PLCs.

PLCs require a programming device which is used to develop and later download the created program into the memory of the controller.

Modern PLCs generally contain a real-time operating system, such as OS-9 or VxWorks.

===Mechanical design===

There are two types of mechanical design for PLC systems. A &quot;single box&quot; (also called a &quot;brick&quot;) is a small programmable controller that fits all units and interfaces into one compact casing, although, typically, additional expansion modules for inputs and outputs are available. The second design type a &quot;modular&quot; PLC has a chassis (also called a &quot;rack&quot;) that provides space for modules with different functions, such as power supply, processor, selection of I/O modules and communication interfaces which all can be customized for the particular application. Several racks can be administered by a single processor and may have thousands of inputs and outputs. Either a special high-speed serial I/O link or comparable communication method is used so that racks can be distributed away from the processor, reducing the wiring costs for large plants.
===Discrete and analog signals===
Discrete (digital) signals can only take &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; value (1 or 0, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;). Examples of devices providing a discrete signal include limit switches and photoelectric sensors.

Analog signals can use voltage or current that is analogous to the monitored variable and can take any value within their scale. Pressure, temperature, flow, and weight are often represented by analog signals. These are typically interpreted as integer values with various ranges of accuracy depending on the device and the number of bits available to store the data. For example, an analog 0 to 10 V or 4-20 mA current loop input would be converted into an integer value of 0 to 32,767. The PLC will take this value and translate it into the desired units of the process so the operator or program can read it.

===Redundancy===
Some special processes need to work permanently with minimum unwanted downtime. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system that is fault tolerant. In such cases, to increase the system availability in the event of hardware component failure, redundant CPU or I/O modules with the same functionality can be added to a hardware configuration to prevent a total or partial process shutdown due to hardware failure. Other redundancy scenarios could be related to safety-critical processes, for example, large hydraulic presses could require that two PLCs turn on output before the press can come down in case one PLC does not behave properly.

==Programming==
Programmable logic controllers are intended to be used by engineers without a programming background. For this reason, a graphical programming language called ladder logic was first developed. It resembles the schematic diagram of a system built with electromechanical relays and was adopted by many manufacturers and later standardized in the IEC 61131-3 control systems programming standard. it is still widely used, thanks to its simplicity.

 the majority of PLC systems adhere to the IEC 61131-3 standard that defines 2 textual programming languages: Structured Text (similar to Pascal) and Instruction List; as well as 3 graphical languages: ladder logic, function block diagram and sequential function chart. Instruction List was deprecated in the third edition of the standard.

Modern PLCs can be programmed in a variety of ways, from the relay-derived ladder logic to programming languages such as specially adapted dialects of BASIC and C.

While the fundamental concepts of PLC programming are common to all manufacturers, differences in I/O addressing, memory organization, and instruction sets mean that PLC programs are never perfectly interchangeable between different makers. Even within the same product line of a single manufacturer, different models may not be directly compatible.

===Programming device===
PLC programs are typically written in a programming device, which can take the form of a desktop console, special software on a personal computer, or a handheld programming device. Then, the program is downloaded to the PLC directly or over a network. It is stored either in non-volatile flash memory or battery-backed-up RAM. In some programmable controllers, the program is transferred from a personal computer to the PLC through a programming board that writes the program into a removable chip, such as EPROM.

Manufacturers develop programming software for their controllers. In addition to being able to program PLCs in multiple languages, they provide common features like hardware diagnostics and maintenance, software debugging, and offline simulation.

===Simulation===
PLC simulation is a feature often found in PLC programming software. It allows for testing and debugging early in a project&#x27;s development.

 An incorrectly programmed PLC can result in lost productivity and even dangerous conditions of programmed equipment. Testing the project in simulation improves its quality, increases the level of safety associated with equipment and can save costly downtime during the installation and commissioning of automated control applications since many scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.

==Functionality==

The main difference from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended for and therefore tolerant of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive input/output (I/O) to connect the PLC to sensors and actuators. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as limit switches, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or machine vision systems. PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, electric motors, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, magnetic relays, solenoids, or analog outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external I/O modules attached to a fieldbus or computer network that plugs into the PLC.

The functionality of the PLC has evolved over the years to include sequential relay control, motion control, process control, distributed control systems, and networking. The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to desktop computers. PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allows a general-purpose desktop computer to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. Desktop computer controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because desktop computers run on less stable operating systems than PLCs, and because the desktop computer hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical.

===Basic functions===
The most basic function of a programmable logic controller is to emulate the functions of electromechanical relays. Discrete inputs are given a unique address, and a PLC instruction can test if the input state is on or off. Just as a series of relay contacts perform a logical AND function, not allowing current to pass unless all the contacts are closed, so a series of &quot;examine if on&quot; instructions will energize its output storage bit if all the input bits are on. Similarly, a parallel set of instructions will perform a logical OR. In an electromechanical relay wiring diagram, a group of contacts controlling one coil is called a &quot;rung&quot; of a &quot;ladder diagram&quot;, and this concept is also used to describe PLC logic. Some models of PLC limit the number of series and parallel instructions in one &quot;rung&quot; of logic. The output of each rung sets or clears a storage bit, which may be associated with a physical output address or which may be an &quot;internal coil&quot; with no physical connection. Such internal coils can be used, for example, as a common element in multiple separate rungs. Unlike physical relays, there is usually no limit to the number of times an input, output or internal coil can be referenced in a PLC program.

Some PLCs enforce a strict left-to-right, top-to-bottom execution order for evaluating the rung logic. This is different from electro-mechanical relay contacts, which, in a sufficiently complex circuit, may either pass current left-to-right or right-to-left, depending on the configuration of surrounding contacts. The elimination of these &quot;sneak paths&quot; is either a bug or a feature, depending on the programming style.

More advanced instructions of the PLC may be implemented as functional blocks, which carry out some operation when enabled by a logical input and which produce outputs to signal, for example, completion or errors, while manipulating variables internally that may not correspond to discrete logic.

=== Communication ===
PLCs use built-in ports, such as USB, Ethernet, RS-232, RS-485, or RS-422 to communicate with external devices (sensors, actuators) and systems (programming software, SCADA, user interface). Communication is carried over various industrial network protocols, like Modbus, or EtherNet/IP. Many of these protocols are vendor specific.

PLCs used in larger I/O systems may have peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between processors. This allows separate parts of a complex process to have individual control while allowing the subsystems to co-ordinate over the communication link. These communication links are also often used for user interface devices such as keypads or PC-type workstations.

Formerly, some manufacturers offered dedicated communication modules as an add-on function where the processor had no network connection built-in.

=== User interface ===

PLCs may need to interact with people for the purpose of configuration, alarm reporting, or everyday control. A human-machine interface (HMI) is employed for this purpose. HMIs are also referred to as man-machine interfaces (MMIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A simple system may use buttons and lights to interact with the user. Text displays are available as well as graphical touch screens. More complex systems use programming and monitoring software installed on a computer, with the PLC connected via a communication interface.

==Process of a scan cycle==
A PLC works in a program scan cycle, where it executes its program repeatedly. The simplest scan cycle consists of 3 steps:

# Read inputs.
# Execute the program.
# Write outputs.

The program follows the sequence of instructions. It typically takes a time span of tens of milliseconds for the processor to evaluate all the instructions and update the status of all outputs. If the system contains remote I/O—for example, an external rack with I/O modules—then that introduces additional uncertainty in the response time of the PLC system.

As PLCs became more advanced, methods were developed to change the sequence of ladder execution, and subroutines were implemented.

Special-purpose I/O modules may be used where the scan time of the PLC is too long to allow predictable performance. Precision timing modules, or counter modules for use with shaft encoders, are used where the scan time would be too long to reliably count pulses or detect the sense of rotation of an encoder. This allows even a relatively slow PLC to still interpret the counted values to control a machine, as the accumulation of pulses is done by a dedicated module that is unaffected by the speed of program execution.

==Security==
In his book from 1998, E. A. Parr pointed out that even though most programmable controllers require physical keys and passwords, the lack of strict access control and version control systems, as well as an easy-to-understand programming language make it likely that unauthorized changes to programs will happen and remain unnoticed.

Prior to the discovery of the Stuxnet computer worm in June 2010, the security of PLCs received little attention. Modern programmable controllers generally contain real-time operating systems, which can be vulnerable to exploits in a similar way as desktop operating systems, like Microsoft Windows. PLCs can also be attacked by gaining control of a computer they communicate with. these concerns have grown – networking is becoming more commonplace in the PLC environment, connecting the previously separated plant floor networks and office networks.

In February 2021, Rockwell Automation publicly disclosed a critical vulnerability affecting its Logix controllers family. The secret cryptographic key used to verify communication between the PLC and workstation could be extracted from the programming software (Studio 5000 Logix Designer) and used to remotely change program code and configuration of a connected controller. The vulnerability was given a severity score of 10 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability scale. At the time of writing, the mitigation of the vulnerability was to limit network access to affected devices.

== Safety PLCs ==
Safety PLCs can be either a standalone device or a safety-rated hardware and functionality added to existing controller architectures (Allen-Bradley GuardLogix, Siemens F-series, etc.). These differ from conventional PLC types by being suitable for safety-critical applications for which PLCs have traditionally been supplemented with hard-wired safety relays and areas of the memory dedicated to the safety instructions. The standard of safety level is the SIL. 

A safety PLC might be used to control access to a robot cell with trapped-key access, or to manage the shutdown response to an emergency stop button on a conveyor production line. Such PLCs typically have a restricted regular instruction set augmented with safety-specific instructions designed to interface with emergency stop buttons, light screens, and other safety-related devices. 

The flexibility that such systems offer has resulted in rapid growth of demand for these controllers.

==PLC compared with other control systems==

PLCs are well adapted to a range of automation tasks. These are typically industrial processes in manufacturing where the cost of developing and maintaining the automation system is high relative to the total cost of the automation, and where changes to the system would be expected during its operational life. PLCs contain input and output devices compatible with industrial pilot devices and controls; little electrical design is required, and the design problem centers on expressing the desired sequence of operations. PLC applications are typically highly customized systems, so the cost of a packaged PLC is low compared to the cost of a specific custom-built controller design. On the other hand, in the case of mass-produced goods, customized control systems are economical. This is due to the lower cost of the components, which can be optimally chosen instead of a &quot;generic&quot; solution, and where the non-recurring engineering charges are spread over thousands or millions of units.

Programmable controllers are widely used in motion, positioning, or torque control. Some manufacturers produce motion control units to be integrated with PLC so that G-code (involving a CNC machine) can be used to instruct machine movements.

=== PLC chip / embedded controller ===
These are for small machines and systems with low or medium volume. They can execute PLC languages such as Ladder, Flow-Chart/Grafcet, etc. They are similar to traditional PLCs, but their small size allows developers to design them into custom printed circuit boards like a microcontroller, without computer programming knowledge, but with a language that is easy to use, modify and maintain. They sit between the classic PLC / micro-PLC and microcontrollers.

=== Microcontrollers ===
A microcontroller-based design would be appropriate where hundreds or thousands of units will be produced and so the development cost (design of power supplies, input/output hardware, and necessary testing and certification) can be spread over many sales, and where the end-user would not need to alter the control. Automotive applications are an example; millions of units are built each year, and very few end-users alter the programming of these controllers. However, some specialty vehicles such as transit buses economically use PLCs instead of custom-designed controls, because the volumes are low and the development cost would be uneconomical.

=== Single-board computers ===
Very complex process control, such as those used in the chemical industry, may require algorithms and performance beyond the capability of even high-performance PLCs. Very high-speed or precision controls may also require customized solutions; for example, aircraft flight controls. Single-board computers using semi-customized or fully proprietary hardware may be chosen for very demanding control applications where the high development and maintenance cost can be supported. &quot;Soft PLCs&quot; running on desktop-type computers can interface with industrial I/O hardware while executing programs within a version of commercial operating systems adapted for process control needs.

The rising popularity of single board computers has also had an influence on the development of PLCs. Traditional PLCs are generally closed platforms, but some newer PLCs (e.g. groov EPIC from Opto 22, ctrlX from Bosch Rexroth, PFC200 from Wago, PLCnext from Phoenix Contact, and Revolution Pi from Kunbus) provide the features of traditional PLCs on an open platform.

===Programmable logic relays (PLR)===
In more recent years, small products called programmable logic relays (PLRs) or smart relays, have become more common and accepted. These are similar to PLCs and are used in light industries where only a few points of I/O are needed, and low cost is desired. These small devices are typically made in a common physical size and shape by several manufacturers and branded by the makers of larger PLCs to fill their low-end product range. Most of these have 8 to 12 discrete inputs, 4 to 8 discrete outputs, and up to 2 analog inputs. Most such devices include a tiny postage stamp-sized LCD screen for viewing simplified ladder logic (only a very small portion of the program being visible at a given time) and status of I/O points, and typically these screens are accompanied by a 4-way rocker push-button plus four more separate push-buttons, similar to the key buttons on a VCR remote control, and used to navigate and edit the logic. Most have an RS-232 or RS-485 port for connecting to a PC so that programmers can use user-friendly software for programming instead of the small LCD and push-button set for this purpose. Unlike regular PLCs that are usually modular and greatly expandable, the PLRs are usually not modular or expandable, but their cost can be significantly lower than that a PLC, and they still offer robust design and deterministic execution of the logic.

A variant of PLCs, used in remote locations is the remote terminal unit or RTU. An RTU is typically a low power, ruggedized PLC whose key function is to manage the communications links between the site and the central control system (typically SCADA) or in some modern systems, &quot;The Cloud&quot;. Unlike factory automation using wired communication protocols such as Ethernet, communications links to remote sites are often radio-based and are less reliable. To account for the reduced reliability, RTU will buffer messages or switch to alternate communications paths. When buffering messages, the RTU will timestamp each message so that a full history of site events can be reconstructed. RTUs, being PLCs, have a wide range of I/O and are fully programmable, typically with languages from the IEC 61131-3 standard that is common to many PLCs, RTUs and DCSs. In remote locations, it is common to use an RTU as a gateway for a PLC, where the PLC is performing all site control and the RTU is managing communications, time-stamping events and monitoring ancillary equipment. On sites with only a handful of I/O, the RTU may also be the site PLC and will perform both communications and control functions.

<text>Peter Allen David (born September 23, 1956), often abbreviated PAD, is an American writer of comic books, novels, television, films, and video games. His notable comic book work includes an award-winning 12-year run on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, as well as runs on &quot;Aquaman&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, &quot;SpyBoy&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;, &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, and &quot;X-Factor&quot;.

His &quot;Star Trek&quot; work includes comic books and novels such as the &quot;New Frontier&quot; book series. His other novels include film adaptations, media tie-ins, and original works, such as the &quot;Apropos of Nothing&quot; and &quot;Knight Life&quot; series. His television work includes series such as &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, &quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot; and Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Space Cases&quot;, which he co-created with Bill Mumy.

David often jokingly describes his occupation as &quot;Writer of Stuff&quot;, and he is noted for his prolific writing, characterized by its mingling of real-world issues with humor and references to popular culture, as well as elements of metafiction and self-reference.

David has earned multiple awards for his work, including a 1992 Eisner Award, a 1993 &quot;Wizard&quot; Fan Award, a 1996 Haxtur Award, a 2007 Julie Award and a 2011 GLAAD Media Award.

==Early life==
Peter David&#x27;s paternal grandparents, Martin and Hela David, and his father, Gunter, emigrated to the United States in the 1930s after the antisemitism in Nazi Germany progressed to the point that Martin&#x27;s Berlin shoestore became the target of vandalism. David was born September 23, 1956, in Fort Meade, Maryland, to Gunter and Dalia David (née Rojansky), an Israeli Jewish mother who had worked with DNA mappers James Watson and Francis Crick and to whom David credits his sense of humor. He has two siblings, a brother Wally, seven years his junior, who works as an IT Systems Administrator in the financial sector, and a younger sister named Beth.

David first became interested in comics when he was about five years old, reading copies of Harvey Comics&#x27; &quot;Casper&quot; and &quot;Wendy&quot; in a barbershop. He became interested in superheroes through the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series. Although David&#x27;s parents approved of his reading Harvey Comics and comics featuring Disney characters, they did not approve of superhero books, especially those published by Marvel Comics, feeling that characters that looked like monsters, such as the Thing or the Hulk, or who wore bug-eyed costumes, like Spider-Man, did not appear heroic. As a result, David read those comics in secret, beginning with his first Marvel book, &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #3 (November 1965), which saw the wedding of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. His parents eventually allowed him to start reading superhero titles, his favorite of which was &quot;Superman&quot;. He cites John Buscema as his favorite pre-1970s artist. David attended his first comic book convention around the time that Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;New Gods&quot; premiered, after asking his father to take him to one of Phil Seuling&#x27;s shows in New York, where David obtained Kirby&#x27;s autograph, his first encounter with a comics professional.

David&#x27;s earliest interest in writing came through the journalism work of his father, Gunter, who sometimes reviewed movies and took young Peter along (if it was age-appropriate). While Gunter wrote his reviews back at the newspaper&#x27;s office, David wrote his own, portions of which sometimes found their way into Gunter&#x27;s published reviews. David began to entertain the notion of becoming a professional writer at age twelve, buying a copy of &quot;The Guide to the Writer&#x27;s Market&quot;, and subscribing to similar-themed magazines, in the hopes of becoming a reporter.

David lived in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in a small house at 11 Albert Terrace, and attended Demarest Elementary School. His family later moved to Verona, New Jersey, where he spent his adolescence. By the time he entered his teens, he had lost interest in comic books, feeling he had outgrown them. David&#x27;s best friend in junior high and first year in high school, Keith, was gay, and David has described how both of them were targets of ostracism and harassment from homophobes.

Although his family eventually moved to Pennsylvania, his experiences in Verona soured him on that town and shaped his liberal sociopolitical positions regarding LGBT issues. He later made Verona the home location of villain Morgan le Fay in his novel &quot;Knight Life&quot;, and has often discussed his progressive views on LGBT issues in his column and on his blog.

David&#x27;s interest in comics was rekindled when he saw a copy of &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; (1978) while passing a newsstand, and later, &quot;X-Men&quot; #95 (October 1975), and discovered in that latter book the &quot;All-New, All-Different&quot; team that had first appeared in &quot;Giant-Size X-Men&quot; #1 (May 1975). These two books were the first comics he had purchased in years.

A seminal moment in the course of his aspirations occurred when he met writer Stephen King at a book signing, and told him that he was an aspiring writer. King signed David&#x27;s copy of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; with the inscription, &quot;Good luck with your writing career.&quot;, which David now inscribes himself onto books presented to him by fans who tell him the same thing. Other authors that David cites as influences include Harlan Ellison, Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert B. Parker, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Robert Crais and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Specific books he has mentioned as favorites include &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, &quot;The Essential Ellison&quot;, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, &quot;Adams Versus Jefferson&quot;, and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. David has singled out Ellison in particular as a writer whom he has tried to emulate.

David attended New York University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism.

==Career==
===Early work===
David&#x27;s first professional assignment was covering the World Science Fiction Convention held in Washington in 1974 for the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;.

David eventually gravitated towards fiction after his attempts at journalism did not meet with success. His first published fiction appeared in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; in 1980. He sold an op-ed piece to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but overall his submissions that met with rejection far outnumbered those accepted.

===Comics career===
====1980s====

David eventually gave up on a career in writing and came to work in book publishing. His first publishing job was for the E.P. Dutton imprint Elsevier/Nelson, where he worked mainly as an assistant to the editor-in-chief. He later worked in sales and distribution for Playboy Paperbacks. He subsequently worked for five years in Marvel Comics&#x27; Sales Department, first as Assistant Direct Sales Manager under Carol Kalish, who hired him, and then succeeding Kalish as Sales Manager. During this time he made some cursory attempts to sell stories, including submission of some Moon Knight plots to Dennis O&#x27;Neil, but his efforts were unfruitful.

Three years into David&#x27;s tenure as Direct Sales Manager, Jim Owsley became editor of the Spider-Man titles. Although crossing over from sales into editorial was considered a conflict of interest in the Marvel offices, Owsley, whom David describes as a &quot;maverick,&quot; was impressed with how David had not previously hesitated to work with him when Owsley was an assistant editor under Larry Hama. When Owsley became an editor, he purchased a Spider-Man story from David, which appeared in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #103 (June 1985). Owsley subsequently purchased from David &quot;The Death of Jean DeWolff&quot;, a violent murder mystery darker in tone than the usually lighter Spider-Man stories that ran in issues #107–110 (October 1985 – January 1986) of that title. Responding to charges of conflict of interest, David made a point of not discussing editorial matters with anyone during his 9-to-5 hours as Direct Sales Manager, and decided not to exploit his position as Sales Manager by promoting the title. Although David attributes the story&#x27;s poor sales to this decision, he asserts that such crossing over from Sales to Editorial is now common. In the Marvel offices, a rumor circulated that it was actually Owsley who was writing the stories attributed to David. Nonetheless, David says he was fired from &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; by Owsley due to editorial pressure by Marvel&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, and he has commented that the resentment stirred by Owsley&#x27;s purchase of his stories may have permanently damaged Owsley&#x27;s career. Months later, Bob Harras offered David &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, as it was a struggling title that no one else wanted to write, which gave David free rein to do whatever he wanted with the character.

During his 12-year run on &quot;Hulk&quot;, David explored the recurring themes of the Hulk&#x27;s multiple personality disorder, his periodic changes between the raging, less intelligent Green Hulk and the more streetwise, cerebral Grey Hulk, and of being a journeyman hero, which were inspired by &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #312 (October 1985), in which writer Bill Mantlo (and possibly, according to David, Barry Windsor-Smith) had first established that Banner had suffered childhood abuse at the hands of his father. These aspects of the character were later used in the 2003 feature film adaptation by screenwriter Michael France and director Ang Lee. Comic Book Resources credits David with making the formerly poor-selling book &quot;a must-read mega-hit&quot;. David collaborated with a number of artists who became fan-favorites on the series, including Todd McFarlane, Dale Keown and Gary Frank. Among the new characters he created during his run on the series were the Riot Squad and the Pantheon. David wrote the first appearance of the Thunderbolts, a team created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley, in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #449 (January 1997).

It was after he had been freelancing for a year, and into his run on &quot;Hulk&quot;, that David felt that his writing career had cemented. After putting out feelers at DC Comics, and being offered the job of writing a four-issue miniseries of The Phantom by editor Mike Gold, David quit his sales position to write full-time. David had a brief tenure writing Green Lantern when the character was exclusive to the short-lived anthology series &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; from issues #608–620 in 1988.

David took over &quot;Dreadstar&quot; during its First Comics run, with issue #41 (March 1989) after Jim Starlin left the title, and remained on it until issue #64 (March 1991), the final issue of that run. David&#x27;s other Marvel Comics work in the late 1980s and 1990s includes runs on &quot;Wolverine&quot;, the New Universe series &quot;Mark Hazzard: Merc&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;, a run on the original &quot;X-Factor&quot;, and the futuristic series &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;, about a man in the year 2099 who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man, the title character of which David co-created. David left &quot;X-Factor&quot; after 19 issues, and he wrote the first 44 issues of &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; before quitting that book to protest the firing of editor Joey Cavalieri. The book was cancelled two issues later, along with the entire 2099 line.

====1990s====

In 1990, David wrote a seven-issue &quot;Aquaman&quot; miniseries, &quot;The Atlantis Chronicles&quot;, for DC Comics, about the history of Aquaman&#x27;s home of Atlantis, which David has referred to as among the written works of which he is most proud, and his first time writing in the full script format. He later wrote a 1994 &quot;Aquaman&quot; miniseries, &quot;Aquaman: Time and Tide&quot;, which led to a relaunched monthly &quot;Aquaman&quot; series, the first 46 issues of which he wrote from 1994 to 1998. His run on &quot;Aquaman&quot; gained notoriety, for in the book&#x27;s second issue, Aquaman lost a hand, which was then replaced with a harpoon, a feature of the character that endured for the duration of David&#x27;s run on the book. More broadly, his run recast the character as an aggressive man of action, one deserving of greater respect, in contrast to the &quot;fish-talking punch line&quot; into which the TV series &quot;Super Friends&quot; had rendered him. David quit that book over creative differences.

David wrote the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book for DC from 1988 to 1991, when that company held the licensing rights to the property, though he has opined that novels are better suited to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, whose stories are not highly visual. He and Ron Marz cowrote the &quot;DC vs. Marvel&quot; intercompany crossover in 1996. David also had runs on &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot;, the latter eventually being canceled so that DC could use that book&#x27;s characters in a relaunched &quot;Teen Titans&quot; monthly.

David&#x27;s work for Dark Horse Comics has included the teen spy adventure &quot;SpyBoy&quot;, which appeared in a series and a number of miniseries between 1999 and 2004, and the 2007 miniseries &quot;The Scream&quot;.

Other 1990s work includes the 1997 miniseries &quot;Heroes Reborn: The Return&quot;, for Marvel, and two creator-owned properties: &quot;Soulsearchers and Company&quot;, published by Claypool Comics, and the Epic Comics title &quot;Sachs and Violens&quot;, which he produced with co-creator/artist George Pérez.

====2000s====
David&#x27;s early 2000s work includes runs on two volumes of &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; as well as the &quot;Before the Fantastic Four: Reed Richards&quot; limited series.

David and his second wife, Kathleen, wrote the final English-language text for the first four volumes of the manga series &quot;Negima&quot; for Del Rey Manga.

In 2003, David began writing another creator-owned comic, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, for DC Comics, which he created in order to make use of plans he had devised for Supergirl after the &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; storyline, but which were derailed by that series&#x27; cancellation. That same year, he wrote a &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series for Dreamwave that tied into the animated television series broadcast that year.

DC canceled &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; after 20 issues, but David restarted the title at IDW Publishing at the end of 2005. Other IDW work included a &quot;&quot; one-shot and the &quot;Spike vs. Dracula&quot; mini-series, both based on the character from the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; television series.
In 2005, David briefly returned to &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, though he left after only 11 issues because of his workload. He started a new series, &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot;, beginning with a twelve-part crossover storyline called &quot;The Other&quot;, which, along with J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, and Reginald Hudlin&#x27;s run on &quot;Marvel Knights Spider-Man,&quot; depicted the webslinger as he discovered he was dying, lost an eye during a traumatic fight with Morlun, underwent a metamorphosis, and emerged with new abilities and insights into his powers. The storyline caused some controversy among readers for its introduction of retractable stingers in Spider-Man&#x27;s arms, and the establishment of his powers being derived from his status as a &quot;Spider-Totem&quot;. David&#x27;s final issue of that title was #23.

David wrote a &quot;MadroX&quot; miniseries that year, whose success led to a relaunch of a monthly &quot;X-Factor&quot; volume 3 written by him. This was a revamped version of the title starring both Madrox and other members of the former &quot;X-Factor&quot; title that David had written in the early 1990s, now working as investigators in a detective agency of that name. David&#x27;s work on the title garnered praise from Ain&#x27;t it Cool News, and David has stated that the opt in/opt out policy and greater planning with which Marvel now executes crossover storylines has made his second stint on the title far easier. His decision to explicitly establish male characters Shatterstar and Rictor as sharing a sexual attraction to one another (a confirmation of clues that had been established in &quot;X-Force&quot; years earlier in issues such as &quot;X-Force&quot; #25, 34, 43, 49, 56 and &quot;X-Force &#x27;99 Annual&quot;), drew criticism from Shatterstar&#x27;s co-creator, Rob Liefeld, though Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada supported David&#x27;s story. David eventually won a 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for his work on the title.

On February 11, 2006, David announced at the WonderCon convention in California in that he had signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics. &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Soulsearchers and Company&quot; and David&#x27;s &quot;Spike&quot; miniseries were &quot;grandfathered&quot; into the contract, so as to not be affected by it. The first new project undertaken by David after entering into the contract, which he announced on April 5, 2006, was writing the dialogue for &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born&quot;, the comic book spin-off of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; novels, which was to be illustrated by Jae Lee, as well as scripting the subsequent &quot;Dark Tower&quot; comics.

David took over Marvel&#x27;s &quot;She-Hulk&quot; after writer Dan Slott&#x27;s departure, beginning with issue #22. His run, which won praise, ended with issue #38, when the series was canceled. He wrote a 2008–09 &quot;Sir Apropos of Nothing&quot; miniseries, based on the character from his novels, which was published by IDW Publishing.

David&#x27;s other 2000s comics based on licensed or adapted properties include &quot;Halo: Helljumper&quot;, a 2009 miniseries based on the &quot;Halo&quot; video game, a 2009 &quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot; manga book published by Del Rey, &quot;Ben Folds Four&quot;, a &quot;Little Mermaid&quot; story in Jim Valentino&#x27;s &quot;Fractured Fables&quot; anthology that was praised by Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, an adaptation of the 1982 film &quot;Tron&quot; that was released to tie in with that film&#x27;s , and a &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; prequel to the 2012 feature film. In 2010, he co-wrote &quot;The Spider-Man Vault: A Museum-in-a-Book with Rare Collectibles Spun from Marvel&#x27;s Web&quot; with Robert Greenberger. David wrote the script for &quot;Avengers: Season One&quot;, an original graphic novel published to promote the DVD release of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

====2010s====
On November 24, 2011, David was one of the balloon handlers who pulled the Spider-Man balloon during the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
In October 2013, &quot;X-Factor&quot; ended its run with issue #262, concluding the X-Factor Investigations incarnation of the series. The book was then relaunched as &quot;All-New X-Factor&quot;, a new series with artist Carmine Di Giandomenico, as a part of the All-New Marvel NOW! initiative announced at the 2013 New York Comic Con. The opening storyline, which continues events from issue #260 of the previous series, establishes the new corporate-sponsored version of the team, and includes Polaris, Quicksilver, and Gambit.

In July 2014, David returned to Spider-Man 2099, writing the second volume of &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; with artist Will Sliney. With this series, David was again writing two series, &quot;X-Factor&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;, after having previously done so decades prior, a coincidence that prompted him to joke at the June 2014 Special Edition NYC convention, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether to be proud of that or if I&#x27;m in a rut!&quot;

In 2014 David wrote a six-part story-arc for &quot;The Phantom&quot; for publishing company Hermes Press, a story that David, reportedly had wanted to write for many years.

In 2015, Simon and Schuster published Stan Lee&#x27;s autobiographical graphic novel, &quot;Amazing Fantastic Incredible&quot;, which David co-wrote, and which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller in its first week of release.

In April 2017, following the conclusion of the Spider-Man storyline &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;, which saw the return of Ben Reilly, Marvel premiered the monthly series &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot;, with David as writer. David explained to Syfy Wire that when Marvel offered him the job, he was initially ambivalent, as Ben Reilly had never been his favorite incarnation of Spider-Man, and given Reilly&#x27;s recent emergence as the villainous Jackal. However, David gave further consideration to the fact that a book whose main character had a skewed, villainous worldview was not something Marvel had historically done much of, and decided that the premise presented itself with opportunities that intrigued him enough to accept the job. His other Spider-Man work during this decade included a 2019 five-issue miniseries &quot;Symbiote Spider-Man&quot;, which holds a 7.5 out of 10 rating at the review aggregator Comic Book Roundup, and the 2020 follow-up miniseries &quot;Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality&quot;, which holds a 7.6 rating at Comic Book Roundup.

===Novels===
David&#x27;s career as a novelist developed concurrently with his comic-book writing career. David had been working at a publisher that went out of business, and a former coworker from that publisher became his agent, through whom he sold his first novel, &quot;Knight Life&quot;, to Ace Books. Although the sale was made before he wrote any comic books, the novel was not published until eighteen months later, in 1987. The novel depicts the reappearance of King Arthur in modern-day New York City. Another early novel of his, &quot;Howling Mad&quot;, is about a wolf that turns into a human being after being bitten by a werewolf. Ace Books hired David to write the &quot;Photon&quot; and &quot;Psi-Man&quot; novels, though they published them under the &quot;house name&quot; David Peters, over David&#x27;s objections. David updated &quot;Knight Life&quot; years later when Penguin Putnam brought it back into print in 2003, and made it a trilogy with the sequels &quot;One Knight Only&quot; and &quot;Fall of Knight&quot;, which were published in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Penguin rereleased &quot;Howling Mad&quot; and the &quot;Psi-Man books&quot; under David&#x27;s actual name.

David first began writing &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels at the request of Pocket Books editor Dave Stern, who was a fan of David&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic book work. His &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels are among those for which he is best known, including &quot;Q-in-Law&quot;; &quot;I, Q&quot;; &quot;Vendetta&quot;; &quot;Q-Squared&quot;; and &quot;Imzadi&quot;, one of the best-selling Star Trek novels of all time. He created the ongoing novel series, &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier,&quot; a spin-off from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; with John J. Ordover in 1997. &quot;New Frontier&quot; continued until September 2015, with the publication of the third part of the digital novel, &quot;The Returned&quot;, the final &quot;New Frontier&quot; novel to date. David&#x27;s other science fiction tie-in novels include writing five &quot;Babylon 5&quot; novels, three of which were originals, and two of which were adaptations of the TV movies &quot;Thirdspace&quot; and &quot;In the Beginning&quot;.

His other novel adaptations include those of the movies &quot;The Return of Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man&quot;. He wrote an original Hulk novel, &quot;The Incredible Hulk: What Savage Beast&quot;, and an adaptation of an unused &quot;Alien Nation&quot; television script, &quot;Body and Soul&quot;.

David&#x27;s 2009 novel &quot;Tigerheart&quot; is a re-imagining of Peter Pan with a mix of new and old characters, told as a Victorian bedtime story, much like the classic tale. It was praised by Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, and honored by the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; as one of 2008&#x27;s Best Adult Books for High School Students. His &quot;Sir Apropos of Nothing&quot; fantasy trilogy, &quot;Sir Apropos of Nothing&quot;, &quot;The Woad to Wuin&quot; and &quot;Tong Lashing&quot;, features characters and settings completely of David&#x27;s own creation, as does his 2007 fantasy novel, &quot;Darkness of the Light&quot;, which is the first in a new trilogy of novels titled &quot;The Hidden Earth&quot;. The second installment, &quot;The Highness of the Low&quot;, was scheduled to be published in September 2009, but David has related on his blog that it has been delayed until the winter of 2012.

David&#x27;s 2010 novel work includes &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot;, a novel cowritten with musician Claudio Sanchez of the band Coheed and Cambria, that was released with the band&#x27;s album of the same name, and a &quot;Fable&quot; original novel &quot;&quot;, set between the events of &quot;Fable II&quot; and &quot;Fable III&quot;. In April 2011, David announced that, in addition to another &quot;Fable&quot; novel, he and a number of other writers, including Glenn Hauman, Mike Friedman and Bob Greenberger, were assembling an electronic publishing endeavor called Crazy Eight Press to publish e-books directly to fans, the first of which would be David&#x27;s Arthurian story, &quot;The Camelot Papers&quot;. David explained that the second book in his &quot;Hidden Earth&quot; trilogy would be published through Crazy Eight. In September 2013, David acknowledged that books published through Crazy Eight are not as lucrative for him as those for publishers that pay him advances, and announced that his then-impending novel, &quot;ARTFUL: Being the Heretofore Secret History of that Unique Individual, The Artful Dodger, Hunter of Vampyres (Amongst Other Things.)&quot;, would be published by Amazon.com.

===Writing habits and approach===

David has stated that he tries to block out different days and different times to work on different projects. He usually works in the morning, for example, on novels, and does comics-related work in the afternoon. Having previously used Smith Corona typewriters, he writes on a Sony Vaio desktop computer, using Microsoft Word for his comics and novel work, and Final Draft for his screenplays. When writing novels, he sometimes outlines the story, and sometimes improvises as he is writing. Following his stroke in December 2012, David began using DragonDictate to write. Todd McFarlane&#x27;s original art for the cover of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #340, featuring Wolverine, which McFarlane gave to David as a gift, hangs in David&#x27;s office.

David previously wrote his comic book scripts using the Marvel Method, but due to his tendency to overplot, as during his collaboration with McFarlane on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, he switched to the full script method, which he continues to use . He has stated that he prefers to plot his comics stories in six-month arcs. He has stated that when he works on a particular title, he always does so with a particular person or group of people in mind to which he dedicates it, explaining that he wrote &quot;Supergirl&quot; for his daughters, &quot;Young Justice&quot; for a son he might one day have and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; for his first wife, Myra, who first urged him to accept the job of writing that book. David has further explained that the events of his own life are sometimes reflected in his work, as when, for example, following the breakup of his first marriage, the direction of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; faltered, with the Hulk wandering the world aimlessly, hopelessly looking to be loved.

David has stated that his favorite female character of his own creation is Lee, the protagonist of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, which he says is derived from the positive female fan reaction to that character. Characters that David has not written but which he has expressed an interest in writing for the comics medium include Batman, Tarzan, Doc Savage, the Dragonriders of Pern, the Steed/Peel Avengers, and Dracula. He has specifically mentioned interest in writing a &quot;Tarzan vs. the Phantom&quot; story.

Authors including Hugh Casey, Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Kevin Killiany participated in the story, with characters such as Michael Dukakis, Dan Quayle, and Ernest Hemingway appearing alongside satirical versions of Meyer&#x27;s characters. David conceived the satire as a not-for-profit venture, and while he has no plans to publish the completed &quot;Potato Moon&quot;, he has allowed for the possibility of a future charity release to benefit the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.
* In 2022, David curated an anthology entitled &quot;The Fans are Buried Tales&quot;, which, in his own words, combined Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; with an event at a Farpoint convention in which everyone was snowed in &quot;and created the concept of a large, general SF convention in which the attendees are snowed in and wind up exchanging stories of their characters/genres in the hotel bar.&quot; When he discovered that organizers of the 2022 Farpoint convention would not be requiring attendees to show proof of vaccination or negative test results, he resorted to using a Kickstarter to pay those involved. Many of the stories were from fellow Crazy 8 authors, while others were submitted by other professional writers and even fans.

===Other media===

David has written for several television series and video games. He wrote two scripts for &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (the second-season episodes &quot;Soul Mates&quot; and &quot;There All the Honor Lies&quot;), and the episode &quot;Ruling from the Tomb&quot; for its sequel series, &quot;Crusade&quot;. With actor/writer Bill Mumy, he is co-creator of the television series &quot;Space Cases&quot;, which ran for two seasons on Nickelodeon, and which proved to be his most lucrative work. David himself appeared as Ben, the father of series regular Bova, in the second-season episode &quot;Long Distance Calls&quot;. David&#x27;s oldest daughter, Shana, later appeared as Pezu, the emotionally disturbed sentient computer in the series finale &quot;A Friend in Need&quot;. David has written and co-produced several films for Full Moon Entertainment and has made cameo appearances in some of the films as well.

David wrote an unproduced script for the fifth season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; called &quot;Gut Reactions&quot;, which he wrote with Bill Mumy.

David wrote &quot;In Charm&#x27;s Way&quot;, an episode of &quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot;. The script was recorded in early 2009, and the episode premiered November 13, 2009. He later wrote three episodes of the spinoff &quot;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&quot;, the first of which, &quot;Reflected Glory&quot;, premiered October 15, 2010.

David wrote the script for the Xbox 360 video game &quot;Shadow Complex&quot;, which debuted in August 2009.

The series centers on Thunderhead, a would-be hero whose inability to utilize his ability to produce loud thunderblasts without injury to himself leads him to become a source of comedic derision in the superhero community. The series, which explores events that occur in between the battles typically seen in comic books, was based on a concept originated by Uslan, and partly inspired by &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. David describes &quot;Head Cases&quot; as a 75-minute movie divided into 5-minute webisodes. The series will feature guest appearances by other industry personalities, including Stan Lee, who appears as himself, functioning in a similar manner to Norm Peterson from &quot;Cheers&quot;.

On more than one occasion, editorial problems or corporate pressure to modify or re-script his plotlines have prompted David to leave books, particularly his decision to terminate his first run on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Factor&quot;, due to constantly having to constrain his plots to accommodate crossover events with other books. He resigned from &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; to protest the firing of editor Joey Cavalieri and from &quot;Aquaman&quot; over other creative differences. When David abruptly left his first stint on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; due to editorial pressures, some of the plot points of the character that David established were retconned by later creative teams.

In his &quot;But I Digress&quot; column, which began appearing in the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; on July 27, 1990, and in his blog, in operation since April 2002, David has been outspoken in many of his views pertaining to the comic book industry and numerous other subjects. He has criticized the low regard in which writers are held, the practice of selling polybagged comics, so-called &quot;poster covers&quot; that showcase a character without indicating anything about the comic&#x27;s content, the meaninglessness of killing off characters to be eventually revived, the poor commitment on the part of some to maintaining continuity in shared fictional universes, and the emphasis on gearing monthly comics series toward eventual collection into trade paperbacks. David has opined that failure on the part of consumers to purchase the monthly individual issues in favor of waiting for the trade collections hurts the sales of the monthly and its chances of being collected at all. A father of four daughters, David has worked on a number of series that feature female leads, such as &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; and &quot;She-Hulk&quot;, and he has lamented that the American comic book market is not very supportive of such books. David has spoken out about fans who are abusive or threatening to creators, and against copyright infringement, particularly that which is committed through peer-to-peer file sharing and posting literary works in their entirety on the Internet without the permission of the copyright holder.

On many occasions, he has offered criticisms of specific publishers, as when he criticized &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine for ageism. He has criticized companies for not sufficiently compensating the creators of their long-standing and lucrative characters, such as Marvel Comics for its treatment of Blade creator Marv Wolfman and Archie Comics for its treatment of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; creator Dan DeCarlo. He has criticized publishers for various other business practices, including Marvel and Image Comics. He has defended said companies from criticism he feels is unfounded, as when he defended Marvel from a February 17, 1992, &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; magazine article. He has criticized deletionists on Wikipedia on more than one occasion.

On occasion, he has disagreed publicly with specific industry personalities such as Frank Miller and Jim Shooter. Particularly publicized were his disagreements with &quot;Spawn&quot; creator Todd McFarlane in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the formation of Image Comics, the company McFarlane co-founded. This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at Philadelphia&#x27;s Comicfest convention in October 1993, which was moderated by artist George Pérez. McFarlane claimed that Image was not being treated fairly by the media, and by David in particular. The three judges, Maggie Thompson, editor of the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, William Christensen of &quot;Wizard Press&quot;, and John Danovich of the magazine &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot;, voted 2–1 in favor of David, with Danovich voting the debate a tie. David has since criticized McFarlane for other business practices, and has engaged in public disagreements with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; editor Gary Groth, Erik Larsen, Rob Liefeld, Marvel Editor-In-Chief Joe Quesada, writer/director Kevin Smith, DC Comics Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio, and John Byrne. Despite his differences with Byrne, David has stated that he is still a fan of Byrne&#x27;s, citing Byrne&#x27;s work on &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Next Men&quot;, &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; and &quot;Babe&quot;.

Politically, David identifies himself as liberal. He was critical of the George W. Bush administration in general, and the Iraq War in particular, as well as other Republicans and the religious right. He also became a staunch critic of President Donald Trump and his administration, criticizing his policies on a weekly basis. He has spoken out in favor of Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself from aggressors, and has opined that certain criticisms of Israel indicate bias and double standards. He favors gun control, and holds progressive or liberal views on LGBT issues, including favoring gay marriage and allowing openly homosexual individuals to serve in the military. He opposes capital punishment. He is an advocate of freedom of speech, having criticized various publicized instances of censorship in general, such as the targeting of comic book retailers for prosecution for selling certain comic books, and the Comics Code Authority in particular. He is a promoter and activist for the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which comes to the aid of such creators and retailers. He has criticized ideas associated with liberalism or political correctness, such as certain publicized cases of alleged sexual harassment or discrimination that he deems unfounded, and has not shied away from criticizing liberals and Democrats, including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Caroline Kennedy, and Barack Obama.

In October 2016, David generated controversy for remarks he made during a panel discussion at the New York Comic Con to Vicente Rodriguez, a fan and the founder of Roma Pop, an organization that seeks to promote more positive representation of the Romani in comics. Rodriguez had asked speakers at multiple panels at the convention about greater Romani representation in comics, in light of what he said were stereotypical depictions of that group. When he asked David about what the public could do about Marvel&#x27;s editorial policies regarding this, David related an anecdote from a 1993 trip to Bucharest, where he was told by his guide that the crippled children he saw had been maimed by their parents to improve their success as beggars. David then angrily rebuffed further interjections by Rodriguez before moving onto the next question. David would later defend these beliefs on his blog, insisting that he had written Romani characters like Quicksilver in a positive manner, and was angered by the crippling of children. However Comics Beat, in reporting on the incident, stated that David&#x27;s claim about the children is an urban myth commonly circulated in Romania, and that the malformed limbs seen in such children more likely resulted from lack of medical care, owing to the Romani distrust of the medical establishment that resulted from the forcible sterilization programs imposed upon them in many European nations until the 2000s. Two days after his first blog post, and the day after the Comics Beat article, David published a second blog post in which he apologized for his conduct, stating that after researching the matter, he concluded that the children he saw likely suffered from genetic conditions, and that he had no right to speak as he had to Rodriguez. David also related that he had apologized to Rodriguez in person in subsequent encounters at the convention, and resolved to treat Romani characters with respect.

==Personal life==
David met his first wife, Myra Kasman, at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention. They married in June 1977, with his childhood friend Keith serving as best man. Together they had three daughters, Shana, Guinevere and Ariel. They separated in late 1996 and were divorced by 1998. David began dating Kathleen O&#x27;Shea, a bookseller, puppeteer and writer/editor in 1998. After dating for three years, David proposed to O&#x27;Shea at the Adventurers Club in Disney World on September 3, 2000. They married on May 26, 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia. Their daughter, Caroline Helen David, was born on December 5, 2002, and named after David&#x27;s late friend and coworker, Carol Kalish. David and his family live in Suffolk County, New York, on the south shore of Long Island, where his favorite local comics shop is Fourth World Comics in Smithtown, New York. David&#x27;s father, Gunter, died of cancer on April 20, 2015. David&#x27;s mother, Dalia, died May 27, 2017.

David had been a Conservative Jew but, as of October 2003, attends a Reform synagogue. His Hebrew name in patronymic form is Jacob Ben Joachim. He has, however, expressed reservations about organized religion.

David has named &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Liberty Meadows&quot;, &quot;Fables&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Runaways&quot;, &quot;She-Hulk&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, &quot;The Crossovers&quot; and J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s run on &quot;Spider-Man&quot; as comics that he has enjoyed. Other creators whose work he has long-admired include John Romita, Sr., John Buscema, Gene Colan, and others he has stated he presently admires or are friends that he enjoys working with include George Pérez, Andy Kubert, and Rick Leonardi. He has named Pérez as his favorite artistic collaborator, and has named Pérez, Leonard Kirk and Dale Keown as the artists whose art has mostly closely matched the visuals he conceived when writing comic book scripts.

David is an avid fan of bowling, and a bowler himself, as is his daughter Ariel. He is a fan of the New York Mets, and practices tai chi. His favorite music includes The Beatles, and his favorite albums include Harry Chapin&#x27;s &quot;Verities and Balderdash&quot; and the soundtracks to &quot;Amadeus&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. His favorite movies include the James Bond films, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;That&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and the early Johnny Weissmuller &quot;Tarzan&quot; films. His favorite TV shows have included &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;Carnivale&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Alias&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. He is a fan of musicals, in particular &quot;1776&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, with a taste for Lerner and Loewe and Stephen Sondheim. He acts in local stage productions.

In June 2010, David&#x27;s wife announced on his website that he had successfully undergone surgery to relieve serious back pain. He later explained on his site that the pain, which he had been suffering in his hips and knees for three weeks, left him unable to function, and was eventually diagnosed as a herniated disc caused by bone fragments and fluid buildup. He underwent a three-hour discectomy and was told his full strength would return in six months.

On December 29, 2012, David suffered a stroke while on vacation in Florida. The stroke occurred in the pons section of David&#x27;s brain, from which he lost most of the use of his right arm and his right leg, and suffered from blurred vision in his right eye. While a total recovery was indicated to be unlikely, he remained in good spirits, and underwent physical therapy in order to return to his prior routine. Two and a half months later, his condition had improved. His vision problems were gone, and he was able to navigate around his house without a wheelchair, and resume bowling and practicing tai chi. He had made slow and steady progress on his right leg and arm, and was continuing his therapy. Six months after the stroke, David had completed his physical therapy, though he still suffered some pain in his shoulder, and intended to work on improving his reduced endurance. David revealed in January 2015 that he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes a year prior.

In March 2017, David announced on his blog that the IRS was demanding that he pay $88,000 USD in unpaid taxes, penalty and interest, which began to accumulate when his divorce from his first wife used up his savings. He started a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money from friends and fans, which raised $68,000 by April 12. David announced that he would begin a Patreon account where he would publish new work, and which would be used to pay taxes, and asked his readers for their content requests. By May 11, having sold some original comics artwork acquired two decades earlier, the Davids&#x27; debts were paid off.

On November 27, 2022, another GoFundMe was launched by Graham Murphy, who explained David&#x27;s health was once again in decline, following kidney failure, another series of strokes, and a mild heart attack.

<doc id="25002" wikidata="Q3926" url="?curid=25002" title="Pretoria">
<text>Pretoria ( ; ) is South Africa&#x27;s administrative capital, serving as the seat of the executive branch of government, and as the host to all foreign embassies to South Africa.

Pretoria straddles the Apies River and extends eastward into the foothills of the Magaliesberg mountains. It has a reputation as an academic city and centre of research, being home to the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), the University of Pretoria (UP), the University of South Africa (UNISA), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the Human Sciences Research Council. It also hosts the National Research Foundation and the South African Bureau of Standards. Pretoria was one of the host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Pretoria is the central part of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality which was formed by the amalgamation of several former local authorities, including Bronkhorstspruit, Centurion, Cullinan, Hammanskraal and Soshanguve. Some have proposed changing the official name from Pretoria to Tshwane, which has caused some public controversy.

Pretoria is named after the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, and South Africans sometimes call it the &quot;Jacaranda City&quot;, because of the thousands of jacaranda trees planted along its streets and in its parks and gardens.

==History==

Pretoria was founded in 1855 by Marthinus Pretorius, a leader of the Voortrekkers, who named it after his father Andries Pretorius and chose a spot on the banks of the &quot;Apies rivier&quot; (Afrikaans for &quot;Monkeys river&quot;) to be the new capital of the South African Republic (; ZAR). The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the Voortrekkers after his victory over Dingane and the Zulus in the Battle of Blood River in 1838. The elder Pretorius also negotiated the Sand River Convention (1852), in which the United Kingdom acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal. It became the capital of the South African Republic on 1 May 1860.

The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers&#x27; settlement movements of the Great Trek.

===Boer Wars===

During the First Boer War, the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty that ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the Pretoria Convention.

The Second Boer War resulted in the end of the Transvaal Republic and start of British hegemony in South Africa. The city surrendered to British forces under Frederick Roberts on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902 at Melrose House.

The Pretoria Forts were built for the defence of the city just prior to the Second Boer War. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.

===Union of South Africa===

The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the Orange River Colony were united with the Cape Colony and Natal Colony in 1910 to become the Union of South Africa. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town serving as the legislative capital and Bloemfontein as the judicial capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded Potchefstroom in that role.)
On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.

==Geography==
Pretoria is situated approximately north-northeast of Johannesburg in the northeast of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the Highveld to the south and the lower-lying Bushveld to the north. It lies at an altitude of about above sea level, in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the Magaliesberg range.

===Climate===

Pretoria has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa) with long hot, rainy summers, and short, dry and mild winters. The city experiences the typical winters of South Africa, with cold, clear nights and mild to moderately warm days. Although the average lows during winter are mild, it can get cold due to the clear skies, with night time low temperatures in recent years in the range of .

The average annual temperature is . This is rather high, considering the city&#x27;s relatively high altitude of about , and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year.

Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959, 1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history.

During a nationwide heat wave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached , unusual for that time of the year. Similar record-breaking extreme heat events also occurred in January 2013, when Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding on several days. The year 2014 was one of the wettest on record for the city. A total of fell up to the end of December, with recorded in this month alone. In 2015, Pretoria saw its worst drought since 1982; the month of November 2015 saw new records broken for high temperatures, with recorded on 11 November after three weeks of temperatures between and . Pretoria reached a new record high of on 7 January 2016.

==Demographics==

Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute &quot;Pretoria&quot;, the population ranges from 700,000 to 2.95 million. The main languages spoken in Pretoria are Sepedi, Setswana, Xitsonga, Tshivenda, Afrikaans, and English. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since its founding, it has been a major Afrikaner population centre, and there are roughly 1 million Afrikaners living in or around the city.

===Ethnic groups===
Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself has had a white majority, albeit with an ever-increasing black middle-class. However, in the townships of Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Atteridgeville black people make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black ethnic group are the Northern Sothos.

The lower estimate for the population of Pretoria includes largely former white-designated areas, and there is therefore a white majority. However, including the geographically separate townships increases Pretoria&#x27;s population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.

Pretoria&#x27;s Indians were ordered to move from Pretoria to Laudium on 6 June 1958.
==Cityscape==
Pretoria is known as the &quot;Jacaranda City&quot; due to the approximately 50,000 Jacarandas that line its streets. Purple is a colour often associated with the city and is often included on local council logos and services such as the A Re Yeng rapid bus system and the logo of the local Jacaranda FM radio station.

===Architecture===

Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from 19th century Dutch, German and British colonial architecture to modern, postmodern, neomodern, and art deco architecture styles with a good mix of a uniquely South African style.

Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the late 19th century Palace of Justice, the early 20th century Union Buildings, the post-war Voortrekker Monument, the diverse buildings dotting the main campuses of both the University of Pretoria and the University of South Africa, traditional Cape Dutch style Mahlamba Ndlopfu (the President&#x27;s House), the Neo-Byzantine Old Synagogue, the more modern Reserve Bank of South Africa (office skyscraper) and the Telkom Lukasrand Tower. Other well-known structures and buildings include the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, The South African State Theatre and the Oliver Tambo building which is the Headquarters of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.
===Central business district===
Despite the many corporate offices, small businesses, shops, and government departments that are situated in Pretoria&#x27;s sprawling suburbs, its Central Business District still retains its status as the traditional centre of government and commerce. Many banks, businesses, large corporations, shops, shopping centres, and other businesses are situated in the city centre which is towered by several large skyscrapers, the tallest of which is the Poyntons Building ( tall), the ABSA Building ( tall) and the Reserve Bank of South Africa building ( tall).

The area contains a large number of historical buildings, monuments, and museums that include the Pretoria City Hall, National Library of South Africa, Pretorius Square, Church Square (along with its many historical buildings and statues), and the Ou Raadsaal. There is also the Transvaal Museum (the country&#x27;s leading natural history museum, which although it has changed venues a number of times, has been around since 1892), the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa (or more colloquially known as the Pretoria Zoo), Melrose House Museum in Jacob Maré Street, the Pretoria Art Museum and the African Window Cultural History Museum.

Several National Departments also have Head Offices in the Central Business district such as the Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Public Service and Administration, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury. The district also has a high number of residential buildings which house people who primarily work in the district.

===Parks and gardens===
Pretoria is home to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, as well as the Pretoria National Botanical Garden. There are also a number of smaller parks and gardens located throughout the city, including the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary, Pretorius Square gardens, the Pretoria Rosarium, Church Square, Pretoria Showgrounds, Springbok Park, Freedom Park, Jan Cilliers Park and Burgers Park, the oldest park in the city and now a national monument. In the suburbs there are also several parks that are notable: Rietondale Park, &quot;Die Proefplaas&quot; in the Queenswood suburb, Magnolia Dell Park, Nelson Mandela Park and Mandela Park Peace Garden and Belgrave Square Park.

====Jacaranda city====

Pretoria&#x27;s nickname &quot;the Jacaranda City&quot; comes from the around 70,000 jacaranda trees that grow in Pretoria and decorate the city each October with their purple blossoms. The first two trees were planted in 1888 in the garden of local gardener, J.D. Cilliers, at Myrtle Lodge on Celliers Street in Sunnyside. He obtained the seedlings from a Cape Town nurseryman who had harvested them in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The two trees still stand on the grounds of the Sunnyside Primary School.

The jacaranda comes from tropical South America and belongs to the family Bignoniaceae. There are around fifty species of jacaranda, but the one found most often in the warmer areas of Southern Africa is Jacaranda mimosifolia.

At the end of the 19th century, the flower and tree grower James Clark imported jacaranda seedlings from Australia and began growing them on a large scale. In November 1906, he donated two hundred small saplings to the Pretoria City Council, which planted them on Koch Street (today Bosman Street). The city engineer Walton Jameson, soon known as &quot;Jacaranda Jim&quot;, launched a programme to plant jacaranda trees throughout Pretoria, and by 1971 there would already be 55,000 of them in the city.

Most jacarandas in Pretoria are lilac in colour, but there are also white ones planted on Herbert Baker Street in Groenkloof.

The Jacaranda Carnival is an old tradition that was held from 1939 to 1964. After a hiatus of over twenty years, it resumed in 1985. Festivities include a colourful march and the crowning of the Jacaranda Queen.

===Suburbs===
== Transportation ==


===Railway===
Commuter rail services around Pretoria are operated by Metrorail. The routes, originating from the city centre, extend south to Germiston and Johannesburg, west to Atteridgeville, northwest to Ga-Rankuwa, north to Soshanguve and east to Mamelodi. Via the Pretoria–Maputo railway it is possible to access the port of Maputo, in the east.

The Gautrain high-speed railway line runs from the eastern suburb of Hatfield to Pretoria Station and then southwards to Centurion, Midrand, Marlboro, Sandton, Rhodesfield, OR Tambo International Airport, Rosebank and Johannesburg.

Pretoria Station is a departure point for the Blue Train luxury train. Rovos Rail, a luxury mainline train safari service operates from the colonial-style railway station at Capital Park. The South African Friends of the Rail have recently moved their vintage train trip operations from the Capital Park station to the Hercules station.

===Buses===
Various bus companies exist in Pretoria, of which PUTCO is one of the oldest and most recognised. Tshwane municipality provides the remainder of the bus services.

===Road===
The N1 is the major freeway that runs through Pretoria. It enters the city from the south as the Ben Schoeman Highway. At the Brakfontein Interchange in Centurion, the Ben Schoeman Highway becomes the N14 to Pretoria Central, the N1 turns north-east, then north, as the Eastern Bypass, bisecting the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from Johannesburg to Polokwane and the north of the country. The N1 is a toll road north of Pretoria. The R101 is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of the city on regular streets rather than the eastern suburbs.

The N4 enters the city as a highway from eMalahleni in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching west from the N1 as the Platinum Highway, forming the Northern Bypass, and heading to Rustenburg. The N4 runs east–west through South Africa, connecting Maputo to Gaborone. The N4 is a toll road. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a partially-tolled highway west of the city towards Hartbeespoort. These roads through the city centre are now designated as the M2 (from the Proefplaas Interchange to Arcadia) and the M4 (from Arcadia to Hartbeespoort).

There is a third, original east–west road: the R104, previously named Church Street, also from eMalahleni in the east through Pretoria to Hartbeespoort and Rustenburg in the west. Church Street has been renamed as Stanza Bopape Street from the M16 to Nelson Mandela Drive (M3), Helen Joseph Street from the M3 to Church Square, WF Nkomo Street from Church Square to the R511 (south-east of Hartbeespoort) and Elias Motswaledi Street from the R511 to Pelindaba.

The N14 starts from the R101 just south of the Pretoria CBD, heading south as the Ben Schoeman Freeway. At the Brakfontein interchange in Centurion, the Ben Schoeman Freeway becomes the N1 to Johannesburg, and the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-westerly highway towards Krugersdorp. The R114 parallels the N14 from Centurion to Muldersdrift.

The R21 provides a second north–south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Circle south of the city centre, heading south-east to Monument Park, where it becomes a highway. It crosses the N1 at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north–south towards Ekurhuleni (specifically Kempton Park and Boksburg). Importantly, it links Pretoria with the OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park.

The R80 highway (Mabopane Highway) is a highway in the north-west of the city. The highway begins in Soshanguve and it terminates just north of the city centre (in Roseville) at an intersection with the M1.

Pretoria is also served by many regional roads. The R55 starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north–south from Pretoria West to Sandton. The R50 starts from the N1 in the south-east of the city, and heads south-east towards Bapsfontein and Delmas. The R511 runs north–south from Sandton towards Brits and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The R514 starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511 in Hartbeespoort. The R513 crosses Pretoria&#x27;s northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to Cullinan and Bronkhorstspruit in the east and Hartbeespoort in the west. The R566 takes origin in Pretoria&#x27;s northern suburbs, connecting Pretoria to Brits. The R573 (also called &quot;Moloto Road&quot;) starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to KwaMhlanga and Siyabuswa.

Pretoria is also served internally by metropolitan routes.

===Airports===
For scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg&#x27;s airports: OR Tambo International, south of central Pretoria; and Lanseria, south-west of the city. Wonderboom Airport in the suburb of Annlin in the north of Pretoria primarily services light commercial and private aircraft. However, as from August 2015, scheduled flights from Wonderboom Airport to Cape Town International Airport were made available by SA Airlink. There are two military air bases to the south of the city, Swartkop and Waterkloof.

== Culture ==

A number of popular South African bands and musicians are originally from Pretoria. These include Desmond and the Tutus, Bittereinder, The Black Cat Bones, Seether, popular mostwako rapper JR, Joshua na die Reën and DJ Mujava who was raised in the town of Attridgeville.

The song &quot;Marching to Pretoria&quot; refers to this city. Pretoria was the capital of the South African Republic (a.k.a. Republic of the Transvaal; 1852–1881 and 1884–1902) the principal battleground for the First and Second Boer War, the latter which brought both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State republic under British rule. &quot;Marching to Pretoria&quot; was one of the songs that British soldiers sang as they marched from the Cape Colony, under British Rule since 1814, to the capital of the Southern African Republic (or in Dutch, &quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek&quot;). As the song&#x27;s refrain puts it: &quot;We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Pretoria/We are marching to Pretoria, Pretoria, Hurrah.&quot;

The opening line of John Lennon&#x27;s Beatles&#x27; song I Am the Walrus, &quot;I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together&quot;, is often believed to be based on the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m with you and you&#x27;re with me and so we are all together&quot; in &quot;Marching to Pretoria&quot;. Lennon denied this, insisting his lyrics came from &quot;nothing&quot;.

===Performing arts and galleries===

Pretoria is home to an extensive portfolio of public art. A diverse and evolving city, Pretoria boasts a vibrant art scene and a variety of works that range from sculptures to murals to pieces by internationally and locally renowned artists. The Pretoria Art Museum is home to a vast collection of local artworks. After a bequest of 17th century Dutch artworks by Lady Michaelis in 1932 the art collection of Pretoria City Council expanded quickly to include South African works by Henk Pierneef, Pieter Wenning, Frans Oerder, Anton van Wouw and Irma Stern. And according to the museum: &quot;As South African museums in Cape Town and Johannesburg already had good collections of 17th, 18th and 19th century European art, it was decided to focus on compiling a representative collection of South African art&quot; making it somewhat unusual compared to its contemporaries.

Pretoria houses several performing arts venues including:
the South African State Theatre which houses the arts of Opera, musicals, plays and comedic performances.

A 9 metre tall statue of former president Nelson Mandela was unveiled in front of the Union Buildings on 16 December 2013. Since Nelson Mandela&#x27;s inauguration as South Africa&#x27;s first majority elected president the Union Buildings have come to represent the new &#x27;Rainbow Nation&#x27;. Public art in Pretoria has flourished since the 2010 FIFA World Cup with many areas receiving new public artworks.

===Sport===

One of the most popular sports in Pretoria is rugby union. Loftus Versfeld is home to the Blue Bulls, who compete in the domestic Currie Cup, and also to the Bulls in the international United Rugby Championship competition. The Bulls rugby team, which is operated by the Blue Bulls, won the Super Rugby competition in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Loftus Versfeld also hosts the football side Mamelodi Sundowns.

Pretoria also hosted matches during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Loftus Versfeld was used for some matches in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Association football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in the city. There are two soccer teams in the city playing in South Africa&#x27;s top-flight league, the Premiership. They are Mamelodi Sundowns and Supersport United. Supersport United were the 2008–09 PSL Champions. Following the 2011/2012 season the University of Pretoria F.C. gained promotion to the South African Premier Division, the top domestic league, becoming the third Pretoria-based team in the league. After a poor league finish in the 2015/2016 season, University of Pretoria F.C. were relegated to the National First Division, the second-highest football league in South Africa, in the 2016 promotion/relegation play-offs.

Cricket is also a popular game in the city. As there is no international cricket stadium in the city, it does not host any top-class cricket tournaments, although the nearby situated Centurion has Supersport Park which is an international cricket stadium and has hosted many important tournaments such as 2003 Cricket World Cup, 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2009 IPL and 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. The most local franchise team to Pretoria is the Titans, although Northerns occasionally play in the city in South Africa&#x27;s provincial competitions. Many Pretoria born cricketers have gone on to play for South Africa, including former international captains AB de Villiers Faf du Plessis.

The Pretoria Transnet Blind Cricket Club is situated in Pretoria and is the biggest Blind Cricket club in South Africa. Their field is at the Transnet Engineering campus on Lynette Street, home of differently disabled cricket. PTBCC has played many successful blind cricket matches with abled bodied teams such as the South African Indoor Cricket Team and TuksCricket Junior Academy. Northerns Blind Cricket is the Provincial body that governs PTBCC and Filefelfia Secondary School. The Northern Blind Cricket team won the 40 over National Blind Cricket tournament that was held in Cape Town in April 2014.

The city&#x27;s SunBet Arena at Time Square hosted the NBA Africa Game 2018.

Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Zion Christian Church, Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, Assemblies of God, Baptist Union of Southern Africa (Baptist World Alliance), Methodist Church of Southern Africa (World Methodist Council), Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pretoria (Catholic Church). Greek Orthodox Community of Pretoria , Cathedral of the Annunciation of the Theotokos
 There are also Muslim mosques and Hindu temples.

===Jewish community===
Pretoria has a small Jewish community of around 3,000. Jewish citizens have been in Pretoria since its foundation in the 19th century and played an important role in its industrial and economic growth. A Mr. De Vries, the first Jewish inhabitant of Pretoria, was a prominent citizen and prosecutor, a member of the Volksraad and a pioneer of the Afrikaans language. Another famed Jewish Pretorian was Sammy Marks.

Other early Jewish settlers, many of them immigrants from Lithuania, were not as educated as De Vries and often did not speak Dutch, Afrikaans, or English. Many of them spoke only Yiddish and made a living as shopkeepers in the local retail industry. Most Jewish residents stayed neutral in the Second Boer War, though some joined the South African Republic army.

The first congregation was founded between 1890 and 1895, and in 1898 the first synagogue, The Old Synagogue opened on Paul Kruger Street. A second synagogue, known as the Great Synagogue, opened in 1922. Both synagogues are no longer in operation, but a Reformed synagogue, Temple Menorah, opened in the early 1950s.

The Jewish community of Pretoria&#x27;s golden age was in the early 20th century, when many Jewish sports clubs, charities, and youth groups flourished. After 1948, many Jews left for Cape Town or Johannesburg.

The Old Synagogue on Paul Kruger Street was purchased by the government in 1952 to become the new home of the High Court where prominent opposition figures in the Anti-Apartheid Movement were tried, including Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and 26 others were prosecuted for treason from 1 August 1958 to 29 March 1961; the Rivonia Trial was held there in 1963–1964.

Two Jewish schools arose in Pretoria, the Miriam Marks School, which was founded in 1905, and the Carmel School, which opened in 1959. Only the second, currently also operating as a synagogue, remains. Pretoria&#x27;s Reformed congregation shares a rabbi with the Johannesburg one, though the synagogue no longer operates and services take place in worshippers&#x27; private homes.

===Buddhist community===
A Buddhist centre, the Jang Chup Chopel Rigme Centre (&quot;Centre of Light&quot;) was founded in early January 2015 by Duan Pienaar or Gyalten Nyima (his adopted monastic name) in Waverley around Pretoria-Moot. Pienaar is the only Afrikaner ordained in the highly selective Tibetan Tantric Buddhist community in Bylakuppe, in southern India. His instructor Lama Kyabje Choden Rinpoche is the highest tantric master after the Dalai Lama. Pienaar, who studied Buddhist teachers for twenty years, spent two years in India.

===Coat of arms===

The Pretoria civic arms, designed by Frans Engelenburg, were granted by the College of Arms on 7 February 1907. They were registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in March 1953 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in May 1968. The Bureau provided new artwork, in a more modern style, in 1989.

The arms were: &quot;Gules, on an mimosa tree eradicated proper within an orle of eight bees volant, Or, an inescutcheon Or and thereon a Roman praetor seated proper&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms: a red shield displaying an uprooted mimosa tree surrounded by a border of eight golden bees, superimposed on the tree is a golden shield depicting a Roman praetor. The tree represented growth, the bees industry, and the praetor (judge) was an heraldic pun on the name.

The crest was a three-towered golden castle; the supporters were an eland and a kudu; and the motto &quot;Praestantia praevaleat Pretoria&quot;.
The coat of arms have gone out of favour after the City Council amalgamated with its surrounding councils to form the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality.

===Tertiary education===
Pretoria is one of South Africa&#x27;s leading academic cities and is home to both the largest residential university in South Africa, largest distance education university in South Africa and a research intensive university. The three Universities in the city in order of the year founded are as follows:

====University of South Africa====

The University of South Africa (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the University of the Cape of Good Hope, is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300,000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world&#x27;s mega universities. Unisa is a dedicated open distance education institution and offers both vocational and academic programmes.

====University of Pretoria====

The University of Pretoria (commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies) is a multi campus public research university. The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the Johannesburg based Transvaal University College and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status. Established in 1920, the University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science is the second oldest veterinary school in Africa and the only veterinary school in South Africa. In 1949 the university launched the first MBA programme outside of North America. Since 1997, the university has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education&#x27;s accreditation benchmark.

====Tshwane University of Technology====

The Tshwane University of Technology (commonly referred to as TUT) is a higher education institution, offering vocational oriented diplomas and degrees, and came into being through a merger of Technikon Northern Gauteng, Technikon North-West and Technikon Pretoria. TUT caters for approximately 60,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa.

===CSIR===
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is South Africa&#x27;s central scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of parliament in 1945 and is situated on its own campus in the city. It is the largest research and development organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&amp;D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams. In 2002, Sibusiso Sibisi was appointed as the president and CEO of the CSIR.

==Military==
Pretoria has earned a reputation as being the centre of South Africa&#x27;s Military and is home to several military facilities of the South African National Defence Force:

===Military headquarters===

====Transito Air Force Headquarters====

This complex is the headquarters to the South African Air Force.

*Magazine Hill which is the regimental Headquarters to the Pretoria Armoured Regiment, a reserve tank regiment of the South African Army

====Thaba Tshwane====
Thaba Tshwane is a large military area south-west of the Pretoria Central Business District and North of Air Force Base Swartkop. It is the headquarters of several army units-

The South African Defence Intelligence College is also located in the Sterrewag Suburb north of Air Force Base Waterkloof.

===Air force bases===
While technically not within the city limits of Pretoria, Air Force Base Swartkop and Air Force Base Waterkloof are often used for defence related matters within the city. These may include aerial military transport duties within the city, aerospace monitoring and defence as well as VIP transport to and from the city.

==Proposed change of name==
On 26 May 2005 the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC), which is linked to the Directorate of Heritage in the Department of Arts and Culture, approved changing the name of Pretoria to Tshwane, which is already the name of the Metropolitan Municipality in which Pretoria and a number of surrounding cities are located. Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it was not approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture, who at the time requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC before presenting a recommendation before parliament for a vote. Various public interest groups warned that any name change would be challenged in court, should the minister approve it. The long process involved makes a name change less likely.

The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised &quot;Africa&#x27;s leading capital city&quot; as &quot;Tshwane&quot; since the SAGNC decision in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. When a complaint was lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media. Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their &quot;City of Tshwane&quot; advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. After refusing to abide by the ASA&#x27;s request, the Metro Council was banned from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to the capital as Tshwane. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.

After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place &quot;Tshwane&quot; advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area. In August 2007, an internal memo was leaked to the media in which the Tshwane mayor sought advice from the premier of Gauteng on whether the municipality could be called the &quot;City of Tshwane&quot; instead of just &quot;Tshwane&quot;. This could increase confusion about the distinction between the city of Pretoria and the municipality of Tshwane.

In early 2010 it was again rumoured that the South African government would make a decision regarding the name; however, a media briefing regarding name changes, which could have been an opportunity to discuss it, was cancelled shortly before taking place. Rumours of the name change provoked outrage from Afrikaner civil rights and political groups. It later emerged that the registration of the municipality as a geographic place had been published in the government gazette as it had been too late to withdraw the name from the publication, but it was announced that the name had been withdrawn, pending &quot;further work&quot; by officials. The following week, the registration of &quot;Tshwane&quot; was officially withdrawn in the Government Gazette. The retraction had reportedly been ordered at the behest of the Deputy President of South Africa Kgalema Motlanthe, acting on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, as minister of Arts and Culture Lulu Xingwana had acted contrary to the position of the ANC, which is that Pretoria and the municipality are separate entities, which was subsequently articulated by ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe.

In March 2010 a group supporting the name change, calling themselves the &quot;Tshwane Royal House Committee&quot;, claimed to be descendants of Chief Tshwane and demanded to be made part of the administration of the municipality.

According to comments made by Mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa in late 2011, the change would occur in 2012. However, there remained considerable uncertainty about the issue.

, the proposed name change has not occurred.

<text>A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry. Psychiatrists are physicians who evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments or strictly mental issues. Sometimes a psychiatrist works within a multi-disciplinary team, which may comprise clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, and nursing staff. Psychiatrists have broad training in a biopsychosocial approach to the assessment and management of mental illness.

As part of the clinical assessment process, psychiatrists may employ a mental status examination; a physical examination; brain imaging such as a computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography scan; and blood testing. Psychiatrists use pharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, or interventional approaches to treat mental disorders.

== Subspecialties ==
The field of psychiatry has many subspecialties that require additional (fellowship) training, which, in the US, are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and require Maintenance of Certification Program to continue. These include the following: 
* Clinical neurophysiology
* Forensic psychiatry
* Addiction psychiatry
* Child and adolescent psychiatry
* Geriatric psychiatry
* Palliative care
* Pain management
* Consultation-liaison psychiatry
* Sleep medicine
* Brain injury medicine

Further, other specialties that exist include:
* Cross-cultural psychiatry
* Emergency psychiatry
* Learning disability
* Neurodevelopmental disorder
* Cognition diseases, as in various forms of dementia
* Biological psychiatry
* Community psychiatry
* Global mental health
* Military psychiatry
* Social psychiatry
* Sports psychiatry

The United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties in the United States offers certification and fellowship program accreditation in the subspecialties of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, which is open to both neurologists and psychiatrists.

Some psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups. Pediatric psychiatry is the area of the profession working with children in addressing psychological problems. Psychiatrists specializing in geriatric psychiatry work with the elderly and are called geriatric psychiatrists or geropsychiatrists. Those who practice psychiatry in the workplace are called occupational psychiatrists in the United States and occupational psychology is the name used for the most similar discipline in the UK. Psychiatrists working in the courtroom and reporting to the judge and jury, in both criminal and civil court cases, are called forensic psychiatrists, who also treat mentally disordered offenders and other patients whose condition is such that they have to be treated in secure units.

Other psychiatrists may also specialize in psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, dementia-related disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep medicine, pain medicine, palliative medicine, eating disorders, sexual disorders, women&#x27;s health, global mental health, early psychosis intervention, mood disorders and anxiety disorders such as obsessive–compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Psychiatrists work in a wide variety of settings. Some are full-time medical researchers, many see patients in private medical practices, and consult liaison psychiatrists see patients in hospital settings where psychiatric and other medical conditions interact.

== Professional requirements ==
While requirements to become a psychiatric physician differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.

===India===

In India, a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree is the basic qualification needed to do psychiatry. After completing an MBBS (including an internship), they can attend various PG medical entrance exams and get a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) in psychiatry, which is a 3-year course. Diploma course in psychiatry or DNB psychiatry can also be taken to become a psychiatrist.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, one must complete medical school after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program, one can specialize for 4.5-years in psychiatry. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine, or medical research). To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short, this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children&#x27;s and adolescent psychiatrist.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, one must complete basic medical education, an MBBS, then get registered with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) as a general practitioner after a one-year mandatory internship, house job. After registration with PMDC, one has to take the FCPS-I exam. After that, they pursue four additional years of training in psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan. Training includes rotations in general medicine, neurology, and clinical psychology for three months each, during the first two years. There is a mid-exam intermediate module and a final exam after four years.

=== Hong Kong ===
In the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), psychiatrists are required to obtain a medical degree, followed by a minimum of six years of specialized training. Then, they must achieve fellowship at the Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists and attain the qualification of &#x27;specialist in psychiatry&#x27; from the Medical Council. Certified psychiatrists are included in the registry.

The fees charged by specialist psychiatrists vary. In private clinics, the cost of a consultation starts from HK$1,500. Compared to private clinics, the fees for specialist outpatient services of the Hospital Authority are lower, but the waiting time can be as long as two years. For Eligible Persons, the first consultation fee is HK$135, and each subsequent consultation fee is HK$80. Additionally, the cost for each type of medication is HK$15.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom, psychiatrists must hold a medical degree. Following this, the individual will work as a foundation house officer for two additional years in the UK, or one year as an intern in Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of basic specialist training culminating in the MRCPsych exam, followed by three years of higher specialist training referred to as &quot;ST4-6&quot; in the UK and &quot;Senior Registrar Training&quot; in Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of special interests such as forensic or child/adolescent takes place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training (CC(S)T). At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist, and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8–9 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local/native medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).

=== United States and Canada ===
In the United States and Canada, one must first attain the degree of M.D. or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, followed by practice as a psychiatric resident for another four years (five years in Canada). This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies. All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in cognitive behavioral, brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies. Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an &quot;internship&quot;. After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified. The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is twelve years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training. The average compensation for psychiatrists in the U.S. in 2023 was $309,000.

<text>In mathematical logic, the Peano axioms (, ), also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th-century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.

The axiomatization of arithmetic provided by Peano axioms is commonly called Peano arithmetic.

The importance of formalizing arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of Hermann Grassmann, who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction. In 1881, Charles Sanders Peirce provided an axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic. In 1888, Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in 1889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book &quot;The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method&quot; ().

The nine Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about equality; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the &quot;underlying logic&quot;. The next three axioms are first-order statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final, axiom is a second-order statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers, which makes this formulation close to second-order arithmetic. A weaker first-order system is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the second-order induction axiom with a first-order axiom schema. The term &quot;Peano arithmetic&quot; is sometimes used for specifically naming this restricted system.

== Historical second-order formulation ==
When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano&#x27;s ε). Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege&#x27;s work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.

The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of &quot;natural numbers&quot;, usually represented as a set N or formula_1 The non-logical symbols for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol &quot;S&quot;.

The first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:

Peano&#x27;s original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the &quot;first&quot; natural number, while the axioms in &quot;Formulario mathematico&quot; include zero.

The next four axioms describe the equality relation. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of &quot;the Peano axioms&quot; in modern treatments.

The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued &quot;successor&quot; function &quot;S&quot;.

Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a unary representation of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as &quot;S&quot;(0), 2 as &quot;S&quot;(&quot;S&quot;(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0.

The intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying &quot;successor&quot; sufficiently many times to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the &quot;axiom of induction&quot;.

The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:
In Peano&#x27;s original formulation, the induction axiom is a second-order axiom. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker first-order induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section below.

=== Defining arithmetic operations and relations ===

If we use the second-order induction axiom, it is possible to define addition, multiplication, and total (linear) ordering on N directly using the axioms. However, and addition and multiplication are often added as axioms. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.

==== Addition ====

Addition is a function that maps two natural numbers (two elements of N) to another one. It is defined recursively as:

: formula_2
For example:

: formula_3

To prove commutativity of addition, first prove formula_4 and formula_5, each by induction on formula_6. Using both results, then prove formula_7 by induction on formula_6.
The structure is a commutative monoid with identity element 0. is also a cancellative magma, and thus embeddable in a group. The smallest group embedding N is the integers.

==== Multiplication ====

Similarly, multiplication is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:

: formula_9
It is easy to see that formula_10 is the multiplicative right identity:

:formula_11

To show that formula_10 is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:

* formula_10 is the left identity of 0: formula_14.
* If formula_10 is the left identity of formula_16 (that is formula_17), then formula_10 is also the left identity of formula_19: formula_20, using commutativity of addition.

Therefore, by the induction axiom formula_10 is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers. Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication is commutative and distributes over addition:

: formula_22.

Thus, formula_23 is a commutative semiring.

==== Inequalities ====

The usual total order relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:

: For all , if and only if there exists some such that .

This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for formula_24, if , then:

* &quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;, and
* &quot;a&quot; · &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; · &quot;c&quot;.

Thus, the structure is an ordered semiring; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.

The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation &quot;≤&quot;:

: For any predicate &quot;φ&quot;, if
:* &quot;φ&quot;(0) is true, and
:* for every , if &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is true for every such that , then &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) is true,
:* then for every , &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is true.

This form of the induction axiom, called &quot;strong induction&quot;, is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are well-ordered—every nonempty subset of N has a least element—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty be given and assume &quot;X&quot; has no least element.

* Because 0 is the least element of N, it must be that .
* For any , suppose for every , . Then , for otherwise it would be the least element of &quot;X&quot;.

Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every , . Thus, , which contradicts &quot;X&quot; being a nonempty subset of N. Thus &quot;X&quot; has a least element.

=== Models ===

A model of the Peano axioms is a triple , where N is a (necessarily infinite) set, and satisfies the axioms above. Dedekind proved in his 1888 book, &quot;The Nature and Meaning of Numbers&quot; (, i.e., &quot;What are the numbers and what are they good for?&quot;) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are isomorphic. In particular, given two models and of the Peano axioms, there is a unique homomorphism satisfying

: formula_25
and it is a bijection. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are categorical. (This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, below.)

==== Set-theoretic models ====

The Peano axioms can be derived from set theoretic constructions of the natural numbers and axioms of set theory such as ZF. The standard construction of the naturals, due to John von Neumann, starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator &quot;s&quot; on sets defined as:

: formula_26

The set of natural numbers N is defined as the intersection of all sets closed under &quot;s&quot; that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:

: formula_27
and so on. The set N together with 0 and the successor function satisfies the Peano axioms.

Peano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.

==== Interpretation in category theory ====

The Peano axioms can also be understood using category theory. Let &quot;C&quot; be a category with terminal object 1&quot;C&quot;, and define the category of pointed unary systems, US1(&quot;C&quot;) as follows:

* The objects of US1(&quot;C&quot;) are triples where &quot;X&quot; is an object of &quot;C&quot;, and and are &quot;C&quot;-morphisms.
* A morphism &quot;φ&quot; : (&quot;X&quot;, 0&quot;X&quot;, &quot;S&quot;&quot;X&quot;) → (&quot;Y&quot;, 0&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;S&quot;&quot;Y&quot;) is a &quot;C&quot;-morphism with and .

Then &quot;C&quot; is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US1(&quot;C&quot;) has an initial object; this initial object is known as a natural number object in &quot;C&quot;. If is this initial object, and is any other object, then the unique map is such that

: formula_28
This is precisely the recursive definition of 0&quot;X&quot; and &quot;S&quot;&quot;X&quot;.

=== Consistency ===
When the Peano axioms were first proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a &quot;natural number&quot;. Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were &quot;consistent&quot;; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don&#x27;t define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their consistency using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself, if Peano arithmetic is consistent.

Although it is widely claimed that Gödel&#x27;s theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using type theory. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano&#x27;s axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called ε0. Gentzen explained: &quot;The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles&quot;. Gentzen&#x27;s proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε0 can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen&#x27;s proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.

The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano&#x27;s axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as Gentzen&#x27;s proof. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate ultrafinitism, reject Peano&#x27;s axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are self-verifying theories that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true formula_29 theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of &quot;0=1&quot;).

== Peano arithmetic as first-order theory ==

All of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction above is second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers). As an alternative one can consider a first-order &quot;axiom schema&quot; of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom. The reason that it is weaker is that the number of predicates in first-order language is countable, whereas the number of sets of natural numbers is uncountable. Thus, there exist sets that cannot be described in first-order language (in fact, most sets have this property).

First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have another technical limitation. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.

The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of Robinson arithmetic, is sufficient for this purpose:

* formula_30
* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33
* formula_34
* formula_35

In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a recursively enumerable and even decidable set of axioms. For each formula in the language of Peano arithmetic, the first-order induction axiom for &quot;φ&quot; is the sentence

:formula_36

where formula_37 is an abbreviation for &quot;y&quot;1...,&quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot;. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom; that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula &quot;φ&quot;.

=== Equivalent axiomatizations ===
The above axiomatization of Peano arithmetic uses a signature that only has symbols for zero as well as the successor, addition, and multiplications operations. There are many other different, but equivalent, axiomatizations. One such alternative uses an order relation symbol instead of the successor operation and the language of discretely ordered semirings (axioms 1-7 for semirings, 8-10 on order, 11-13 regarding compatibility, and 14-15 for discreteness):

# formula_38, i.e., addition is associative.
# formula_39, i.e., addition is commutative.
# formula_40, i.e., multiplication is associative.
# formula_41, i.e., multiplication is commutative.
# formula_42, i.e., multiplication distributes over addition.
# formula_43, i.e., zero is an identity for addition, and an absorbing element for multiplication (actually superfluous).
# formula_44, i.e., one is an identity for multiplication.
# formula_45, i.e., the &#x27;&lt;&#x27; operator is transitive.
# formula_46, i.e., the &#x27;&lt;&#x27; operator is irreflexive.
# formula_47, i.e., the ordering satisfies trichotomy.
# formula_48, i.e. the ordering is preserved under addition of the same element.
# formula_49, i.e. the ordering is preserved under multiplication by the same positive element.
# formula_50, i.e. given any two distinct elements, the larger is the smaller plus another element.
# formula_51, i.e. zero and one are distinct and there is no element between them. In other words, 0 is covered by 1, which suggests that these numbers are discrete.
# formula_52, i.e. zero is the minimum element.

The theory defined by these axioms is known as PA−. It is also incomplete and one of its important properties is that any structure formula_53 satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by formula_54) isomorphic to formula_55. Elements in that segment are called standard elements, while other elements are called nonstandard elements. 

Finally, Peano arithmetic PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema.

=== Undecidability and incompleteness ===

According to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, the theory of PA (if consistent) is incomplete. Consequently, there are sentences of first-order logic (FOL) that are true in the standard model of PA but are not a consequence of the FOL axiomatization. Essential incompleteness already arises for theories with weaker axioms, such as Robinson arithmetic. 

Closely related to the above incompleteness result (via Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem for FOL) it follows that there is no algorithm for deciding whether a given FOL sentence is a consequence of a first-order axiomatization of Peano arithmetic or not. Hence, PA is an example of an undecidable theory. Undecidability arises already for the existential sentences of PA, due to the negative answer to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, whose proof implies that all computably enumerable sets are diophantine sets, and thus definable by existentially quantified formulas (with free variables) of PA. Formulas of PA with higher quantifier rank (more quantifier alternations) than existential formulas are more expressive, and define sets in the higher levels of the arithmetical hierarchy.

=== Nonstandard models ===
Although the usual natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called &quot;non-standard models&quot;); the compactness theorem implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.

When interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind&#x27;s categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.

It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as Skolem in 1933 provided an explicit construction of such a nonstandard model. On the other hand, Tennenbaum&#x27;s theorem, proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is computable. This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. There is only one possible order type of a countable nonstandard model. Letting &quot;ω&quot; be the order type of the natural numbers, &quot;ζ&quot; be the order type of the integers, and &quot;η&quot; be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is , which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.

==== Overspill ====

A cut in a nonstandard model &quot;M&quot; is a nonempty subset &quot;C&quot; of &quot;M&quot; so that &quot;C&quot; is downward closed (&quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot; ⇒ &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;) and &quot;C&quot; is closed under successor. A proper cut is a cut that is a proper subset of &quot;M&quot;. Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers. However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable. The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact.

<doc id="25006" wikidata="Q13034" url="?curid=25006" title="Procyon">
<text>Procyon () is the brightest star in the constellation of Canis Minor and usually the eighth-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.34. It has the Bayer designation α Canis Minoris, which is Latinized to Alpha Canis Minoris, and abbreviated α CMi or Alpha CMi, respectively. As determined by the European Space Agency &quot;Hipparcos&quot; astrometry satellite, this system lies at a distance of just , and is therefore one of Earth&#x27;s nearest stellar neighbors. 

A binary star system, Procyon consists of a white-hued main-sequence star of spectral type F5 IV–V, designated component A, in orbit with a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DQZ, named Procyon B. The pair orbit each other with a period of 40.84 years and an eccentricity of 0.4.

==Observation==

Procyon is usually the eighth-brightest star in the night sky, culminating at midnight on 14 January. It forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle asterism, in combination with Sirius and Betelgeuse. The prime period for evening viewing of Procyon is in late winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

It has a color index of 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.

==Stellar system==
Procyon is a binary star system with a bright primary component, Procyon A, having an apparent magnitude of 0.34, and a faint companion, Procyon B, at magnitude 10.7. The pair orbit each other with a period of 40.84 years along an elliptical orbit with an eccentricity of 0.4, more eccentric than Mercury&#x27;s. The plane of their orbit is inclined at an angle of 31.1° to the line of sight with the Earth. The average separation of the two components is , a little less than the distance between Uranus and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9 AU and as far as 21.0 AU.

===Procyon A===
The primary has a stellar classification of F5IV–V, indicating that it is a late-stage F-type main-sequence star. Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is evolving into a subgiant that has nearly fused its hydrogen core into helium, after which it will expand as the nuclear reactions move outside the core. As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.

The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is an estimated , giving Procyon A a white hue. It is 1.5 times the solar mass (), twice the solar radius (), and has seven times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity (). Both the core and the envelope of this star are convective; the two regions being separated by a wide radiation zone.

====Oscillations====
In late June 2004, Canada&#x27;s orbital MOST satellite telescope carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm solar-like oscillations in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit asteroseismology. No oscillations were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered. However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based radial velocity observations of solar-like oscillations. Subsequent observations in radial velocity have confirmed that Procyon is indeed oscillating.

Photometric measurements from the NASA Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation (convection near the surface of the star) and solar-like oscillations. Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with radial velocity measurements from the ground. Additional observations with MOST taken in 2007 were able to detect oscillations.

===Procyon B===

Like Sirius B, Procyon B is a white dwarf that was inferred from astrometric data long before it was observed. Its existence had been postulated by German astronomer Friedrich Bessel as early as 1844, and, although its orbital elements had been calculated by his countryman Arthur Auwers in 1862 as part of his thesis, Procyon B was not visually confirmed until 1896 when John Martin Schaeberle observed it at the predicted position using the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory. It is more difficult to observe from Earth than Sirius B, due to a greater apparent magnitude difference and smaller angular separation from its primary.

At , Procyon B is considerably less massive than Sirius B; however, the peculiarities of degenerate matter ensure that it is larger than its more famous neighbor, with an estimated radius of 8,600 km, versus 5,800 km for Sirius B. The radius agrees with white dwarf models that assume a carbon core. It has a stellar classification of DQZ, having a helium-dominated atmosphere with traces of heavy elements. For reasons that remain unclear, the mass of Procyon B is unusually low for a white dwarf star of its type. With a surface temperature of , it is also much cooler than Sirius B; this is a testament to its lesser mass and greater age. The mass of the progenitor star for Procyon B was about and it came to the end of its life some  billion years ago, after a main-sequence lifetime of  million years.

===X-ray emission===
Attempts to detect X-ray emission from Procyon with nonimaging, soft X-ray-sensitive detectors prior to 1975 failed. Extensive observations of Procyon were carried out with the &quot;Copernicus&quot; and TD-1A satellites in the late 1970s. The X-ray source associated with Procyon AB was observed on 1 April 1979, with the Einstein Observatory high-resolution imager (HRI). The HRI X-ray pointlike source location is ~4″ south of Procyon A, on the edge of the 90% confidence error circle, indicating identification with Procyon A rather than Procyon B which was located about 5″ north of Procyon A (about 9″ from the X-ray source location).
==Etymology and cultural significance==
&quot;α Canis Minoris&quot; (Latinized to &quot;Alpha Canis Minoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The name &quot;Procyon&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;before the dog&quot;, since it precedes the &quot;Dog Star&quot; Sirius as it travels across the sky due to Earth&#x27;s rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater right ascension, it also has a more northerly declination, which means it will rise above the horizon earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with Maera, a hound belonging to Erigone, daughter of Icarius of Athens. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Procyon&quot; for the star α Canis Minoris A.

The two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, In Babylonian mythology, Procyon was known as Nangar (the Carpenter), an aspect of Marduk, involved in constructing and organizing the celestial sky.

The constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Procyon and Sirius were &quot;Volci&quot; &quot;the wolves&quot;, circling hungrily around Orion which depicted a plough with oxen.

Rarer names are the Latin translation of Procyon, &quot;Antecanis&quot;, and the Arabic-derived names &quot;Al Shira&quot; and &quot;Elgomaisa&quot;. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used a variant of this, &quot;Algomeiza/Algomeyza&quot;. &quot;Al Shira&quot; derives from &#x27;, &quot;the Syrian sign&quot; (the other sign being Sirius; &quot;Syria&quot; is supposedly a reference to its northern location relative to Sirius); &quot;Elgomaisa&quot; derives from &#x27; &quot;the bleary-eyed (woman)&quot;, in contrast to &quot;the teary-eyed (woman)&quot;, which is Sirius. (See Gomeisa.)

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;South River&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of Procyon, ε Canis Minoris and β Canis Minoris. Consequently, Procyon itself is known as (, &quot;the Third Star of South River&quot;). It is part of the Vermilion Bird.

The Hawaiians see Procyon as part of an asterism &quot;Ke ka o Makali&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;the canoe bailer of Makali&#x27;i&quot;) that helps them navigate at sea. In Hawaiian language, this star is called &quot;Puana&quot; (&quot;blossom&quot;), which is a new Hawaiian name based on the Māori name &quot;Puangahori&quot;. It forms this asterism &quot;(Ke ka o Makali&#x27;i)&quot; with the Pleiades (Makali&#x27;i), Auriga, Orion, Capella, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian lore, Procyon was one of the pillars propping up the sky, known as &quot;Anâ-tahu&#x27;a-vahine-o-toa-te-manava&quot; (&quot;star-the-priestess-of-brave-heart&quot;), the pillar for elocution. Māori astronomers know the star as &quot;Puangahori&quot; (&quot;False Puanga&quot;) which distinguishes it from its pair &quot;Puanga&quot; or &quot;Puanga-rua&quot; (&quot;Blossom-cluster&quot;) which refers to a star of great importance to Māori culture and calendar, known by its western name Rigel.

Procyon appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolizing the state of Amazonas.
The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil call Procyon and Canopus &quot;Kofongo&quot; (&quot;Duck&quot;), with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism&#x27;s appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in food staple manioc, used at feasts to feed guests.

Known as &quot;Sikuliarsiujuittuq&quot; to the Inuit, Procyon was quite significant in their astronomy and mythology. Its eponymous name means &quot;the one who never goes onto the newly formed sea ice&quot;, and refers to a man who stole food from his village&#x27;s hunters because he was too obese to hunt on ice. He was killed by the other hunters who convinced him to go on the sea ice. Procyon received this designation because it typically appears red (though sometimes slightly greenish) as it rises during the Arctic winter; this red color was associated with Sikuliarsiujuittuq&#x27;s bloody end.

==View from this system==
Were the Sun to be observed from this star system, it would appear to be a magnitude 2.55 star in the constellation Aquila with the exact opposite coordinates at right ascension , declination . It would be as bright as β Scorpii is in our sky. Canis Minor would obviously be missing its brightest star.

Procyon&#x27;s closest neighboring star is Luyten&#x27;s Star, about away. Procyon would be the brightest star in the night sky of an exoplanet orbiting Luyten&#x27;s Star, with an apparent magnitude of -4.68. Luyten&#x27;s Star would also be visible from Procyon, at an apparent magnitude of 4.61, unlike any red dwarfs from Earth.

<doc id="25008" wikidata="Q179637" url="?curid=25008" title="Prisoner of war">
<text>A prisoner of war (POW) is a person who is held captive by a belligerent power during or immediately after an armed conflict. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase &quot;prisoner of war&quot; dates back to 1610.

Belligerents hold prisoners of war in custody for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons, such as isolating them from the enemy combatants still in the field (releasing and repatriating them in an orderly manner after hostilities), demonstrating military victory, punishing them, prosecuting them for war crimes, exploiting them for their labour, recruiting or even conscripting them as their own combatants, collecting military and political intelligence from them, or indoctrinating them in new political or religious beliefs.

==Ancient times==
For a large part of human history, prisoners of war would most often be either slaughtered or enslaved. Early Roman gladiators could be prisoners of war, categorised according to their ethnic roots as Samnites, Thracians, and Gauls (&quot;Galli&quot;). Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; describes Trojan and Greek soldiers offering rewards of wealth to opposing forces who have defeated them on the battlefield in exchange for mercy, but their offers are not always accepted; see Lycaon for example.

Typically, victors made little distinction between enemy combatants and enemy civilians, although they were more likely to spare women and children. Sometimes the purpose of a battle, if not of a war, was to capture women, a practice known as &quot;raptio&quot;; the Rape of the Sabines involved, according to tradition, a large mass-abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no rights, and were held legally as chattels.

In the fourth century AD, Bishop Acacius of Amida, touched by the plight of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire, who were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life of slavery, took the initiative in ransoming them by selling his church&#x27;s precious gold and silver vessels and letting them return to their country. For this he was eventually canonised.

==Middle Ages and Renaissance==

According to legend, during Childeric&#x27;s siege and blockade of Paris in 464 the nun Geneviève (later canonised as the city&#x27;s patron saint) pleaded with the Frankish king for the welfare of prisoners of war and met with a favourable response. Later, Clovis I () liberated captives after Genevieve urged him to do so.

King Henry V&#x27;s English army killed many French prisoners of war after the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. This was done in retaliation for the French killing of the boys and other non-combatants handling the baggage and equipment of the army, and because the French were attacking again and Henry was afraid that they would break through and free the prisoners who would rejoin the fight against the English.

In the later Middle Ages a number of religious wars aimed to not only defeat but also to eliminate enemies. Authorities in Christian Europe often considered the extermination of heretics and heathens desirable. Examples of such wars include the 13th-century Albigensian Crusade in Languedoc and the Northern Crusades in the Baltic region. When asked by a Crusader how to distinguish between the Catholics and Cathars following the projected capture (1209) of the city of Béziers, the papal legate Arnaud Amalric allegedly replied, &quot;Kill them all, God will know His own&quot;.

Likewise, the inhabitants of conquered cities were frequently massacred during Christians&#x27; Crusades against Muslims in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen could hope to be ransomed; their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.

Feudal Japan had no custom of ransoming prisoners of war, who could expect for the most part summary execution.

In the 13th century the expanding Mongol Empire famously distinguished between cities or towns that surrendered (where the population was spared but required to support the conquering Mongol army) and those that resisted (in which case the city was ransacked and destroyed, and all the population killed). In Termez, on the Oxus: &quot;all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain&quot;.

The Aztecs warred constantly with neighbouring tribes and groups, aiming to collect live prisoners for sacrifice. For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 persons&quot; were sacrificed.

During the early Muslim conquests of 622–750, Muslims routinely captured large numbers of prisoners. Aside from those who converted, most were ransomed or enslaved. Christians captured during the Crusades were usually either killed or sold into slavery if they could not pay a ransom. During his lifetime ( – 632), Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion; however, if the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual. On certain occasions where Muhammad felt the enemy had broken a treaty with the Muslims he endorsed the mass execution of male prisoners who participated in battles, as in the case of the Banu Qurayza in 627. The Muslims divided up the females and children of those executed as &quot;ghanima&quot; (spoils of war).

==Modern times==
In Europe, the treatment of prisoners of war became increasingly centralised, in the time period between the 16th and late 18th century. Whereas prisoners of war had previously been regarded as the private property of the captor, captured enemy soldiers became increasingly regarded as the property of the state. The European states strove to exert increasing control over all stages of captivity, from the question of who would be attributed the status of prisoner of war to their eventual release. The act of surrender was regulated so that it, ideally, should be legitimised by officers, who negotiated the surrender of their whole unit. Soldiers whose style of fighting did not conform to the battle line tactics of regular European armies, such as Cossacks and Croats, were often denied the status of prisoners of war.

In line with this development the treatment of prisoners of war became increasingly regulated in international treaties, particularly in the form of the so-called cartel system, which regulated how the exchange of prisoners would be carried out between warring states. Another such treaty was the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This treaty established the rule that prisoners of war should be released without ransom at the end of hostilities and that they should be allowed to return to their homelands.

There also evolved the right of &quot;parole&quot;, French for &quot;discourse&quot;, in which a captured officer surrendered his sword and gave his word as a gentleman in exchange for privileges. If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who hold him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.

===European settlers captured in North America===

Early historical narratives of captured European settlers, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of Mary Rowlandson, captured in 1676 in the chaotic fighting of King Philip&#x27;s War, provide an early example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the captivity narrative, and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1826). Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and as bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example the case of John R. Jewitt, a sailor who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nootka people on the Pacific Northwest coast from 1802 to 1805.

=== Great Northern War ===
During the Great Northern War of 1700 to 1721, Russian authorities sent many Swedish prisoners-of-war, especially those who surrendered after the Battle of Poltava in 1709, to Siberia.

===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===
The earliest known purpose-built prisoner-of-war camp was established at Norman Cross in Huntingdonshire, England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross Prison was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of privateers. About 100 senior officers and some civilians &quot;of good social standing&quot;, mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given &quot;parole&quot; outside the prison, mainly in Peterborough although some further afield. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.

During the Battle of Leipzig both sides used the city&#x27;s cemetery as a lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6,000 POWs who lived in the burial vaults and used the coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.

===Prisoner exchanges===
The extensive period of conflict during the American Revolutionary War and Napoleonic Wars (1793–1815), followed by the Anglo-American War of 1812, led to the emergence of a cartel system for the exchange of prisoners, even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.

===American Civil War===


At the start of the American Civil War a system of paroles operated. Captives agreed not to fight until they were officially exchanged. Meanwhile, they were held in camps run by their own army where they were paid but not allowed to perform any military duties. The system of exchanges collapsed in 1863 when the Confederacy refused to exchange black prisoners. In the late summer of 1864, a year after the Dix–Hill Cartel was suspended, Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not. After that about 56,000 of the 409,000 POWs died in prisons during the American Civil War, accounting for nearly 10% of the conflict&#x27;s fatalities. Of the 45,000 Union prisoners of war confined in Camp Sumter, located near Andersonville, Georgia, 13,000 (28%) died. At Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois, 10% of its Confederate prisoners died during one cold winter month; and Elmira Prison in New York state, with a death rate of 25% (2,963), nearly equalled that of Andersonville.

===Amelioration===
During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new conventions being adopted and becoming recognised as international law that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.

===Hague and Geneva Conventions===
Chapter II of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention &quot;IV – The Laws and Customs of War on Land&quot; covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War and were largely revised in the Third Geneva Convention in 1949.

Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention protects captured military personnel, some guerrilla fighters, and certain civilians. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until his or her release or repatriation. Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, POWs acquires the status of protected persons, meaning it is a war crime by the detaining power to deprive the rights afforded to them by the Third Convention&#x27;s provisions. Article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention states that POWs can only be required to give their name, date of birth, rank and service number (if applicable).

The ICRC has a special role to play, with regards to international humanitarian law, in restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war, in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art. 71 and GC IV, art. 107).

However, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union&#x27;s refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets also used Axis prisoners as forced labour. The Germans also routinely executed Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the Commando Order.

====Qualifications====
To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be lawful combatants entitled to combatant&#x27;s privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy combatants. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must be part of a chain of command, wear a &quot;fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance&quot;, bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the laws and customs of war. (The Convention recognises a few other groups as well, such as &quot;[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units&quot;.)

Thus, uniforms and badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. Under Additional Protocol I, the requirement of a distinctive marking is no longer included. &quot;Francs-tireurs&quot;, militias, insurgents, terrorists, saboteurs, mercenaries, and spies generally do not qualify because they do not fulfill the criteria of Additional Protocol I. Therefore, they fall under the category of unlawful combatants, or more properly they are not combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get prisoner of war status are still protected like civilians under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

The criteria are applied primarily to &quot;international&quot; armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like civil wars is guided by Additional Protocol II, but insurgents are often treated as traitors, terrorists or criminals by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. However, in the American Civil War, both sides treated captured troops as POWs presumably out of reciprocity, although the Union regarded Confederate personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.

===Rights===
Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war (POW) must be:
* Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honour
* Able to inform their next of kin and the International Committee of the Red Cross of their capture
* Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages
* Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention
* Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading
* Released quickly after conflicts end
* Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number

In addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the International Committee of the Red Cross.

When a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a war of aggression, murder, ill treatment, and deportation of individuals, and genocide during World War II. Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.

===U.S. Code of Conduct and terminology===

The United States Military Code of Conduct was promulgated in 1955 via under President Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organisation, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the Korean War.

When a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, &quot;name, rank, serial number&quot;), receiving special favours or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.

Since the Vietnam War, the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.

In 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; for captured American personnel with &quot;Missing-Captured&quot;. A January 2008 directive states that the reasoning behind this is since &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; is the international legal recognised status for such people there is no need for any individual country to follow suit. This change remains relatively unknown even among experts in the field and &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; remains widely used in the Pentagon which has a &quot;POW/Missing Personnel Office&quot; and awards the Prisoner of War Medal.

==World War I==


During World War I, about eight million men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured. Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.

The German Empire held 2.5 million prisoners; Russia held 2.9 million, and Britain and France held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the Armistice in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes killed or mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.

There was much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador (prior to America&#x27;s entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;. Even worse conditions are reported in the book &quot;Escape of a Princess Pat&quot; by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died. Nearly 375,000 of the 500,000 Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war taken by Russians perished in Siberia from smallpox and typhus. In Germany, food was short, but only 5 per cent died.

The Ottoman Empire often treated prisoners of war poorly. Some 11,800 British soldiers, most from the British Indian Army, became prisoners after the five-month Siege of Kut, in Mesopotamia, in April 1916. Many were weak and starved when they surrendered and 4,250 died in captivity.

During the Sinai and Palestine campaign 217 Australian and unknown numbers of British, New Zealand and Indian soldiers were captured by Ottoman forces. About 50 per cent of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. Australian Flying Corps pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed. About 25 per cent of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, while only one officer died. The most curious case came in Russia where the Czechoslovak Legion of Czechoslovak prisoners (from the Austro-Hungarian army) who were released and armed to fight on the side of the Entente, who briefly served as a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

===Release of prisoners===
At the end of the war in 1918 there were believed to be 140,000 British prisoners of war in Germany, including thousands of internees held in neutral Switzerland. The first British prisoners were released and reached Calais on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via Dunkirk to Dover and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for demobilisation.

On 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released &quot;en masse&quot; and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many ex-prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by cavalry troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.

Upon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and &quot;boarded&quot; before being dispatched to their own homes. All commissioned officers had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King George V, written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph.

While the Allied prisoners were sent home at the end of the war, the same treatment was not granted to Central Powers prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom had to serve as forced labour, e.g. in France, until 1920. They were released after many approaches by the ICRC to the Allied Supreme Council.

==World War II==
Historian Niall Ferguson, in addition to figures from Keith Lowe, tabulated the total death rate for POWs in World War II as follows:

===Treatment of POWs by the Axis===

====Empire of Japan====

The Empire of Japan, which had signed but never ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with international agreements, including provisions of the Hague Conventions, either during the Second Sino-Japanese War or during the Pacific War, because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable. Moreover, according to a directive ratified on 5 August 1937 by Emperor Hirohito, the constraints of the Hague Conventions were explicitly removed on Chinese prisoners of war.

Prisoners of war from China, the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Japanese-occupied Asia, held by Japanese imperial armed forces were subject to murder, torture, beatings, extrajudicial punishment, brutal treatment, slavery, medical experiments, starvation rations, poor medical treatment and cannibalism. The most notorious use of forced labour was in the construction of the Burma–Thailand Death Railway. After 20 March 1943, the Imperial Navy was ordered to kill prisoners of war taken at sea. After the Armistice of Cassibile, Italian soldiers and civilians in East Asia were taken as prisoners of war by Japanese armed forces and subject to the same conditions as other POWs.

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the Japanese captured 350,000 POWs, of which 131,134 came from Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. Of these 131,134 POWs, 35,756 died while detained, the death rate of Western prisoners was thus 27.1 per cent, seven times that of Western POWs under the Germans and Italians. The death rate of Chinese was much higher. Thus, while 37,583 prisoners from the United Kingdom, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number for the Chinese was only 56. The 27,465 US Army POWs captured in the Pacific Theater, including Filipinos, had a 40.4 per cent death rate. The War Ministry in Tokyo issued an order at the end of the war allowing local commanders to kill remaining POWs without formal orders from Tokyo.

No direct access to the POWs was provided to the International Red Cross. Escapes amongst the prisoners of European descent were almost impossible because of the difficulty of hiding in Asiatic populations.

Allied POW camps and ship-transports became accidental targets of Allied attacks. The number of deaths which occurred when Japanese &quot;hell ships&quot;—unmarked transport ships in which POWs were transported in harsh conditions—were attacked by U.S. Navy submarines was particularly high. Gavan Daws has calculated that &quot;of all POWs who died in the Pacific War, one in three was killed on the water by friendly fire&quot;. Daws states that 10,800 of the 50,000 POWs shipped by the Japanese were killed at sea while Donald L. Miller states that &quot;approximately 21,000 Allied POWs died at sea, about 19,000 of them killed by friendly fire.&quot;

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old, and Ronald Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, toilet paper as the &quot;canvas&quot;. Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.

Female prisoners (detainees) at Changi Prison in Singapore, recorded their ordeal in seemingly harmless prison quilt embroidery.

====Germany====
=====French soldiers=====

After the French armies surrendered in summer 1940, Germany seized two million French prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various terms. Of the remainder, the officers and non-commissioned officers were kept in camps and did not work. The privates were sent out to work. About half of them worked for German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.

=====Western Allies&#x27; POWs=====

Germany and Italy generally treated prisoners from the British Empire and Commonwealth, France, the U.S., and other western Allies in accordance with the Geneva Convention, which had been signed by these countries. Consequently, western Allied officers were not usually made to work and some personnel of lower rank were usually compensated, or not required to work either. The main complaints of western Allied prisoners of war in German POW camps—especially during the last two years of the war—concerned shortages of food.

Only a small proportion of western Allied POWs who were Jews—or whom the Nazis believed to be Jewish—were killed as part of the Holocaust or were subjected to other antisemitic policies. For example, Major Yitzhak Ben-Aharon, a Palestinian Jew who had enlisted in the British Army, and who was captured by the Germans in Greece in 1941, experienced four years of captivity under entirely normal conditions for POWs.

A small number of Allied personnel were sent to concentration camps, for a variety of reasons including being Jewish. As the US historian Joseph Robert White put it: &quot;An important exception ... is the sub-camp for U.S. POWs at Berga an der Elster, officially called &quot;Arbeitskommando 625&quot; [also known as &quot;Stalag IX-B&quot;]. Berga was the deadliest work detachment for American captives in Germany. 73 men who participated, or 21 percent of the detachment, perished in two months. 80 of the 350 POWs were Jews.&quot; Another well-known example was a group of 168 Australian, British, Canadian, New Zealand and US aviators who were held for two months at Buchenwald concentration camp; two of the POWs died at Buchenwald. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this incident: German authorities wanted to make an example of &quot;Terrorflieger&quot; (&quot;terrorist aviators&quot;) or these aircrews were classified as spies, because they had been disguised as civilians or enemy soldiers when they were apprehended.
Information on conditions in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted &quot;The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren&#x27;t gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy on the part of the Germans.&quot; Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup which was still more substantial than what Soviet POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that &quot;The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened enough that we wouldn&#x27;t attempt escape.&quot;

As the Red Army approached some POW camps in early 1945, German guards forced western Allied POWs to walk long distances towards central Germany, often in extreme winter weather conditions. It is estimated that, out of 257,000 POWs, about 80,000 were subject to such marches and up to 3,500 of them died as a result.

=====Italian POWs=====
In September 1943 after the Armistice, Italian officers and soldiers in many places waiting for orders were arrested by Germans and Italian fascists and taken to internment camps in Germany or Eastern Europe, where they were held for the duration of the war. The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POWs, but the prisoners held the status of &quot;military internees&quot;. Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovannino Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as &quot;My Secret Diary&quot;. He wrote about semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how, when they were released (now from a German camp), they found a deserted German town filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.. It is estimated that of the 700,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Germans, around 40,000 died in detention and more than 13,000 lost their lives during the transportation from the Greek islands to the mainland.

=====Eastern European POWs=====

Between 1941 and 1945 the Axis powers took about 5.7 million Soviet prisoners. About one million of them were released during the war, in that their status changed but they remained under German authority. A little over 500,000 either escaped or were liberated by the Red Army. Some 930,000 more were found alive in camps after the war. The remaining 3.3 million prisoners (57.5% of the total captured) died during their captivity. Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million Soviet prisoners taken died while in German hands. According to Russian military historian General Grigoriy Krivosheyev, the Axis powers took 4.6 million Soviet prisoners, of whom 1.8 million were found alive in camps after the war and 318,770 were released by the Axis during the war and were then drafted into the Soviet armed forces again. By comparison, 8,348 Western Allied prisoners died in German camps during 1939–45 (3.5% of the 232,000 total).
The Germans officially justified their policy on the grounds that the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. Legally, however, under article 82 of the Geneva Convention, signatory countries had to give POWs of all signatory and non-signatory countries the rights assigned by the convention. Shortly after the German invasion in 1941, the USSR made Berlin an offer of a reciprocal adherence to the Hague Conventions. Third Reich officials left the Soviet &quot;note&quot; unanswered.

====Romania====
=====Soviet POWs=====
Between 1941 and 1944, 91,060 Soviet prisoners of war were captured by the Romanian Army. Until August 1944, 5,221 Soviet prisoners died in Romanian camps mainly to disease during winter. The POWs were treated according to the 1929 Geneva Convention, which was ratified by Romania on 15 September 1931. Initially, the prisoners were held in five POW camps in Vulcan, Găești, Drăgășani, Alexandria and Slobozia. By 1942, the number reached 12 camps of which 10 were in Romania, and two in Transnistria at Tiraspol and Odesa. As the frontline moved further away, the captured prisoners were given to German POW camps, and then they were transferred to Romanian ones after requests from the Romanian authorities.
In the winter of 1941/1942, the conditions of the POW camps were unsatisfactory, leading to the deaths of prisoners due to various diseases. The conditions were improved in 1942 when, by order of Marshal Ion Antonescu, the organisations leading the camps were to permanently control how the prisoners were accommodated, cared for, fed, and used. Due to some problems that arose with the food allowance in 1942, it was decided that the prisoners were to be fed like the Romanian troops, with an allocated 30 lei per soldier per day.

In accordance with Article 27 of the Geneva Convention, the POWs were used in various productive activities. In return for providing work, the prisoners were granted payment and accommodation, as well as free time for cleaning, rest, and religious or other activities by their employers, according to the contracts signed with the commanders of the prison camps. The main workplaces for prisoners were in agriculture and industrial enterprises, but also in forestry, civil works, and in service of the POW camps.

For correspondence with their families, the prisoners were provided with postcards. However, most of these were not used as the POWs feared reprisals from the Soviet authorities upon learning that they were prisoners in Romania. The punishment of POWs in the Romanian camps was applied following the regulations of the Romanian Army. Executions by firing squad were few. The escapees who were caught and did not commit any acts of sabotage or espionage were tried by court-martial and sentenced to prison terms from 3–6 months to several years. After 23 August 1944, the Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet headquarters.

=====Western Allies&#x27; POWs=====

The first Americans were captured in Romania following Operation Tidal Wave. The airmen were interned at first in the court of the Central Seminary in Bucharest, with the wounded airmen taken to the no. 415 Hospital in Sinaia. After Marshal Antonescu&#x27;s visits, a new camp was to be set up, and the prisoners were to be treated according to the Geneva Convention. In September, all 110 POWs were transferred to the villas belonging to the Brașov and Giurgiu City Halls at Timișul de Jos, in the newly established Camp No. 14 (&quot;Lagărul de prizonieri nr. 14&quot;). The excellent living conditions at the camp earned it the nickname &quot;gilded cage&quot;, with the prisoners describing it as &quot;probably the best prison camp in the world&quot;. The treatment of the Allied POWs was overseen by Princess Catherine Caradja, who was nicknamed &quot;The Angel of Ploiești&quot; by the airmen.

In the spring of 1944, with the increasing number of American and British prisoners due to the restarted air campaign, a new camp was set up in Bucharest. Camp No. 13 from Bucharest was initially located within the barracks of the 6th Guard Regiment &quot;Mihai Viteazul&quot;, in a frequently bombed area. It was later moved to the Normal School on St. Ecaterina Street. In June 1944, the non-commissioned officers were transferred to a wing of the . After 23 August, at the request of the prisoners to be organised into a military unit, General Mihail Racoviță approved the transfer of 896 POWs to the barracks of the 4th Vânători Regiment. All Western Allied POWs were evacuated to Italy during Operation Reunion from 31 August to 3 September.

===Treatment of POWs by the Soviet Union===
====Germans, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Finns====

According to some sources, the Soviets captured 3.5 million Axis servicemen (excluding Japanese), of whom more than a million died. One specific example is that of the German POWs after the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Soviets captured 91,000 German troops in total (completely exhausted, starving and sick), of whom only 5,000 survived the captivity.

German soldiers were kept as forced labour for many years after the war. The last German POWs like Erich Hartmann, the highest-scoring fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare, who had been declared guilty of war crimes but without due process, were not released by the Soviets until 1955, two years after Stalin died.

====Polish====

As a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, hundreds of thousands of Polish soldiers became prisoners of war in the Soviet Union. Thousands were executed; over 20,000 Polish military personnel and civilians perished in the Katyn massacre. Out of Anders&#x27; 80,000 evacuees from the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom, only 310 volunteered to return to Poland in 1947.

Of the 230,000 Polish prisoners of war taken by the Soviet army, only 82,000 survived.

====Japanese====
After the Soviet–Japanese War, 560,000 to 760,000 Japanese prisoners of war were captured by the Soviet Union. The prisoners were captured in Manchuria, Korea, South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, then sent to work as forced labour in the Soviet Union and Mongolia. An estimated 60,000 to 347,000 of these Japanese prisoners of war died in captivity.

====Americans====
Stories that circulated during the Cold War claimed 23,000 Americans held in German POW camps had been seized by the Soviets and never been repatriated. The claims had been perpetuated after the release of people like John H. Noble. Careful scholarly studies demonstrated that this was a myth based on the misinterpretation of a telegram about Soviet prisoners held in Italy.

===Treatment of POWs by the Western Allies===


====Germans====

During the war, the armies of Western Allied nations such as Australia, Canada, the UK and the US were given orders to treat Axis prisoners strictly in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Some breaches of the Convention took place, however. According to Stephen E. Ambrose, of the roughly 1,000 US combat veterans he had interviewed, only one admitted to shooting a prisoner, saying he &quot;felt remorse, but would do it again&quot;. However, one-third of interviewees told him they had seen fellow US troops kill German prisoners.

In Britain, German prisoners, particularly higher-ranked officers, were housed in luxurious buildings where listening devices were installed. A considerable amount of military intelligence was gained from eavesdropping on what the officers believed were private casual conversations. Much of the listening was carried out by German refugees, in many cases Jews. The work of these refugees in contributing to the Allied victory was declassified over half a century later.

In February 1944, 59.7% of POWs in America were employed. This relatively low percentage was due to problems setting wages that would not compete against those of non-prisoners, to union opposition, as well as concerns about security, sabotage, and escape. Given national manpower shortages, citizens and employers resented the idle prisoners, and efforts were made to decentralise the camps and reduce security enough that more prisoners could work. By the end of May 1944, POW employment was at 72.8%, and by late April 1945 it had risen to 91.3%. The sector that made the most use of POW workers was agriculture. There was more demand than supply of prisoners throughout the war, and 14,000 POW repatriations were delayed in 1946 so prisoners could be used in the spring farming seasons, mostly to thin and block sugar beets in the west. While some in Congress wanted to extend POW labour beyond June 1946, President Truman rejected this, leading to the end of the program.

Towards the end of the war in Europe, as large numbers of Axis soldiers surrendered, the US created the designation of Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEF) so as not to treat prisoners as POWs. A lot of these soldiers were kept in open fields in makeshift camps in the Rhine valley (&quot;Rheinwiesenlager&quot;). Controversy has arisen about how Eisenhower managed these prisoners. (see &quot;Other Losses&quot;).

After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the POW status of the German prisoners was in many cases maintained, and they were for several years used as public labourers in countries such as the UK and France. Many died when forced to clear minefields in countries such as Norway and France. &quot;By September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents&quot;.

In 1946, the UK held over 400,000 German POWs, many having been transferred from POW camps in the US and Canada. They were employed as labourers to compensate for the lack of manpower in Britain, as a form of war reparation. A public debate ensued in the UK over the treatment of German prisoners of war, with many in Britain comparing the treatment to the POWs to slave labour. In 1947, the Ministry of Agriculture argued against repatriation of working German prisoners, since by then they made up 25 per cent of the land workforce, and it wanted to continue having them work in the UK until 1948.

The &quot;London Cage&quot;, an MI19 prisoner of war facility in London used during and immediately after the war to interrogate prisoners before sending them to prison camps, was subject to allegations of torture.

After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid, such as food or prisoner visits, to POW camps in Germany. However, after making appeals to the Allies in the autumn of 1945, the Red Cross was allowed to investigate the camps in the British and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as providing relief to the prisoners held there. On 4 February 1946, the Red Cross was also permitted to visit and assist prisoners in the US occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. &quot;During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made&quot;.

POWs were also transferred among the Allies, with for example 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps to the Soviets and subsequently imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, at the time one of the NKVD special camps. Although the Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention, the U.S. chose to hand over several hundred thousand German prisoners to the Soviet Union in May 1945 as a &quot;gesture of friendship&quot;. U.S. forces also refused to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender to them in Saxony and Bohemia, and handed them over to the Soviet Union instead.

The United States handed over 740,000 German prisoners to France, which was a Geneva Convention signatory but which used them as forced labourers. Newspapers reported that the POWs were being mistreated; Judge Robert H. Jackson, chief US prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials, told US President Harry S Truman in October 1945 that the Allies themselves,

have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it.

====Hungarians====
Hungarians became POWs of the Western Allies. Some of these were, like the Germans, used as forced labour in France after the cessation of hostilities. After the war, Hungarian POWs were handed over to the Soviets and transported to the Soviet Union for forced labour. Such forced Hungarian labour by the USSR is often referred to as malenkij robot—little work. András Toma, a Hungarian soldier taken prisoner by the Red Army in 1944, was discovered in a Russian psychiatric hospital in 2000. It is likely that he was the last prisoner of war from World War II to be repatriated.

====Japanese====

Although thousands of Japanese servicemembers were taken prisoner of war, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the Battle of Iwo Jima, over 20,000 were killed and only 216 were taken prisoner of war. Of the 30,000 Japanese troops that defended Saipan, fewer than 1,000 remained alive at battle&#x27;s end. Japanese prisoners of war sent to camps fared well; however, some were killed when attempting to surrender or were massacred just after doing so (see Allied war crimes during World War II in the Pacific). In some instances, Japanese prisoners of war were tortured through a variety of methods. A method of torture used by the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) included suspending prisoners by the neck in wooden cages until they died. In very rare cases, some were beheaded by sword, and a severed head was once used as a football by Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers.

After the war, many Japanese POWs were kept on as Japanese Surrendered Personnel until mid-1947 by the Allies. The JSP were used until 1947 for labour purposes, such as road maintenance, recovering corpses for reburial, cleaning, and preparing farmland. Early tasks also included repairing airfields damaged by Allied bombing during the war and maintaining law and order until the arrival of Allied forces in the region.

====Italians====

In 1943, Italy overthrew Mussolini and became an Allied co-belligerent. This did not change the status of many Italian POWs, retained in Australia, the UK and US due to labour shortages.

After Italy surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany, the United States initially made plans to send Italian POWs back to fight Germany. Ultimately though, the government decided instead to loosen POW work requirements prohibiting Italian prisoners from carrying out war-related work. About 34,000 Italian POWs were active in 1944 and 1945 on 66 US military installations, performing support roles such as quartermaster, repair, and engineering work as Italian Service Units.

====Cossacks====

On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the Yalta Conference, the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR. The interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets (Operation Keelhaul) regardless of their wishes. The forced repatriation operations took place in 1945–1947.

==Post-World War II==

During the Korean War, the North Koreans developed a reputation for severely mistreating and torturing prisoners of war (see Treatment of POWs by North Korean and Chinese forces). Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful to the North Korean military; these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. While POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration, regular prisoners of war were usually tortured or treated very poorly.

The 1952 Inter-Camp POW Olympics were held from 15 to 27 November 1952 in Pyuktong, North Korea. The Chinese hoped to gain worldwide publicity, and while some prisoners refused to participate, some 500 POWs of eleven nationalities took part. They came from all the North Korean prison camps and competed in football, baseball, softball, basketball, volleyball, track and field, soccer, gymnastics, and boxing. For the POWs, this was also an opportunity to meet with friends from other camps. The prisoners had their own photographers, announcers, and even reporters, who after each day&#x27;s competition published a newspaper, the &quot;Olympic Roundup&quot;.

At the end of the First Indochina War, of the 11,721 French soldiers taken prisoner after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and led by the Viet Minh on death marches to distant POW camps, only 3,290 were repatriated four months later.

During the Vietnam War, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army took many United States servicemembers as prisoners of war and subjected them to mistreatment and torture. Some American prisoners of war were held in the prison known to US POWs as the Hanoi Hilton. Communist Vietnamese held in custody by South Vietnamese and American forces were also tortured and badly treated. After the war, millions of South Vietnamese servicemen and government workers were sent to &quot;re-education&quot; camps, where many perished.

As in previous conflicts, speculation existed, without evidence, that a handful of American pilots captured during the Korean and Vietnam wars were transferred to the Soviet Union and never repatriated.

Regardless of regulations determining treatment of prisoners, violations of their rights continue to be reported. Many cases of POW massacres have been reported in recent times, including the murder of Israeli prisoners of war in the 1973 Yom Kippur War by their Egyptian captors, the 13 October massacre in Lebanon by Syrian forces and June 1990 massacre in Sri Lanka.

Indian intervention in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 led to the third Indo-Pakistan war, which ended in Indian victory and the capture of 93,000 Pakistani POWs, they were later slowly repatriated in a deal with Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, prisoners were well-treated in general by both sides, with military commanders dispatching enemy prisoners back to their homelands in record time following the end of the war.

In 1991, during the Gulf War, American, British, Italian, and Kuwaiti POWs (mostly crew members of downed aircraft and special forces) were tortured by the Iraqi secret police. An American military doctor, Major Rhonda Cornum, a 37-year-old flight surgeon captured when her Blackhawk UH-60 was shot down, was also subjected to sexual abuse.

During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s, Serb paramilitary forces supported by JNA forces killed POWs at Vukovar and Škarbrnja, while Bosnian Serb forces killed POWs at Srebrenica. A large number of surviving Croatian or Bosnian POWs described the conditions in Serbian concentration camps as similar to those in Germany in World War II, including regular beatings, torture and random executions.

In 2001, reports emerged concerning two POWs that India had taken during the Sino-Indian War, Yang Chen and Shih Liang. The two were imprisoned as spies for three years before being interned in a mental asylum in Ranchi, where they spent the following 38 years under a special prisoner status.

The last prisoners of the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War were exchanged in 2003.

During the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Ukrainian POWs have described being tortured by Russian forces using electrocution, beatings, and sexual abuse. Both sides of the conflict forced prisoners to be naked at times as a humiliating punishment.

==Numbers of POWs==
This section lists nations with the highest number of POWs since the start of World War II and ranked by descending order. These are also the highest numbers in any war since the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War entered into force on 19 June 1931. The USSR had not signed the Geneva Convention.
