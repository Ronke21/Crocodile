<text>The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans conquered most of this during the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Octavian&#x27;s assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

By 100 BC, the city of Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond. However, it was severely destabilised by civil wars and political conflicts, which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. In 27 BC, the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching military power () and the new title of &quot;Augustus&quot;, marking his accession as the first Roman emperor. The vast Roman territories were organized into senatorial provinces, governed by proconsuls who were appointed by lot annually, and imperial provinces, which belonged to the emperor but were governed by legates.

The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana (). Rome reached its greatest territorial extent under Trajan (), but a period of increasing trouble and decline began under Commodus (). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a 49-year crisis that threatened its existence due to civil war, plagues and barbarian invasions. The Gallic and Palmyrene empires broke away from the state and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire, which was later reunified under Aurelian (). The civil wars ended with the victory of Diocletian (), who set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West. Constantine the Great (), the first Christian emperor, moved the imperial seat from Rome to Byzantium in 330, and renamed it Constantinople. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire. With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Empire finally collapsed. The Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city&#x27;s fall in 1453.

Due to the Empire&#x27;s extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had a lasting influence on the development of language, religion, art, architecture, literature, philosophy, law, and forms of government across its territories. Latin evolved into the Romance languages while Medieval Greek became the language of the East. The Empire&#x27;s adoption of Christianity resulted in the formation of medieval Christendom. Roman and Greek art had a profound impact on the Italian Renaissance. Rome&#x27;s architectural tradition served as the basis for Romanesque, Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture, influencing Islamic architecture. The rediscovery of classical science and technology (which formed the basis for Islamic science) in medieval Europe contributed to the Scientific Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. Many modern legal systems, such as the Napoleonic Code, descend from Roman law. Rome&#x27;s republican institutions have influenced the Italian city-state republics of the medieval period, the early United States, and modern democratic republics.

==History==

===Transition from Republic to Empire===
Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an &quot;empire&quot; (a great power) long before it had an emperor. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected magistrates (Roman consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate. The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors. The consuls&#x27; military power rested in the Roman legal concept of &quot;imperium&quot;, meaning &quot;command&quot; (typically in a military sense). Occasionally, successful consuls or generals were given the honorary title &quot;imperator&quot; (commander); this is the origin of the word &quot;emperor&quot;, since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.

Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and civil wars from the late second century BC (see Crisis of the Roman Republic) while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated by a faction that opposed his concentration of power. This faction was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by Mark Antony and Caesar&#x27;s adopted son Octavian. Antony and Octavian divided the Roman world between them, but this did not last long. Octavian&#x27;s forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate gave him the title &quot;Augustus&quot; (&quot;venerated&quot;) and made him &quot;princeps&quot; (&quot;foremost&quot;) with proconsular &quot;imperium&quot;, thus beginning the Principate, the first epoch of Roman imperial history. Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority. During his 40-year rule, a new constitutional order emerged so that, upon his death, Tiberius would succeed him as the new &quot;de facto&quot; monarch.

===&quot;Pax Romana&quot;===

The 200 years that began with Augustus&#x27;s rule is traditionally regarded as the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; (&quot;Roman Peace&quot;). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down &quot;mercilessly and swiftly&quot;. The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as the victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the &quot;Five Good Emperors&quot;: Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.

===Transition from classical to late antiquity===


In the view of contemporary Greek historian Cassius Dio, the accession of Commodus in 180 marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron&quot;, a comment which has led some historians, notably Edward Gibbon, to take Commodus&#x27; reign as the beginning of the Empire&#x27;s decline.

In 212, during the reign of Caracalla, Roman citizenship was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The Severan dynasty was tumultuous; an emperor&#x27;s reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, this crisis sometimes marks the transition from Classical to Late Antiquity. Aurelian () stabilised the empire militarily and Diocletian reorganised and restored much of it in 285. Diocletian&#x27;s reign brought the empire&#x27;s most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the &quot;Great Persecution&quot;.

Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate tetrarch. Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy collapsed shortly after. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. Julian, who under the influence of his adviser Mardonius attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the state religion.

===Fall in the West and survival in the East===
The Western Roman Empire began to disintegrate in the early 5th century. The Romans fought off all invaders, most famously Attila, but the empire had assimilated so many Germanic peoples of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. Most chronologies place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when Romulus Augustulus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer.

Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring Zeno sole emperor and placing himself as Zeno&#x27;s nominal subordinate. In reality, Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone. The Eastern Roman Empire, called the Byzantine Empire by later historians, continued until the reign of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Roman emperor. He died in battle in 1453 against Mehmed II and his Ottoman forces during the siege of Constantinople. Mehmed II adopted the title of &quot;caesar&quot; in an attempt to claim a connection to the former Empire. His claim was soon recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but not by European monarchs.

==Geography and demography==

The Roman Empire was one of the largest in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase &quot;imperium sine fine&quot; (&quot;empire without end&quot;) expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by Jupiter. This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century. In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example cutting down entire forests.

Roman expansion was mostly accomplished under the Republic, though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened. Under Augustus, a &quot;global map of the known world&quot; was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive political geography that survives from antiquity, the &quot;Geography&quot; of Strabo. When Augustus died, the account of his achievements (&quot;Res Gestae&quot;) prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire. Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of Roman Imperial administration.
The Empire reached its largest expanse under Trajan (), encompassing 5 million km2. The traditional population estimate of inhabitants accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world&#x27;s total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. Recent demographic studies have argued for a population peak from to more than . Each of the three largest cities in the Empire—Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch—was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.

As the historian Christopher Kelly described it:

Trajan&#x27;s successor Hadrian adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders (&quot;fines&quot;) were marked, and the frontiers (&quot;limites&quot;) patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever-present barbarian threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.

==Languages==

Latin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, but the Empire was deliberately multilingual. Andrew Wallace-Hadrill says &quot;The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood&quot;. At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law. Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages.

Latin and Greek&#x27;s mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic. Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era, especially for military, administration, and trade and commerce matters. Greek grammar, literature, poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture.
There was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire, but it represented a certain status. High standards of Latin, &quot;Latinitas&quot;, started with the advent of Latin literature. Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire, a natural competition of language emerged that spurred &quot;Latinitas&quot;, to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek. Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class. Most of the emperors were bilingual but had a preference for Latin in the public sphere for political reasons, a &quot;rule&quot; that first started during the Punic Wars. Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire.

After all freeborn inhabitants were universally in 212, many Roman citizens would have lacked a knowledge of Latin. The wide use of Koine Greek was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the lingua franca of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire. Following Diocletian&#x27;s reforms in the 3rd century CE, there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west. Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient romance languages in the 7th century CE following the collapse of the Empire&#x27;s west.

The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire. Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages. References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages, particularly in Egypt with Coptic, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths. In Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military. The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 575. The emergent Gallo-Romance languages would then be shaped by Gaulish. Proto-Basque or Aquitanian evolved with Latin loan words to modern Basque. The Thracian language, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia, are attested in Imperial-era inscriptions.

==Society==

The Empire was remarkably multicultural, with &quot;astonishing cohesive capacity&quot; to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples. Public monuments and communal spaces open to all—such as forums, amphitheatres, racetracks and baths—helped foster a sense of &quot;Romanness&quot;.

Roman society had multiple, overlapping social hierarchies. The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval, but did not effect an immediate redistribution of wealth and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes, a peak was merely added to the social pyramid. Personal relationships—patronage, friendship (&quot;amicitia&quot;), family, marriage—continued to influence politics. By the time of Nero, however, it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen, or an equestrian who exercised greater power than a senator.

The blurring of the Republic&#x27;s more rigid hierarchies led to increased social mobility, both upward and downward, to a greater extent than all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (&quot;collegia&quot; and &quot;sodalitates&quot;): professional and trade guilds, veterans&#x27; groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing troupes, and burial societies.

===Legal status===
According to the jurist Gaius, the essential distinction in the Roman &quot;law of persons&quot; was that all humans were either free (&quot;liberi&quot;) or slaves (&quot;servi&quot;). The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the &quot;ius Latinum&quot;, &quot;Latin right&quot;), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were &quot;peregrini&quot;, non-Romans. In 212, the &quot;Constitutio Antoniniana&quot; extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.

====Women in Roman law====


Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother&#x27;s citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase &quot;ex duobus civibus Romanis natos&quot; (&quot;children born of two Roman citizens&quot;). A Roman woman kept her own family name (&quot;nomen&quot;) for life. Children most often took the father&#x27;s name, with some exceptions. Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes.

The archaic &quot;manus&quot; marriage in which the woman was subject to her husband&#x27;s authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father&#x27;s legal authority, even though she moved into her husband&#x27;s home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated. This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period: although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life, and her husband had no legal power over her. Although it was a point of pride to be a &quot;one-man woman&quot; (&quot;univira&quot;) who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to divorce, nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced. Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will. A mother&#x27;s right to own and dispose of property, including setting the terms of her will, gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood.
As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, moral legislation attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting &quot;family values&quot;. Adultery was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act (&quot;stuprum&quot;) between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a double standard was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status. Childbearing was encouraged: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom (the &quot;ius trium liberorum&quot;).

====Slaves and the law====

At the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in Roman Italy were slaves, making Rome one of five historical &quot;slave societies&quot; in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy. Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility. In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour. Agriculture and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in Roman Egypt but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces. Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.
Laws pertaining to slavery were &quot;extremely intricate&quot;. Slaves were considered property and had no legal personhood. They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens, sexual exploitation, torture, and summary execution. A slave could not as a matter of law be raped; a slave&#x27;s rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the Aquilian Law. Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called &quot;conubium&quot;, but their unions were sometimes recognized. Technically, a slave could not own property, but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund (&quot;peculium&quot;) that he could use, depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave acting as the master of others. Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough &quot;peculium&quot; to justify their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (&quot;Lex Fufia Caninia&quot;) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.

Following the Servile Wars of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves. Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves. The burgeoning trade in eunuchs in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will &quot;for lust or gain&quot;.

Roman slavery was not based on race. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).

During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the conquest of Greece brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by pirates. Infant abandonment and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources. &quot;Vernae&quot;, by contrast, were &quot;homegrown&quot; slaves born to female slaves within the household, estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his &quot;vernae&quot; faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.

====Freedmen====

Rome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom (&quot;libertas&quot;), including the right to vote. His former master became his patron (&quot;patronus&quot;): the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a priestly role. He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. The rise of successful freedmen—through political influence or wealth—is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by inscriptions throughout the Empire.

===Census rank===

The Latin word &quot;ordo&quot; (plural &quot;ordines&quot;) is translated variously and inexactly into English as &quot;class, order, rank&quot;. One purpose of the Roman census was to determine the &quot;ordo&quot; to which an individual belonged. Two of the highest &quot;ordines&quot; in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, cities or colonies were led by decurions, also known as &quot;curiales.&quot;
&quot;Senator&quot; was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million &quot;sestertii&quot;. Not all men who qualified for the &quot;ordo senatorius&quot; chose to take a Senate seat, which required legal domicile at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment. A senator&#x27;s son belonged to the &quot;ordo senatorius&quot;, but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.

In the time of Nero, senators were still primarily from Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the easternmost province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (&quot;patria&quot;).

Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, the political career track, but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome&#x27;s early days, &quot;equites&quot; or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors, but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire. A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian. The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at Cádiz and Padua alone. Equestrians rose through a military career track (&quot;tres militiae&quot;) to become highly placed prefects and procurators within the Imperial administration.

The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher &quot;ordines&quot; brought distinction and privileges, but also responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (&quot;munera&quot;). Maintaining one&#x27;s rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.

In the later Empire, the &quot;dignitas&quot; (&quot;worth, esteem&quot;) that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as &quot;vir illustris&quot; (&quot;illustrious man&quot;). The appellation &quot;clarissimus&quot; (Greek &quot;lamprotatos&quot;) was used to designate the &quot;dignitas&quot; of certain senators and their immediate family, including women. &quot;Grades&quot; of equestrian status proliferated.

====Unequal justice====

As the republican principle of citizens&#x27; equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (&quot;honestiores&quot;) and humbler folk (&quot;humiliores&quot;). In general, &quot;honestiores&quot; were the members of the three higher &quot;orders&quot;, along with certain military officers. The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system. Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative &quot;worth&quot; (&quot;dignitas&quot;) of the defendant: an &quot;honestior&quot; could pay a fine for a crime for which an &quot;humilior&quot; might receive a scourging.

Execution, which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic, could be quick and relatively painless for &quot;honestiores&quot;, while &quot;humiliores&quot; might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves, such as crucifixion and condemnation to the beasts. In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as &quot;honestiores&quot;, especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of martyrdom.

==Government and military==

The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government. The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites. The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone. Cooperation with local elites was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions.

Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance. Roman government was thus limited, but efficient in its use of available resources.

===Central government===
The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified emperors and some members of their families with divinely sanctioned authority (&quot;auctoritas&quot;). The rite of apotheosis (also called &quot;consecratio&quot;) signified the deceased emperor&#x27;s deification. The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices. The emperor made himself the central religious authority as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the Principate, the emperor&#x27;s powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the Dominate.

The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate, he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor&#x27;s council (&quot;consilium&quot;) became subject to official appointment for greater transparency. Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the &quot;consilium&quot;. The women of the emperor&#x27;s family often intervened directly in his decisions.

Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception (&quot;salutatio&quot;), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at games. By the 4th century, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions. Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it retained its symbolic political centrality. The Senate legitimated the emperor&#x27;s rule, and the emperor employed senators as legates (&quot;legati&quot;): generals, diplomats, and administrators.

The practical source of an emperor&#x27;s power and authority was the military. The legionaries were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual oath of loyalty to the emperor. Most emperors chose a successor, usually a close family member or adopted heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the Praetorian Guard and the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the &quot;donativum&quot;, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.

===Military===


After the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by &quot;organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army&quot;. By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career. The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization.

The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana. The three major divisions of the military were:
* the garrison at Rome, comprising the Praetorian Guard, the &quot;cohortes urbanae&quot; and the &quot;vigiles&quot;, who functioned as police and firefighters;
* the provincial army, comprising the Roman legions and the auxiliaries provided by the provinces (&quot;auxilia&quot;);
* the navy.
Through his military reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus regularized the legion. A legion was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (&quot;contubernia&quot;); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which was likely determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280. After Germanic tribes wiped out three legions in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, the number of legions was increased from 25 to around 30. The army had about 300,000 soldiers in the 1st century, and under 400,000 in the 2nd, &quot;significantly smaller&quot; than the collective armed forces of the conquered territories. No more than 2% of adult males living in the Empire served in the Imperial army. Augustus also created the Praetorian Guard: nine cohorts, ostensibly to maintain the public peace, which were garrisoned in Italy. Better paid than the legionaries, the Praetorians served only sixteen years.

The &quot;auxilia&quot; were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship, also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries—thus, around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments. The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.

The Roman navy not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean, parts of the North Atlantic coasts, and the Black Sea. Nevertheless, the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch.

===Provincial government===

An annexed territory became a Roman province in three steps: making a register of cities, taking a census, and surveying the land. Further government recordkeeping included births and deaths, real estate transactions, taxes, and juridical proceedings. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the central government sent out around 160 officials annually to govern outside Italy. Among these officials were the Roman governors: magistrates elected at Rome who in the name of the Roman people governed senatorial provinces; or governors, usually of equestrian rank, who held their &quot;imperium&quot; on behalf of the emperor in imperial provinces, most notably Roman Egypt. A governor had to make himself accessible to the people he governed, but he could delegate various duties. His staff, however, was minimal: his official attendants (&quot;apparitores&quot;), including lictors, heralds, messengers, scribes, and bodyguards; legates, both civil and military, usually of equestrian rank; and friends who accompanied him unofficially.

Other officials were appointed as supervisors of government finances. Separating fiscal responsibility from justice and administration was a reform of the Imperial era, to avoid provincial governors and tax farmers exploiting local populations for personal gain. Equestrian procurators, whose authority was originally &quot;extra-judicial and extra-constitutional&quot;, managed both state-owned property and the personal property of the emperor (&quot;res privata&quot;). Because Roman government officials were few, a provincial who needed help with a legal dispute or criminal case might seek out any Roman perceived to have some official capacity.

In the High Empire, Italy was legally distinguished from the provinces, and along with some favored provincial communities, enjoyed immunity from the property tax and poll tax. However, under the Emperor Diocletian, Italy lost these privileges and was subdivided into provinces.

===Law===
Roman courts held original jurisdiction over cases involving Roman citizens throughout the empire, but there were too few judicial functionaries to impose Roman law uniformly in the provinces. Most parts of the Eastern Empire already had well-established law codes and juridical procedures. Generally, it was Roman policy to respect the &quot;mos regionis&quot; (&quot;regional tradition&quot; or &quot;law of the land&quot;) and to regard local laws as a source of legal precedent and social stability. The compatibility of Roman and local law was thought to reflect an underlying &quot;ius gentium&quot;, the &quot;law of nations&quot; or international law regarded as common and customary. If provincial law conflicted with Roman law or custom, Roman courts heard appeals, and the emperor held final decision-making authority.

In the West, law had been administered on a highly localized or tribal basis, and private property rights may have been a novelty of the Roman era, particularly among Celts. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite. The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian&#x27;s efforts to stabilize the Empire after the Crisis of the Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years, the &quot;Codex Gregorianus&quot; and the &quot;Codex Hermogenianus&quot;, to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.

The pervasiveness of Roman law throughout Western Europe enormously influenced the Western legal tradition, reflected by continued use of Latin legal terminology in modern law.

===Taxation===

Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product. The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%. The tax code was &quot;bewildering&quot; in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries; they might be temporary. Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military, and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty. In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.

The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Tax obligations were determined by the census: each head of household provided a headcount of his household, as well as an accounting of his property. A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the &quot;portoria&quot;, customs and tolls on trade, including among provinces. Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves, which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices. An owner who manumitted a slave paid a &quot;freedom tax&quot;, calculated at 5% of value. An inheritance tax of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone outside their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from an auction tax went towards the veterans&#x27; pension fund (&quot;aerarium militare&quot;).

Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the &quot;super-rich&quot;, but in the later period, the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.

==Economy==

The Empire is best thought of as a network of regional economies, based on a form of &quot;political capitalism&quot; in which the state regulated commerce to assure its own revenues. Economic growth, though not comparable to modern economies, was greater than that of most other societies prior to industrialization. Territorial conquests permitted a large-scale reorganization of land use that resulted in agricultural surplus and specialization, particularly in north Africa. Some cities were known for particular industries. The scale of urban building indicates a significant construction industry. Papyri preserve complex accounting methods that suggest elements of economic rationalism, and the Empire was highly monetized. Although the means of communication and transport were limited in antiquity, transportation in the 1st and 2nd centuries expanded greatly, and trade routes connected regional economies. The supply contracts for the army drew on local suppliers near the base (&quot;castrum&quot;), throughout the province, and across provincial borders.
Economic historians vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product during the Principate. In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 &quot;HS&quot;. The GDP per capita of Italy is estimated as 40 to 66% higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income.

Economic dynamism resulted in social mobility. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, wealth requirements for rank indicate a strong tendency towards plutocracy. Prestige could be obtained through investing one&#x27;s wealth in grand estates or townhouses, luxury items, public entertainments, funerary monuments, and religious dedications. Guilds (&quot;collegia&quot;) and corporations (&quot;corpora&quot;) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking. &quot;There can be little doubt that the lower classes of ... provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high standard of living not equaled again in Western Europe until the 19th century&quot;. Households in the top 1.5% of income distribution captured about 20% of income. The &quot;vast majority&quot; produced more than half of the total income, but lived near subsistence.

===Currency and banking===

The early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money as a way to express prices and debts. The &quot;sestertius&quot; (English &quot;sesterces&quot;, symbolized as &quot;HS&quot;) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century, though the silver &quot;denarius&quot;, worth four sesterces, was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty. The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze &quot;as&quot;, one-tenth &quot;denarius&quot;. Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as &quot;pecunia&quot; (&quot;money&quot;) and were used only on the frontiers. Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face. This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire. The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration. The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving.
Rome had no central bank, and regulation of the banking system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers&#x27; deposits. A typical bank had fairly limited capital, and often only one principal. Seneca assumes that anyone involved in Roman commerce needs access to credit. A professional deposit banker received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers. The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire permitted the exchange of large sums without physically transferring coins, in part because of the risks of moving large amounts of cash. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, in 33 AD; generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers. The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.

Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties debased the currency, particularly the &quot;denarius&quot;, under the pressures of meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation under Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins. Despite Diocletian&#x27;s introduction of the gold &quot;solidus&quot; and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.

===Mining and metallurgy===
The main mining regions of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (silver, copper, lead, iron and gold); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production.

Hydraulic mining allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500 tonnes. Copper and lead production levels were unmatched until the Industrial Revolution. At its peak around the mid-2nd century, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000 t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800 AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over prehistoric levels during the Imperial era and dropped thereafter.

===Transportation and communication===
The Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called &quot;our sea&quot; (&quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;). Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as major rivers. Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult. Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.

Land transport utilized the advanced system of Roman roads, called &quot;viae&quot;. These roads were primarily built for military purposes, but also served commercial ends. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the &quot;cursus publicus&quot;, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into villages or trading posts. A &quot;mansio&quot; (plural &quot;mansiones&quot;) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the &quot;cursus publicus&quot;. The distance between &quot;mansiones&quot; was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Carts were usually pulled by mules, travelling about 4 mph.

===Trade and commodities===
Roman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions as far away as China and India. Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the Silk Road; Indian trade also occurred by sea from Egyptian ports. The main commodity was grain. Also traded were olive oil, foodstuffs, &quot;garum&quot; (fish sauce), slaves, ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, pottery, glassware, marble, papyrus, spices and &quot;materia medica&quot;, ivory, pearls, and gemstones. Though most provinces could produce wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central trade good.

===Labour and occupations===

Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in Rome and 85 in Pompeii. Professional associations or trade guilds (&quot;collegia&quot;) are attested for a wide range of occupations, some quite specialized.

Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; imperial or public service; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining. Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free, and most workers were illiterate and without special skills. The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in Italian industrial farming (&quot;latifundia&quot;), these may have been mostly slaves, but elsewhere slave farm labour was probably less important.

Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded and products were often named for peoples or towns, like a fashion &quot;label&quot;. Better ready-to-wear was exported by local businessmen (&quot;negotiatores&quot; or &quot;mercatores&quot;). Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, by &quot;vestiarii&quot; (clothing dealers), or peddled by itinerant merchants. The fullers (&quot;fullones&quot;) and dye workers (&quot;coloratores&quot;) had their own guilds. &quot;Centonarii&quot; were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into pieced goods.

==Architecture and engineering==
The chief Roman contributions to architecture were the arch, vault, and dome. Some Roman structures still stand today, due in part to sophisticated methods of making cements and concrete. Roman temples developed Etruscan and Greek forms, with some distinctive elements. Roman roads are considered the most advanced built until the early 19th century.

Roman bridges were among the first large and lasting bridges, built from stone (and in most cases concrete) with the arch as the basic structure. The largest Roman bridge was Trajan&#x27;s bridge over the lower Danube, constructed by Apollodorus of Damascus, which remained for over a millennium the longest bridge to have been built. The Romans built many dams and reservoirs for water collection, such as the Subiaco Dams, two of which fed the Anio Novus, one of the largest aqueducts of Rome.
The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts. &quot;De aquaeductu&quot;, a treatise by Frontinus, who served as water commissioner, reflects the administrative importance placed on the water supply. Masonry channels carried water along a precise gradient, using gravity alone. It was then collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths, toilets, or industrial sites. The main aqueducts in Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia. The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a route of more than 336 km. Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance, and to a technological standard not equalled until modern times. The Romans also used aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire.

Insulated glazing (or &quot;double glazing&quot;) was used in the construction of public baths. Elite housing in cooler climates might have hypocausts, a form of central heating. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later steam engine: the crank and connecting rod system, Hero&#x27;s aeolipile (generating steam power), the cylinder and piston (in metal force pumps), non-return valves (in water pumps), and gearing (in water mills and clocks).

==Daily life==

===City and country===
The city was viewed as fostering civilization by being &quot;properly designed, ordered, and adorned&quot;. Augustus undertook a vast building programme in Rome, supported public displays of art that expressed imperial ideology, and reorganized the city into neighbourhoods &quot;(vici)&quot; administered at the local level with police and firefighting services. A focus of Augustan monumental architecture was the Campus Martius, an open area outside the city centre: the Altar of Augustan Peace () was located there, as was an obelisk imported from Egypt that formed the pointer (&quot;gnomon&quot;) of a horologium. With its public gardens, the Campus was among the most attractive places in Rome to visit.

City planning and urban lifestyles was influenced by the Greeks early on, and in the Eastern Empire, Roman rule shaped the development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa tailored city planning and architecture to imperial ideals, while expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In areas inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of preexisting walled settlements known as &quot;oppida&quot;. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic coastal cities.
The network of cities (, &quot;municipia&quot;, &quot;civitates&quot; or in Greek terms &quot;poleis&quot;) was a primary cohesive force during the Pax Romana. Romans of the 1st and 2nd centuries were encouraged to &quot;inculcate the habits of peacetime&quot;. As the classicist Clifford Ando noted:


In the city of Rome, most people lived in multistory apartment buildings (&quot;insulae&quot;) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (&quot;thermae&quot;), toilets with running water (&quot;latrinae&quot;), basins or elaborate fountains (&quot;nymphea&quot;) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common people. 

The public baths served hygienic, social and cultural functions. Bathing was the focus of daily socializing. Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with amenities that might include an exercise room, sauna, exfoliation spa, ball court, or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had hypocaust heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels. Public baths were part of urban culture throughout the provinces, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths only for hygiene.
Rich families from Rome usually had two or more houses: a townhouse (&quot;domus&quot;) and at least one luxury home (&quot;villa&quot;) outside the city. The &quot;domus&quot; was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (&quot;balneum&quot;), but it was not a place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods show a higher concentration of such houses, they were not segregated enclaves. The &quot;domus&quot; was meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; (head of household) met with clients every morning. It was a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces were often rented out as shops (&quot;tabernae&quot;). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the &quot;insulae&quot;—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden.

The villa by contrast was an escape from the city, and in literature represents a lifestyle that balances intellectual and artistic interests (&quot;otium&quot;) with an appreciation of nature and agriculture. Ideally a villa commanded a view or vista, carefully framed by the architectural design. 

Augustus&#x27; programme of urban renewal, and the growth of Rome&#x27;s population to as many as one million, was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds. Interior decorating often featured painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament, and animals, rendered accurately enough to be identified by species. On a more practical level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the priority of land use. Larger farms (&quot;latifundia&quot;) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another.
Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (Cura Annonae) to citizens who registered for it (about 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome). The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates. The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed the emperor&#x27;s position as universal benefactor, and the right of citizens to share in &quot;the fruits of conquest&quot;. The &quot;annona&quot;, public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist Juvenal, however, saw &quot;bread and circuses&quot; (&quot;panem et circenses&quot;) as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:

===Health and disease===

Epidemics were common in the ancient world, and occasional pandemics in the Empire killed millions. The Roman population was unhealthy. About 20 percent—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in cities, Rome being the largest. The cities were a &quot;demographic sink&quot;: the death rate exceeded the birth rate and constant immigration was necessary to maintain the population. Average lifespan is estimated at the mid-twenties, and perhaps more than half of children died before reaching adulthood. Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to disease. Land and sea connections facilitated and sped the transfer of infectious diseases across the empire&#x27;s territories. The rich were not immune; only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.

The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen (2nd century). Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like humoral theory. A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height: the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of pre-Roman Italian societies and medieval Europe.

===Food and dining===

Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery. Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (&quot;tabernae&quot;, &quot;cauponae&quot;, &quot;popinae&quot;, &quot;thermopolia&quot;). Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes; fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (&quot;archimagirus&quot;) and kitchen staff, or banquets hosted by social clubs (&quot;collegia&quot;).

Most Romans consumed at least 70% of their daily calories in the form of cereals and legumes. &quot;Puls&quot; (pottage) was considered the food of the Romans, and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto. Urban populations and the military preferred bread. By the reign of Aurelian, the state had begun to distribute the &quot;annona&quot; as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added olive oil, wine, and pork to the dole.

Roman literature focuses on the dining habits of the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (&quot;cena&quot;) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (&quot;triclinium&quot;) furnished with couches. By the late Republic, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men. The poet Martial describes a dinner, beginning with the &quot;gustatio&quot; (&quot;tasting&quot; or &quot;appetizer&quot;) salad. The main course was kid, beans, greens, a chicken, and leftover ham, followed by a dessert of fruit and wine. Roman &quot;foodies&quot; indulged in wild game, fowl such as peacock and flamingo, large fish (mullet was especially prized), and shellfish. Luxury ingredients were imported from the far reaches of empire. A book-length collection of Roman recipes is attributed to Apicius, a name for several figures in antiquity that became synonymous with &quot;gourmet&quot;.

Refined cuisine could be moralized as a sign of either civilized progress or decadent decline. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—were considered more civilized foods than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism. Some philosophers and Christians resisted the demands of the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished and trade routes were disrupted; the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple and virtuous.

===Spectacles===
When Juvenal complained that the Roman people had exchanged their political liberty for &quot;bread and circuses&quot;, he was referring to the state-provided grain dole and the &quot;circenses&quot;, events held in the entertainment venue called a &quot;circus&quot;. The largest such venue in Rome was the Circus Maximus, the setting of horse races, chariot races, the equestrian Troy Game, staged beast hunts (&quot;venationes&quot;), athletic contests, gladiator combat, and historical re-enactments. From earliest times, several religious festivals had featured games (&quot;ludi&quot;), primarily horse and chariot races (&quot;ludi circenses&quot;). The races retained religious significance in connection with agriculture, initiation, and the cycle of birth and death.

Under Augustus, public entertainments were presented on 77 days of the year; by the reign of Marcus Aurelius, this had expanded to 135. Circus games were preceded by an elaborate parade (&quot;pompa circensis&quot;) that ended at the venue. Competitive events were held also in smaller venues such as the amphitheatre, which became the characteristic Roman spectacle venue, and stadium. Greek-style athletics included footraces, boxing, wrestling, and the pancratium. Aquatic displays, such as the mock sea battle (&quot;naumachia&quot;) and a form of &quot;water ballet&quot;, were presented in engineered pools. State-supported theatrical events (&quot;ludi scaenici&quot;) took place on temple steps or in grand stone theatres, or in the smaller enclosed theatre called an &quot;odeon&quot;.

Circuses were the largest structure regularly built in the Roman world. The Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome. Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are visible as ruins today. The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources. The physical arrangement of the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor in his opulent box; senators and equestrians in reserved advantageous seats; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites of social and political protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in 532.
The chariot teams were known by the colours they wore. Fan loyalty was fierce and at times erupted into sports riots. Racing was perilous, but charioteers were among the most celebrated and well-compensated athletes. Circuses were designed to ensure that no team had an unfair advantage and to minimize collisions (&quot;naufragia&quot;), which were nonetheless frequent and satisfying to the crowd. The races retained a magical aura through their early association with chthonic rituals: circus images were considered protective or lucky, curse tablets have been found buried at the site of racetracks, and charioteers were often suspected of sorcery. Chariot racing continued into the Byzantine period under imperial sponsorship, but the decline of cities in the 6th and 7th centuries led to its eventual demise.

The Romans thought gladiator contests had originated with funeral games and sacrifices. Some of the earliest styles of gladiator fighting had ethnic designations such as &quot;Thracian&quot; or &quot;Gallic&quot;. The staged combats were considered , &quot;services, offerings, benefactions&quot;, initially distinct from the festival games (&quot;ludi&quot;). To mark the opening of the Colosseum, Titus presented 100 days of arena events, with 3,000 gladiators competing on a single day. Roman fascination with gladiators is indicated by how widely they are depicted on mosaics, wall paintings, lamps, and in graffiti. Gladiators were trained combatants who might be slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a necessary or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training was costly and time-consuming. By contrast, &quot;noxii&quot; were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or no training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival; physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects.

Modern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the &quot;theatre of life and death&quot; difficult to understand. Pliny the Younger rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, &quot;to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory&quot;. Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles, but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter—an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice. Even martyr literature, however, offers &quot;detailed, indeed luxuriant, descriptions of bodily suffering&quot;, and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction.

===Recreation===
The singular &quot;ludus&quot;, &quot;play, game, sport, training&quot;, had a wide range of meanings such as &quot;word play&quot;, &quot;theatrical performance&quot;, &quot;board game&quot;, &quot;primary school&quot;, and even &quot;gladiator training school&quot; (as in &quot;Ludus Magnus&quot;). Activities for children and young people in the Empire included hoop rolling and knucklebones (&quot;astragali&quot; or &quot;jacks&quot;). Girls had dolls made of wood, terracotta, and especially bone and ivory. Ball games include trigon and harpastum. People of all ages played board games, including &quot;latrunculi&quot; (&quot;Raiders&quot;) and &quot;XII scripta&quot; (&quot;Twelve Marks&quot;). A game referred to as &quot;alea&quot; (dice) or &quot;tabula&quot; (the board) may have been similar to backgammon. Dicing as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the festival of the Saturnalia.

After adolescence, most physical training for males was of a military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men learned horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero&#x27;s efforts to encourage Greek-style athletic games. Some women trained as gymnasts and dancers, and a rare few as female gladiators. The &quot;Bikini Girls&quot; mosaic shows young women engaging in routines comparable to rhythmic gymnastics. Women were encouraged to maintain health through activities such as playing ball, swimming, walking, or reading aloud (as a breathing exercise).

===Clothing===

In a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order. There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare.

The toga was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites. It was a &quot;vast expanse&quot; of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance. The drapery became more intricate and structured over time. The &quot;toga praetexta&quot;, with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (&quot;toga picta&quot;).

Ordinary clothing was dark or colourful. The basic garment for all Romans, regardless of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic, with length differing by wearer. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades; finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man of the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (&quot;clavi&quot;) woven vertically: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer&#x27;s status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic. Common male attire also included cloaks, and in some regions, trousers. In the 2nd century, emperors and elite men are often portrayed wearing the pallium, an originally Greek mantle; women are also portrayed in the pallium. Tertullian considered the pallium an appropriate garment both for Christians, in contrast to the toga, and for educated people.

Roman clothing styles changed over time. In the Dominate, clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures. Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of urban life, affected fashion: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and the toga was abandoned, replaced by the pallium as a garment embodying social unity.

==Arts==

Greek art had a profound influence on Roman art. Public art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for historical or ideological significance. In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce. The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes. Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands.

===Portraiture===
Portraiture, which survives mainly in sculpture, was the most copious form of imperial art. Portraits during the Augustan period utilize classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and idealism. Republican portraits were characterized by verism, but as early as the 2nd century BC, Greek heroic nudity was adopted for conquering generals. Imperial portrait sculptures may model a mature head atop a youthful nude or semi-nude body with perfect musculature. Clothed in the toga or military regalia, the body communicates rank or role, not individual characteristics. 

Portraiture in painting is represented primarily by the Fayum mummy portraits, which evoke Egyptian and Roman traditions of commemorating the dead with realistic painting. Marble portrait sculpture were painted, but traces have rarely survived.

===Sculpture and sarcophagi===

Examples of Roman sculpture survive abundantly, though often in damaged or fragmentary condition, including freestanding statuary in marble, bronze and terracotta, and reliefs from public buildings and monuments. Niches in amphitheatres were originally filled with statues, as were formal gardens. Temples housed cult images of deities, often by famed sculptors.

Elaborately carved marble and limestone sarcophagi are characteristic of the 2nd to 4th centuries. Sarcophagus relief has been called the &quot;richest single source of Roman iconography&quot;, depicting mythological scenes or Jewish/Christian imagery as well as the deceased&#x27;s life.
===Painting===

Initial Roman painting drew from Etruscan and Greek models and techniques. Examples of Roman paintings can be found in palaces, catacombs and villas. Much of what is known of Roman painting is from the interior decoration of private homes, particularly as preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius. In addition to decorative borders and panels with geometric or vegetative motifs, wall painting depicts scenes from mythology and theatre, landscapes and gardens, spectacles, everyday life, and erotic art.

===Mosaic===
Mosaics are among the most enduring of Roman decorative arts, and are found on floors and other architectural features. The most common is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces &quot;(tesserae)&quot; of materials such as stone and glass. &quot;Opus sectile&quot; is a related technique in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century (e.g. the Basilica of Junius Bassus).

Figurative mosaics share many themes with painting, and in some cases use almost identical compositions. Geometric patterns and mythological scenes occur throughout the Empire. In North Africa, a particularly rich source of mosaics, homeowners often chose scenes of life on their estates, hunting, agriculture, and local wildlife. Plentiful and major examples of Roman mosaics come also from present-day Turkey (particularly the (Antioch mosaics), Italy, southern France, Spain, and Portugal.

===Decorative arts===

Decorative arts for luxury consumers included fine pottery, silver and bronze vessels and implements, and glassware. Pottery manufacturing was economically important, as were the glass and metalworking industries. Imports stimulated new regional centres of production. Southern Gaul became a leading producer of the finer red-gloss pottery (&quot;terra sigillata&quot;) that was a major trade good in 1st-century Europe. Glassblowing was regarded by the Romans as originating in Syria in the 1st century BC, and by the 3rd century, Egypt and the Rhineland had become noted for fine glass.
===Performing arts===
In Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion. Female roles were played by men in drag (&quot;travesti&quot;). Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca, for example.

More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying &quot;mimus&quot; theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqué language and sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and dancing bears. Unlike literary theatre, &quot;mimus&quot; was played without masks, and encouraged stylistic realism. Female roles were performed by women. &quot;Mimus&quot; was related to &quot;pantomimus&quot;, an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung libretto, often mythological, either tragic or comic.
Although sometimes regarded as foreign, music and dance existed in Rome from earliest times. Music was customary at funerals, and the &quot;tibia&quot;, a woodwind instrument, was played at sacrifices. Song &quot;(carmen)&quot; was integral to almost every social occasion. Music was thought to reflect the orderliness of the cosmos. Various woodwinds and &quot;brass&quot; instruments were played, as were stringed instruments such as the &quot;cithara&quot;, and percussion. The &quot;cornu&quot;, a long tubular metal wind instrument, was used for military signals and on parade. These instruments spread throughout the provinces and are widely depicted in Roman art. The hydraulic pipe organ &quot;(hydraulis)&quot; was &quot;one of the most significant technical and musical achievements of antiquity&quot;, and accompanied gladiator games and events in the amphitheatre. Although certain dances were seen at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was embedded in religious rituals of archaic Rome. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the mystery religions, particularly the cults of Cybele and Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.

Like gladiators, entertainers were legally &quot;infames&quot;, technically free but little better than slaves. &quot;Stars&quot;, however, could enjoy considerable wealth and celebrity, and mingled socially and often sexually with the elite. Performers supported each other by forming guilds, and several memorials for theatre members survive. Theatre and dance were often condemned by Christian polemicists in the later Empire.

==Literacy, books, and education==
Estimates of the average literacy rate range from 5 to over 30%. The Roman obsession with documents and inscriptions indicates the value placed on the written word. Laws and edicts were posted as well as read out. Illiterate Roman subjects could have a government scribe (&quot;scriba&quot;) read or write their official documents for them. The military produced extensive written records. The Babylonian Talmud declared &quot;if all seas were ink, all reeds were pen, all skies parchment, and all men scribes, they would be unable to set down the full scope of the Roman government&#x27;s concerns&quot;.

Numeracy was necessary for commerce. Slaves were numerate and literate in significant numbers; some were highly educated. Graffiti and low-quality inscriptions with misspellings and solecisms indicate casual literacy among non-elites.

The Romans had an extensive priestly archive, and inscriptions appear throughout the Empire in connection with votives dedicated by ordinary people, as well as &quot;magic spells&quot; (e.g. the Greek Magical Papyri).

Books were expensive, since each copy had to be written out on a papyrus roll (&quot;volumen&quot;) by scribes. The codex—pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty in the 1st century, but by the end of the 3rd century was replacing the &quot;volumen&quot;. Commercial book production was established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century certain neighbourhoods of Rome and Western provincial cities were known for their bookshops. The quality of editing varied wildly, and plagiarism or forgery were common, since there was no copyright law.

Collectors amassed personal libraries, and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure (&quot;otium&quot;) associated with the villa lifestyle. Significant collections might attract &quot;in-house&quot; scholars, and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library (as Pliny the Younger did in Comum). Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis, and represented a literary canon. Books considered subversive might be publicly burned, and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.

Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups. Public readings (&quot;recitationes&quot;) expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, giving rise to &quot;consumer literature&quot; for entertainment. Illustrated books, including erotica, were popular, but are poorly represented by extant fragments.

Literacy began to decline during the Crisis of the Third Century. The emperor Julian banned Christians from teaching the classical curriculum, but the Church Fathers and other Christians adopted Latin and Greek literature, philosophy and science in biblical interpretation. As the Western Roman Empire declined, reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy, although it continued in the Byzantine Empire.

===Education===
Traditional Roman education was moral and practical. Stories were meant to instil Roman values (&quot;mores maiorum&quot;). Parents were expected to act as role models, and working parents passed their skills to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships. Young children were attended by a pedagogue, usually a Greek slave or former slave, who kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring.

Formal education was available only to families who could pay for it; lack of state support contributed to low literacy. Primary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic might take place at home if parents hired or bought a teacher. Other children attended &quot;public&quot; schools organized by a schoolmaster (&quot;ludimagister&quot;) paid by parents. &quot;Vernae&quot; (homeborn slave children) might share in-home or public schooling. Boys and girls received primary education generally from ages 7 to 12, but classes were not segregated by grade or age. Most schools employed corporal punishment. For the socially ambitious, education in Greek as well as Latin was necessary. Schools became more numerous during the Empire, increasing educational opportunities.
At the age of 14, upperclass males made their rite of passage into adulthood, and began to learn leadership roles through mentoring from a senior family member or family friend. Higher education was provided by &quot;grammatici&quot; or &quot;rhetores&quot;. The &quot;grammaticus&quot; or &quot;grammarian&quot; taught mainly Greek and Latin literature, with history, geography, philosophy or mathematics treated as explications of the text. With the rise of Augustus, contemporary Latin authors such as Virgil and Livy also became part of the curriculum. The &quot;rhetor&quot; was a teacher of oratory or public speaking. The art of speaking (&quot;ars dicendi&quot;) was highly prized, and &quot;eloquentia&quot; (&quot;speaking ability, eloquence&quot;) was considered the &quot;glue&quot; of civilized society. Rhetoric was not so much a body of knowledge (though it required a command of the literary canon) as it was a mode of expression that distinguished those who held social power. The ancient model of rhetorical training—&quot;restraint, coolness under pressure, modesty, and good humour&quot;—endured into the 18th century as a Western educational ideal.

In Latin, &quot;illiteratus&quot; could mean both &quot;unable to read and write&quot; and &quot;lacking in cultural awareness or sophistication&quot;. Higher education promoted career advancement. Urban elites throughout the Empire shared a literary culture imbued with Greek educational ideals (&quot;paideia&quot;). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools of higher learning to express cultural achievement. Young Roman men often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave secondary teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties. In the Eastern Empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and esthetic values.

Literate women ranged from cultured aristocrats to girls trained to be calligraphers and scribes. The ideal woman in Augustan love poetry was educated and well-versed in the arts. Education seems to have been standard for daughters of the senatorial and equestrian orders. An educated wife was an asset for the socially ambitious household.

=== Literature ===

Literature under Augustus, along with that of the Republic, has been viewed as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Latin literature, embodying classical ideals. The three most influential Classical Latin poets—Virgil, Horace, and Ovid—belong to this period. Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; was a national epic in the manner of the Homeric epics of Greece. Horace perfected the use of Greek lyric metres in Latin verse. Ovid&#x27;s erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of Augustan morality, contributing to his exile. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; wove together Greco-Roman mythology; his versions of Greek myths became a primary source of later classical mythology, and his work was hugely influential on medieval literature. The early Principate produced satirists such as Persius and Juvenal.

The mid-1st through mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of Latin literature. The three leading writers—Seneca, Lucan, and Petronius—committed suicide after incurring Nero&#x27;s displeasure. Epigrammatist and social observer Martial and the epic poet Statius, whose poetry collection &quot;Silvae&quot; influenced Renaissance literature, wrote during the reign of Domitian. Other authors of the Silver Age included Pliny the Elder, author of the encyclopedic &quot;Natural History&quot;; his nephew, Pliny the Younger; and the historian Tacitus.

The principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the historian Livy, whose account of Rome&#x27;s founding became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot; by Suetonius is a primary source for imperial biography. Among Imperial historians who wrote in Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Josephus, and Cassius Dio. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer Plutarch, the geographer Strabo, and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian.

From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, Christian authors were in active dialogue with the classical tradition. Tertullian was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. In the late 4th century, Jerome produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the Vulgate. Around that same time, Augustine wrote &quot;The City of God against the Pagans&quot;, considered &quot;a masterpiece of Western culture&quot;.

In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality. A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; of Macrobius and &quot;The Marriage of Philology and Mercury&quot; of Martianus Capella. Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius, Prudentius, Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.

==Religion==


The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success to their collective piety (&quot;pietas&quot;) and good relations with the gods (&quot;pax deorum&quot;). The archaic religion believed to have come from the earliest kings of Rome was the foundation of the &quot;mos maiorum&quot;, &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot;, central to Roman identity.

Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of &quot;do ut des&quot;, &quot;I give that you might give&quot;. Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and libations to the family&#x27;s domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances; as many as 135 days were devoted to religious festivals and games (&quot;ludi&quot;).

In the wake of the Republic&#x27;s collapse, state religion adapted to support the new regime. Augustus justified one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. Public vows now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called &quot;emperor worship&quot; expanded on a grand scale the traditional veneration of the ancestral dead and of the &quot;Genius&quot;, the divine tutelary of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (&quot;divus&quot;) by vote of the Senate. The Roman imperial cult, influenced by Hellenistic ruler cult, became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as Najran, in present-day Saudi Arabia. Rejection of the state religion became tantamount to treason.

The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories, their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them, building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous syncretic or reinterpreted gods were cultivated, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue.

Mystery religions, which offered initiates salvation in the afterlife, were a matter of personal choice, practiced in addition to one&#x27;s family rites and public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, which conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;magic&quot;, conspiracy (&quot;coniuratio&quot;), and subversive activity. Thus, sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists. In Gaul, the power of the druids was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. However, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted within the context of Imperial theology, and a new Gallo-Roman religion coalesced; its capital at the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity. The monotheistic rigour of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and granting of special exemptions. Tertullian noted that Judaism, unlike Christianity, was considered a &quot;religio licita&quot;, &quot;legitimate religion&quot;. The Jewish–Roman wars resulted from political as well as religious conflicts; the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD led to the sacking of the Second Temple and the dispersal of Jewish political power (see Jewish diaspora).
Christianity emerged in Roman Judaea as a Jewish religious sect in the 1st century and gradually spread out of Jerusalem throughout the Empire and beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians. A major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia, describes his persecution and executions of Christians. The Decian persecution of 246–251 seriously threatened the Christian Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook the most severe persecution of Christians, from 303 to 311.

From the 2nd century onward, the Church Fathers condemned the diverse religions practiced throughout the Empire as &quot;pagan&quot;. In the early 4th century, Constantine I became the first emperor to convert to Christianity. He supported the Church financially and made laws that favored it, but the new religion was already successful, having moved from less than 50,000 to over a million adherents between 150 and 250. Constantine and his successors banned public sacrifice while tolerating other traditional practices. Constantine never engaged in a purge, there were no &quot;pagan martyrs&quot; during his reign, and people who had not converted to Christianity remained in important positions at court. Julian attempted to revive traditional public sacrifice and Hellenistic religion, but met Christian resistance and lack of popular support.
Christians of the 4th century believed the conversion of Constantine showed that Christianity had triumphed over paganism (in Heaven) and little further action besides such rhetoric was necessary. Thus, their focus shifted towards heresy. According to Peter Brown, &quot;In most areas, polytheists were not molested, and apart from a few ugly incidents of local violence, Jewish communities also enjoyed a century of stable, even privileged, existence&quot;. There were anti-pagan laws, but they were not generally enforced; through the 6th century, centers of paganism existed in Athens, Gaza, Alexandria, and elsewhere.

According to recent Jewish scholarship, toleration of the Jews was maintained under Christian emperors. This did not extend to heretics: Theodosius I made multiple laws and acted against alternate forms of Christianity, and heretics were persecuted and killed by both the government and the church throughout Late Antiquity. Non-Christians were not persecuted until the 6th century. Rome&#x27;s original religious hierarchy and ritual influenced Christian forms, and many pre-Christian practices survived in Christian festivals and local traditions.

==Legacy==

Several states claimed to be the Roman Empire&#x27;s successor. The Holy Roman Empire was established in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor. The Russian Tsardom, as inheritor of the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s Orthodox Christian tradition, counted itself the Third Rome (Constantinople having been the second), in accordance with the concept of translatio imperii. The last Eastern Roman titular, Andreas Palaiologos, sold the title of Emperor of Constantinople to Charles VIII of France; upon Charles&#x27; death, Palaiologos reclaimed the title and on his death granted it to Ferdinand and Isabella and their successors, who never used it. When the Ottomans, who based their state on the Byzantine model, took Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II established his capital there and claimed to sit on the throne of the Roman Empire. He even launched an invasion of Otranto with the purpose of re-uniting the Empire, which was aborted by his death. In the medieval West, &quot;Roman&quot; came to mean the church and the Catholic Pope. The Greek form Romaioi remained attached to the Greek-speaking Christian population of the Byzantine Empire and is still used by Greeks.

The Roman Empire&#x27;s control of the Italian Peninsula influenced Italian nationalism and the unification of Italy (&quot;Risorgimento&quot;) in 1861. 

In the United States, the founders were educated in the classical tradition, and used classical models for landmarks in Washington, D.C.. The founders saw Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism as models for the mixed constitution, but regarded the emperor as a figure of tyranny.

<doc id="25508" wikidata="Q1773" url="?curid=25508" title="Riga">
<text>Riga ( ) is the capital, the primate, and the largest city of Latvia. Home to 605,273 inhabitants, the city accounts for a third of Latvia&#x27;s total population. The population of Riga metropolitan area, which stretches beyond the city limits, is estimated at 860,142 (as of 2023). The city lies on the Gulf of Riga at the mouth of the Daugava river where it meets the Baltic Sea. Riga&#x27;s territory covers and lies above sea level on a flat and sandy plain.

Riga was founded in 1201, and is a former Hanseatic League member. Riga&#x27;s historical centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, noted for its Art Nouveau/Jugendstil architecture and 19th century wooden architecture. Riga was the European Capital of Culture in 2014, along with Umeå in Sweden. Riga hosted the 2006 NATO Summit, the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, the 2013 World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship, and the IIHF Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships in 2006, 2021, and 2023. It is home to the European Union&#x27;s office of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). In 2017, it was named as the European Region of Gastronomy.

In 2019, Riga received over 1.4 million foreign visitors. The city is served by Riga International Airport, the largest and busiest airport in the Baltic States. Riga is a member of Eurocities, the Union of the Baltic Cities (UBC), and Union of Capitals of the European Union (UCEU).

== Etymology ==
The precise origin of the name is unknown; however, there are numerous and speculative theories for the origin of the name &quot;Riga&quot;:

* It is an adapted word, borrowing from the Livonian meaning loop, which refers to the ancient natural harbor formed by the tributary loop of the Daugava River.
* It could be derived from Riege, the German name for the River Rīdzene, a former tributary of the Daugava.
* Bishop Albert claimed credit from his campaign to conquer and convert the local populace, as coming from the Latin (&quot;irrigated&quot;), symbolising an &quot;irrigation of dry pagan souls by Christianity&quot;.

However, the most reliably documented explanation is the affirmation by German historian Dionysius Fabricius (1610) that Riga&#x27;s name comes from its already established role in trade: &quot;Riga obtained its name from the buildings or warehouses found in great number along the banks of the Duna, which the Livs in their own language are accustomed to call Riae&quot;. The &quot;j&quot; in Latvian hardened to a &quot;g&quot; in German. English geographer Richard Hakluyt (1589) corroborates this account, calling Riga as &quot;Rie&quot;, as pronounced in Old Latvian. This is further supported by the fact that Riga is called &quot;Riia&quot; in Estonian (a language closely related to Livonian).

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The river Daugava has been a trade route since antiquity, part of the Vikings&#x27; Dvina–Dnieper navigation route to Byzantium. A sheltered natural harbor upriver from the mouth of the Daugava—the site of today&#x27;s Riga—has been recorded, as &quot;Duna Urbs&quot;, as early as the 2nd century. It was settled by the Livs, a Finnic tribe.
Riga began to develop as a centre of Viking trade during the early Middle Ages. Riga&#x27;s inhabitants engaged mainly in fishing, animal husbandry, and trading, later developing crafts, including bone, wood, amber, and iron.

The &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; testifies to Riga having long been a trading centre by the 12th century, referring to it as (ancient port), and describes dwellings and warehouses used to store mostly flax, and hides. German traders began visiting Riga, establishing a nearby outpost in 1158.

Along with German traders the monk Meinhard of Segeberg arrived to convert the Livonian pagans to Christianity. Catholic and Orthodox Christianity had already arrived in Latvia more than a century earlier, and many Latvians had been baptized. Meinhard settled among the Livs, building a castle and church at Uexküll (now known as Ikšķile), upstream from Riga, and established his bishopric there. The Livs, however, continued to practice paganism and Meinhard died in Uexküll in 1196, having failed in his mission. In 1198, the Bishop Berthold arrived with a contingent of crusaders and commenced a campaign of forced Christianization. Berthold died soon afterwards and his forces were defeated.

The Church mobilized to avenge this defeat. Pope Innocent III issued a bull declaring a crusade against the Livonians. Bishop Albert was proclaimed Bishop of Livonia by his uncle Hartwig of Uthlede, Prince-Archbishop of Bremen and Hamburg in 1199. Albert landed in Riga in 1200 with 23 ships and 500 Westphalian crusaders. In 1201, he transferred the seat of the Livonian bishopric from Uexküll to Riga, extorting agreement to do this from the elders of Riga by force.

=== Under Bishop Albert ===

The year 1201 also marked the first arrival of German merchants in Novgorod, via the Dvina. To defend territory and trade, Albert established the Order of Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1202, which was open to nobles and merchants.

The Christianisation of the Livs continued. In 1207, Albert started to fortify the town. King Philip invested Albert with Livonia as a fief and principality of the Holy Roman Empire. To promote a permanent military presence, territorial ownership was divided between the Church and the &quot;Order&quot;, with the Church taking Riga and two-thirds of all lands conquered and granting the &quot;Order&quot; a third. Until then, it had been customary for crusaders to serve for a year and then return home.

Albert had ensured Riga&#x27;s commercial future by obtaining papal bulls which decreed that all German merchants had to carry on their Baltic trade through Riga. In 1211, Riga minted its first coinage, and Albert laid the cornerstone for the Riga Dom. Riga was not yet secure as an alliance of tribes failed to take Riga. In 1212, Albert led a campaign to compel Polotsk to grant German merchants free river passage. Polotsk conceded Kukenois (Koknese) and Jersika to Albert, also ending the Livs&#x27; tribute to Polotsk.

Riga&#x27;s merchant citizenry chafed and sought greater autonomy from the Church. In 1221, they acquired the right to independently self-administer Riga and adopted a city constitution.

That same year Albert was compelled to recognise Danish rule over lands they had conquered in Estonia and Livonia. Albert had sought the aid of King Valdemar of Denmark to protect Riga and Livonian lands against Liv insurrection when reinforcements could not reach Riga. The Danes landed in Livonia, built a fortress at Reval (Tallinn) and set about conquering Estonian and Livonian lands. The Germans attempted, but failed, to assassinate Valdemar. Albert was able to reach an accommodation with them a year later, however, and in 1222 Valdemar returned all Livonian lands and possessions to Albert&#x27;s control.

Albert&#x27;s difficulties with Riga&#x27;s citizenry continued; with papal intervention, a settlement was reached in 1225 whereby they no longer had to pay tax to the Bishop of Riga, and Riga&#x27;s citizens acquired the right to elect their magistrates and town councillors. In 1226, Albert consecrated the Dom Cathedral, built St. James&#x27;s Church, (now a cathedral) and founded a parochial school at the Church of St. George.

In 1227, Albert conquered Oesel and the city of Riga concluded a treaty with the Principality of Smolensk giving Polotsk to Riga.

Albert died in January 1229. He failed in his aspiration to be anointed archbishop but the German hegemony he established over the Livonia would last for seven centuries.

=== Hanseatic League ===
In 1282, Riga became a member of the Hanseatic League. The Hansa was instrumental in giving Riga economic and political stability, thus providing the city with a strong foundation which endured the political conflagrations that were to come, down to modern times.

=== Holy Roman Empire, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Swedish and Russian Empires ===


As the influence of the Hanseatic League waned, Riga became the object of foreign military, political, religious and economic aspirations. Riga accepted the Reformation in 1522, ending the power of the archbishops. In 1524, iconoclasts targeted a statue of the Virgin Mary in the cathedral to make a statement against religious icons. It was accused of being a witch, and given a trial by water in the Daugava river. The statue floated, so it was denounced as a witch and burnt at Kubsberg. With the demise of the Livonian Order (1561) during the Livonian War, Riga for twenty years had the status of a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire before it came under the influence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by the Treaty of Drohiczyn, which ended the war for Riga in 1581. In 1621, during the Polish–Swedish War (1621–1625), Riga and the outlying fortress of Daugavgrīva came under the rule of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, who intervened in the Thirty Years&#x27; War not only for political and economic gain but also in favour of German Lutheran Protestantism. During the Russo-Swedish War (1656–1658), Riga withstood a siege by Russian forces.

Riga remained one of the largest cities under the Swedish crown until 1710, a period during which the city retained a great deal of autonomous self-government. In July 1701, during the opening phase of the Great Northern War, the &quot;Crossing of the Düna&quot; took place nearby, resulting in a victory for king Charles XII of Sweden. Between November 1709 and June 1710, however, the Russians under Tsar Peter the Great besieged and captured Riga, which was at the time struck by a plague. Along with the other Livonian towns and gentry, Riga capitulated to Russia, but largely retained their privileges. Riga was made the capital of the Governorate of Riga (later, Livonia). Sweden&#x27;s northern dominance had ended, and Russia&#x27;s emergence as the strongest Northern power was formalised through the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. At the beginning of the 20th century Riga was the largest timber export port in the Russian Empire and ranked the 3rd according to the external trade volume.

During these many centuries of war and changes of power in the Baltic, and despite demographic changes, the Baltic Germans in Riga had maintained a dominant position. By 1867, Riga&#x27;s population was 42.9% German. Riga employed German as its official language of administration until the installation of Russian in 1891 as the official language in the Baltic provinces, as part of the policy of Russification of the non-Russian-speaking territories of the Russian Empire, including Congress Poland, Finland and the Baltics, undertaken by Tsar Alexander III. More and more Latvians started moving to the city during the mid-19th century. The rise of a Latvian bourgeoisie made Riga a centre of the Latvian National Awakening with the founding of the Riga Latvian Association in 1868 and the organisation of the first national song festival in 1873. In 1897, Riga was the sixth largest city in the Russian Empire. The nationalist movement of the Neo-Latvians was followed by the socialist New Current during the city&#x27;s rapid industrialisation, culminating in the 1905 Revolution led by the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party.

=== World War I ===
The 20th century brought World War I and the impact of the Russian Revolution of 1917 to Riga. As a result of the battle of Jugla, the German army marched into Riga on 3 September 1917. On 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed, giving the Baltic countries to Germany. Because of the armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918, Germany had to renounce that treaty, as did Russia, leaving Latvia and the other Baltic States in a position to claim independence. Latvia, with Riga as its capital city, thus declared its independence on 18 November 1918. Between World War I and World War II (1918–1940), Riga and Latvia shifted their focus from Russia to the countries of Western Europe. The United Kingdom and Germany replaced Russia as Latvia&#x27;s major trade partners. The majority of the Baltic Germans were resettled in late 1939, prior to the occupation of Estonia and Latvia by the Soviet Union in June 1940.

=== World War II and Soviet era ===
During World War II, Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 and then was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941–1944. On 17 June 1940, the Soviet forces invaded Latvia occupying bridges, post/telephone, telegraph, and broadcasting offices. Three days later, Latvian president Kārlis Ulmanis was forced to approve a pro-Soviet government which had taken office. On 14–15 July, rigged elections were held in Latvia and the other Baltic states, The ballots held the following instructions: &quot;Only the list of the Latvian Working People&#x27;s Bloc must be deposited in the ballot box. The ballot must be deposited without any changes.&quot; The alleged voter activity index was 97.6%. Most notably, the complete election results were published in Moscow 12 hours before the election closed. Soviet electoral documents found later substantiated that the results were completely fabricated. The Soviet authorities, having regained control over Riga and Latvia imposed a regime of terror, opening the headquarters of the KGB, massive deportations started. Hundreds of men were arrested, including leaders of the former Latvian government. The most notorious deportation, the June deportation took place on 13 and 14 June 1941, estimated at 15,600 men, women, and children, and including 20% of Latvia&#x27;s last legal government. Similar deportations were repeated after the end of World War II. The building of the KGB located at 61 Brīvības iela, known as &#x27;the corner house&#x27;, is now a museum. Stalin&#x27;s deportations also included thousands of Latvian Jews. The mass deportation totalled 131,500 across the Baltics.

During the Nazi occupation, the Jewish community was forced into the Riga Ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp was constructed in Kaiserwald. On 25 October 1941, the Nazis relocated all Jews from Riga and the vicinity to the ghetto. Most of Latvia&#x27;s Jews (about 24,000) were killed on 30 November and 8 December 1941 in the Rumbula massacre. By the end of the war, the remaining Baltic Germans were expelled to Germany.
The Soviet Red Army reconquered Riga on 13 October 1944. In the following years the massive influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel, and their dependents from Russia and other Soviet republics started. Microdistricts of the large multi-storied housing blocks were built to house immigrant workers.

By the end of World War II, Riga&#x27;s historical centre was heavily damaged from constant bombing. After the war, huge efforts were made to reconstruct and renovate most of the famous buildings that had been part of the skyline of the city before the war. Such buildings were, amongst others, St. Peter&#x27;s Church which lost its wooden tower after a fire caused by the Wehrmacht (renovated in 1954). Another example is the House of the Blackheads, completely destroyed, its ruins subsequently demolished; a facsimile was constructed in 1995.

In 1989, the percentage of Latvians in Riga had fallen to 36.5%.

=== 21st century ===

In 2004, the arrival of low-cost airlines resulted in cheaper flights from other European cities such as London and Berlin, and consequently a substantial increase in numbers of tourists.

On 21 November 2013, the roof of a supermarket collapsed in Zolitūde, one of the neighbourhoods of the city, possibly as a result of the weight of materials used in the construction of a garden on the roof. Fifty-four people were killed. Latvian President Andris Bērziņš described the disaster as &quot;a large-scale murder of many defenceless people&quot;.
Riga was the European Capital of Culture in 2014. During Latvia&#x27;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2015, the 4th Eastern Partnership Summit took place in Riga.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Saeima voted to suspend the functioning of a section of an agreement between Latvia and Russia regarding the preservation of memorial structures on 12 May, in the next day the Riga City Council also voted to demolish the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders. On 20 May, a rally called &quot;Getting Rid of Soviet Heritage&quot; took place in Riga to call for removing Soviet monuments in Latvia, it was attended by approximately 5,000 people. The demolition began 22 August 2022 and on 25 August 2022, the obelisk was toppled. In 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the street on which the Embassy of the Russian Federation is located was renamed &quot;Independent Ukraine Street.&quot;

== Geography ==
Riga is one of the largest city in the three Baltic states: (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia). Riga is home to approximately one tenth of the three Baltic countries&#x27; combined population.

=== Administrative divisions ===

*Central District ()
*Kurzeme District ()
*Zemgale Suburb ()
*Northern District ()
*Vidzeme Suburb ()
*Latgale Suburb ()

Riga&#x27;s administrative divisions consist of six administrative entities: Central, Kurzeme and Northern districts and the Latgale, Vidzeme and Zemgale suburbs. Three entities were established on 1 September 1941, and the other three were established in October 1969. There are no official lower-level administrative units, but the Riga City Council Development Agency is working on a plan, which officially makes Riga consist of 58 neighbourhoods. The current names were confirmed on 28 December 1990.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Riga is humid continental (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). The coldest months are January and February, when the average temperature is but temperatures as low as can be observed almost every year on the coldest days. The proximity of the sea causes frequent autumn rains and fogs. Continuous snow cover may last eighty days. The summers in Riga are mild and rainy with an average temperature of , while the temperature on the hottest days can exceed .


== Government ==

The head of the city government in Riga is the mayor, or officially the Chairman of the Riga City Council. The mayor is elected by the city council. He or she is assisted by one or more Vice Mayors (deputy mayors). The current mayor is Vilnis Ķirsis, who was elected on 17 August 2023 from New Unity, with support from &quot;Coalition for Cooperation&quot;, consisting of New Unity, National Alliance/Latvian Regional Alliance (NA/LRA), Code for Riga, Honor to server Riga and For Latvia&#x27;s Development factions.

The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city. The Council consists of 60 members or deputies who are elected every four years. The Presidium of the Riga City Council consists of the Chairman of the Riga City Council and the representatives delegated by the political parties or party blocks elected to the City Council. From February to October 2020, the offices of the Mayor and Vice Mayors were suspended and the council itself had been dissolved and replaced by an interim administration of representatives from three governmental ministries until snap elections were held in 2020.

== Demographics ==
With 605,270 inhabitants in 2024 as according to the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia, Riga was one of the largest cities in the Baltic states, though its population has decreased from just over 900,000 in 1991 and the population of Vilnius has just outnumbered that of Riga. Notable causes include emigration and low birth rates. According to the 2022 data, ethnic Latvians made up 47.4% of the population of Riga. Russians formed 35.7%, Belarusians 3.6%, Ukrainians 3.5%, Poles 1.7%, other ethnicities consisted 8.2%. By comparison, 63.0% of Latvia&#x27;s total population was ethnically Latvian, 24.2% Russian, 3.1% Belarusian, 2.2% Ukrainian, 1.9% Polish, 1.1% are Lithuanian and the rest of other origins.

Upon the restoration of Latvia&#x27;s independence in 1991, Soviet-era immigrants (and any of their offspring born before 1991) were not automatically granted Latvian citizenship because they had migrated to the territory of Latvia during the years of Soviet occupation. The proportion of ethnic Latvians in Riga increased from 36.5% in 1989 to 47.4% in 2022. In contrast, the percentage of Russians fell from 47.3% to 35.7% in the same time period. In 2022 citizens of Latvia made up 79.0%, non-citizens 15.3% and citizens of other countries 5.6% of the population of Riga.

== Economy ==
Riga is one of the key economic and financial centres of the Baltic states. Roughly half of all the jobs in Latvia are in Riga and the city generates more than 50% of Latvia&#x27;s GDP as well as around half of Latvia&#x27;s exports. The biggest exporters are in wood products, IT, food and beverage manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, transport and metallurgy. Riga Port is one of the largest in the Baltics. It handled a record 34 million tons of cargo in 2011 and has potential for future growth with new port developments on Krievu Sala. Tourism is also a large industry in Riga and after a slowdown during the global economic recessions of the late 2000s, grew 22% in 2011 alone.

Riga was intended to become the global financial centre in the former Soviet Union. One bank, which provided high levels of secrecy for its customers, promoted itself as &quot;We are closer than Switzerland!&quot; (). On 28 July 1995, twenty Latvian banks with assistance of persons from the Paris Stock Exchange organised the Riga Stock Exchange which was the first Latvian stock exchange in Riga.

=== Art Nouveau ===

Riga has one of the largest collections of Art Nouveau buildings in the world, with at least 800 buildings. This is due to the fact that at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, when Art Nouveau was at the height of its popularity, Riga experienced an unprecedented financial and demographic boom. In the period from 1857 its population grew from 282,000 (256,200 in Riga itself and another 26,200 inhabitants beyond the city limits in the patrimonial district and military town of Ust-Dvinsk) to 472,100 in 1913. The middle class of Riga used their acquired wealth to build imposing apartment blocks outside the former city walls. Local architects, mostly graduates of Riga Technical University, adopted current European movements and in particular Art Nouveau. Between 1910 and 1913, between 300 and 500 new buildings were built each year in Riga, many of them in Art Nouveau style and most of them outside the old town.

== Transport ==

Riga, with its central geographic position and concentration of population, has always been the infrastructural hub of Latvia. Several national roads begin in Riga, and European route E22 crosses Riga from the east and west, while the Via Baltica crosses Riga from the south and north.

As a city situated by a river, Riga also has several bridges. The oldest-standing bridge is the Railway Bridge, which is also the only railroad-carrying bridge in Riga. The Stone Bridge (&quot;Akmens tilts&quot;) connects Old Riga and Pārdaugava; the Island Bridge (&quot;Salu tilts&quot;) connects Maskavas Forštate and Pārdaugava via Zaķusala; and the Shroud Bridge (&quot;Vanšu tilts&quot;) connects Old Riga and Pārdaugava via Ķīpsala. In 2008, the first stage of the new Southern Bridge (&quot;Dienvidu tilts&quot;) route across the Daugava was completed, and was opened to traffic on 17 November.

The Southern Bridge was the biggest construction project in the Baltic states in 20 years, and its purpose was to reduce traffic congestion in the city centre. Another major construction project is the planned Riga Northern transport corridor; its first segment detailed project was completed in 2015.

The Freeport of Riga facilitates cargo and passenger traffic by sea. Sea ferries connect Riga Passenger Terminal to Stockholm operated by Tallink.
Riga has one active airport that serves commercial airlines—the Riga International Airport (RIX), built in 1973. It is the primary hub of AirBaltic and a base for RyanAir. Renovation and modernisation of the airport was completed in 2001, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of the city. In 2006, a new terminal extension was opened. Extension of the runway was completed in October 2008, and the airport is now able to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A340, Boeing 747, 757, 767 and 777. Another terminal extension is under construction . The annual number of passengers has grown from 310,000 in 1993 to 4.7 million in 2014, making Riga International Airport the largest in the Baltic States. A new multi-modal hub is planned around the airport with a Rail Baltica station and airport city development planned.

The former international airport of Riga, Spilve Airport, located from Riga city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation. Riga was also home to a military air base during the Cold War—Rumbula Air Base.

Public transport in the city is provided by Rīgas Satiksme which operates a large number of trams, buses and trolleybuses on an extensive network of routes across the city. In addition, up until 2012 many private owners operated minibus services, after which the City Council established the unified transport company &quot;Rīgas mikroautobusu satiksme&quot;, establishing a monopoly over the service.

Riga International Coach Terminal provides domestic and international connections by coach.

As the population of Riga city started to approach 1 million people in the 1980s, the city became eligible (under the Soviet standards of the time) for the construction of a subway system Riga Metro, which would have been paid for by the Soviet government. However, the population decline and shortage of funding following Latvian independence put an end to this plan.

Riga is connected to the rest of Latvia by domestic trains operated by the national carrier Passenger Train, whose headquarters are in Riga. The main railway station is the Riga Central Station. It has stops for public transport along the streets Satekles iela, 13. janvāra iela Marijas iela, and Merķeļa iela. There are also international rail services to Russia and Belarus, and plans to revive passenger rail traffic with Estonia. International overnight service is with Latvia Express trains (). A TEN-T project called Rail Baltica envisages building a high-speed railway line via Riga connecting Tallinn to Warsaw using standard gauge, expected to be put into operation in 2024. Latvian Railways ( or &quot;LDz&quot;) operates the Latvian Rail History Museum in Riga.

<doc id="25519" wikidata="Q960541" url="?curid=25519" title="Reich">
<text> ( , ) is a German word whose meaning is analogous to the English word &quot;realm&quot;not to be confused with the German adjective which means &#x27;rich&#x27;. The terms (; ) and (; ) are respectively used in German in reference to empires and kingdoms. The &quot;Cambridge Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; indicates that in English usage, the term &quot;Third Reich&quot; refers to &quot;Germany during the period of Nazi control from 1933 to 1945&quot;.

The term (sometimes translated to &quot;German Empire&quot;) continued to be used even after the collapse of the German Empire and the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. There was no emperor, but many Germans had imperialistic ambitions. According to Richard J. Evans:

The term is derived from the Germanic word which generally means &quot;realm&quot;, but in German, it is typically used to designate a kingdom or an empire, especially the Roman Empire. The terms (, &quot;Imperium&quot;) and (&quot;Imperial realm&quot;) are used in German to more specifically define an empire ruled by an emperor.

 is comparable in meaning and development (as well as descending from the same Proto-Indo-European root) to the English word &quot;realm&quot; (via French &quot;kingdom&quot; from Latin &quot;royal&quot;). It is used for historical empires in general, such as the Roman Empire (), Persian Empire (), and both the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire (, literally &quot;Tsars&#x27; realm&quot;). , the name used for Austria today, is composed of and which, literally translated, means &quot;Eastern Realm&quot;. The name once referred to the eastern parts of the Holy Roman Empire.

In the history of Germany specifically, it is used to refer to:
* the early medieval Frankish Realm (Francia) and Carolingian Empire (the and );
* the Holy Roman Empire (), which lasted from the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor in 800, until 1806, when it was dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars;
* the German Empire ( or ), which lasted from the unification of Germany in 1871 until its collapse after World War I, during the German Revolution of 1918–1919;
* the Weimar Republic of 1919–1933 continued to use as its official name;
* Nazi Germany, the state often referred to as the &quot;Third Reich&quot;, which lasted from the Enabling Act in 1933 until the end of World War II in Europe in 1945. It continued to use the official name, , until 1943, when it was renamed to the (Greater German Reich). 

The Nazis adopted the term &quot;Third Reich&quot; to legitimize their government as the rightful successor to the retroactively renamed &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second&quot; Reichs – the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire, respectively; the Nazis discounted the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic entirely. The terms &quot;First Reich&quot; and &quot;Second Reich&quot; are not used by historians, and the term &quot;Fourth Reich&quot; is mainly used in fiction and political humor, although it is also used by those who subscribe to neo-Nazism.

==Etymology==

The German noun &quot;Reich&quot; is derived from , which together with its cognates in , , and is derived from a Common Germanic .
The English noun survives only in the compounds &quot;bishopric&quot; and &quot;archbishopric&quot;.

The German adjective , on the other hand, has an exact cognate in English rich. Both the noun () and the adjective () are derivations based on the Common Germanic &quot;ruler, king&quot;, reflected in Gothic as , glossing &quot;leader, ruler, chieftain&quot;.

It is probable that the Germanic word was not inherited from pre-Proto-Germanic, but rather loaned from Celtic (i.e. Gaulish &quot;rīx&quot;, Welsh , both meaning &#x27;king&#x27;) at an early time.

The word has many cognates outside of Germanic and Celtic, notably and . It is ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot;, lit. &#x27;to straighten out or rule&#x27;.

==Usage throughout German history==
===Frankish Empire===
&quot;Frankenreich&quot; or &quot;Fränkisches Reich&quot; is the German name given to the Frankish Kingdom of Charlemagne. 
&quot;Frankenreich&quot; came to be used of Western Francia and medieval France after the development of Eastern Francia into the Holy Roman Empire.
The German name of France, &quot;Frankreich&quot;, is a contraction of &quot;Frankenreich&quot; used in reference to the kingdom of France from the late medieval period.

===Holy Roman Empire===
The term &quot;Reich&quot; was part of the German names for Germany for much of its history. &quot;Reich&quot; was used by itself in the common German variant of the Holy Roman Empire, (&#x27;). &quot;Der rîche&quot; was a title for the Emperor. However, Latin, not German, was the formal legal language of the medieval Empire (&#x27;), so English-speaking historians are more likely to use Latin &#x27; than German &#x27; as a term for this period of German history. The common contemporary Latin legal term used in documents of the Holy Roman Empire was for a long time &quot;regnum&quot; (&quot;rule, domain, empire&quot;, such as in &quot;Regnum Francorum&quot; for the Frankish Kingdom) before &quot;imperium&quot; was in fact adopted, the latter first attested in 1157, whereas the parallel use of &quot;regnum&quot; never fell out of use during the Middle Ages.

====Modern age====
At the beginning of the modern age, some circles redubbed the HRE into the &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; (&quot;&quot;), a symptom of the formation of a German nation state as opposed to the multinational state the Empire was throughout its history.

Resistance against the French Revolution with its concept of the state brought a new movement to create a German &quot;ethnical state&quot;, especially after the Napoleonic wars. Ideal for this state was the Holy Roman Empire; the legend arose that Germany were &quot;un-defeated when unified&quot;, especially after the Franco-Prussian War (&quot;&quot;, lit. &quot;German-French war&quot;). Before that, the German question ruptured this &quot;German unity&quot; after the 1848 Revolution before it was achieved, however; Austria-Hungary as a multinational state could not become part of the new &quot;German empire&quot;, and nationality conflicts in Prussia with the Prussian Poles arose (&quot;We can never be Germans – Prussians, every time!&quot;).

The advent of national feeling and the movement to create an ethnically German Empire did lead directly to nationalism in 1871. Ethnic minorities declined since the beginning of the modern age; the Polabs, Sorbs and even the once important Low Germans had to assimilate themselves. This marked the transition between Antijudaism, where converted Jews were accepted as full citizens (in theory), to Antisemitism, where Jews were thought to be from a different ethnicity that could never become German. Apart from all those ethnic minorities being de facto extinct, even today the era of national feeling is taught in history in German schools as an important stepping-stone on the road to a German nation.

===German Reich===
In the case of the Hohenzollern Empire (1871–1918), the official name of the country was (&quot;German Realm&quot;), because under the Constitution of the German Empire, it was legally a confederation of German states under the permanent presidency of the King of Prussia. The constitution granted the King of Prussia the title of &quot;German Emperor&quot; (&quot;Deutscher Kaiser&quot;), but this referred to the German nation rather than directly to the &quot;state&quot; of Germany.

The exact translation of the term &quot;German Empire&quot; would be . This name was sometimes used informally for Germany between 1871 and 1918, but it was disliked by the first German Emperor, Wilhelm I, and never became official.

The unified Germany which arose under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1871 was the first entity that was officially called in German &quot;&quot;. remained the official name of Germany until 1945, although these years saw three very different political systems more commonly referred to in English as: &quot;the German Empire&quot; (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933; this term is a post-World War II coinage not used at the time), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945).

===During the Weimar Republic===
After 1918 &quot;Reich&quot; was usually not translated as &quot;Empire&quot; in English-speaking countries, and the title was instead simply used in its original German. During the Weimar Republic the term &#x27; and the prefix &#x27; referred not to the idea of empire but rather to the institutions, officials, affairs etc. of the whole country as opposed to those of one of its constituent federal states (&#x27;), in the same way that the terms &#x27; (federation) and &quot;&quot; (federal) are used in Germany today, and comparable to &quot;The Crown&quot; in Commonwealth countries and &quot;The Union&quot; in the United States.

===During the Nazi period===
The Nazis sought to legitimize their power historiographically by portraying their ascendancy to rule as the direct continuation of an ancient German past. They adopted the term &quot;&quot; (&quot;Third Empire&quot; – usually rendered in English in the partial translation &quot;the Third &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;), first used in a 1923 book entitled &quot;Das Dritte Reich&quot; by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, that counted the medieval Holy Roman Empire (which nominally survived until the 19th century) as the first and the 1871–1918 monarchy as the second, which was then to be followed by a &quot;reinvigorated&quot; third one. The Nazis ignored the previous 1918–1933 Weimar period, which they denounced as a historical aberration, contemptuously referring to it as &quot;the System&quot;. In the summer of 1939, the Nazis themselves actually banned the continued use of the term in the press, ordering it to use expressions such as &quot;Nationalsozialistisches Deutschland&quot; (&quot;National Socialist Germany&quot;), &quot;Großdeutsches Reich&quot; (&quot;Greater German Reich&quot;), or simply &quot;Deutsches Reich&quot; (German Reich) to refer to the German state instead. It was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal desire that &quot;Großdeutsches Reich&quot; and &quot;nationalsozialistischer Staat&quot; (&quot;[the] National Socialist State&quot;) would be used in place of &quot;Drittes Reich&quot;. &quot;Reichskanzlei Berchtesgaden&quot; (&quot;Reich Chancellery Berchtesgaden&quot;), another nickname of the regime (named after the eponymous town located in the vicinity of Hitler&#x27;s mountain residence where he spent much of his time in office) was also banned at the same time, despite the fact that a sub-section of the Chancellery was in fact installed there to serve Hitler&#x27;s needs.

Although the term &quot;Third Reich&quot; is still commonly used in reference to the Nazi dictatorship, historians avoid using the terms &quot;First Reich&quot; and &quot;Second Reich&quot;, which are seldom found outside Nazi propaganda. During and following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (annexation) of Austria in 1938, Nazi propaganda also used the political slogan &quot;Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer&quot; (&quot;One nation, one &quot;Reich&quot;, one leader&quot;), in order to enforce pan-German sentiment. The term &#x27; (&quot;old Reich&quot;; cf. French &quot;ancien regime&quot; for monarchical France) is sometimes used to refer to the Holy Roman Empire. The term &#x27; was also used after the Anschluss to denote Germany with its pre-1938 post-World War I borders. Another name that was popular during this period was the term &quot;Tausendjähriges Reich&quot; (&quot;Thousand-Year Reich&quot;), the millennial connotations of which suggested that Nazi Germany would last a thousand years.

The Nazis also spoke of enlarging the then-established Greater German Reich into a &quot;Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation&quot; (&quot;Großgermanisches Reich Deutscher Nation&quot;) by gradually and directly annexing all of the historically Germanic countries and regions of Europe into the Nazi state (Flanders, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden etc.).

===Possible negative connotations in modern usage===
A number of previously neutral words which were used by the Nazis later took on negative connotations in German (e.g. &#x27; or &#x27;); while in many contexts &#x27; is not one of them (&quot;Frankreich&quot;, France; &quot;Römisches Reich&quot;, Roman Empire), it can imply German imperialism or strong nationalism if it is used to describe a political or governmental entity. &#x27; has thus not been used in official terminology since 1945, though it is still found in the name of the Reichstag building, which since 1999 has housed the German federal parliament, the Bundestag. The decision not to rename the Reichstag building was taken only after long debate in the Bundestag; even then, it is described officially as &quot;&quot; (Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag). As seen in this example, the term &quot;Bund&quot; (federation) has replaced &quot;Reich&quot; in the names of various state institutions such as the army (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;). The term &quot;Reichstag&quot; also remains in use in the German language as the term for the parliaments of some foreign monarchies, such as Sweden&#x27;s Riksdag and Japan&#x27;s pre-war Imperial Diet.

===Limited usage in the railway system of the German Democratic Republic===
The exception is that during the Cold War, the East German railway incongruously continued to use the name &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; (German Reich Railways), which had been the name of the national railway during the Weimar Republic and the Nazi era. Even after German reunification in October 1990, the Reichsbahn continued to exist for over three years as the operator of the railroad in eastern Germany, ending finally on 1 January 1994 when the Reichsbahn and the western Deutsche Bundesbahn were merged to form the privatized Deutsche Bahn AG.

==Usage in related languages==

===In Scandinavian languages===

The cognate of the word Reich is used in all Scandinavian languages with the identical meaning, i.e. &quot;realm&quot;. It is spelled &#x27; in Danish and older Norwegian (before the 1907 spelling reform) and &#x27; in Swedish and modern Norwegian. The word is traditionally used for sovereign entities, generally simply means &quot;country&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; (in the sense of a sovereign state) and does not have any special or political connotations. It does not imply any particular form of government, but it implies that the entity is both of a certain size and of a certain standing, like the Scandinavian kingdoms themselves; hence the word might be considered exaggerated for very small states like a city-state. Its use as a stand-alone word is more widespread than in contemporary German, but most often, it refers to the three Scandinavian states themselves and certain historical empires, like the Roman Empire. The standard word for a &quot;country&quot; is usually &quot;land&quot;, and there are many other words used to refer to countries.

The word is part of the official names of Denmark, Norway and Sweden in the form of , , and , all meaning kingdom, or literally the &quot;realm of a king&quot; (a kingdom can also be called in Danish and Norwegian and or in Swedish, direct cognates of the English word). Two regions in Norway that were petty kingdoms before the unification of Norway around 900 AD have retained the word in the names (see Ringerike and Romerike). The word is also used in &quot;&quot;, with the current spelling , the name of Sweden in Swedish. Thus in the official name of Sweden, , the word appears twice.

The derived prefix (Danish and pre-1907 Norwegian) and (Swedish and Norwegian) and implies nationwide or under central jurisdiction. Examples include and , names for a national road in Swedish and Norwegian. It is also present in the names of numerous institutions in all the Scandinavian countries, such as (the agency responsible for oversight of the state finances in Denmark) and (commonly known as just ), the central bank of Sweden. It is also used in words such as (Danish), (Swedish) and (Norwegian), relating to foreign countries and other things from abroad. The opposite word is //, meaning domestic.

The adjective form of the word, in Danish and in Swedish/Norwegian, means &quot;rich&quot; like in other Germanic languages.

===Rijk/ryk===
Rijk is the Dutch and ryk the Afrikaans and Frisian equivalent of the German word &quot;Reich&quot;.

In a political sense in the Netherlands and Belgium, the word &quot;rijk&quot; often connotes a connection with the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Belgium as opposed to the European part of the Netherlands or the provincial or municipal governments. The &quot;ministerraad&quot; is the executive body of the Netherlands&#x27; government and the &quot;rijksministerraad&quot; that of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a similar distinction is found in &quot;wetten&quot; (laws) versus &quot;rijkswetten&quot; (kingdom laws) or the now-abolished &quot;rijkswacht&quot; (lit. &quot;guard of the realm&quot;) for gendarmerie in Belgium. The word &quot;rijk&quot; can also be found in institutions like the Rijkswaterstaat, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu and Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. The German way of applying &quot;rijk&quot; is largely followed in Dutch, resulting in &quot;Frankrijk&quot; (France), &quot;Oostenrijk&quot; (Austria) and the historical &quot;Persische Rijk&quot; and &quot;Romeinse Rijk&quot; for the Persian and Roman Empires respectively. 

In colloquial speech, &quot;rijk&quot; usually means working for the central government rather than the provincial or municipal government, much as Americans refer to the &quot;federal&quot; government.

In Afrikaans, &quot;ryk&quot; refers to rulership and area of governance (mostly a kingdom), but in a modern sense, the term is used in a much more figurative sense (e.g. &quot;Die Hemelse Ryk&quot; (the heavenly kingdom, China)), as the sphere under one&#x27;s control or influencas:
* &quot;die drie ryke van die natuur: die plante-, diere- en delfstowweryk&quot; (the three kingdoms of nature: the plant, animal and mineral kingdom)
* &quot;die duisendjarige ryk&quot; (the thousand-year realm, the Biblical millennium)
* &quot;die ryk van die verbeelding, van drome&quot; (the realm of the imagination, of dreams)
* &quot; &#x27;n bestuurder wat sy ryk goed beheer&quot; (a manager who controls his domain well)

As in German, the adjective &quot;rijk&quot;/&quot;ryk&quot; also means &quot;rich&quot;.

<doc id="25520" wikidata="Q9794" url="?curid=25520" title="Reggae">
<text>Reggae () is a music genre that originated in Jamaica during the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, was the first popular song to use the word &quot;reggae&quot;, effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. Reggae is rooted in traditional Jamaican Kumina, Pukkumina, Revival Zion, Nyabinghi, and burru drumming. Jamaican reggae music evolved out of the earlier genres mento, ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing), calypso, and also draws influence from traditional African folk rhythms. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower-paced than both ska and rocksteady. The concept of call and response can be found throughout reggae music. The genre of reggae music is led by the drum and bass. Some key players in this sound are Jackie Jackson from Toots and the Maytals, Carlton Barrett from Bob Marley and the Wailers, Lloyd Brevett from the Skatalites, Paul Douglas from Toots and the Maytals, Lloyd Knibb from the Skatalites, Winston Grennan, Sly Dunbar, and Anthony &quot;Benbow&quot; Creary from the Upsetters. The bass guitar often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and equalized so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The guitar in reggae usually plays on the offbeat of the rhythm. It is common for reggae to be sung in Jamaican Patois, Jamaican English, and Iyaric dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing.

Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting pan-Africanism. After the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafari and spread its gospel throughout the world. Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of Rastafari. The musician becomes the messenger, and as Rastafari see it, &quot;the soldier and the musician are tools for change.&quot;

Reggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. Reggae en Español spread from the Spanish-speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American country of Venezuela and later to the rest of South America. Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe in 1980.

==Etymology==
The 1967 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of Jamaican English&quot; lists &quot;reggae&quot; as &quot;a recently estab. sp. for &quot;rege&quot;&quot;, as in &quot;rege-rege&quot;, a word that can mean either &quot;rags, ragged clothing&quot; or &quot;a quarrel, a row&quot;. &quot;Reggae&quot; as a musical term first appeared in print with the 1968 rocksteady hit &quot;Do the Reggay&quot; by the Maytals which named the genre.

Reggae historian Steve Barrow credits Clancy Eccles with altering the Jamaican patois word &quot;streggae&quot; (loose woman) into &quot;reggae&quot;. However, Toots Hibbert said:

There&#x27;s a word we used to use in Jamaica called &quot;streggae&quot;. If a girl is walking and the guys look at her and say &quot;Man, she&#x27;s streggae&quot; it means she don&#x27;t dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, &quot;OK man, let&#x27;s do the reggay.&quot; It was just something that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing &quot;Do the reggay, do the reggay&quot; and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it&#x27;s in the Guinness World of Records.

Bob Marley said that the word &quot;reggae&quot; came from a Spanish term for &quot;the king&#x27;s music&quot;. The liner notes of &quot;To the King&quot;, a compilation of Christian gospel reggae, suggest that the word &quot;reggae&quot; was derived from the Latin meaning &#x27;to the king&#x27;.

==History==

===Precursors===

Reggae&#x27;s direct origins are in the ska and rocksteady of 1960s Jamaica, strongly influenced by traditional Caribbean mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues. Ska was originally a generic title for Jamaican music recorded between 1961 and 1967 and emerged from Jamaican R&amp;B, which was based largely on American R&amp;B and doo-wop. Rastafari entered some countries primarily through reggae music; thus, the movement in these places is more stamped by its origins in reggae music and social milieu. The Rastafari movement was a significant influence on reggae, with Rasta drummers like Count Ossie taking part in seminal recordings. One of the predecessors of reggae drumming is the Nyabinghi rhythm, a style of ritual drumming performed as a communal meditative practice in the Rastafarian life.

In the latter half of the 20th century, phonograph records became of central importance to the Jamaican music industry, playing a significant cultural and economic role in the development of reggae music. &quot;In the early 1950s, Jamaican entrepreneurs began issuing 78s&quot; but this format would soon be superseded by the 7&quot; single, first released in 1949. In 1951 the first recordings of mento music were released as singles and showcased two styles of mento: an acoustic rural style, and a jazzy pop style. Other 7&quot; singles to appear in Jamaica around this time were covers of popular American R&amp;B hits, made by Kingston sound system operators to be played at public dances. Meanwhile, Jamaican expatriates started issuing 45s on small independent labels in the United Kingdom, many mastered directly from Jamaican 45s.

Ska arose in Jamaican studios in the late 1950s, developing from this mix of American R&amp;B, mento and calypso music. Notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs, ska is characterized by a quarter note walking bass line, guitar and piano offbeats, and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats. When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, ska became the music of choice for young Jamaicans seeking music that was their own. Ska also became popular among mods in Britain.

In the mid-1960s, ska gave rise to rocksteady, a genre slower than ska featuring more romantic lyrics and less prominent horns. Theories abound as to why Jamaican musicians slowed the ska tempo to create rocksteady; one is that the singer Hopeton Lewis was unable to sing his hit song &quot;Take It Easy&quot; at a ska tempo. The name &quot;rocksteady&quot; was codified after the release of a single by Alton Ellis. Many rocksteady rhythms later were used as the basis of reggae recordings, whose slower tempos allowed for the &quot;double skank&quot; guitar strokes on the offbeat.

===Emergence in Jamaica===
Reggae developed from ska and rocksteady in the late 1960s. Larry And Alvin&#x27;s &quot;Nanny Goat&quot; and the Beltones&#x27; &quot;No More Heartaches&quot; were among the songs in the genre. The beat was distinctive from rocksteady in that it dropped any of the pretensions to the smooth, soulful sound that characterized slick American R&amp;B, and instead was closer in kinship to US southern funk, being heavily dependent on the rhythm section to drive it along. Reggae&#x27;s great advantage was its almost limitless flexibility: from the early, jerky sound of Lee Perry&#x27;s &quot;People Funny Boy&quot;, to the uptown sounds of Third World&#x27;s &quot;Now That We&#x27;ve Found Love&quot;, it was an enormous leap through the years and styles, yet both are instantly recognizable as reggae. The shift from rocksteady to reggae was illustrated by the organ shuffle pioneered by Jamaican musicians like Jackie Mittoo and Winston Wright and featured in transitional singles &quot;Say What You&#x27;re Saying&quot; (1968) by Eric &quot;Monty&quot; Morris and &quot;People Funny Boy&quot; (1968) by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.

Early 1968 was when the first &quot;bona fide&quot; reggae records were released: &quot;Nanny Goat&quot; by Larry Marshall and &quot;No More Heartaches&quot; by the Beltones. That same year, the newest Jamaican sound began to spawn big-name imitators in other countries. American artist Johnny Nash&#x27;s 1968 hit &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot; has been credited with first putting reggae in the American listener charts. Around the same time, reggae influences were starting to surface in rock and pop music; one example is 1968&#x27;s &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; by the Beatles.

The Wailers, a band started by Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer in 1963, is perhaps the most recognized band that made the transition through all three stages of early Jamaican popular music: ska, rocksteady and reggae. Over a dozen Wailers songs are based on or use a line from Jamaican mento songs. Other significant ska artists who made the leap to reggae include Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker, Ken Boothe, and Millie Small, best known for her 1964 blue-beat/ska cover version of &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot; which was a smash hit internationally.

Notable Jamaican producers influential in the development of ska into rocksteady and reggae include: Coxsone Dodd, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Leslie Kong, Duke Reid, Joe Gibbs and King Tubby. Chris Blackwell, who founded Island Records in Jamaica in 1960, relocated to England in 1962, where he continued to promote Jamaican music. He formed a partnership with Lee Gopthal&#x27;s Trojan Records in 1968, which released reggae in the UK until bought by Saga records in 1974.

===International popularity===

Reggae&#x27;s influence bubbled to the top of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts in late 1972. First Three Dog Night hit No. 1 in September with a cover of the Maytones&#x27; version of &quot;Black and White&quot;. Then Johnny Nash was at No. 1 for four weeks in November with &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;. Paul Simon&#x27;s single &quot;Mother And Child Reunion&quot; – a track which he recorded in Kingston, Jamaica with Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s backing group – was ranked by Billboard as the No. 57 song of 1972.

In 1973, the film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; starring Jimmy Cliff was released and introduced Jamaican music to cinema audiences outside Jamaica. Though the film achieved cult status, its limited appeal meant that it had a smaller impact than Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1974 cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; which made it onto the playlists of mainstream rock and pop radio stations worldwide. Clapton&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; used modern rock production and recording techniques and faithfully retained most of the original reggae elements; it was a breakthrough pastiche devoid of any parody and played an important part in bringing the music of Bob Marley to a wider rock audience. By the mid-1970s, authentic reggae dub plates and specials were getting some exposure in the UK on John Peel&#x27;s radio show, who promoted the genre for the rest of his career. Around the same time, British filmmaker Jeremy Marre documented the Jamaican music scene in &quot;Roots Rock Reggae&quot;, capturing the heyday of Roots reggae.

While the quality of Reggae records produced in Jamaica took a turn for the worse following the oil crisis of the 1970s, reggae produced elsewhere began to flourish. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the UK punk rock scene flourished, and reggae was a notable influence. The DJ Don Letts would play reggae and punk tracks at clubs such as The Roxy. Punk bands such as the Clash, the Ruts, the Members and the Slits played many reggae-influenced songs. Around the same time, reggae music took a new path in the UK; one that was created by the multiracial makeup of England&#x27;s inner cities and exemplified by groups like Steel Pulse, Aswad and UB40, as well as artists such as Smiley Culture and Carroll Thompson. The Jamaican ghetto themes in the lyrics were replaced with UK inner city themes, and Jamaican patois became intermingled with Cockney slang. In South London around this time, a new subgenre of lovers rock, was being created. Unlike the Jamaican music of the same name which was mainly dominated by male artists such as Gregory Isaacs, the South London genre was led by female singers like Thompson and Janet Kay. The UK Lovers Rock had a softer and more commercial sound.Other reggae artists who enjoyed international appeal in the early 1980s include Third World, Black Uhuru and Sugar Minott. The Grammy Awards introduced the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album category in 1985.
Women also play a role in the reggae music industry personnel such as Olivia Grange, president of Specs-Shang Musik; Trish Farrell, president of Island/Jamaica; Lisa Cortes, president of Loose Cannon; Jamaican-American Sharon Gordon, who has worked in the independent reggae music industry.

=== Reggae heritage ===

Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding made February 2008 the first annual Reggae Month in Jamaica. To celebrate, the Recording Industry Association of Jamaica (RIAJam) held its first Reggae Academy Awards on 24 February 2008. In addition, Reggae Month included a six-day Global Reggae conference, a reggae film festival, two radio station award functions, and a concert tribute to the late Dennis Brown, who Bob Marley cited as his favorite singer. On the business side, RIAJam held events focused on reggae&#x27;s employment opportunities and potential international revenue. . Reggae Month 2019 in Jamaica was welcomed with multiple events ranging from corporate reggae functions to major celebrations in honour of Bob Marley&#x27;s Birthday on 6 February to a tribute concert in honour of Dennis Brown on 24 February along with a sold-out concert by 2019 Reggae Grammy nominated artiste Protoje for his A Matter of Time Live held at Hope Gardens in Kingston on 23 February.

In November 2018 &quot;reggae music of Jamaica&quot; was added to the UNESCO&#x27;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity the decision recognised reggae&#x27;s &quot;contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual.&quot;

==== Cod reggae ====
The term cod reggae is popularly used to describe reggae done by non-Caribbean people, often in a disparaging manner because of perceived inauthenticity. Boy George has been described as “one of the great cod reggae artists of all time.”

==Musical characteristics==

Stylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues (R&amp;B), jazz, mento, calypso, African, and Latin American music, as well as other genres. Reggae scenes consist of two guitars, one for rhythm and one for lead—drums, congas, and keyboards, with a couple of vocalists.

Reggae is played in time because the symmetrical rhythmic pattern does not lend itself to other time signatures such as . One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; staccato chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure, often referred to as the skank.

This rhythmic pattern accents the second and fourth beats in each bar and combines with the drum&#x27;s emphasis on beat three to create a unique sense of phrasing. The reggae offbeat can be counted so that it falls between each count as an &quot;and&quot; (example: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ... , etc.) or counted as a half-time feel at twice the tempo so it falls on beats 2 and 4. This is in contrast to the way most other popular genres focus on beat one, the &quot;downbeat&quot;.

The tempo of reggae is usually slower than both ska and rocksteady. It is this slower tempo, the guitar/piano offbeats, the emphasis on the third beat, and the use of syncopated, melodic bass lines that differentiate reggae from other music, although other musical styles have incorporated some of these innovations.

===Drums and other percussion===
Reggae drummers often involved these three tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum so that it tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the hi-hat for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.

===Bass===

===Guitars===

The guitar in reggae usually plays on the off beat of the rhythm. So if one is counting in time and counting &quot;1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and ...&quot;, one would play a downstroke on the &quot;and&quot; part of the beat. A musical figure known as skank or the &#x27;bang&quot; has a very dampened, short and scratchy chop sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following eighth-note beats on the up-stroke. An example is the intro to &quot;Stir It Up&quot; by the Wailers. Artist and producer Derrick Harriott says, &quot;What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.&quot;

===Keyboards===
The reggae organ-shuffle is unique to reggae. In the original version of reggae, the drummer played a reggae groove that was used in the four bar introduction, allowing the piano to serve as a percussion instrument.

===Horns===

===Vocals===
====Lyrical themes====
Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing. Many early reggae bands covered Motown or Atlantic soul and funk songs. Some reggae lyrics attempt to raise the political consciousness of the audience, such as by criticizing materialism, or by informing the listener about controversial subjects such as apartheid. Many reggae songs promote the use of cannabis (also known as &quot;herb&quot;, &quot;ganja&quot;, or &quot;sinsemilla&quot;), considered a sacrament in the Rastafari movement. There are many artists who utilize religious themes in their music – whether it be discussing a specific religious topic, or simply giving praise to God (Jah). Other common socio-political topics in reggae songs include black nationalism, anti-racism, anti-colonialism, anti-capitalism and criticism of political systems and &quot;Babylon&quot;.

In recent years, Jamaican (and non-Jamaican) reggae musicians have used more positive themes in reggae music. The music is widely considered a treasured cultural export for Jamaica, so musicians who still desire progress for their island nation have begun focusing on themes of hopefulness, faith, and love. For elementary children, reggae songs such as &quot;Give a Little Love&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, or &quot;Three Little Birds&quot;, all written by Bob Marley, can be sung and enjoyed for their optimism and cheerful lyrics.

====Criticism of dancehall and reggae lyrics====

Some dancehall and ragga artists have been criticised for homophobia, including threats of violence. Buju Banton&#x27;s song &quot;Boom Bye-Bye&quot; states that gays &quot;haffi dead&quot; (have to die). Other notable dancehall artists who have been accused of homophobia include Elephant Man, Bounty Killer and Beenie Man. The controversy surrounding anti-gay lyrics has led to the cancellation of UK tours by Beenie Man and Sizzla. Toronto, Canada has also seen the cancellation of concerts due to artists such as Elephant Man and Sizzla refusing to conform to similar censorship pressures.

After lobbying from the Stop Murder Music coalition, the dancehall music industry agreed in 2005 to stop releasing songs that promote hatred and violence against gay people. In June 2007, Beenie Man, Sizzla and Capleton signed up to the Reggae Compassionate Act, in a deal brokered with top dancehall promoters and Stop Murder Music activists. They renounced homophobia and agreed to &quot;not make statements or perform songs that incite hatred or violence against anyone from any community&quot;. Five artists targeted by the anti-homophobia campaign did not sign up to the act, including Elephant Man, TOK, Bounty Killa and Vybz Kartel. Buju Banton and Beenie Man both gained positive press coverage around the world for publicly renouncing homophobia by signing the Reggae Compassion Act. However, both of these artists have since denied any involvement in anti-homophobia work and both deny having signed any such act.

==Global significance==

Reggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. In November 2018 UNESCO added the &quot;reggae music of Jamaica&quot; to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

===Americas===

Reggae en Español spread from mainland South American Caribbean from Venezuela and Guyana to the rest of South America. It does not have any specific characteristics other than being sung in Spanish, usually by artists of Latin American origin. Samba reggae originated in Brazil as a blend of samba with Jamaican reggae. Reggae also has a presence in Veracruz, Mexico. The most notable Jarocho reggae group being Los Aguas Aguas from Xalapa. Some of the most popular reggae groups across Latin America come from the Southern Cone, such as the Chilean band Gondwana, and the Argentinian band Los Cafres. The Puerto Rican band Cultura Profética is also widely recognized in the region. Hispanic reggae includes three elements: the incorporation of the Spanish language; the use of translations and versions based on known riddims and background music; and regional consciousness. It is a medium of rebellious contestation rising from the underground. Hispanic reggae is related to rap, sharing characteristics that can be found not only in the social conditions in which they developed in the region but also in the characteristics of social sectors and classes that welcome them.

Brazilian samba-reggae utilized themes such as the civil rights movement and the Black Soul movement, and especially the Jamaican independence movement since the 1960s and its messages in reggae and Rastafari. Thus, the sudden popularity of reggae music and musicians in Bahia, Brazil, was not the result of the effects of the transnational music industry, but of the need to establish cultural and political links with black communities across the Americas that had faced and were facing similar sociopolitical situations.

Musically, it was the bloco afro Olodum and its lead percussionist, Neguinho do Samba, that began to combine the basic samba beat of the blocos with merengue, salsa, and reggae rhythms and debuted their experimentations in the carnival of 1986. The new (drumming patterns) were labeled &quot;samba-reggae&quot; and consisted basically of a pattern in which the surdo bass drums (four of them at minimum) divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts.

In the state of Maranhão, in northeastern Brazil, reggae is a very popular genre. São Luís, the state capital, is known as the Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 , the name given to sound teams formed by DJs and sound systems with dozens of powerful amplifiers stacked. Reggae in Maranhão has its own characteristics, such as melody and dance style, as well as having its own radio and television programs. In 2018, the Reggae Museum of Maranhão was inaugurated, the second reggae museum in the world (after Jamaica), with the objective of preserving the state&#x27;s reggae cultural history.

In the United States, bands like Rebelution, Slightly Stoopid, Dirty Heads, and Iration are the leading bands in a growing genre. Other bands like The Movement, The Elovaters, Artikal Sound 

System, Soja, Fortunate Youth, Hirie, Common Kings and Tribal Seeds have enthusiastic followings and typically provide a fantastic experience opening for more established acts or in early sets at larger reggae festivals. The live experience is a major part of the American Reggae world and the presence of so many emerging bands to combine with established international acts has allowed the movement to grow in recent years. 

The American reggae scene is heavily centred in Southern California, with large scenes also in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Miami, and Honolulu. For decades, Hawaiian reggae has had a big following on the Hawaiian islands and the West coast of the US. On the east coast upstate NY has seen a rise in original roots reggae bands such as Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad and John Brown&#x27;s Body who were inspired by Jamaican reggae bands that performed in the area in the 1980s and 1990s. Matisyahu gained prominence by blending traditional Jewish themes with reggae. Compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu&#x27;s lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish. There is a large Caribbean presence in Toronto and Montreal, Canada, with English and French influences on the reggae genre. Canadian band Magic!&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;Rude&quot; was an international hit.

In 2017, Toots and the Maytals became the second reggae-based group to ever perform at the Coachella festival, after Chronixx in 2016.

===Europe===
The UK was a primary destination for Caribbean people looking to emigrate as early as the 1950s. Because of this, Caribbean music in the United Kingdom, including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Most notable of these is lovers rock, but this fusion of Jamaican music into English culture was seminal in the formation of other musical forms like drum and bass and dubstep. The UK became the base from which many Jamaican artists toured Europe and due to the large number of Jamaican musicians emigrating there, the UK is the root of the larger European scene that exists today. Many of the world&#x27;s most famous reggae artists began their careers in UK. Singer and Grammy Award-winning reggae artist Maxi Priest began his career with seminal British sound system Saxon Studio International.

Three reggae-tinged singles from the Police&#x27;s 1978 debut album, &quot;Outlandos d&#x27;Amour&quot;, laid down the template for the basic structure of a lot of rock/reggae songwriting: a reggae-infused verse containing upstrokes on guitar or keyboards and a more aggressive, on-the-beat punk/rock attack during the chorus. The end of the 1970s featured a ska revival in the UK. By the end of the 1970s, a revival movement had begun in England, with such bands as the Specials, Madness, the (English) Beat, and the Selecter. The Specials&#x27; leader and keyboardist, Jerry Dammers, founded the 2 Tone record label, which released albums from the aforementioned racially integrated groups and was instrumental in creating a new social and cultural awareness. The 2 Tone movement referenced reggae&#x27;s godfathers, popular styles (including the genre&#x27;s faster and more dance-oriented precursors, ska and rocksteady), and previous modes of dress (such as black suits and porkpie hats) but updated the sound with a faster tempo, more guitar, and more attitude.

Birmingham based reggae/pop music band UB40 were main contributors to the British reggae scene throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The achieved international success with hits such as &quot;Red Red Wine&quot;, &quot;Kingston Town&quot; and &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Help) Falling in Love with You.&quot;

Other UK-based artists that had international impact include Aswad, Misty in Roots, Steel Pulse, Janet Kay, Tippa Irie, Smiley Culture and more recently Bitty McLean. There have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe, whose music and vocal styles are almost identical to contemporary Jamaican music. The best examples might be Alborosie (Italy) and Gentleman (Germany). Both Gentleman and Alborosie have had a significant chart impact in Jamaica, unlike many European artists. They have both recorded and released music in Jamaica for Jamaican labels and producers and are popular artists, likely to appear on many riddims. Alborosie has lived in Jamaica since the late 1990s and has recorded at Bob Marley&#x27;s famous Tuff Gong Studios. Since the early 1990s, several Italian reggae bands have emerged, including Africa Unite, Gaudi, Reggae National Tickets, Sud Sound System, Pitura Freska and B.R. Stylers.

Reggae appeared on the Yugoslav popular music scene in the late 1970s, through sporadic songs by various rock acts, most prominently by new wave bands Haustor, Šarlo Akrobata, Aerodrom, Laboratorija Zvuka, Piloti, Zana, Du Du A and Grupa I. In the mid-1980s appeared Del Arno Band, often considered the first Yugoslav band whose sound was primarily reggae-oriented, remaining one of the most notable reggae acts in the region of former Yugoslavia.

The first homegrown Polish reggae bands started in the 1980s with groups like Izrael. Singer and songwriter Alexander Barykin was considered the father of Russian reggae. In Sweden, Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees from across Northern Europe and features Swedish reggae bands such as Rootvälta and Svenska Akademien as well as many popular Jamaican artists. Summerjam, Europe&#x27;s biggest reggae festival, takes place in Cologne, Germany, and sees crowds of 25,000 or more. Rototom Sunsplash, a week-long festival which used to take place in Osoppo, Italy, until 2009, is now held in Benicassim, Spain, and gathers up to 150,000 visitors every year.

In Iceland reggae band Hjálmar is well established having released six CDs in Iceland. They were the first reggae band in Iceland, but few Icelandic artists had written songs in the reggae style before their arrival on the Icelandic music scene. The Icelandic reggae scene is expanding and growing at a fast rate. RVK Soundsystem is the first Icelandic sound system, counting five DJs. They hold reggae nights in Reykjavík every month at clubs Hemmi og Valdi and more recently in Faktorý as the crowd has grown so much.

In Germany, the three successful Reggae Summerjam open-air festivals were crucial parts of the renaissance of Caribbean music in Germany but in 1990, conflict broke out between the two main German promoters who had cooperated so well during the previous seasons. With a lot of infighting and personal quarrels, each of them pursued his own preparations for a big summer festival. The result was that two open-air events look place on the same day.

The 1990 Reggae Summerjam was staged as usual, but for only one day. The event took place at the Lorelei Rock amphitheater, with artists like Mad Professor&#x27;s Ariwa Posse with Macka B and Kofi, Mutabaruka, the Mighty Diamonds, the Twinkle Brothers, Manu Dibango and Fela Kuti.

The other, ex-partner of the once-united promoters succeeded in bringing the original Sunsplash package to Germany for the first time. Close to the Main River in the little village of Gemaunden deep in rural south-central Germany, they staged a two-day festival that drew a bigger crowd. About 10,000 people came from all over the country as well as from neighboring states like trance and, for the first time, East Germany to see the lineup of top reggae artists.

===Africa===
Reggae in Africa was much boosted by the visit of Bob Marley to Zimbabwe on Independence Day 18 April 1980. Nigerian reggae had developed in the 1970s with artists such as Majek Fashek proving popular. In South Africa, reggae music has played a unifying role amongst cultural groups in Cape Town. During the years of Apartheid, the music bonded people from all demographic groups. Lucky Dube recorded 25 albums, fusing reggae with Mbaqanga. The Marcus Garvey Rasta camp in Phillipi is regarded by many to be the reggae and Rastafari center of Cape Town. Reggae bands play regularly at community centres such as the Zolani center in Nyanga.

In Uganda musician Papa Cidy is very popular. Arthur Lutta is also a Ugandan gospel reggae drummer known for his reggae style drumming. In Ethiopia, Dub Colossus and Invisible System emerged in 2008 sharing core members, and have received wide acclaim. In Mali, Askia Modibo fuses reggae with Malian music. In Malawi, Black Missionaries produced nine albums. In Ivory Coast a country where reggae music is extremely popular, Tiken Jah Fakoly fuses reggae with traditional music. Alpha Blondy from Ivory Coast sings reggae with religious lyrics. In Sudan, beats, drums and bass guitar from reggae have been adopted by local music. Reggae is very popular there among generations from young to old; some spiritual (religious) groups grow dreadlocks and feature reggae beats in their chants.

===Asia===
In the Philippines, several bands and sound systems play reggae and dancehall music. Their music is called Pinoy reggae. Japanese reggae emerged in the early 1980s. Reggae is becoming more prevalent in Thailand as well. Reggae music is quite popular in Sri Lanka. Aside from the reggae music and Rastafari influences seen ever more on Thailand&#x27;s islands and beaches, a true reggae sub-culture is taking root in Thailand&#x27;s cities and towns. Many Thai artists, such as Job 2 Do, keep the tradition of reggae music and ideals alive in Thailand.

Famous Indian singer Kailash Kher and music producer Clinton Cerejo created &quot;Kalapi&quot;, a rare fusion piece of reggae and Indian music for Coke Studio India. Other than this high-profile piece, reggae is confined to a small, emerging scene in India. Reggae Rajahs are a reggae and bass music sound system crew based out of New Delhi, India. They are the first Jamaican style sound system in India and creators of Goa Sunsplash Festival. Thaikkudam Bridge, a neo-Indian band based in Kerala, India, is known for introducing reggae into Indian regional blues.

===Australia and the Pacific===
Reggae in Australia originated in the 1980s. Australian reggae groups include Sticky Fingers, Blue King Brown and Astronomy Class.

By the end of the 1980s, the local music scene in Hawaii was dominated by Jawaiian music, a local form of reggae.

New Zealand reggae was heavily inspired by Bob Marley&#x27;s 1979 tour of the country and early reggae groups such as Herbs. The genre has seen many bands like Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, Salmonella Dub, the Black Seeds and Katchafire emerging in more recent times, often involving fusion with electronica.

In 2017 the first-ever chart dedicated to reggae and dancehall music was established in Australia by radio presenter DJ Ragz, music producer DJ Wade and Dancehall Reggae Australia.

<text>A relay league is a chain of message forwarding stations in a system of optical telegraphs, radio telegraph stations, or riding couriers. Early 19th century methods of this type evolved into the electrical telegraph networks of the mid-to-late 19th century.

== Radio relay leagues ==
Radio amateurs have been early in arranging relay leagues, as is reflected in the name of the organization of American Radio Relay League (ARRL).

Radio amateur message relay operations were originally conducted in the first two decades of the 20th century using Morse code via spark-gap transmitters. As vacuum tubes became affordable, operations shifted to more efficient manual telegraphy transmitters, referred to as &quot;CW&quot; (Continuous wave). Messages were relayed station-to-station, typically involving four or more re-transmission cycles to cover the continental United States, in an organized system of amateur radio networks. After World War II, voice and radioteletype implementations of the message relay system were employed.

<text>The early history of radio is the history of technology that produces and uses radio instruments that use radio waves. Within the timeline of radio, many people contributed theory and inventions in what became radio. Radio development began as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;. Later radio history increasingly involves matters of broadcasting.

== Discovery ==


In an 1864 presentation, published in 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed theories of electromagnetism and mathematical proofs demonstrating that light, radio and x-rays were all types of electromagnetic waves propagating through free space.

Between 1886 and 1888 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz published the results of experiments wherein he was able to transmit electromagnetic waves (radio waves) through the air, proving Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory.

==Exploration of optical qualities==

After their discovery many scientists and inventors experimented with transmitting and detecting &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; (it would take almost 20 years for the term &quot;radio&quot; to be universally adopted for this type of electromagnetic radiation). Maxwell&#x27;s theory showing that light and Hertzian electromagnetic waves were the same phenomenon at different wavelengths led &quot;Maxwellian&quot; scientists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and Alexander Trotter to assume they would be analogous to optical light.

Following Hertz&#x27; untimely death in 1894, British physicist and writer Oliver Lodge presented a widely covered lecture on Hertzian waves at the Royal Institution on June 1 of the same year. Lodge focused on the optical qualities of the waves and demonstrated how to transmit and detect them (using an improved variation of French physicist Édouard Branly&#x27;s detector Lodge named the &quot;coherer&quot;). Lodge further expanded on Hertz&#x27; experiments showing how these new waves exhibited like light refraction, diffraction, polarization, interference and standing waves, confirming that Hertz&#x27; waves and light waves were both forms of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic waves. During part of the demonstration the waves were sent from the neighboring Clarendon Laboratory building, and received by apparatus in the lecture theater.

After Lodge&#x27;s demonstrations researchers pushed their experiments further down the electromagnetic spectrum towards visible light to further explore the quasioptical nature at these wavelengths. Oliver Lodge and Augusto Righi experimented with 1.5 and 12 GHz microwaves respectively, generated by small metal ball spark resonators. Russian physicist Pyotr Lebedev in 1895 conducted experiments in the 50 GHz 50 (6 millimeter) range. Bengali Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose conducted experiments at wavelengths of 60 GHz (5 millimeter) and invented waveguides, horn antennas, and semiconductor crystal detectors for use in his experiments. He would later write an essay, &quot;Adrisya Alok&quot; (&quot;Invisible Light&quot;) on how in November 1895 he conducted a public demonstration at the Town Hall of Kolkata, India using millimeter-range-wavelength microwaves to trigger detectors that ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance.

==Proposed applications==

Between 1890 and 1892 physicists such as John Perry, Frederick Thomas Trouton and William Crookes proposed electromagnetic or Hertzian waves as a navigation aid or means of communication, with Crookes writing on the possibilities of wireless telegraphy based on Hertzian waves in 1892. Among physicist, what were perceived as technical limitations to using these new waves, such as delicate equipment, the need for large amounts of power to transmit over limited ranges, and its similarity to already existent optical light transmitting devices, lead them to a belief that applications were very limited. The Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla considered Hertzian waves relatively useless for long range transmission since &quot;light&quot; could not transmit further than line of sight. There was speculation that this fog and stormy weather penetrating &quot;invisible light&quot; could be used in maritime applications such as lighthouses, including the London journal &quot;The Electrician&quot; (December 1895) commenting on Bose&#x27;s achievements, saying &quot;we may in time see the whole system of coast lighting throughout the navigable world revolutionized by an Indian Bengali scientist working single handed[ly] in our Presidency College Laboratory.&quot;

In 1895, adapting the techniques presented in Lodge&#x27;s published lectures, Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov built a lightning detector that used a coherer based radio receiver. He presented it to the Russian Physical and Chemical Society on May 7, 1895.

==Marconi and radio telegraphy==

In 1894, the young Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began working on the idea of building long-distance a wireless transmission systems based on the use of Hertzian waves (radio waves), a line of inquiry that he noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing. Marconi read through the literature and used the ideas of others who were experimenting with radio waves but did a great deal to develop devices such as portable transmitters and receiver systems that could work over long distances, turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system. By August 1895, Marconi was field testing his system but even with improvements he was only able to transmit signals up to one-half mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves. Marconi raised the height of his antenna and hit upon the idea of grounding his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements the system was capable of transmitting signals up to and over hills. This apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful radio transmission system and Marconi went on to file British patent GB189612039A, &quot;Improvements in transmitting electrical impulses and signals and in apparatus there-for&quot;, in 1896. This patent was granted in the UK on 2 July 1897.

===Nautical and transatlantic transmissions===
In 1897, Marconi established a radio station on the Isle of Wight, England and opened his &quot;wireless&quot; factory in the former silk-works at Hall Street, Chelmsford, England, in 1898, employing around 60 people.

On 12 December 1901, using a kite-supported antenna for reception—signals transmitted by the company&#x27;s new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall, Marconi transmitted a message across the Atlantic Ocean to Signal Hill in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

Marconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907 between Clifden, Ireland, and Glace Bay, but even after this the company struggled for many years to provide reliable communication to others.

Marconi&#x27;s apparatus is also credited with saving the 700 people who survived the tragic &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

==Audio transmission==

In the late 1890s, Canadian-American inventor Reginald Fessenden came to the conclusion that he could develop a far more efficient system than the spark-gap transmitter and coherer receiver combination. To this end he worked on developing a high-speed alternator (referred to as &quot;an alternating-current dynamo&quot;) that generated &quot;pure sine waves&quot; and produced &quot;a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength&quot;, or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter. While working for the United States Weather Bureau on Cobb Island, Maryland, Fessenden researched using this setup for audio transmissions via radio. By fall of 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers (one mile), which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. Although successful, the sound transmitted was far too distorted to be commercially practical. According to some sources, notably Fessenden&#x27;s wife Helen&#x27;s biography, on Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden used an Alexanderson alternator and rotary spark-gap transmitter to make the first radio audio broadcast, from Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing &quot;O Holy Night&quot; on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible.

Around the same time American inventor Lee de Forest experimented with an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady &quot;continuous wave&quot; signal that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. In February 1907 he transmitted electronic telharmonium music from his laboratory station in New York City. This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing &quot;I Love You Truly&quot;. In July 1907 he made ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone—race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie—which were sent from the steam yacht &quot;Thelma&quot; to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox&#x27;s Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island.

===Broadcasting===
The Dutch company &quot;Nederlandsche Radio-Industrie&quot; and its owner-engineer, Hanso Idzerda, made its first regular entertainment radio broadcast over station PCGG from its workshop in The Hague on 6 November 1919. The company manufactured both transmitters and receivers. Its popular program was broadcast four nights per week using narrow-band FM transmissions on 670 metres (448 kHz), until 1924 when the company ran into financial trouble.

Regular entertainment broadcasts began in Argentina, pioneered by Enrique Telémaco Susini and his associates. At 9 pm on August 27, 1920, Sociedad Radio Argentina aired a live performance of Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Parsifal&quot; from the Coliseo Theater in downtown Buenos Aires. Only about twenty homes in the city had receivers to tune in this program.

On 31 August 1920 the &quot;Detroit News&quot; began publicized daily news and entertainment &quot;Detroit News Radiophone&quot; broadcasts, originally as licensed amateur station 8MK, then later as WBL and WWJ in Detroit, Michigan.

Union College in Schenectady, New York began broadcasting on October 14, 1920, over 2ADD, an amateur station licensed to Wendell King, an African-American student at the school. Broadcasts included a series of Thursday night concerts initially heard within a radius and later for a radius.

In 1922 regular audio broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the Marconi Research Centre 2MT at Writtle near Chelmsford, England.

==== Wavelength and frequency ====
In early radio, and to a limited extent much later, the transmission signal of the radio station was specified in meters, referring to the wavelength, the length of the radio wave. This is the origin of the terms long wave, medium wave, and short wave radio. Portions of the radio spectrum reserved for specific purposes were often referred to by wavelength: the 40-meter band, used for amateur radio, for example. The relation between wavelength and frequency is reciprocal: the higher the frequency, the shorter the wave, and vice versa.

As equipment progressed, precise frequency control became possible; early stations often did not have a precise frequency, as it was affected by the temperature of the equipment, among other factors. Identifying a radio signal by its frequency rather than its length proved much more practical and useful, and starting in the 1920s this became the usual method of identifying a signal, especially in the United States. Frequencies specified in number of cycles per second (kilocycles, megacycles) were replaced by the more specific designation of hertz (cycles per second) about 1965.

==Radio companies==

===British Marconi===
Using various patents, the British Marconi company was established in 1897 by Guglielmo Marconi and began communication between coast radio stations and ships at sea. A year after, in 1898, they successfully introduced their first radio station in Chelmsford. This company, along with its subsidiaries Canadian Marconi and American Marconi, had a stranglehold on ship-to-shore communication. It operated much the way American Telephone and Telegraph operated until 1983, owning all of its equipment and refusing to communicate with non-Marconi equipped ships. Many inventions improved the quality of radio, and amateurs experimented with uses of radio, thus planting the first seeds of broadcasting.

===Telefunken===
The company Telefunken was founded on May 27, 1903, as &quot;Telefunken society for wireless telefon&quot; of Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) and the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (&quot;General Electricity Company&quot;) as joint undertakings for radio engineering in Berlin. It continued as a joint venture of AEG and Siemens AG, until Siemens left in 1941. In 1911, Kaiser Wilhelm II sent Telefunken engineers to West Sayville, New York to erect three 600-foot (180-m) radio towers there. Nikola Tesla assisted in the construction. A similar station was erected in Nauen, creating the only wireless communication between North America and Europe.

==Technological development==

===Amplitude-modulated (AM)===
The invention of amplitude-modulated (AM) radio, which allows more closely spaced stations to simultaneously send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where each transmission occupies a wide bandwidth) is attributed to Reginald Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen and Lee de Forest.

=== Crystal set receivers ===
The most common type of receiver before vacuum tubes was the crystal set, although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery. Inventions of the triode amplifier, motor-generator, and detector enabled audio radio. The use of amplitude modulation (AM), by which soundwaves can be transmitted over a continuous-wave radio signal of narrow bandwidth (as opposed to spark-gap radio, which sent rapid strings of damped-wave pulses that consumed much bandwidth and were only suitable for Morse-code telegraphy) was pioneered by Fessenden, Poulsen and Lee de Forest.

The art and science of crystal sets is still pursued as a hobby in the form of simple un-amplified radios that &#x27;runs on nothing, forever&#x27;. They are used as a teaching tool by groups such as the Boy Scouts of America to introduce youngsters to electronics and radio. As the only energy available is that gathered by the antenna system, loudness is necessarily limited.

===Vacuum tubes===

During the mid-1920s, amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. John Ambrose Fleming developed a vacuum tube diode. Lee de Forest placed a screen, added a &quot;grid&quot; electrode, creating the triode.

Early radios ran the entire power of the transmitter through a carbon microphone. In the 1920s, the Westinghouse company bought Lee de Forest&#x27;s and Edwin Armstrong&#x27;s patent. During the mid-1920s, Amplifying vacuum tubes revolutionized radio receivers and transmitters. Westinghouse engineers developed a more modern vacuum tube.

The first radios still required batteries, but in 1926 the &quot;battery eliminator&quot; was introduced to the market. This tube technology allowed radios to be powered through the grid instead. They still required batteries to heat up the vacuum-tube filaments, but after the invention of indirectly heated vacuum tubes, the first completely battery free radios became available in 1927.

In 1929 a new screen grid tube called UY-224 was introduced, an amplifier designed to operate directly on alternating current.

A problem with the early radios was fading stations and fluctuating volume. The invention of the superheterodyne receiver solved this problem, and the first radios with a heterodyne radio receiver went for sale in 1924. But it was costly, and the technology was shelved while waiting for the technology to mature, and in 1929 the Radiola 66 and Radiola 67 went for sale.

===Loudspeakers===
In the early days one had to use headphones to listen to radio. Later loudspeakers in the form of a horn of the type used by phonographs, equipped with a telephone receiver, became available. But the sound quality was poor. In 1926 the first radios with electrodynamic loudspeakers went for sale, which improved the quality significantly. At first the loudspeakers were separated from the radio, but soon radios would come with a built-in loudspeaker.

Other inventions related to sound included the automatic volume control (AVC), first commercially available in 1928. In 1930 a tone control knob was added to the radios. This allowed listeners to improve imperfect broadcasting.

The magnetic cartridge, which was introduced in the mid 20&#x27;s, greatly improved the broadcasting of music. When playing music from a phonograph before the magnetic cartridge, a microphone had to be placed close to a horn loudspeaker. The invention allowed the electric signals to be amplified and then fed directly to the broadcast transmitter.

===Transistor technology===
Following development of transistor technology, bipolar junction transistors led to the development of the transistor radio. In 1954, the Regency company introduced a pocket transistor radio, the TR-1, powered by a &quot;standard 22.5 V Battery.&quot; In 1955, the newly formed Sony company introduced its first transistorized radio, the TR-55. It was small enough to fit in a vest pocket, powered by a small battery. It was durable, because it had no vacuum tubes to burn out. In 1957, Sony introduced the TR-63, the first mass-produced transistor radio, leading to the mass-market penetration of transistor radios. Over the next 20 years, transistors replaced tubes almost completely except for high-power transmitters.

By the mid-1960s, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) were using metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in their consumer products, including FM radio, television and amplifiers. Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) provided a practical and economic solution for radio technology, and was used in mobile radio systems by the early 1970s.

===Integrated circuit===
The first integrated circuit (IC) radio, P1740 by General Electric, became available in 1966.

===Car radio===
The first car radio was introduced in 1922, but it was so large that it took up too much space in the car. The first commercial car radio that could easily be installed in most cars went for sale in 1930.

== Radio telex ==
Telegraphy did not go away on radio. Instead, the degree of automation increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, teletypewriters automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex. For thirty years, telex was the cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.

Telex systems were adapted to short-wave radio by sending tones over single sideband. CCITT R.44 (the most advanced pure-telex standard) incorporated character-level error detection and retransmission as well as automated encoding and routing. For many years, telex-on-radio (TOR) was the only reliable way to reach some third-world countries. TOR remains reliable, though less-expensive forms of e-mail are displacing it. Many national telecom companies historically ran nearly pure telex networks for their governments, and they ran many of these links over short wave radio.

Documents including maps and photographs went by radiofax, or wireless photoradiogram, invented in 1924 by Richard H. Ranger of Radio Corporation of America (RCA). This method prospered in the mid-20th century and faded late in the century.

==Radio navigation==
One of the first developments in the early 20th century was that aircraft used commercial AM radio stations for navigation, AM stations are still marked on U.S. aviation charts. Radio navigation played an important role during war time, especially in World War II. Before the discovery of the crystal oscillator, radio navigation had many limits. However, as radio technology expanding, navigation is easier to use, and it provides a better position. Although there are many advantages, the radio navigation systems often comes with complex equipment such as the radio compass receiver, compass indicator, or the radar plan position indicator. All of these require users to obtain certain knowledge.

In the 1960s VOR systems became widespread. In the 1970s, LORAN became the premier radio navigation system. Soon, the US Navy experimented with satellite navigation. In 1987, the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation of satellites was launched; it was followed by other GNSS systems like Glonass, BeiDou and Galileo.

==FM==

In 1933, FM radio was patented by inventor Edwin H. Armstrong. FM uses frequency modulation of the radio wave to reduce static and interference from electrical equipment and the atmosphere. In 1937, W1XOJ, the first experimental FM radio station after Armstrong&#x27;s W2XMN in Alpine, New Jersey, was granted a construction permit by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

===FM in Europe===

After World War II, FM radio broadcasting was introduced in Germany. At a meeting in Copenhagen in 1948, a new wavelength plan was set up for Europe. Because of the recent war, Germany (which did not exist as a state and so was not invited) was only given a small number of medium-wave frequencies, which were not very good for broadcasting. For this reason Germany began broadcasting on UKW (&quot;Ultrakurzwelle&quot;, i.e. ultra short wave, nowadays called VHF) which was not covered by the Copenhagen plan. After some amplitude modulation experience with VHF, it was realized that FM radio was a much better alternative for VHF radio than AM. Because of this history, FM radio is still referred to as &quot;UKW Radio&quot; in Germany. Other European nations followed a bit later, when the superior sound quality of FM and the ability to run many more local stations because of the more limited range of VHF broadcasts were realized.

==Television==
In the 1930s, regular analog television broadcasting began in some parts of Europe and North America. By the end of the decade there were roughly 25,000 all-electronic television receivers in existence worldwide, the majority of them in the UK. In the US, Armstrong&#x27;s FM system was designated by the FCC to transmit and receive television sound.

===Color television===
* 1953: NTSC compatible color television introduced in the US.
* 1962: Telstar 1, the first communications satellite, relayed the first publicly available live transatlantic television signal.
* Mid-1960s: Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) first used for television, by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The power MOSFET was later widely adopted for television receiver circuits.

By 1963, color television was being broadcast commercially (though not all broadcasts or programs were in color), and the first (radio) communication satellite, &quot;Telstar&quot;, was launched. In the 1970s,

==Mobile phones==
In 1947 AT&amp;T commercialized the Mobile Telephone Service. From its start in St. Louis in 1946, AT&amp;T then introduced Mobile Telephone Service to one hundred towns and highway corridors by 1948. Mobile Telephone Service was a rarity with only 5,000 customers placing about 30,000 calls each week. Because only three radio channels were available, only three customers in any given city could make mobile telephone calls at one time. Mobile Telephone Service was expensive, costing US$15 per month, plus $0.30–0.40 per local call, equivalent to (in 2012 US dollars) about $176 per month and $3.50–4.75 per call. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs, was introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.

The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology, information theory and cellular networking led to the development of affordable mobile communications. The Advanced Mobile Phone System analog mobile phone system, developed by Bell Labs and introduced in the Americas in 1978, gave much more capacity. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in North America (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s.

==Broadcast and copyright==

The British government and the state-owned postal services found themselves under massive pressure from the wireless industry (including telegraphy) and early radio adopters to open up to the new medium. In an internal confidential report from February 25, 1924, the &quot;Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee&quot; stated:

:&quot;We have been asked &#x27;to consider and advise on the policy to be adopted as regards the Imperial Wireless Services so as to protect and facilitate public interest.&#x27; It was impressed upon us that the question was urgent. We did not feel called upon to explore the past or to comment on the delays which have occurred in the building of the Empire Wireless Chain. We concentrated our attention on essential matters, examining and considering the facts and circumstances which have a direct bearing on policy and the condition which safeguard public interests.&quot;

When radio was introduced in the early 1920s, many predicted it would kill the phonograph record industry. Radio was a free medium for the public to hear music for which they would normally pay. While some companies saw radio as a new avenue for promotion, others feared it would cut into profits from record sales and live performances. Many record companies would not license their records to be played over the radio, and had their major stars sign agreements that they would not perform on radio broadcasts.

Indeed, the music recording industry had a severe drop in profits after the introduction of the radio. For a while, it appeared as though radio was a definite threat to the record industry. Radio ownership grew from two out of five homes in 1931 to four out of five homes in 1938. Meanwhile, record sales fell from $75 million in 1929 to $26 million in 1938 (with a low point of $5 million in 1933), though the economics of the situation were also affected by the Great Depression.

The copyright owners were concerned that they would see no gain from the popularity of radio and the &#x27;free&#x27; music it provided. What they needed to make this new medium work for them already existed in previous copyright law. The copyright holder for a song had control over all public performances &#x27;for profit.&#x27; The problem now was proving that the radio industry, which was just figuring out for itself how to make money from advertising and currently offered free music to anyone with a receiver, was making a profit from the songs.

The test case was against Bamberger&#x27;s Department Store in Newark, New Jersey in 1922. The store was broadcasting music from its store on the radio station WOR. No advertisements were heard, except at the beginning of the broadcast which announced &quot;L. Bamberger and Co., One of America&#x27;s Great Stores, Newark, New Jersey.&quot; It was determined through this and previous cases (such as the lawsuit against Shanley&#x27;s Restaurant) that Bamberger was using the songs for commercial gain, thus making it a public performance for profit, which meant the copyright owners were due payment.

With this ruling the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) began collecting licensing fees from radio stations in 1923. The beginning sum was $250 for all music protected under ASCAP, but for larger stations the price soon ballooned to $5,000. Edward Samuels reports in his book &quot;The Illustrated Story of Copyright&quot; that &quot;radio and TV licensing represents the single greatest source of revenue for ASCAP and its composers […] and [a]n average member of ASCAP gets about $150–$200 per work per year, or about $5,000-$6,000 for all of a member&#x27;s compositions.&quot; Not long after the Bamberger ruling, ASCAP had to once again defend their right to charge fees, in 1924. The Dill Radio Bill would have allowed radio stations to play music without paying and licensing fees to ASCAP or any other music-licensing corporations. The bill did not pass.

== Regulations of radio stations in the U.S ==

=== Wireless Ship Act of 1910 ===
Radio technology was first used for ships to communicate at sea. To ensure safety, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 marks the first time the U.S. government implies regulations on radio systems on ships. This act requires ships to have a radio system with a professional operator if they want to travel more than 200 miles offshore or have more than 50 people on board. However, this act had many flaws including the competition of radio operators including the two majors company (British and American Marconi). They tended to delay communication for ships that used their competitor&#x27;s system. This contributed to the tragic incident of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.

=== Radio Act of 1912 ===
In 1912, distress calls to aid the sinking &quot;Titanic&quot; were met with a large amount of interfering radio traffic, severely hampering the rescue effort. Subsequently, the US government passed the Radio Act of 1912 to help mitigate the repeat of such a tragedy. The act helps distinguish between normal radio traffic and (primarily maritime) emergency communication, and specifies the role of government during such an emergency.

=== The Radio Act of 1927 ===
The Radio Act of 1927 gave the Federal Radio Commission the power to grant and deny licenses, and to assign frequencies and power levels for each licensee. In 1928 it began requiring licenses of existing stations and setting controls on who could broadcast from where on what frequency and at what power. Some stations could not obtain a license and ceased operations. In section 29, the Radio Act of 1927 mentioned that the content of the broadcast should be freely present, and the government cannot interfere with this.

=== The Communications Act of 1934 ===
The introduction of the Communications Act of 1934 led to the establishment of the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC). The FCC&#x27;s responsibility is to control the industry including &quot;telephone, telegraph, and radio communications.&quot; Under this Act, all carriers have to keep records of authorized interference and unauthorized interference. This Act also supports the President in time of war. If the government needs to use the communication facilities in time of war, they are allowed to.

=== The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ===
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was the first significant overhaul in over 60 years amending the work of the Communications Act of 1934. Coming only two dozen years after the breakup of AT&amp;T, the act sets out to move telecommunications into a state of competition with their markets and the networks they are a part of. Up to this point the effects of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have been seen, but some of the changes the Act set out to fix are still ongoing problems, such as being unable to create an open competitive market.

== Licensed commercial public radio stations ==

The question of the &#x27;first&#x27; publicly targeted licensed radio station in the U.S. has more than one answer and depends on semantics. Settlement of this &#x27;first&#x27; question may hang largely upon what constitutes &#x27;regular&#x27; programming
* It is commonly attributed to KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which in October 1920 received its license and went on the air as the first US licensed commercial broadcasting station on November 2, 1920, with the presidential election results as its inaugural show, but was not broadcasting daily until 1921. (Their engineer Frank Conrad had been broadcasting from on the two call sign signals of 8XK and 8YK since 1916.) Technically, KDKA was the first of several already-extant stations to receive a &#x27;limited commercial&#x27; license.
* On February 17, 1919, station 9XM at the University of Wisconsin in Madison broadcast human speech to the public at large. 9XM was first experimentally licensed in 1914, began regular Morse code transmissions in 1916, and its first music broadcast in 1917. Regularly scheduled broadcasts of voice and music began in January 1921. That station is still on the air today as WHA.
* On August 20, 1920, 8MK, began broadcasting daily and was later claimed by famed inventor Lee de Forest as the first commercial station. 8MK was licensed to a teenager, Michael DeLisle Lyons, and financed by E. W. Scripps. In 1921 8MK changed to WBL and then to WWJ in 1922, in Detroit. It has carried a regular schedule of programming to the present and also broadcast the 1920 presidential election returns just as KDKA did. Inventor Lee de Forest claims to have been present during 8MK&#x27;s earliest broadcasts, since the station was using a transmitter sold by his company.
* The first station to receive a commercial license was WBZ, then in Springfield, Massachusetts. Lists provided to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that WBZ received its commercial license on 15 September 1921; another Westinghouse station, WJZ, then in Newark, New Jersey, received its commercial license on November 7, the same day as KDKA did. What separates WJZ and WBZ from KDKA is the fact that neither of the former stations remain in their original city of license, whereas KDKA has remained in Pittsburgh for its entire existence.
* 2XG: Launched by Lee de Forest in the Highbridge section of New York City, that station began daily broadcasts in 1916. Like most experimental radio stations, however, it had to go off the air when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, and did not return to the air.
* 1XE: Launched by Harold J. Power in Medford, Massachusetts, 1XE was an experimental station that started broadcasting in 1917. It had to go off the air during World War I, but started up again after the war, and began regular voice and music broadcasts in 1919. However, the station did not receive its commercial license, becoming WGI, until 1922.
* WWV, the U.S. Government time service, which was believed to have started 6 months before KDKA in Washington, D.C. but in 1966 was transferred to Ft. Collins, Colorado.
* WRUC, the Wireless Radio Union College, located on Union College in Schenectady, New York; was launched as W2XQ 
* KQV, one of Pittsburgh&#x27;s five original AM stations, signed on as amateur station &quot;8ZAE&quot; on November 19, 1919, but did not receive a commercial license until January 9, 1922.

<doc id="25523" wikidata="Q39246" url="?curid=25523" title="Richard Feynman">
<text>Richard Phillips Feynman (; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, and in particle physics, for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga.

Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal &quot;Physics World&quot;, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to the wider public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with having pioneered the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot; and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;. Feynman also became known through his autobiographical books &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; and &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot;, and books written about him such as &quot;Tuva or Bust!&quot; by Ralph Leighton and the biography &quot;Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman&quot; by James Gleick.

== Early life ==
Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in New York City, to Lucille (; 1895–1981), a homemaker, and Melville Arthur Feynman (1890–1946), a sales manager. Feynman&#x27;s father was born into a Jewish family in Minsk, Russian Empire, and immigrated with his parents to the United States at the age of five. Feynman&#x27;s mother was born in the United States into a Jewish family. Lucille&#x27;s father had emigrated from Poland, and her mother also came from a family of Polish immigrants. She trained as a primary school teacher but married Melville in 1917, before taking up a profession. Feynman was a late talker and did not speak until after his third birthday. As an adult, he spoke with a New York accent strong enough to be perceived as an affectation or exaggeration, so much so that his friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a &quot;bum&quot;.

The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. This radio repairing was probably the first job Feynman had, and during this time he showed early signs of an aptitude for his later career in theoretical physics, when he would analyze the issues theoretically and arrive at the solutions. When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.

When Richard was five, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, Henry Phillips, who died at age four weeks. Four years later, Richard&#x27;s sister Joan was born and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though separated by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, and they both shared a curiosity about the world. Though their mother thought women lacked the capacity to understand such things, Richard encouraged Joan&#x27;s interest in astronomy, and Joan eventually became an astrophysicist.

===Religion===
Feynman&#x27;s parents were both from Jewish families, and his family went to the synagogue every Friday. However, by his youth, Feynman described himself as an &quot;avowed atheist&quot;. Many years later, in a letter to Tina Levitan, declining a request for information for her book on Jewish Nobel Prize winners, he stated, &quot;To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory&quot;, adding, &quot;at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way &#x27;the chosen people&#x27;&quot;.

Later in life, during a visit to the Jewish Theological Seminary, Feynman encountered the Talmud for the first time. He saw that it contained the original text in a little square on each page, and surrounding it were commentaries written over time by different people. In this way the Talmud had evolved, and everything that was discussed was carefully recorded. Despite being impressed, Feynman was disappointed with the lack of interest for nature and the outside world expressed by the rabbis, who cared about only those questions which arise from the Talmud.

== Education ==
Feynman attended Far Rockaway High School, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg. Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted to a higher math class. An IQ test administered in high school estimated his IQ at 125—high but &quot;merely respectable&quot;, according to biographer James Gleick. His sister Joan, who scored one point higher, later jokingly claimed to an interviewer that she was smarter. Years later he declined to join Mensa International, saying that his IQ was too low.

When Feynman was 15, he taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, infinite series, analytic geometry, and both differential and integral calculus. Before entering college, he was experimenting with mathematical topics such as the half-derivative using his own notation. He created special symbols for logarithm, sine, cosine and tangent functions so they did not look like three variables multiplied together, and for the derivative, to remove the temptation of canceling out the formula_1&#x27;s in formula_2. A member of the Arista Honor Society, in his last year in high school he won the New York University Math Championship. His habit of direct characterization sometimes rattled more conventional thinkers; for example, one of his questions, when learning feline anatomy, was &quot;Do you have a map of the cat?&quot; (referring to an anatomical chart).

Feynman applied to Columbia University but was not accepted because of its quota for the number of Jews admitted. Instead, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity. Although he originally majored in mathematics, he later switched to electrical engineering, as he considered mathematics to be too abstract. Noticing that he &quot;had gone too far&quot;, he then switched to physics, which he claimed was &quot;somewhere in between&quot;. As an undergraduate, he published two papers in the &quot;Physical Review&quot;. One of these, which was co-written with Manuel Vallarta, was entitled &quot;The Scattering of Cosmic Rays by the Stars of a Galaxy&quot;. 

The other was his senior thesis, on &quot;Forces in Molecules&quot;, based on a topic assigned by John C. Slater, who was sufficiently impressed by the paper to have it published. Its main result is known as the Hellmann–Feynman theorem.

In 1939, Feynman received a bachelor&#x27;s degree and was named a Putnam Fellow. He attained a perfect score on the graduate school entrance exams to Princeton University in physics—an unprecedented feat—and an outstanding score in mathematics, but did poorly on the history and English portions. The head of the physics department there, Henry D. Smyth, had another concern, writing to Philip M. Morse to ask: &quot;Is Feynman Jewish? We have no definite rule against Jews but have to keep their proportion in our department reasonably small because of the difficulty of placing them.&quot; Morse conceded that Feynman was indeed Jewish, but reassured Smyth that Feynman&#x27;s &quot;physiognomy and manner, however, show no trace of this characteristic&quot;.

Attendees at Feynman&#x27;s first seminar, which was on the classical version of the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to quantize, and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity in general relativity, which Sir Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar did much later as the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler. In his doctoral thesis entitled &quot;The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics&quot;, Feynman applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, and laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams. A key insight was that positrons behaved like electrons moving backwards in time. James Gleick wrote:
One of the conditions of Feynman&#x27;s scholarship to Princeton was that he could not be married; nevertheless, he continued to see his high school sweetheart, Arline Greenbaum, and was determined to marry her once he had been awarded his PhD despite the knowledge that she was seriously ill with tuberculosis. This was an incurable disease at the time, and she was not expected to live more than two years. On June 29, 1942, they took the ferry to Staten Island, where they were married in the city office. The ceremony was attended by neither family nor friends and was witnessed by a pair of strangers. Feynman could kiss Arline only on the cheek. After the ceremony he took her to Deborah Hospital, where he visited her on weekends.

== Manhattan Project ==

In 1941, with World War II occurring in Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman spent the summer working on ballistics problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of what would become the Manhattan Project. At the time, Feynman had not earned a graduate degree. Wilson&#x27;s team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, intended to electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson&#x27;s former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled to determine whether it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence&#x27;s recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.

At this juncture, in early 1943, Robert Oppenheimer was establishing the Los Alamos Laboratory, a secret laboratory on a mesa in New Mexico where atomic bombs would be designed and built. An offer was made to the Princeton team to be redeployed there. &quot;Like a bunch of professional soldiers,&quot; Wilson later recalled, &quot;we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos.&quot; Oppenheimer recruited many young physicists, including Feynman, who he telephoned long distance from Chicago to inform that he had found a Presbyterian sanatorium in Albuquerque, New Mexico for Arline. They were among the first to depart for New Mexico, leaving on a train on March 28, 1943. The railroad supplied Arline with a wheelchair, and Feynman paid extra for a private room for her. There they spent their wedding anniversary.

At Los Alamos, Feynman was assigned to Hans Bethe&#x27;s Theoretical (T) Division, and impressed Bethe enough to be made a group leader. He and Bethe developed the Bethe–Feynman formula for calculating the yield of a fission bomb, which built upon previous work by Robert Serber. As a junior physicist, he was not central to the project. He administered the computation group of human computers in the theoretical division. With Stanley Frankel and Nicholas Metropolis, he assisted in establishing a system for using IBM punched cards for computation. He invented a new method of computing logarithms that he later used on the Connection Machine. An avid drummer, Feynman figured out how to get the machine to click in musical rhythms. Other work at Los Alamos included calculating neutron equations for the Los Alamos &quot;Water Boiler&quot;, a small nuclear reactor, to measure how close an assembly of fissile material was to criticality.

On completing this work, Feynman was sent to the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Manhattan Project had its uranium enrichment facilities. He aided the engineers there in devising safety procedures for material storage so that criticality accidents could be avoided, especially when enriched uranium came into contact with water, which acted as a neutron moderator. He insisted on giving the rank and file a lecture on nuclear physics so that they would realize the dangers. He explained that while any amount of unenriched uranium could be safely stored, the enriched uranium had to be carefully handled. He developed a series of safety recommendations for the various grades of enrichments. He was told that if the people at Oak Ridge gave him any difficulty with his proposals, he was to inform them that Los Alamos &quot;could not be responsible for their safety otherwise&quot;.
Returning to Los Alamos, Feynman was put in charge of the group responsible for the theoretical work and calculations on the proposed uranium hydride bomb, which ultimately proved to be infeasible. He was sought out by physicist Niels Bohr for one-on-one discussions. He later discovered the reason: most of the other physicists were too much in awe of Bohr to argue with him. Feynman had no such inhibitions, vigorously pointing out anything he considered to be flawed in Bohr&#x27;s thinking. He said he felt as much respect for Bohr as anyone else, but once anyone got him talking about physics, he would become so focused he forgot about social niceties. Perhaps because of this, Bohr never warmed to Feynman.

At Los Alamos, which was isolated for security, Feynman amused himself by investigating the combination locks on the cabinets and desks of physicists. He often found that they left the lock combinations on the factory settings, wrote the combinations down, or used easily guessable combinations like dates. He found one cabinet&#x27;s combination by trying numbers he thought a physicist might use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, &quot;e&quot; = 2.71828 ...), and found that the three filing cabinets where a colleague kept research notes all had the same combination. He left notes in the cabinets as a prank, spooking his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy had gained access to them.

Feynman&#x27;s $380 () monthly salary was about half the amount needed for his modest living expenses and Arline&#x27;s medical bills, and they were forced to dip into her $3,300 () in savings. On weekends he borrowed a car from his friend Klaus Fuchs to drive to Albuquerque to see Arline. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs mentioned Feynman&#x27;s safe-cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque; Fuchs himself later confessed to spying for the Soviet Union. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman, particularly in view of Feynman&#x27;s Q clearance.
Informed that Arline was dying, Feynman drove to Albuquerque and sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He then immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder&#x27;s lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. The immense brightness of the explosion made him duck to the truck&#x27;s floor, where he saw a temporary &quot;purple splotch&quot; afterimage.

== Post Trinity and Cornell (1945-1949) ==
Feynman nominally held an appointment at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as an assistant professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan Project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, &quot;It&#x27;s great to be back at the only university that ever had the good sense to fire me.&quot;

As early as October 30, 1943, Bethe had written to the chairman of the physics department of his university, Cornell, to recommend that Feynman be hired. On February 28, 1944, this was endorsed by Robert Bacher, also from Cornell, and one of the most senior scientists at Los Alamos. This led to an offer being made in August 1944, which Feynman accepted. Oppenheimer had also hoped to recruit Feynman to the University of California, but the head of the physics department, Raymond T. Birge, was reluctant. He made Feynman an offer in May 1945, but Feynman turned it down. Cornell matched its salary offer of $3,900 () per annum. Feynman became one of the first of the Los Alamos Laboratory&#x27;s group leaders to depart, leaving for Ithaca, New York, in October 1945.

Because Feynman was no longer working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, he was no longer exempt from the draft. At his induction physical, Army psychiatrists diagnosed Feynman as suffering from a mental illness and the Army gave him a 4-F exemption on mental grounds. His father died suddenly on October 8, 1946, and Feynman suffered from depression. On October 17, 1946, he wrote a letter to Arline, expressing his deep love and heartbreak. The letter was sealed and only opened after his death. &quot;Please excuse my not mailing this,&quot; the letter concluded, &quot;but I don&#x27;t know your new address.&quot; Unable to focus on research problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and tried unsuccessfully to use them to formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and had turned his attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.
Feynman was not the only frustrated theoretical physicist in the early post-war years. Quantum electrodynamics suffered from infinite integrals in perturbation theory. These were clear mathematical flaws in the theory, which Feynman and Wheeler had tried, unsuccessfully, to work around. &quot;Theoreticians&quot;, noted Murray Gell-Mann, &quot;were in disgrace&quot;. In June 1947, leading American physicists met at the Shelter Island Conference. For Feynman, it was his &quot;first big conference with big men ... I had never gone to one like this one in peacetime.&quot; The problems plaguing quantum electrodynamics were discussed, but the theoreticians were completely overshadowed by the achievements of the experimentalists, who reported the discovery of the Lamb shift, the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron, and Robert Marshak&#x27;s two-meson hypothesis.

Bethe took the lead from the work of Hans Kramers, and derived a renormalized non-relativistic quantum equation for the Lamb shift. The next step was to create a relativistic version. Feynman thought that he could do this, but when he went back to Bethe with his solution, it did not converge. Feynman carefully worked through the problem again, applying the path integral formulation that he had used in his thesis. Like Bethe, he made the integral finite by applying a cut-off term. The result corresponded to Bethe&#x27;s version. Feynman presented his work to his peers at the Pocono Conference in 1948. It did not go well. Julian Schwinger gave a long presentation of his work in quantum electrodynamics, and Feynman then offered his version, entitled &quot;Alternative Formulation of Quantum Electrodynamics&quot;. The unfamiliar Feynman diagrams, used for the first time, puzzled the audience. Feynman failed to get his point across, and Paul Dirac, Edward Teller and Niels Bohr all raised objections.

To Freeman Dyson, one thing at least was clear: Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman understood what they were talking about even if no one else did, but had not published anything. He was convinced that Feynman&#x27;s formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman&#x27;s that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on &quot;A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics&quot; attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on &quot;The Theory of Positrons&quot; addressed the Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the &quot;Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction&quot; in 1950 and &quot;An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics&quot; in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.

While papers by others initially cited Schwinger, papers citing Feynman and employing Feynman diagrams appeared in 1950, and soon became prevalent. Students learned and used the powerful new tool that Feynman had created. Computer programs were later written to evaluate Feynman diagrams, enabling physicists to use quantum field theory to make high-precision predictions. Marc Kac adapted Feynman&#x27;s technique of summing over possible histories of a particle to the study of parabolic partial differential equations, yielding what is now known as the Feynman–Kac formula, the use of which extends beyond physics to many applications of stochastic processes. To Schwinger, however, the Feynman diagram was &quot;pedagogy, not physics&quot;.

Looking back on this period, Feynman would reflect fondly on his time at the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as &quot;a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains&quot;. He enjoyed the house&#x27;s convenience and said that &quot;it&#x27;s there that I did the fundamental work&quot; for which he won the Nobel Prize. 

However, Feynman was also reported to have been quite restless during his time at Cornell. By 1949, as the period was coming to a close, he had never settled into a particular house or apartment, moving instead between guest houses or student residences. While he did spend some time living with various married friends, these situations were reported to frequently end because the &quot;arrangements became sexually volatile&quot;. The renowned 31 year old was known to frequently pursue his married female friends, undergraduate girls and women, and to hire sex workers, which would sour many of his friendships. Additionally, Feynman was not fond of Ithaca&#x27;s cold winter weather or feeling as though he lived in the shadow of Hans Bethe while at Cornell.

== Brazil (1949–1952) ==
Feynman spent several weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949. That year, the Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb, generating concerns about espionage. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950 and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman&#x27;s loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950 and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. Because of the fears of a nuclear war, a girlfriend told Feynman that he should also consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951–1952, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas.
In Brazil, Feynman was impressed with &quot;samba&quot; music, and learned to play the , a metal percussion instrument based on a frying pan. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo and conga drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio with his friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to investigate Bohm&#x27;s ideas on physics.

== Caltech and later years (1952–1978) ==

=== Personal and political life ===
Feynman did not return to Cornell. Bacher, who had been instrumental in bringing Feynman to Cornell, had lured him to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Part of the deal was that he could spend his first year on sabbatical in Brazil. He had become smitten by Mary Louise Bell from Neodesha, Kansas. They had met in a cafeteria in Cornell, where she had studied the history of Mexican art and textiles. She later followed him to Caltech, where he gave a lecture. While he was in Brazil, she taught classes on the history of furniture and interiors at Michigan State University. He proposed to her by mail from Rio de Janeiro, and they married in Boise, Idaho, on June 28, 1952, shortly after he returned. They frequently quarreled and she was frightened by what she described as &quot;a violent temper&quot;. Their politics were different; although he registered and voted as a Republican, she was more conservative, and her opinion on the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing (&quot;Where there&#x27;s smoke there&#x27;s fire&quot;) offended him. They separated on May 20, 1956. An interlocutory decree of divorce was entered on June 19, 1956, on the grounds of &quot;extreme cruelty&quot;. The divorce became final on May 5, 1958.

In the wake of the 1957 Sputnik crisis, the U.S. government&#x27;s interest in science rose for a time. Feynman was considered for a seat on the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee, but was not appointed. At this time, the FBI interviewed a woman close to Feynman, possibly his ex-wife Bell, who sent a written statement to J. Edgar Hoover on August 8, 1958:

The U.S. government nevertheless sent Feynman to Geneva for the September 1958 Atoms for Peace Conference. On the beach at Lake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, West Yorkshire, and working in Switzerland as an &quot;au pair&quot;. Feynman&#x27;s love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, on the advice of an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and extorted him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 (equivalent to $202 in 2022) a week to be his live-in maid. Feynman knew that this sort of behavior was illegal under the Mann Act, so he had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that she already had two boyfriends, but decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men, but Feynman proposed in early 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman&#x27;s Nobel Prize.

=== Allegations of sexism ===
There were protests over his alleged sexism at Caltech in 1968, and again in 1972. Protesters &quot;objected to his use of sexist stories about &#x27;lady drivers&#x27; and clueless women in his lectures.&quot; Feynman recalled protesters entering a hall and picketing a lecture he was about to make in San Francisco, calling him a &quot;sexist pig&quot;. He later reflected on the incident claiming that it prompted him to address the protesters, saying that &quot;women do indeed suffer prejudice and discrimination in physics, and your presence here today serves to remind us of these difficulties and the need to remedy them&quot;. 

In his 1985 memoir, &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;, he recalled holding meetings in strip clubs, drawing naked portraits of his female students while lecturing at Caltech, and pretending to be an undergraduate to deceive younger women into sleeping with him. While he reflected on the attitude he had at the time as something he regretted, it lends credence to the claims of the protesters in 1968 and 1972 that his behavior was not just a personal flaw but something that impacted his professional life quite frequently.

=== Feynman diagram van ===
In 1975, in Long Beach, CA, Feynman bought a Dodge Tradesman Maxivan with a bronze-khaki exterior and yellow-green interior, with custom &quot;Feynman diagram&quot; exterior murals. After Feynman&#x27;s death, Gweneth sold the van for $1 to one of Feynman&#x27;s friends, film producer Ralph Leighton, who later put it into storage, where it began to rust. In 2012, video game designer Seamus Blackley, a father of the Xbox, bought the van. &quot;Qantum&quot; was the license plate ID.

=== Physics ===
At Caltech, Feynman investigated the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, where helium seems to display a complete lack of viscosity when flowing. Feynman provided a quantum-mechanical explanation for the Soviet physicist Lev Landau&#x27;s theory of superfluidity. Applying the Schrödinger equation to the question showed that the superfluid was displaying quantum mechanical behavior observable on a macroscopic scale. This helped with the problem of superconductivity, but the solution eluded Feynman. It was solved with the BCS theory of superconductivity, proposed by John Bardeen, Leon Neil Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer in 1957.
Feynman, inspired by a desire to quantize the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laid the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams.

With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman developed a model of weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process is a combination of vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an antineutrino). Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman&#x27;s collaboration with Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.

Feynman attempted an explanation, called the parton model, of the strong interactions governing nucleon scattering. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman&#x27;s partons derisively as &quot;put-ons&quot;. In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles; the statistics of the omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real.

The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman&#x27;s parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data in a way that did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.

After the success of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum gravity. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he investigated the consequences of a free massless spin 2 field and derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, &quot;ghosts&quot;, which are &quot;particles&quot; in the interior of his diagrams that have the &quot;wrong&quot; connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the quantum particle behavior of the Yang–Mills theories, for example, quantum chromodynamics and the electro-weak theory. He did work on all four of the fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetic, the weak force, the strong force and gravity. John and Mary Gribbin state in their book on Feynman that &quot;Nobody else has made such influential contributions to the investigation of all four of the interactions&quot;.

Partly as a way to bring publicity to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman.

Feynman was also interested in the relationship between physics and computation. He was also one of the first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In the 1980s he began to spend his summers working at Thinking Machines Corporation, helping to build some of the first parallel supercomputers and considering the construction of quantum computers.

Between 1984 and 1986, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational perturbation theory) and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments. At Caltech, he once chalked &quot;What I cannot create I do not understand&quot; on his blackboard.

===Machine technology===
Feynman had studied the ideas of John von Neumann while researching quantum field theory. His most famous lecture on the subject was delivered in 1959 at the California Institute of Technology, published under the title &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot; a year later. In this lecture he theorized on future opportunities for designing miniaturized machines, which could build smaller reproductions of themselves. This lecture is frequently cited in technical literature on microtechnology, and nanotechnology.

=== Pedagogy ===

In the early 1960s, Feynman acceded to a request to &quot;spruce up&quot; the teaching of undergraduates at the California Institute of Technology, also called Caltech. After three years devoted to the task, he produced a series of lectures that later became &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;. Accounts vary about how successful the original lectures were. Feynman&#x27;s own preface, written just after an exam on which the students did poorly, was somewhat pessimistic. His colleagues David L. Goodstein and Gerry Neugebauer said later that the intended audience of first-year students found the material intimidating while older students and faculty found it inspirational, so the lecture hall remained full even as the first-year students dropped away. In contrast, physicist Matthew Sands recalled the student attendance as being typical for a large lecture course.

Converting the lectures into books occupied Matthew Sands and Robert B. Leighton as part-time co-authors for several years. Feynman suggested that the book cover should have a picture of a drum with mathematical diagrams about vibrations drawn upon it, in order to illustrate the application of mathematics to understanding the world. Instead, the publishers gave the books plain red covers, though they included a picture of Feynman playing drums in the foreword. Even though the books were not adopted by universities as textbooks, they continue to sell well because they provide a deep understanding of physics.

Many of Feynman&#x27;s lectures and miscellaneous talks were turned into other books, including &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Statistical Mechanics&quot;, &quot;Lectures on Gravitation&quot;, and the &quot;Feynman Lectures on Computation&quot;.

Feynman wrote about his experiences teaching physics undergraduates in Brazil. The students&#x27; studying habits and the Portuguese language textbooks were so devoid of any context or applications for their information that, in Feynman&#x27;s opinion, the students were not learning physics at all. At the end of the year, Feynman was invited to give a lecture on his teaching experiences, and he agreed to do so, provided he could speak frankly, which he did.

Feynman opposed rote learning, or unthinking memorization, as well as other teaching methods that emphasized form over function. In his mind, &quot;clear thinking&quot; and &quot;clear presentation&quot; were fundamental prerequisites for his attention. It could be perilous even to approach him unprepared, and he did not forget fools and pretenders.

In 1964, he served on the California State Curriculum Commission, which was responsible for approving textbooks to be used by schools in California. He was not impressed with what he found. Many of the mathematics texts covered subjects of use only to pure mathematicians as part of the &quot;New Math&quot;. Elementary students were taught about sets, but: 

In April 1966, Feynman delivered an address to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate &quot;ab initio&quot;, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.

In 1974, Feynman delivered the Caltech commencement address on the topic of &quot;cargo cult science&quot;, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience due to a lack of &quot;a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty&quot; on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that &quot;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you&#x27;ve not fooled yourself, it&#x27;s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.&quot;

Feynman served as doctoral advisor to 30 students.

=== Case before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ===
In 1977, Feynman supported his English literature colleague Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech&#x27;s first female professor in 1969, and filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after she was refused tenure in 1974. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that La Belle had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman&#x27;s colleagues were surprised that he took her side, but he had gotten to know La Belle and liked and admired her.

=== &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; ===
In the 1960s, Feynman began thinking of writing an autobiography, and he began granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton&#x27;s son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Ralph transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; and became a best-seller.

Gell-Mann was upset by Feynman&#x27;s account in the book of the weak interaction work, and threatened to sue, resulting in a correction being inserted in later editions. This incident was just the latest provocation in decades of bad feeling between the two scientists. Gell-Mann often expressed frustration at the attention Feynman received; he remarked: was a great scientist, but he spent a great deal of his effort generating anecdotes about himself.&quot;

Feynman has been criticized for a chapter in the book entitled &quot;You Just &quot;Ask&quot; Them?&quot;, where he describes how he learned to seduce women at a bar he went to in the summer of 1946. A mentor taught him to ask a woman if she would sleep with him before buying her anything. He describes seeing women at the bar as &quot;bitches&quot; in his thoughts, and tells a story of how he told a woman named Ann that she was &quot;worse than a whore&quot; after Ann persuaded him to buy her sandwiches by telling him he could eat them at her place, but then, after he bought them, saying they actually could not eat together because another man was coming over. Later on that same evening, Ann returned to the bar to take Feynman to her place. Feynman states at the end of the chapter that this behaviour was not typical of him: &quot;So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn&#x27;t enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.&quot;

=== &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster ===

Feynman played an important role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. He had been reluctant to participate, but was persuaded by advice from his wife. Feynman clashed several times with commission chairman William P. Rogers. During a break in one hearing, Rogers told commission member Neil Armstrong, &quot;Feynman is becoming a pain in the ass.&quot;

During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle&#x27;s O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.

Feynman devoted the latter half of his 1988 book &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot; to his experience on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman&#x27;s account reveals a disconnect between NASA&#x27;s engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA&#x27;s high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 probability of a catastrophic failure aboard the Shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA&#x27;s own engineers estimated the probability of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management&#x27;s estimate of the reliability of the Space Shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission&#x27;s report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), &quot;For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.&quot;

=== Recognition and awards ===
The first public recognition of Feynman&#x27;s work came in 1954, when Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) notified him that he had won the Albert Einstein Award, which was worth $15,000 and came with a gold medal. Because of Strauss&#x27;s actions in stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance, Feynman was reluctant to accept the award, but Isidor Isaac Rabi cautioned him: &quot;You should never turn a man&#x27;s generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, even if he has many vices, should not be used as a tool against him.&quot; It was followed by the AEC&#x27;s Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1962. Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles&quot;. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1965, received the Oersted Medal in 1972, and the National Medal of Science in 1979. He was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, but ultimately resigned and is no longer listed by them.

== Death ==
In 1978, Feynman sought medical treatment for abdominal pains and was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer. Surgeons removed a &quot;very large&quot; tumor that had crushed one kidney and his spleen. In 1986 doctors discovered another cancer, Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Further operations were performed in October 1986 and October 1987. He was again hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center on February 3, 1988. A ruptured duodenal ulcer caused kidney failure, and he declined to undergo the dialysis that might have prolonged his life for a few months. Feynman&#x27;s wife Gweneth, sister Joan, and cousin Frances Lewine watched over him during the final days of his life until he died on February 15, 1988.

When Feynman was nearing death, he asked his friend and colleague Danny Hillis why Hillis appeared so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Hillis quotes Feynman as replying:
Near the end of his life, Feynman attempted to visit the Tuvan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) in the Soviet Union, a dream thwarted by Cold War bureaucratic issues. The letter from the Soviet government authorizing the trip was not received until the day after he died. His daughter Michelle later made the journey. Ralph Leighton chronicled the attempt in &quot;Tuva or Bust!&quot;, published in 1991.

His burial was at Mountain View Cemetery and Mausoleum in Altadena, California. His last words were: &quot;I&#x27;d hate to die twice. It&#x27;s so boring.&quot;

== Popular legacy ==
Aspects of Feynman&#x27;s life have been portrayed in various media. Feynman was portrayed by Matthew Broderick in the 1996 biopic &quot;Infinity&quot;. Actor Alan Alda commissioned playwright Peter Parnell to write a two-character play about a fictional day in the life of Feynman set two years before Feynman&#x27;s death. The play, &quot;QED&quot;, premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 2001 and was later presented at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Broadway, with both presentations starring Alda as Richard Feynman. Real Time Opera premiered its opera &quot;Feynman&quot; at the Norfolk (Connecticut) Chamber Music Festival in June 2005. In 2011, Feynman was the subject of a biographical graphic novel entitled simply &quot;Feynman&quot;, written by Jim Ottaviani and illustrated by Leland Myrick. In 2013, Feynman&#x27;s role on the Rogers Commission was dramatised by the BBC in &quot;The Challenger&quot; (US title: &quot;The Challenger Disaster&quot;), with William Hurt playing Feynman. In 2016, Oscar Isaac performed a public reading of Feynman&#x27;s 1946 love letter to the late Arline. In the 2023 American film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, directed by Christopher Nolan and based on &quot;American Prometheus&quot;, Feynman is portrayed by actor Jack Quaid.

Feynman is commemorated in various ways. On May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;American Scientists&quot; commemorative set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations. The scientists depicted were Richard Feynman, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Josiah Willard Gibbs. Feynman&#x27;s stamp, sepia-toned, features a photograph of Feynman in his thirties and eight small Feynman diagrams. The stamps were designed by Victor Stabin under the artistic direction of Carl T. Herrman. The main building for the Computing Division at Fermilab is named the &quot;Feynman Computing Center&quot; in his honor. Two photographs of Feynman were used in Apple Computer&#x27;s &quot;Think Different&quot; advertising campaign, which launched in 1997. Sheldon Cooper, a fictional theoretical physicist from the television series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, was depicted as a Feynman fan, even emulating him by playing the bongo drums. On January 27, 2016, co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates wrote an article describing Feynman&#x27;s talents as a teacher (&quot;The Best Teacher I Never Had&quot;), which inspired Gates to create Project Tuva to place the videos of Feynman&#x27;s Messenger Lectures, &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, on a website for public viewing. In 2015 Gates made a video in response to Caltech&#x27;s request for thoughts on Feynman for the 50th anniversary of Feynman&#x27;s 1965 Nobel Prize, on why he thought Feynman was special. At CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research, home of the Large Hadron Collider), a street on the Meyrin site is named &quot;Route Feynman&quot;.

=== Textbooks and lecture notes ===

&quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; is perhaps his most accessible work for anyone with an interest in physics, compiled from lectures to Caltech undergraduates in 1961–1964. As news of the lectures&#x27; lucidity grew, professional physicists and graduate students began to drop in to listen. Co-authors Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, colleagues of Feynman, edited and illustrated them into book form. The work has endured and is useful to this day. They were edited and supplemented in 2005 with &quot;Feynman&#x27;s Tips on Physics: A Problem-Solving Supplement to the Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; by Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton&#x27;s son), with support from Kip Thorne and other physicists.
* Includes &quot;Feynman&#x27;s Tips on Physics&quot; (with Michael Gottlieb and Ralph Leighton), which includes four previously unreleased lectures on problem solving, exercises by Robert Leighton and Rochus Vogt, and a historical essay by Matthew Sands.

<text>Research is creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge. It involves the collection, organization, and analysis of evidence to increase understanding of a topic, characterized by a particular attentiveness to controlling sources of bias and error. These activities are characterized by accounting and controlling for biases. A research project may be an expansion of past work in the field. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.

The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&amp;D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.

A researcher is a person who conducts research, especially in order to discover new information or to reach a new understanding. In order to be a social researcher or a social scientist, one should have enormous knowledge of subjects related to social science that they are specialized in. Similarly, in order to be a natural science researcher, the person should have knowledge of fields related to natural science (physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, zoology and so on). Professional associations provide one pathway to mature in the research profession.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;research&quot; is derived from the Middle French &quot;recherche&quot;, which means &quot;to go about seeking&quot;, the term itself being derived from the Old French term &quot;recerchier,&quot; a compound word from &quot;re-&quot; + &quot;cerchier&quot;, or &quot;sercher&quot;, meaning &#x27;search&#x27;. The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.

== Definitions ==
Research has been defined in a number of different ways, and while there are similarities, there does not appear to be a single, all-encompassing definition that is embraced by all who engage in it.

Research, in its simplest terms, is searching for knowledge and searching for truth. In a formal sense, it is a systematic study of a problem attacked by a deliberately chosen strategy, which starts with choosing an approach to preparing a blueprint (design) and acting upon it in terms of designing research hypotheses, choosing methods and techniques, selecting or developing data collection tools, processing the data, interpretation, and ending with presenting solution(s) of the problem.

Another definition of research is given by John W. Creswell, who states that &quot;research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue&quot;. It consists of three steps: pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.

The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research more generally to also include studying already existing knowledge: &quot;studious inquiry or examination; &quot;especially&quot;: investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws&quot;.

Original research, also called primary research, is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review, or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a primary-source character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new knowledge rather than present the existing knowledge in a new form (e.g., summarized or classified). Original research can take various forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In experimental work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject(s), e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In analytical work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the researcher.

The degree of originality of the research is among the major criteria for articles to be published in academic journals and usually established by means of peer review. Graduate students are commonly required to perform original research as part of a dissertation.

=== Scientific research ===

Scientific research is a systematic way of gathering data and harnessing curiosity. This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research may be funded by public authorities, charitable organizations, and private organizations. Scientific research can be subdivided by discipline.

Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural process. Though the order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# Observations and formation of the topic: Consists of the subject area of one&#x27;s interest and following that subject area to conduct subject-related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# Hypothesis: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# Conceptual definition: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# Operational definition: Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# Gathering of data: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# Analysis of data: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
# Data Interpretation: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words.
# Test, revising of hypothesis
# Conclusion, reiteration if necessary

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, null hypothesis). Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment. If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see falsifiability). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.

A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables.

=== Research in the humanities ===
Research in the humanities involves different methods such as for example hermeneutics and semiotics. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in historical method. Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past. Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these. These studies may be qualitative or quantitative, and can use a variety of approaches, such as queer theory or feminist theory.

=== Artistic research ===
Artistic research, also seen as &#x27;practice-based research&#x27;, can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines. One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the social sciences in using qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.

Artistic research has been defined by the School of Dance and Circus (Dans och Cirkushögskolan, DOCH), Stockholm in the following manner – &quot;Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context.&quot; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts. A simpler understanding by Julian Klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception. For a survey of the central problematics of today&#x27;s artistic research, see Giaco Schiesser.

According to artist Hakan Topal, in artistic research, &quot;perhaps more so than other disciplines, intuition is utilized as a method to identify a wide range of new and unexpected productive modalities&quot;. Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction books, also have to do research to support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.

The Society for Artistic Research (SAR) publishes the triannual &quot;Journal for Artistic Research&quot; (&quot;JAR&quot;), an international, online, open access, and peer-reviewed journal for the identification, publication, and dissemination of artistic research and its methodologies, from all arts disciplines and it runs the &quot;Research Catalogue&quot; (RC), a searchable, documentary database of artistic research, to which anyone can contribute.

Patricia Leavy addresses eight arts-based research (ABR) genres: narrative inquiry, fiction-based research, poetry, music, dance, theatre, film, and visual art.

In 2016, the European League of Institutes of the Arts launched &quot;The Florence Principles&#x27; on the Doctorate in the Arts&quot;. The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of the European University Association name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / PhD in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / PhD. The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC, CILECT, CUMULUS and SAR.

=== Historical research ===
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use historical sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:
* Identification of origin date
* Evidence of localization
* Recognition of authorship
* Analysis of data
* Identification of integrity
* Attribution of credibility

===Documentary research===
== Steps in conducting research ==
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research. The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:
* Identification of research problem
* Literature review
* Specifying the purpose of research
* Determining specific research questions
* Specification of a conceptual framework, sometimes including a set of hypotheses
* Choice of a methodology (for data collection)
* Data collection
* Verifying data
* Analyzing and interpreting the data
* Reporting and evaluating research
* Communicating the research findings and, possibly, recommendations

The steps generally represent the overall process; however, they should be viewed as an ever-changing iterative process rather than a fixed set of steps. Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study. The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified. A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question. The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested. The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as empirical research. The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated. At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for further research. However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving &quot;up&quot; to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review. The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted.

Rudolph Rummel says, &quot;... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results.&quot;

Plato in Meno talks about an inherent difficulty, if not a paradox, of doing research that can be paraphrased in the following way, &quot;If you know what you&#x27;re searching for, why do you search for it?! [i.e., you have already found it] If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re searching for, what are you searching for?!&quot;

== Research methods ==

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* Exploratory research, which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* Constructive research, which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* Empirical research, which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence.
There are two major types of empirical research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:

;Qualitative research

Qualitative research refers to much more subjective non-quantitative, use different methods of collecting data, analyzing data, interpreting data for meanings, definitions, characteristics, symbols metaphors of things. Qualitative research further classified into the following types: Ethnography: This research mainly focus on culture of group of people which includes share attributes, language, practices, structure, value, norms and material things, evaluate human lifestyle. Ethno: people, Grapho: to write, this disciple may include ethnic groups, ethno genesis, composition, resettlement and social welfare characteristics. Phenomenology: It is very powerful strategy for demonstrating methodology to health professions education as well as best suited for exploring challenging problems in health professions educations. In addition, PMP researcher Mandy Sha argued that a project management approach is necessary to control the scope, schedule, and cost related to qualitative research design, participant recruitment, data collection, reporting, as well as stakeholder engagement.

;Quantitative research
:This involves systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships, by asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze it utilizing statistical methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive). Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables. Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of positivism.

The quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories. These methods produce results that can be summarized, compared, and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies. Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.

If the research question is about people, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment). If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.

In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data. Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires. Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research. It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.

Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common. This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer. For example, a researcher may choose to conduct a qualitative study and follow it up with a quantitative study to gain additional insights.

Big data has brought big impacts on research methods so that now many researchers do not put much effort into data collection; furthermore, methods to analyze easily available huge amounts of data have also been developed.
Types of Research Method
1. Observatory Research Method
2. Correlation Research Method 

;Non-empirical research
Non-empirical (theoretical) research is an approach that involves the development of theory as opposed to using observation and experimentation. As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source. This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge. Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach. Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science. Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on. See Scientific method.

A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge. Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature. Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects.

== Problems in research ==

=== Meta-research ===

Meta-research is the study of research through the use of research methods. Also known as &quot;research on research&quot;, it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields. Meta-research concerns itself with the detection of bias, methodological flaws, and other errors and inefficiencies. Among the finding of meta-research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields. This widespread difficulty in reproducing research has been termed the &quot;replication crisis.&quot;

=== Methods of research ===
In many disciplines, Western methods of conducting research are predominant. Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study. The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally sensitive methods of data collection. Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies. For example, &quot;Hua Oranga&quot; was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in Māori populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – &quot;taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)&quot;.

=== Bias ===
Research is often biased in the languages that are preferred (linguicism) and the geographic locations where research occurs.
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication. As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals. Multilingual scholars&#x27; influences from their native communicative styles can be assumed to be incompetence instead of difference.

For comparative politics, Western countries are over-represented in single-country studies, with heavy emphasis on Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Since 2000, Latin American countries have become more popular in single-country studies. In contrast, countries in Oceania and the Caribbean are the focus of very few studies. Patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism: countries whose official languages are French or Arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single-country studies than countries with different official languages. Within Africa, English-speaking countries are more represented than other countries.

===Generalizability===

Generalization is the process of more broadly applying the valid results of one study. Studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability, meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions. In comparative politics, this can result from using a single-country study, rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries. Despite the issue of generalizability, single-country studies have risen in prevalence since the late 2000s.

=== Publication peer review ===

Peer review is a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field. Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility. In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper&#x27;s suitability for publication. Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge. The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review. It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry. These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars&#x27; research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide.

=== Influence of the open-access movement ===
The open access movement assumes that all information generally deemed useful should be free and belongs to a &quot;public domain&quot;, that of &quot;humanity&quot;. This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation. For instance, most indigenous communities consider that access to certain information proper to the group should be determined by relationships.

There is alleged to be a double standard in the Western knowledge system. On the one hand, &quot;digital right management&quot; used to restrict access to personal information on social networking platforms is celebrated as a protection of privacy, while simultaneously when similar functions are used by cultural groups (i.e. indigenous communities) this is denounced as &quot;access control&quot; and reprehended as censorship.

=== Future perspectives ===
Even though Western dominance seems to be prominent in research, some scholars, such as Simon Marginson, argue for &quot;the need [for] a plural university world&quot;. Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.

This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West. Focused on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion. In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research.

=== Neo-colonial approaches ===
== Professionalisation ==

In several national and private academic systems, the professionalisation of research has resulted in formal job titles.

=== In Russia ===
In present-day Russia, and some other countries of the former Soviet Union, the term &quot;researcher&quot; (, &quot;nauchny sotrudnik&quot;) has been used both as a generic term for a person who has been carrying out scientific research, and as a job position within the frameworks of the Academy of Sciences, universities, and in other research-oriented establishments.

The following ranks are known:
* Junior Researcher (Junior Research Associate)
* Researcher (Research Associate)
* Senior Researcher (Senior Research Associate)
* Leading Researcher (Leading Research Associate)
* Chief Researcher (Chief Research Associate)

== Publishing ==

Academic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine.
Most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently. It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access. There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and self-archiving, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.

== Research statistics and funding ==

Most funding for scientific research comes from three major sources: corporate research and development departments; private foundations; and government research councils such as the National Institutes of Health in the US and the Medical Research Council in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research but also as a source of merit. The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.

The total number of researchers (full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants for individual countries is shown in the following table.
Research expenditure by type of research as a share of GDP for individual countries is shown in the following table.

<doc id="25525" wikidata="Q9191" url="?curid=25525" title="René Descartes">
<text>René Descartes ( , ; ; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician, widely considered a seminal figure in the emergence of modern philosophy and science. Mathematics was paramount to his method of inquiry, and he connected the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra into analytic geometry. Descartes spent much of his working life in the Dutch Republic, initially serving the Dutch States Army, and later becoming a central intellectual of the Dutch Golden Age. Although he served a Protestant state and was later counted as a deist by critics, Descartes was Roman Catholic.

Many elements of Descartes&#x27;s philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy, he differed from the schools on two major points. First, he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to final ends, divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena. In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God&#x27;s act of creation. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the &quot;Passions of the Soul&quot;, an early modern treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic &quot;as if no one had written on these matters before.&quot; His best known philosophical statement is &quot;&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;; ), found in &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; (1637, in French and Latin, 1644) and &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644, in Latin, 1647 in French). The statement has either been interpreted as a logical syllogism or as an intuitive thought.

Descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century. He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz, and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. The rise of early modern rationalism—as a systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history—exerted an influence on modern Western thought in general, with the birth of two rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes (Cartesianism) and Spinoza (Spinozism). It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz who have given the &quot;Age of Reason&quot; its name and place in history. Leibniz, Spinoza, and Descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, with Descartes and Leibniz additionally contributing to a variety of scientific disciplines. Although only Leibniz is extensively recognized as a polymath, all three rationalists integrated disparate domains of knowledge into their respective works.

Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes&#x27;s influence in mathematics is equally apparent, being the namesake of the Cartesian coordinate system. He is credited as the father of analytic geometry—used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution.

==Life ==

===Early life===
René Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine, Province of Touraine (now Descartes, Indre-et-Loire), France, on 31 March 1596. In May 1597, his mother Jeanne Brochard, died a few days after giving birth to a still-born child. Descartes&#x27;s father, Joachim, was a member of the Parlement of Rennes at Rennes. René lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots. In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Flèche, where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo&#x27;s work. While there, Descartes first encountered hermetic mysticism. After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615–16) at the University of Poitiers, earning a &quot;Baccalauréat&quot; and &quot;Licence&quot; in canon and civil law in 1616, in accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes that he should become a lawyer. From there, he moved to Paris.
In &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, Descartes recalls:
I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it.

=== Army service ===

In accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618, Descartes joined, as a mercenary, the Protestant Dutch States Army in Breda under the command of Maurice of Nassau, and undertook a formal study of military engineering, as established by Simon Stevin. Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics. In this way, he became acquainted with Isaac Beeckman, the principal of a Dordrecht school, for whom he wrote the &quot;Compendium of Music&quot; (written 1618, published 1650).

While in the service of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria from 1619, Descartes was present at the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague, in November 1620.

According to Adrien Baillet, on the night of 10–11 November 1619 (St. Martin&#x27;s Day), while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau, Descartes shut himself in a room with an &quot;oven&quot; (probably a cocklestove) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams, and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is speculated that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome. Upon exiting, he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life&#x27;s work. Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another, so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes arrived at this basic truth quite soon: his famous &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;

=== Career ===
==== France ====
In 1620, Descartes left the army. He visited Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years, he spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: &quot;Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii&quot; (&quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;). He arrived in La Haye in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in bonds, which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life. Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in 1627 as an observer. There, he was interested in the physical properties of the great dike that Richelieu was building and studied mathematically everything he saw during the siege. He also met French mathematician Girard Desargues. In the autumn of that year, in the residence of the papal nuncio Guidi di Bagno, where he came with Mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist, Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux, on the principles of a supposed new philosophy, Cardinal Bérulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the Inquisition.

==== Netherlands ====
Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628. In April 1629, he joined the University of Franeker, studying under Adriaan Metius, either living with a Catholic family or renting the Sjaerdemaslot. The next year, under the name &quot;Poitevin&quot;, he enrolled at Leiden University, which at the time was a Protestant University. He studied both mathematics with Jacobus Golius, who confronted him with Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem, and astronomy with Martin Hortensius. In October 1630, he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, Francine, who was born in 1635 in Deventer. She was baptized a Protestant and died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.

Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francine&#x27;s death in 1640. According to a recent biography by Jason Porterfield, &quot;Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man.&quot; Russell Shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes&#x27;s work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.

Despite frequent moves, he wrote all of his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy. In 1633, Galileo was condemned by the Italian Inquisition, and Descartes abandoned plans to publish &quot;Treatise on the World&quot;, his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637, he published parts of this work in three essays: &quot;Les Météores&quot; (The Meteors), &quot;La Dioptrique&quot; (Dioptrics) and &quot;La Géométrie&quot; (&quot;Geometry&quot;), preceded by an introduction, his famous &quot;Discours de la méthode&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;). In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation:

In &quot;La Géométrie&quot;, Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with Pierre de Fermat. This later became known as Cartesian Geometry.

 Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641, he published a metaphysics treatise, &quot;Meditationes de Prima Philosophia&quot; (&quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by &quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot; (&quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot;), a kind of synthesis of the &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; and &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, settling in Egmond-Binnen.

Between 1643 and 1649 Descartes lived with his girlfriend at Egmond-Binnen in an inn. Descartes became friendly with Anthony Studler van Zurck, lord of Bergen and participated in the design of his mansion and estate. He also met Dirck Rembrantsz van Nierop, a mathematician and surveyor. He was so impressed by Van Nierop&#x27;s knowledge that he even brought him to the attention of Constantijn Huygens and Frans van Schooten.

Christia Mercer suggested that Descartes may have been influenced by Spanish author and Roman Catholic nun Teresa of Ávila, who, fifty years earlier, published &quot;The Interior Castle&quot;, concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth.

Descartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a six-year correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published &quot;Les Passions de l&#x27;âme&quot; (&quot;The Passions of the Soul&quot;), which he dedicated to the Princess. A French translation of &quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot;, prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In the preface to the French edition, Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.

====Sweden====
By 1649, Descartes had become one of Europe&#x27;s most famous philosophers and scientists. That year, Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. Descartes accepted, and moved to the Swedish Empire in the middle of winter. Christina was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish &quot;The Passions of the Soul&quot;.

He was a guest at the house of Pierre Chanut, living on Västerlånggatan, less than 500 meters from Castle Tre Kronor in Stockholm. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian mercury barometer. Challenging Blaise Pascal, Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather.

=== Death ===
Descartes arranged to give lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week at 5 am, in her cold and draughty castle. However, by 15 January 1650 the Queen had actually met with Descartes only four or five times. It soon became clear they did not like each other; she did not care for his mechanical philosophy, nor did he share her interest in Ancient Greek language and literature. On 1 February 1650, he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 February at Chanut.

The cause of death was pneumonia according to Chanut, but peripneumonia according to Christina&#x27;s physician Johann van Wullen who was not allowed to bleed him. (The winter seems to have been mild, except for the second half of January which was harsh as described by Descartes himself; however, &quot;this remark was probably intended to be as much Descartes&#x27;s take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather.&quot;)

E. Pies has questioned this account, based on a letter by the Doctor van Wullen; however, Descartes had refused his treatment, and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since. In a 2009 book, German philosopher Theodor Ebert argues that Descartes was poisoned by Jacques Viogué, a Catholic missionary who opposed his religious views. As evidence, Ebert suggests that Catherine Descartes, the niece of René Descartes, made a veiled reference to the act of poisoning when her uncle was administered &quot;communion&quot; two days before his death, in her &quot;Report on the Death of M. Descartes, the Philosopher&quot; (1693).
His last words were reported to have been:
As a Catholic in a Protestant nation, he was interred in the churchyard of what was to become Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm, where mainly orphans had been buried. His manuscripts came into the possession of Claude Clerselier, Chanut&#x27;s brother-in-law, and &quot;a devout Catholic who has begun the process of turning Descartes into a saint by cutting, adding and publishing his letters selectively.&quot; In 1663, the Pope placed Descartes&#x27;s works on the &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot;. In 1666, sixteen years after his death, his remains were taken to France and buried in Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. In 1671, Louis XIV prohibited all lectures in Cartesianism. Although the National Convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the Panthéon, he was reburied in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 1819, missing a finger and the skull. His alleged skull is in the Musée de l&#x27;Homme in Paris, but some 2020 researches confirm that it may be a forgery. The original skull was probably divided into pieces in Sweden and given to private collectors; one of those pieces arrived at the University of Lund in 1691, where it is still preserved.

==Philosophical work==

In his &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or Cartesian doubt: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge. Descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in &quot;The Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle&#x27;s foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: he thinks. This is expressed in the Latin phrase in &quot;the Discourse on Method&quot; &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; (English: &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;). Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. &quot;The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.&quot; These two first principles—I think and I exist—were later confirmed by Descartes&#x27;s clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation from &quot;The Meditations&quot;): as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a &quot;thinking thing&quot;. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines &quot;thought&quot; (&quot;cogitatio&quot;) as &quot;what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it&quot;. Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious. He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams, and that one&#x27;s mind cannot have been &quot;hijacked&quot; by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before one&#x27;s senses.

In this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding perception as unreliable and, instead, admitting only deduction as a method.

===Mind–body dualism===

Descartes, influenced by the automatons on display at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, investigated the connection between mind and body, and how they interact. His main influences for dualism were theology and physics. The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes&#x27;s signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as Cartesian dualism (or mind–body dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies. In &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body; thus Descartes&#x27;s dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of &quot;modes&quot;, which are the ways in which substances exist. In &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot;, Descartes explained, &quot;we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance&quot;. To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction, which Descartes explained as follows:

The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.
According to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus, Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another. He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. According to Descartes&#x27;s indivisibility argument, the mind is utterly indivisible: because &quot;when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.&quot;

Moreover, in The &quot;Meditations&quot;, Descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances—the mind or soul defined as thinking, and the body defined as matter and unthinking. The Aristotelian philosophy of Descartes&#x27;s day held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree, was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the &quot;final cause&quot;, and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes&#x27;s theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of Kepler and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and &quot;final causes&quot; in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes&#x27;s dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or &quot;res extensa&quot;) in favor of the mind (or &quot;res cogitans&quot;). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics, it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul.

Descartes&#x27;s dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was, according to Descartes, a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In The &quot;Meditations&quot;, Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of &quot;accidents&quot;. But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:

Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.
Descartes&#x27;s discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person? Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind–body problem for many years after Descartes&#x27;s death. Descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas. Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), an empiricist. Empiricism holds that all knowledge is acquired through experience.

===Physiology and psychology===
In &quot;The Passions of the Soul&quot;, published in 1649, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector. Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God&#x27;s will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events, which influenced 19th-century reflex theory. He argued that external motions, such as touch and sound, reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. For example, heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn, animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire. Through this chain of reactions, the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.

Above all, he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine, thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes&#x27;s writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed the brain resembled a working machine and that mathematics, and mechanics could explain complicated processes in it. In the 20th century, Alan Turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories, more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist Ivan Pavlov was a great admirer of Descartes.

=== On animals ===
Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence. He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically. Whereas humans had a soul, or mind, and were able to feel pain and anxiety, animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage, but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent. Although Descartes&#x27;s views were not universally accepted, they became prominent in Europe and North America, allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals, and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century. The publications of Charles Darwin would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals. Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species suggested the possibility of animal suffering.

=== Moral philosophy ===
For Descartes, ethics was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics. In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind–body dualism, and defends free will. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that individuals should seek, and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide their actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge and mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, and as a result wrote his work &quot;The Passions of the Soul&quot;, that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions. His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see Cartesianism), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.

Descartes and Zeno both identified sovereign goods with virtue. For Epicurus, the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno&#x27;s teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding Aristotle&#x27;s opinion that happiness (eudaimonia) depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth, Descartes does not deny that fortunes contributes to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one&#x27;s own control, whereas one&#x27;s mind is under one&#x27;s complete control. The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. Those maxims are known as his &quot;Provisional Morals&quot;.

=== Religion ===

In the third and fifth &quot;Meditation&quot;, Descartes offers proofs of a benevolent God (the trademark argument and the ontological argument respectively). Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, since he believed that God provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception. Regarding epistemology, therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, however, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.

Descartes invokes his causal adequacy principle to support his trademark argument for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: &quot;Ex nihilo nihil fit&quot;, meaning &quot;Nothing comes from nothing&quot; (Lucretius). &quot;Oxford Reference&quot; summarises the argument, as follows, &quot;that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin (God), just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker.&quot; In the fifth Meditation, Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the &quot;idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,&quot; and suggests that &quot;of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.&quot;

Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic, and one of the purposes of the &quot;Meditations&quot; was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. Pascal regarded Descartes&#x27;s views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of deism: &quot;I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,&quot; while a powerful contemporary, Martin Schoock, accused him of atheist beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his &quot;Meditations&quot;. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.

Descartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism. Through this method of skepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to argue that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the &quot;propensity&quot; to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true &quot;substance&quot;. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.

Descartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, he replied, &quot;I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God.&quot;

== Mathematics ==

===&quot;x&quot; for unknown; exponential notation===

Descartes &quot;invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;, and knowns by &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;&quot;. He also &quot;pioneered the standard notation&quot; that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared.

=== Analytic geometry ===

One of Descartes&#x27;s most enduring legacies was his development of Cartesian or analytic geometry, which uses algebra to describe geometry; the Cartesian coordinate system is named after him. He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as Pacioli, Cardano, Tartaglia and Ferrari. Equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity &quot;a2&quot; could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as François Viète, who insisted that a second power must represent an area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or &quot;universal mathematics&quot;, as a precursor to symbolic logic, that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.

=== Influence on Newton&#x27;s mathematics ===
Current popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Isaac Newton, and this is arguably one of his most important contributions. Descartes&#x27;s influence extended not directly from his original French edition of &quot;La Géométrie&quot;, however, but rather from Frans van Schooten&#x27;s expanded second Latin edition of the work. Newton continued Descartes&#x27;s work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.

==== The basis of calculus ====
Descartes&#x27;s work provided the basis for the calculus developed by Leibniz and Newton, who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem, thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics. His rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.

== Physics ==

=== Philosophy, metaphysics, and physics ===
Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences. For him, philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:
=== Mechanics ===

==== Mechanical philosophy ====

The beginning of Descartes&#x27;s interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician Isaac Beeckman, whom he met in 1618, and who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics. It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace, detailing a mathematical problem to be solved. Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French. In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature. In 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo&#x27;s ideas. Together, they worked on free fall, catenaries, conic sections, and fluid statics. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.

==== Anticipating the concept of work ====
Although the concept of work (in physics) was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then. In 1637, Descartes wrote: 

==== Conservation of motion ====

In &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;Principia Philosophiae&quot;) from 1644 Descartes outlined his views on the universe. In it he describes his three laws of motion. (Newton&#x27;s own laws of motion would later be modeled on Descartes&#x27;s exposition.) Descartes defined &quot;quantity of motion&quot; (&quot;Latin: quantitas motus&quot;) as the product of size and speed, and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.Descartes had discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum. He envisioned quantity of motion as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as Galileo had envisioned it. Descartes&#x27;s discovery should not be seen as the modern law of conservation of momentum, since it had no concept of mass as distinct from weight or size, and since he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved.

==== Planetary motion ====
Descartes&#x27;s vortex theory of planetary motion was later rejected by Newton in favor of his law of universal gravitation, and most of the second book of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; is devoted to his counterargument.

=== Optics ===
Descartes also made contributions to the field of optics. He showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes&#x27;s law in France, or more commonly Snell&#x27;s law elsewhere) that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow&#x27;s centre is 42°). He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.

== Meteorology ==
Within &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, there is an appendix in which Descartes discusses his theories on Meteorology known as &quot;Les Météores&quot;. He first proposed the idea that the elements were made up of small particles that join together imperfectly, thus leaving small spaces in between. These spaces were then filled with smaller much quicker &quot;subtile matter&quot;. These particles were different based on what element they constructed, for example, Descartes believed that particles of water were &quot;like little eels, which, though they join and twist around each other, do not, for all that, ever knot or hook together in such a way that they cannot easily be separated.&quot; In contrast, the particles that made up the more solid material, were constructed in a way that generated irregular shapes. The size of the particle also matters; if the particle was smaller, not only was it faster and constantly moving, it was more easily agitated by the larger particles, which were slow but had more force. The different qualities, such as combinations and shapes, gave rise to different secondary qualities of materials, such as temperature. This first idea is the basis for the rest of Descartes&#x27;s theory on meteorology.

While rejecting most of Aristotle&#x27;s theories on meteorology, he still kept some of the terminology that Aristotle used such as vapors and exhalations. These &quot;vapors&quot; would be drawn into the sky by the sun from &quot;terrestrial substances&quot; and would generate wind. Descartes also theorized that falling clouds would displace the air below them, also generating wind. Falling clouds could also generate thunder. He theorized that when a cloud rests above another cloud and the air around the top cloud is hot, it condenses the vapor around the top cloud, and causes the particles to fall. When the particles falling from the top cloud collided with the bottom cloud&#x27;s particles it would create thunder. He compared his theory on thunder to his theory on avalanches. Descartes believed that the booming sound that avalanches created, was due to snow that was heated, and therefore heavier, falling onto the snow that was below it. This theory was supported by experience &quot;It follows that one can understand why it thunders more rarely in winter than in summer; for then not enough heat reaches the highest clouds, in order to break them up.&quot;

Another theory that Descartes had was on the production of lightning. Descartes believed that lightning was caused by exhalations trapped between the two colliding clouds. He believed that in order to make these exhalations viable to produce lightning, they had to be made &quot;fine and inflammable&quot; by hot and dry weather. Whenever the clouds would collide, it would cause them to ignite, creating lightning; if the cloud above was heavier than the bottom cloud, it would also produce thunder.

Descartes also believed that clouds were made up of drops of water and ice, and believed that rain would fall whenever the air could no longer support them. It would fall as snow if the air was not warm enough to melt the raindrops. And hail was when the cloud drops would melt, and then freeze again because cold air would refreeze them.

Descartes did not use mathematics or instruments (as there were not any at the time) to back up his theories on Meteorology and instead used qualitative reasoning in order to deduce his hypothesis.

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy, the thinker whose approaches has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for modernity. The first two of his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, those that formulate the famous methodic doubt, represent the portion of Descartes&#x27;s writings that most influenced modern thinking. It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move. In shifting the debate from &quot;what is true&quot; to &quot;of what can I be certain?&quot;, Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)—while the traditional concept of &quot;truth&quot; implies an external authority, &quot;certainty&quot; instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an anthropocentric revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand. In modernity, the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings, each of whom is a &quot;self-conscious shaper and guarantor&quot; of their own reality. In that way, each person is turned into a reasoning adult, a subject and agent, as opposed to a child obedient to God. This change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the Christian medieval period to the modern period, a shift that had been anticipated in other fields, and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by Descartes.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes&#x27;s work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the Enlightenment&#x27;s emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger, the perspective of Descartes&#x27;s work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology. Descartes&#x27;s philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism.

===Contemporary reception===
In commercial terms, The &quot;Discourse&quot; appeared during Descartes&#x27;s lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The &quot;Meditations&quot;, which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes&#x27;s death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe&#x27;s scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.

Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy (Henricus Regius, 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the university, Gijsbert Voet (Voetius), for teaching Descartes&#x27;s physics.

According to philosophy professor John Cottingham, Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; is considered to be &quot;one of the key texts of Western philosophy&quot;. Cottingham said that the &quot;Meditations&quot; is the &quot;most widely studied of all Descartes&#x27; writings&quot;.

According to Anthony Gottlieb, a former senior editor of &quot;The Economist&quot;, and the author of &quot;The Dream of Reason&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Enlightenment&quot;, one of the reasons Descartes and Thomas Hobbes continue to be debated in the second decade of the twenty-first century, is that they still have something to say to us that remains relevant on questions such as, &quot;What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and our ideas of God?&quot; and &quot;How is government to deal with religious diversity.&quot;

In her 2018 interview with Tyler Cowen, Agnes Callard described Descartes&#x27;s thought experiment in the &quot;Meditations&quot;, where he encouraged a complete, systematic doubting of everything that you believe, to &quot;see what you come to&quot;. She said, &quot;What Descartes comes to is a kind of real truth that he can build upon inside of his own mind.&quot; She said that Hamlet&#x27;s monologues&quot;meditations on the nature of life and emotion&quot;were similar to Descartes&#x27;s thought experiment. Hamlet/Descartes were &quot;apart from the world&quot;, as if they were &quot;trapped&quot; in their own heads. Cowen asked Callard if Descartes actually found any truths through his thought experiment or was it just &quot;an earlier version of the contemporary argument that we&#x27;re living in a simulation, where the evil demon is the simulation rather than Bayesian reasoning?&quot; Callard agreed that this argument can be traced to Descartes, who had said that he had refuted it. She clarified that in Descartes&#x27;s reasoning, you do &quot;end up back in the mind of God&quot;in a &quot;universe God has created&quot; that is the &quot;real world&quot;...The whole question is about being connected to reality as opposed to being a figment. If you&#x27;re living in the world God created, God can create real things. So you&#x27;re living in a real world.&quot;

===Purported Rosicrucianism===
The membership of Descartes to the Rosicrucians is debated.

The initials of his name have been linked to the R.C. acronym widely used by Rosicrucians. Furthermore, in 1619 Descartes moved to Ulm which was a well renowned international center of the Rosicrucian movement. During his journey in Germany, he met Johannes Faulhaber who had previously expressed his personal commitment to join the brotherhood.

Descartes dedicated the work titled &quot;The Mathematical Treasure Trove of Polybius, Citizen of the World&quot; to &quot;learned men throughout the world
and especially to the distinguished B.R.C. (Brothers of the Rosy Cross) in Germany&quot;. The work was not completed and its publication is uncertain.

==Bibliography==
===Writings===
* 1618. &quot;Musicae Compendium&quot;. A treatise on music theory and the aesthetics of music, which Descartes dedicated to early collaborator Isaac Beeckman (written in 1618, first published—posthumously—in 1650).
* 1626–1628. &quot;Regulae ad directionem ingenii&quot; (&quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;). Incomplete. First published posthumously in Dutch translation in 1684 and in the original Latin at Amsterdam in 1701 (&quot;R. Des-Cartes Opuscula Posthuma Physica et Mathematica&quot;). The best critical edition, which includes the Dutch translation of 1684, is edited by Giovanni Crapulli (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966).
* c. 1630. &quot;De solidorum elementis&quot;. Concerns the classification of Platonic solids and three-dimensional figurate numbers. Said by some scholars to prefigure Euler&#x27;s polyhedral formula. Unpublished; discovered in Descartes&#x27;s estate in Stockholm 1650, soaked for three days in the Seine in a shipwreck while being shipped back to Paris, copied in 1676 by Leibniz, and lost. Leibniz&#x27;s copy, also lost, was rediscovered circa 1860 in Hannover.
* 1630–1631. &quot;La recherche de la vérité par la lumière naturelle&quot; (&quot;The Search for Truth by Natural Light&quot;) unfinished dialogue published in 1701.
* 1630–1633. &quot;Le Monde&quot; (&quot;The World&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;Homme&quot; (&quot;Man&quot;). Descartes&#x27;s first systematic presentation of his natural philosophy. &quot;Man&quot; was published posthumously in Latin translation in 1662; and &quot;The World&quot; posthumously in 1664.
* 1637. &quot;Discours de la méthode&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;). An introduction to the &quot;Essais&quot;, which include the &quot;Dioptrique&quot;, the &quot;Météores&quot; and the &quot;Géométrie&quot;.
* 1637. &quot;La Géométrie&quot; (&quot;Geometry&quot;). Descartes&#x27;s major work in mathematics. There is an English translation by Michael Mahoney (New York: Dover, 1979).
* 1641. &quot;Meditationes de prima philosophia&quot; (&quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;), also known as &quot;Metaphysical Meditations&quot;. In Latin; a second edition, published the following year, included an additional objection and reply, and a &quot;Letter to Dinet&quot;. A French translation by the Duke of Luynes, probably done without Descartes&#x27;s supervision, was published in 1647. Includes six Objections and Replies.
* 1644. &quot;Principia philosophiae&quot; (&quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot;), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. A French translation, &quot;Principes de philosophie&quot; by Claude Picot, under the supervision of Descartes, appeared in 1647 with a letter-preface to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
* 1647. &quot;Notae in programma&quot; (&quot;Comments on a Certain Broadsheet&quot;). A reply to Descartes&#x27;s one-time disciple Henricus Regius.
* 1648. &quot;La description du corps humain&quot; (&quot;The Description of the Human Body&quot;). Published posthumously by Clerselier in 1667.
* 1648. &quot;Responsiones Renati Des Cartes...&quot; (&quot;Conversation with Burman&quot;). Notes on a Q&amp;A session between Descartes and Frans Burman on 16 April 1648. Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).
* 1649. &quot;Les passions de l&#x27;âme&quot; (&quot;Passions of the Soul&quot;). Dedicated to Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate.
* 1657. &quot;Correspondance&quot; (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes&#x27;s literary executor Claude Clerselier. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.

In January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through Google. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.

<text>Romansh ( ; sometimes also spelled Romansch and Rumantsch) is a Gallo-Romance and/or Rhaeto-Romance language spoken predominantly in the Swiss canton of the Grisons (Graubünden). Romansh has been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language in correspondence with Romansh-speaking citizens since 1996, along with German, French, and Italian. It also has official status in the canton of the Grisons alongside German and Italian and is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as the Rhaeto-Romance languages, though this is disputed.

Romansh is one of the descendant languages of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire, which by the 5th century AD replaced the Celtic and Raetic languages previously spoken in the area. Romansh retains a small number of words from these languages. Romansh has also been strongly influenced by German in vocabulary and morphosyntax. The language gradually retreated to its current area over the centuries, being replaced in other areas by Alemannic and Bavarian dialects. The earliest writing identified as Romansh dates from the 10th or 11th century, although major works did not appear until the 16th century, when several regional written varieties began to develop. During the 19th century the area where the language was spoken declined due to the industrialization of Switzerland, but the Romansh speakers had a literary revival and started a language movement dedicated to halting the decline of their language.

In the 2000 Swiss census, 35,095 people (of whom 27,038 live in the canton of the Grisons) indicated Romansh as the language of &quot;best command&quot;, and 61,815 as a &quot;regularly spoken&quot; language. In 2010, Switzerland switched to a yearly system of assessment that uses a combination of municipal citizen records and a limited number of surveys. In 2019, there were 40,074 Swiss residents who primarily spoke Romansh; in 2017, 28,698 inhabitants of the canton of the Grisons (14.7% of the population) used it as their main language.

Romansh is divided into five different regional dialect groups (Sursilvan, Vallader, Putèr, Surmiran, and Sutsilvan), each with its own standardized written language. In addition, a pan-regional variety called Rumantsch Grischun was introduced in 1982, which is controversial among Romansh speakers.

== Linguistic classification ==
Romansh is a Romance language descending from Vulgar Latin, the spoken language of the Roman Empire. Among the Romance languages, Romansh stands out because of its peripheral location. This has resulted in several archaic features. Another distinguishing feature is the centuries-long language contact with German, which is most noticeable in the vocabulary and to a lesser extent the syntax of Romansh. Romansh belongs to the Gallo-Romance branch of the Romance languages, which includes languages such as French, Occitan, and Lombard. The main feature placing Romansh within the Gallo-Romance languages is the fronting of Latin to or , as seen in Latin &quot;wall&quot;, which is or in Romansh.

The main features distinguishing Romansh from the Gallo-Italic languages to the south, and placing it closer to Ladin, Friulian and Franco-Provencal, are:
* Palatalization of Latin K and G in front of A, as in Latin &quot;dog&quot;, which is in Sursilvan, &quot;tgang&quot; in Surmiran, and in Putèr and Vallader (the difference between and being purely orthographic, as both represent /tɕ/); Lombard , French . This sound change is partially absent in some varieties of Romansh, however, especially in Sursilvan, where it may have been reversed at some point: Sursilvan and Vallader &quot;house&quot;.
* Pluralisation with &quot;-s&quot; suffix, derived from the Latin accusative case (though see ), as in &quot;&quot; &quot;good horses&quot; as opposed to Lombard ; French , yet identical to Portuguese .
* Retention of L following : &quot;key&quot; from Latin , as opposed to Lombard ; French .
Another defining feature of the Romansh language is the use of unstressed vowels. All unstressed vowels except /a/ disappeared.

Whether or not Romansh, Friulan, and Ladin should compose a separate &quot;Rhaeto-Romance&quot; subgroup within Gallo-Romance is an unresolved issue, known as the . Some linguists posit that these languages are descended from a common language, which was fractured geographically through the spread of German and Italian. The Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli first made the claim in 1873. The other position holds that any similarities between these three languages can be explained through their relative geographic isolation, which shielded them from certain linguistic changes. By contrast, the Gallo-Italic varieties of Northern Italy were more open to linguistic influences from the South. Linguists who take this position often point out that the similarities between the languages are comparatively few. This position was first introduced by the Italian dialectologist Carlo Battisti.

This linguistic dispute became politically relevant for the Italian irredentist movement. Italian nationalists interpreted Battisti&#x27;s hypothesis as implying that Romansh, Friulan, and Ladin were not separate Romance languages but rather Italian dialects. They used this hypothesis as an argument to claim the territories for Italy where these languages were spoken. From a sociolinguistic perspective, however, this question is largely irrelevant. The speakers of Romansh have always identified as speaking a language distinct from both Italian and other Romance varieties. Furthermore, unlike Friulian, Ladin, or Lombard, Romansh is located north of the German-Italian linguistic border, and German has influenced the language much more than Italian has.

==Dialects==

Romansh comprises a group of closely related dialects, which are most commonly divided into five different varieties, each of which has developed a standardized form. These regional standards are referred to as &quot;idioms&quot; in Romansh to distinguish them from the local vernaculars, which are referred to as &quot;dialects&quot;. These dialects form a dialect continuum without clear-cut divisions. Historically a continuous speech area, this continuum has now been ruptured by the spread of German, so that Romansh is now geographically divided into at least two non-adjacent parts.

#&quot;Sursilvan&quot; (Sursilvan: ; derived from the name of the Surselva region, which itself is derived from &quot;sur&quot; &quot;above&quot; and &quot;selva&quot; &quot;forest&quot;) – spoken in the Vorderrhein (Sursilvan: &quot;Rein Anteriur&quot;) valley, including the Lumnezia, Foppa, and Cadi. It is the most widely spoken variety, with 17,897 people or 54.8% within its historical region (including Imboden/Plaun, where Sursilvan is written but Sutsilvan spoken, with the exception of Sursilvan-speaking Flims/Flem) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the Swiss census of 2000.
#&quot;Sutsilvan&quot; (Sutsilvan, Rumantsch Grischun: &quot;sutsilvan&quot;; Vallader: &quot;suotsilvan&quot;; Putèr: &quot;suotsilvaun&quot;; derived from &quot;sut&quot; &quot;below&quot; and &quot;selva&quot; &quot;forest&quot;) – spoken in the Hinterrhein (Sutsilvan: &quot;Ragn Posteriur&quot;) valley, including Schams/Schons, Domleschg/Tumleastga, and Heinzenberg/Mantogna. In Imboden/Plaun, with the exception of Sursilvan-speaking Flims/Flem, they speak Sutsilvan but write Sursilvan. Sutsilvan is the least widely spoken Romansh variety, with 1,111 people or 15.4% within its historical area (excluding Imboden/Plaun) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language. It has become extinct across much of its historical area since the turn of the 20th century.
#&quot;Surmiran&quot; (Surmiran: &quot;surmiran&quot;; derived from &quot;sur&quot; &quot;above&quot; and &quot;meir&quot; &quot;wall&quot;) – spoken in the Gelgia and Albula/Alvra valleys, including Surses and Sutses. Romansh was named by 3,038 people within the historically Surmiran-writing area (44%) as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000.
#&quot;Putèr&quot; (Romansh: ; probably originally a nickname derived from &quot;put&quot; &quot;porridge&quot;, meaning &quot;porridge-eaters&quot;) – spoken in the Upper Engadine (Putèr and Vallader: &quot;Engiadin&#x27;Ota&quot;), as well as in the village of Brail in Zernez, where they, however, &quot;write&quot; Vallader. Romansh was named by 5,497 people or 30% within the Upper Engadine and Bergün Filisur (where Putèr is written but a non-Putèr dialect is spoken) as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000.
#&quot;Vallader&quot; (Vallader: ; derived from &quot;val&quot; &quot;valley&quot;) – spoken in the Lower Engadine (Vallader and Putèr: &quot;Engiadina Bassa&quot;), with the exception of Putèr-speaking Brail – where they nevertheless &quot;write&quot; Vallader – and in the Val Müstair. It is the second most commonly spoken variety of Romansh, with 6,448 people in the Lower Engadine and Val Müstair (79.2%) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the census of 2000.

Aside from these five major dialects, two additional varieties are often distinguished. One is the dialect of the Val Müstair, which is closely related to Vallader but often separately referred to as &quot;Jauer&quot; (Romansh: &quot;jauer&quot;; derived from the personal pronoun &quot;jau&quot; &quot;I&quot;, i.e. &quot;the &quot;jau&quot;-sayers&quot;). Less commonly distinguished is the dialect of Tujetsch and the Val Medel, which is markedly different from Sursilvan and is referred to as &quot;Tuatschin&quot;.

Additionally, the standardized variety Rumantsch Grischun, intended for pan-regional use, was introduced in 1982. The dialect of the Val Bregaglia is usually considered a variety of Lombard, and speakers use Italian as their written language, even though the dialect shares many features with the neighboring Putèr dialect of Romansh.

As these varieties form a continuum with small transitions from each village to the next, there is no straightforward internal grouping of the Romansh dialects. The Romansh language area can be described best as consisting of two widely divergent varieties, Sursilvan in the west and the dialects of the Engadine in the east, with Sutsilvan and Surmiran forming a transition zone between them. The Engadinese varieties &quot;Putèr&quot; and &quot;Vallader&quot; are often referred to as one specific variety known as &quot;Ladin&quot; (Ladin, Sursilvan, Surmiran, and Rumantsch Grischun: ; Sutsilvan: &quot;ladegn&quot;), which is not to be confused with the closely related language in Italy&#x27;s Dolomite mountains also known as Ladin. Sutsilvan and Surmiran are sometimes grouped together as Central Romansh (rm. &quot;Grischun central&quot;), and then grouped together with Sursilvan as &quot;Rhenish Romansh&quot; (in German, &quot;Rheinischromanisch&quot;).

One feature that separates the Rhenish varieties from Ladin is the retention of the rounded front vowels and (written &quot;ü&quot; and &quot;ö&quot;) in Ladin, which have been unrounded in the other dialects, as in Ladin , Sursilvan , Surmiran &quot;meir&quot; &quot;wall&quot; or Ladin to Rhenish &quot;cheese&quot;. Another is the development of Latin -CT-, which has developed into /tɕ/ in the Rhenish varieties as in &quot;détg&quot; &quot;said&quot; or &quot;fatg&quot; &quot;did&quot;, while developing into /t/ in Ladin (&quot;dit&quot; and &quot;fat&quot;). A feature separating Sursilvan from Central Romansh, however, involves the extent of palatalization of Latin /k/ in front of /a/, which is rare in Sursilvan but common in the other varieties: Sursilvan , Sutsilvan &quot;tgea&quot;, Surmiran &quot;tgesa&quot;, Putèr , and Vallader &quot;house&quot;. Overall, however, the Central Romansh varieties do not share many unique features, but rather connect Sursilvan and Ladin through a succession of numerous small differences from one village to the next.

The dialects of Romansh are not always mutually comprehensible. Speakers of Sursilvan and Ladin, in particular, are usually unable to understand each other initially. Because speakers usually identify themselves primarily with their regional dialect, many do not take the effort to attempt to understand unfamiliar dialects, and prefer to speak Swiss German with speakers of other varieties. A common Romansh identity is not widespread outside intellectual circles, even though this has been changing among the younger generation.

== History ==

=== Origins and development until modern times ===
Romansh originates from the spoken Latin brought to the region by Roman soldiers, merchants, and officials following the conquest of the modern-day Grisons area by the Romans in 15 BCE. Before that, the inhabitants spoke Celtic and Raetic languages, with Raetic apparently being spoken mainly in the Lower Engadine valley. Traces of these languages survive mainly in toponyms, including village names such as Tschlin, Scuol, Savognin, Glion, Breil/Brigels, Brienz/Brinzauls, Purtenza, and Trun. Additionally, a small number of pre-Latin words have survived in Romansh, mainly concerning animals, plants, and geological features unique to the Alps, such as &quot;camutsch&quot; &quot;chamois&quot; and &quot;grava&quot; &quot;scree&quot;.

It is unknown how rapidly the Celtic and Raetic inhabitants were Romanized following the conquest of Raetia. Some linguists assume that the area was rapidly Romanized following the Roman conquest, whereas others think that this process did not end until the 4th or 5th century, when more thoroughly Romanized Celts from farther north fled south to avoid invasions by Germanic tribes. The process was certainly complete and the pre-Roman languages extinct by the 5th–6th century, when Raetia became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. Around 537 AD, the Ostrogoths handed over the province of Raetia Prima to the Frankish Empire, which continued to have local rulers administering the so-called Duchy of Chur. However, after the death of the last Victorid ruler, Bishop Tello, around 765 AD, Charlemagne assigned a Germanic duke to administer the region. Additionally, the Diocese of Chur was transferred by the (pre-Schism) Roman Catholic Church from the Archdiocese of Milan to the Diocese of Mainz in 843 AD. The combined effect was a cultural reorientation towards the German-speaking north, especially as the ruling élite now comprised almost entirely speakers of German.

At the time, Romansh was spoken over a much wider area, stretching north into the present-day cantons of Glarus and St. Gallen, to the Walensee in the northwest, and Rüthi and the Alpine Rhine Valley in the northeast. In the east, parts of modern-day Vorarlberg were Romansh-speaking, as were parts of Tyrol. The northern areas, called Lower Raetia, became German-speaking by the 12th century; and by the 15th century, the Rhine Valley of St. Gallen and the areas around the Walensee were entirely German-speaking. This language shift was a long, drawn-out process, with larger, central towns adopting German first, while the more peripheral areas around them remained Romansh-speaking longer. The shift to German was caused in particular by the influence of the local German-speaking élites and by German-speaking immigrants from the north, with the lower and rural classes retaining Romansh longer.

In addition, beginning around 1270, the German-speaking Walser began settling in sparsely populated or uninhabited areas within the Romansh-speaking heartland. The Walser sometimes expanded into Romansh-speaking areas from their original settlements, which then often became German-speaking, such as Davos, Schanfigg, the Prättigau, Schams, and Valendas, which became German-speaking by the 14th century. In rare cases, these Walser settlements were eventually assimilated by their Romansh-speaking neighbors; for instance, Oberhalbstein, Medel, and Tujetsch in the Surselva region.

The Germanization of Chur had particularly long-term consequences. Even though the city had long before ceased to be a cultural center of Romansh, the spoken language of the capital of the Diocese of Chur continued to be Romansh until the 15th century. After a fire in 1465 which virtually destroyed the city, many German-speaking artisans who had been called in to help repair the damage settled there, causing German to become the majority language. In a chronicle written in 1571–72, Durich Chiampell mentions that Romansh was still spoken in Chur roughly a hundred years before, but had since then rapidly given way to German and was now not much appreciated by the inhabitants of the city. Many linguists regard the loss of Chur to German as a crucial event. According to Sylvia Osswald, for example, it occurred precisely at a time when the introduction of the printing press could have led to the adoption of the Romansh dialect of the capital as a common written language for all Romansh speakers. Other linguists such as Jachen Curdin Arquint remain skeptical of this view, however, and assume that the various Romansh-speaking regions would still have developed their own separate written standards.

Instead, several regional written varieties of Romansh began appearing during the 16th century. Gian Travers wrote the first surviving work in Romansh, the &quot;Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs&quot;, in the Putèr dialect. This epic poem, written in 1527, describes the first Musso war, in which Travers himself had taken part. Travers also translated numerous biblical plays into Romansh, though only the titles survive for many of them. Another early writer, Giachem Bifrun, who also wrote in Putèr, penned the first printed book in Romansh, a catechism published in 1552. In 1560 he published a translation of the New Testament: &quot;L&#x27;g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ&quot;.

Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the &quot;Cudesch da Psalms&quot;, a collection of church songs in the Vallader dialect. These early works are generally well written and show that the authors had a large amount of Romansh vocabulary at their disposal, contrary to what one might expect of the first pieces of writing in a language. Because of this, the linguist Ricarda Liver assumes that these written works built on an earlier, pre-literature tradition of using Romansh in administrative and legal situations, of which no evidence survives. In their prefaces, the authors themselves often mention the novelty of writing Romansh, and discuss an apparently common prejudice that Romansh was a language that could not be written.

The first writing in the Sursilvan and Sutsilvan dialects appears in the 17th century. As in the Engadine, these early works usually focused on religious themes, in particular the struggles between Protestants and Counter-Reformers. Daniel Bonifaci produced the first surviving work in this category, the catechism &quot;Curt mussameint dels principals punctgs della Christianevla Religiun&quot;, published in 1601 in the Sutsilvan dialect. A second edition, published in 1615, is closer to Sursilvan, however, and writings in Sutsilvan do not appear again until the 20th century. In 1611, (&quot;The true joys of young people&quot;), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths, was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later, in 1615, a Catholic catechism, &quot;Curt Mussament&quot;, was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the New Testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel.

The first complete translation of the Bible, the &quot;Bibla da Cuera&quot;, was published between 1717 and 1719. The Sursilvan dialect thus had two separate written varieties, one used by the Protestants with its cultural center around Ilanz, and a Catholic variety with the Disentis Abbey as its center. The Engadine dialect was also written in two varieties: Putèr in the Upper Valley and Vallader in the Lower Valley. The Sutsilvan areas either used the Protestant variety of Sursilvan, or simply used German as their main written language. The Surmiran region began developing its own variety in the early 18th century, with a catechism being published in 1703, though either the Catholic variety of Sursilvan or Putèr was more commonly used there until the 20th century.

In the 16th century, the language border between Romansh and German largely stabilized, and it remained almost unchanged until the late 19th century. During this period, only isolated areas became German-speaking, mainly a few villages around Thusis and the village of Samnaun. In the case of Samnaun, the inhabitants adopted the Bavarian dialect of neighboring Tyrol, making Samnaun the only municipality of Switzerland where a Bavarian dialect is spoken. The Vinschgau in South Tyrol was still Romansh-speaking in the 17th century, after which it became entirely German-speaking because of the Counter-Reformation denunciation of Romansh as a &quot;Protestant language&quot;.

=== Romansh during the 19th and 20th centuries ===
With the Act of Mediation, the Grisons became a canton of Switzerland in 1803. The constitution of the canton dates from 1892. When the Grisons became part of Switzerland in 1803, it had a population of roughly 73,000, of whom around 36,600 were Romansh speakers—many of them monolingual—living mostly within the Romansh-speaking valleys. The language border with German, which had mostly been stable since the 16th century, now began moving again as more and more villages shifted to German. One cause was the admission of Grisons as a Swiss canton, which brought Romansh-speakers into more frequent contact with German-speakers. Another factor was the increased power of the central government of the Grisons, which had always used German as its administrative language. In addition, many Romansh-speakers migrated to the larger cities, which were German-speaking, while speakers of German settled in Romansh villages. Moreover, economic changes meant that the Romansh-speaking villages, which had mostly been self-sufficient, engaged in more frequent commerce with German-speaking regions. Also, improvements in the infrastructure made travel and contact with other regions much easier than it had been.

Finally, the rise of tourism made knowledge of German an economic necessity in many areas, while the agricultural sector, which had been a traditional domain of Romansh, became less important. All this meant that knowledge of German became more and more of a necessity for Romansh speakers and that German became more and more a part of daily life. For the most part, German was seen not as a threat but rather as an important asset for communicating outside one&#x27;s home region. The common people frequently demanded better access to learning German. When public schools began to appear, many municipalities decided to adopt German as the medium of instruction, as in the case of Ilanz, where German became the language of schooling in 1833, when the town was still largely Romansh-speaking.

Some people even welcomed the disappearance of Romansh, in particular among progressives. In their eyes, Romansh was an obstacle to the economic and intellectual development of the Romansh people. For instance, the priest Heinrich Bansi from Ardez wrote in 1797: &quot;The biggest obstacle to the moral and economical improvement of these regions is the language of the people, Ladin [...] The German language could certainly be introduced with ease into the Engadine, as soon as one could convince the people of the immense advantages of it&quot;. Others, however, saw Romansh as an economic asset, since it gave the Romansh an advantage when learning other Romance languages. In 1807, for example, the priest Mattli Conrad wrote an article listing the advantages and disadvantages of Romansh: 
In response, the editor of the newspaper added that:

According to the testimony of experienced and vigilant language teachers, while the one who is born Romansh can easily learn to understand these languages and make himself understood in them, he has great difficulties in learning them properly, since precisely because of the similarity, he mixes them so easily with his own bastardized language. [...] in any case, the conveniences named should hold no weight against all the disadvantages that come from such an isolated and uneducated language.

According to Mathias Kundert, this quote is a good example of the attitude of many German-speakers towards Romansh at the time. According to Mathias Kundert, while there was never a plan to Germanize the Romansh areas of Grisons, many German-speaking groups wished that the entire canton would become German-speaking. They were careful, however, to avoid any drastic measures to that extent, in order not to antagonize the influential Romansh minority.

The decline of Romansh over the 20th century can be seen through the results of the Swiss censuses. The decline in percentages is only partially due to the Germanization of Romansh areas, since the Romansh-speaking valleys always had a lower overall population growth than other parts of the canton.

Starting in the mid-19th century, however, a revival movement began, often called the &quot;Rhaeto-Romansh renaissance&quot;. This movement involved an increased cultural activity, as well as the foundation of several organizations dedicated to protecting the Romansh language. In 1863, the first of several attempts was made to found an association for all Romansh regions, which eventually led to the foundation of the in 1885. In 1919, the Lia Rumantscha was founded to serve as an umbrella organization for the various regional language societies. Additionally, the role of Romansh in schooling was strengthened, with the first Romansh school books being published in the 1830s and 1840s. Initially, these were merely translations of the German editions, but by the end of the 19th century teaching materials were introduced which took the local Romansh culture into consideration. Additionally, Romansh was introduced as a subject in teacher&#x27;s college in 1860 and was recognized as an official language by the canton in 1880.

Around the same time, grammar and spelling guidelines began to be developed for the regional written dialects. One of the earliest was the by Zaccaria Pallioppi, published in 1857. For Sursilvan, a first attempt to standardize the written language was the by Baseli Carigiet, published in 1858, followed by a Sursilvan-German dictionary in 1882, and the &quot;Normas ortografias&quot; by Giachen Caspar Muoth in 1888. Neither of these guidelines managed to gather much support. At the same time, the Canton published school books in its own variety. Sursilvan was then definitely standardized through the works of Gion Cahannes, who published &quot;Grammatica Romontscha per Surselva e Sutselva&quot; in 1924, followed by &quot;Entruidament devart nossa ortografia&quot; in 1927. The Surmiran dialect had its own norms established in 1903, when the Canton agreed to finance the school book &quot;Codesch da lectura per las scolas primaras de Surmeir&quot;, though a definite guideline, the &quot;Normas ortograficas per igl rumantsch da Surmeir&quot;, was not published until 1939. In the meantime, the norms of Pallioppi had come under criticism in the Engadine due to the strong influence of Italian in them. This led to an orthographic reform which was concluded by 1928, when the by Cristoffel Bardola was published. A separate written variety for Sutsilvan was developed in 1944 by Giuseppe Gangale.

Around 1880, the entire Romansh-speaking area still formed a continuous geographical unit. But by the end of the century, the so-called &quot;Central-Grisons language bridge&quot; began to disappear. From Thusis, which had become German-speaking in the 16th/17th century, the Heinzenberg and Domleschg valleys were gradually Germanized over the next decades. Around the turn of the century, the inner Heinzenberg and Cazis became German-speaking, followed by Rothenbrunnen, Rodels, Almens, and Pratval, splitting the Romansh area into two geographically non-connected parts. In the 1920s and 1930s the rest of the villages in the valley became mainly German-speaking, sealing the split.

In order to halt the decline of Romansh, the Lia Rumantscha began establishing Romansh day care schools, called , beginning in the 1940s with the aim of reintroducing Romansh to children. Although the had some success – of the ten villages where Scoletas were established, the children began speaking Romansh amongst themselves in four, with the children in four others acquiring at least some knowledge of Romansh – the program ultimately failed to preserve the language in the valley.

A key factor was the disinterest of the parents, whose main motivation for sending their children to the Scoletas appears to have been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. The other factor was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Präz, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.

In other areas, such as the Engadine and the Surselva, where the pressure of German was equally strong, Romansh was maintained much better and remained a commonly spoken language. According to the linguist Mathias Kundert, one important factor was the different social prestige of Romansh. In the Heinzenberg and Domleschg valleys, the elite had been German-speaking for centuries, so that German was associated with power and education, even though most people did not speak it, whereas Romansh was associated with peasant life. In the Engadine and the Surselva by contrast, the elite was itself Romansh-speaking, so that Romansh there was &quot;not only the language spoken to children and cows, but also that of the village notable, the priest, and the teacher.&quot; Additionally, Romansh schools had been common for several years before German had become a necessity, so that Romansh was firmly established as a medium of education.

Likewise, in the Upper Engadine, where factors such as increased mobility and immigration by German speakers were even stronger, Romansh was more firmly established as a language of education and administration, so that the language was maintained to a much greater extent. In the Central Grisons, by contrast, German had been a central part of schooling since the beginning, and virtually all schools switched entirely to German as the language of instruction by 1900, with children in many schools being punished for speaking Romansh well into the 1930s.

=== Rumantsch Grischun ===
Early attempts to create a unified written language for Romansh include the &quot;Romonsch fusionau&quot; of Gion Antoni Bühler in 1867 and the &quot;Interrumantsch&quot; by Leza Uffer in 1958. Neither was able to gain much support, and their creators were largely the only ones actively using them. In the meantime, the Romansh movement sought to promote the different regional varieties while promoting a gradual convergence of the five varieties, called the &quot;avischinaziun&quot;. In 1982, however, the then secretary of the Lia Rumantscha, a sociolinguist named , launched a project for designing a pan-regional variety. The linguist Heinrich Schmid presented to the Lia Rumantscha the same year the rules and directives for this standard language under the name Rumantsch Grischun (Rumantsch Grischun: &quot;rumantsch grischun&quot;). Schmid&#x27;s approach consisted of creating a language as equally acceptable as possible to speakers of the different dialects, by choosing those forms which were found in a majority of the three strongest varieties: Sursilvan, Vallader, and Surmiran (Puter has more speakers than Surmiran but is spoken by a lower percentage of the population in its area). The elaboration of the new standard was endorsed by the Swiss National Fund and carried out by a team of young Romansh linguists under the guidance of Georges Darms and Anna-Alice Dazzi-Gross.

The Lia Rumantscha then began introducing Rumantsch Grischun to the public, announcing that it would be chiefly introduced into domains where only German was being used, such as official forms and documents, billboards, and commercials. In 1984, the assembly of delegates of the head organization Lia Rumantscha decided to use the new standard language when addressing all Romansh-speaking areas of the Grisons. From the very start, Rumansh Grischun has been implemented only on the basis of a decision of the particular institutions. In 1986, the federal administration began to use Rumantsch Grischun for single texts. The same year, however, several influential figures began to criticize the introduction of Rumantsch Grischun. Donat Cadruvi, at the time the president of the cantonal government, claimed that the Lia Rumantscha was trying to force the issue. Romansh writer Theo Candinas also called for a public debate on the issue, calling Rumantsch Grischun a &quot;plague&quot; and &quot;death blow&quot; to Romansh and its introduction a &quot;Romansh Kristallnacht&quot;, thus launching a highly emotional and bitter debate which would continue for several years. The following year, Candinas published another article titled &quot;Rubadurs Garmadis&quot; in which he compared the proponents of Rumantsch Grischun to Nazi thugs raiding a Romansh village and desecrating, destroying, and burning the Romansh cultural heritage.

The proponents responded by labeling the opponents as a small group of archconservative and narrow-minded Sursilvans and CVP politicians among other things. The debate was characterized by a heavy use of metaphors, with opponents describing Rumantsch Grischun as a &quot;test-tube baby&quot; or &quot;castrated language&quot;. They argued that it was an artificial and infertile creation which lacked a heart and soul, in contrast to the traditional dialects. On the other side, proponents called on the Romansh people to nurture the &quot;new-born&quot; to allow it to grow, with Romansh writer Ursicin Derungs calling Rumantsch Grischun a &quot;lungatg virginal&quot; &quot;virgin language&quot; that now had to be seduced and turned into a blossoming woman.

The opposition to Rumantsch Grischun also became clear in the Swiss census of 1990, in which certain municipalities refused to distribute questionnaires in Rumantsch Grischun, requesting the German version instead. Following a survey on the opinion of the Romansh population on the issue, the government of the Grisons decided in 1996 that Rumantsch Grischun would be used when addressing all Romansh speakers, but the regional varieties could continue to be used when addressing a single region or municipality. In schools, Rumantsch Grischun was not to replace the regional dialects but only be taught passively.

The compromise was largely accepted by both sides. A further recommendation in 1999, known as the &quot;Haltinger concept&quot;, also proposed that the regional varieties should remain the basis of the Romansh schools, with Rumantsch Grischun being introduced in middle school and secondary school.

The government of the Grisons then took steps to strengthen the role of Rumantsch Grischun as an official language. Since the cantonal constitution explicitly named Sursilvan and Engadinese as the languages of ballots, a referendum was launched to amend the relevant article. In the referendum, which took place on June 10, 2001, 65% voted in favor of naming Rumantsch Grischun the only official Romansh variety of the Canton. Opponents of Rumantsch Grischun such as Renata Coray and Matthias Grünert argue, however, that if only those municipalities with at least 30% Romansh speakers were considered, the referendum would have been rejected by 51%, with an even larger margin if only those with at least 50% Romansh speakers were considered. They thus interpret the results as the Romansh minority having been overruled by the German-speaking majority of the canton.

A major change in policy came in 2003, when the cantonal government proposed a number of spending cuts, including a proposal according to which new Romansh teaching materials would not be published except in Rumantsch Grischun from 2006 onwards, the logical result of which would be to abolish the regional varieties as languages of instruction. The cantonal parliament passed the measure in August 2003, even advancing the deadline to 2005. The decision was met by strong opposition, in particular in the Engadine, where teachers collected over 4,300 signatures opposing the measure, followed by a second petition signed by around 180 Romansh writers and cultural figures, including many who were supportive of Rumantsch Grischun but opposed its introduction as a language of instruction.

Opponents argued that Romansh culture and identity was transmitted through the regional varieties and not through Rumantsch Grischun and that Rumantsch Grischun would serve to weaken rather than strengthen Romansh, possibly leading to a switch to German-language schools and a swift Germanization of Romansh areas.

The cantonal government refused to debate the issue again, instead deciding on a three-step plan in December 2004 to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the language of schooling, allowing the municipalities to choose when they would make the switch. The decision not to publish any new teaching materials in the regional varieties was not overturned at this point, however, raising the question of what would happen in those municipalities that refused to introduce Rumantsch Grischun at all, since the language of schooling is decided by the municipalities themselves in the Grisons.

The teachers of the Engadine in particular were outraged over the decision, but those in the Surmeir were mostly satisfied. Few opinions were heard from the Surselva, which was interpreted either as support or resignation, depending on the viewpoint of the observer.

In 2007–2008, 23 so called &quot;pioneer-municipalities&quot; (Lantsch/Lenz, Brienz/Brinzauls, Tiefencastel, Alvaschein, Mon, Stierva, Salouf, Cunter, Riom-Parsonz, Savognin, Tinizong-Rona, Mulegns, Sur, Marmorera, Falera, Laax, Trin, Müstair, Santa Maria Val Müstair, Valchava, Fuldera, Tschierv and Lü) introduced Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction in 1st grade, followed by an additional 11 (Ilanz, Schnaus, Flond, Schluein, Pitasch, Riein, Sevgein, Castrisch, Surcuolm, Luven and Duvin) the following year and another 6 (Sagogn, Rueun, Siat, Pigniu, Waltensburg/Vuorz and Andiast) in 2009–2010. However, other municipalities, including the entire Engadine valley and most of the Surselva, continued to use their regional variety. The cantonal government aimed to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the sole language of instruction in Romansh schools by 2020.

In early 2011, a group of opponents in the Surselva and the Engadine founded the association Pro Idioms, demanding the overturning of the government decision of 2003 and launching numerous local initiatives to return to the regional varieties as the language of instruction. In April 2011, Riein became the first municipality to vote to return to teaching in Sursilvan, followed by an additional 4 in December, and a further 10 in early 2012, including Val Müstair (returning to Vallader), which had been the first to introduce Rumantsch Grischun. As of September 2013, all those municipalities in the Surselva which had switched to Rumantsch Grischun had decided to return to teaching in Sursilvan, with the exception of Pitasch, which, followed later.

Supporters of Rumantsch Grischun then announced that they would take the issue to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and announced their intention to launch a cantonal referendum to enshrine Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction.

The Lia Rumantscha opposes these moves and now supports a model of coexistence in which Rumantsch Grischun will supplement but not replace the regional varieties in school. It cites the need for keeping linguistic peace among Romansh speakers, as it says that the decades-long debate over the issue has torn friends and even families apart. The canton&#x27;s 2003 decision not to finance school books in the regional varieties was overturned in December 2011.

Rumantsch Grischun is still a project in progress. At the start of 2014, it was in use as a school language in the central part of the Grisons and in the bilingual classes in the region of Chur. It was taught in upper-secondary schools, in the university of teacher education in Chur and at the universities of Zürich and Fribourg, along with the Romansh idioms. It remains an official and administrative language in the Swiss Confederation and the Canton of the Grisons as well as in public and private institutions for all kinds of texts intended for the whole Romansh-speaking territory.

Until 2021, Surmiran was the only regional variety that was not taught in schools, as all the Surmiran-writing municipalities had switched to Rumantsch Grischun. However, referendums in Surses, Lantsch/Lenz and Albula/Alvra in 2020 led to the return to Surmiran as the language of instruction in the entire Surmiran-writing area, beginning with those pupils who started school in 2021. The only primary schools that will continue teaching in Rumantsch Grischun are the bilingual Romansh/German schools in the cantonal capital of Chur, which is located in a German-speaking area, and in Trin and Domat/Ems, where the local dialects are Sutsilvan but Sursilvan has traditionally been used as the written language.

Rumantsch Grischun is read in the news of Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha and written in the daily newspaper &quot;La Quotidiana&quot;, along with the Romansh idioms. Thanks to many new texts in a wide variety of political and social functions, the Romansh vocabulary has been decisively broadened.

The &quot;Pledari Grond&quot; German–Rumantsch Grischun dictionary, with more than 215 000 entries, is the most comprehensive collection of Romansh words, which can also be used in the idioms with the necessary phonetic shifts. The signatories of &quot;Pro Rumantsch&quot; stress that Romansh needs both the idioms and Rumantsch Grischun if it is to improve its chances in today&#x27;s communication society. There also exist individual dictionaries for each of the different idioms: Sursilvan, Vallader, Puter, Surmiran, and Sutsilvan. As well, the &quot;Pledari Grond&quot; dictionary links to several texts on the grammar of Vallader, Puter, and Rumantsch Grischun.

== Official status in Switzerland and language politics ==
In Switzerland, official language use is governed by the &quot;territorial principle&quot;: Cantonal law determines which of the four national languages enjoys official status in which part of the territory. Only the federal administration is officially quadrilingual. Romansh is an official language at the federal level, one of the three official languages of the Canton of the Grisons, and is a working language in various districts and numerous municipalities within the canton.

=== Official status at the federal level ===
The first Swiss constitution of 1848, as well as the subsequent revision of 1872, made no mention of Romansh, which at the time was not a working language of the Canton of the Grisons either. The federal government did finance a translation of the constitution into the two Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader in 1872, noting, however, that these did not carry the force of law. Romansh became a national language of Switzerland in 1938, following a referendum. A distinction was introduced between &quot;national languages&quot; and &quot;official languages&quot;. The status of a national language was largely symbolic, whereas only official languages were to be used in official documents, a status reserved for German, French, and Italian. The recognition of Romansh as the fourth national language is best seen within the context of the &quot;Spiritual defence&quot; preceding World War II, which aimed to underline the special status of Switzerland as a multinational country. Additionally, this was supposed to discredit the efforts of Italian nationalists to claim Romansh as a dialect of Italian and establish a claim to parts of the Grisons. The Romansh language movement led by the Lia Rumantscha was mostly satisfied with the status as a national but not official language. Their aims at the time were to secure a symbolic &quot;right of residence&quot; for Romansh, and not actual use in official documents.

This status did have disadvantages. For instance, official name registers and property titles had to be in German, French, or Italian. This meant that Romansh-speaking parents were often forced to register their children under German or Italian versions of their Romansh names. As late as 1984, the Canton of the Grisons was ordered not to make entries into its corporate registry in Romansh. The Swiss National Bank first planned to include Romansh on its bills in 1956, when a new series was introduced. Due to disputes within the Lia Rumantscha over whether the bills were to feature the Sursilvan version &quot; or the Vallader version &quot;, the bills eventually featured the Italian version twice, alongside French and German. When new bills were again introduced in 1976/77, a Romansh version was added by finding a compromise between the two largest varieties Sursilvan and Vallader, which read &quot;&quot;, while the numbers on the bills were printed in Surmiran.

Following a referendum on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people. This means that in principle, it is possible to address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language. More precisely, under section 2.6.3 of the Federal Act on the National Languages and Understanding between the Linguistic Communities, Romansh speakers may address the administration in any variety of Romansh, though they will receive a response in Rumantsch Grischun.

In what the Federal Culture Office itself admits is &quot;more a placatory and symbolic use&quot; of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a unified standard language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It takes time and needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.

The Swiss Armed Forces attempted to introduce Romansh as an official language of command between 1988 and 1992. Attempts were made to form four entirely Romansh-speaking companies, but these efforts were abandoned in 1992 due to a lack of sufficient Romansh-speaking non-commissioned officers. Official use of Romansh as a language of command was discontinued in 1995 as part of a reform of the Swiss military.

=== Official status in the canton of the Grisons ===
The Grisons is the only canton of Switzerland where Romansh is recognized as an official language. The only working language of the Three Leagues was German until 1794, when the assembly of the leagues declared German, Italian, Sursilvan, and Ladin (Putèr and Vallader) to have equal official standing. No explicit mention of any official language was made in the cantonal constitutions of 1803, 1814, and 1854. The constitution of 1880 declared that &quot;The three languages of the Canton are guaranteed as national languages, without specifying anywhere which three languages are meant. The new cantonal constitution of 2004 recognizes German, Italian, and Romansh as equal national and official languages of the canton. The canton used the Romansh varieties Sursilvan and Vallader up until 1997, when Rumantsch Grischun was added and use of Sursilvan and Vallader was discontinued in 2001.

This means that any citizen of the canton may request service and official documents such as ballots in their language of choice, that all three languages may be used in court, and that a member of the cantonal parliament is free to use any of the three languages. Since 1991, all official texts of the cantonal parliament must be translated into Romansh and offices of the cantonal government must include signage in all three languages. In practice, the role of Romansh within the cantonal administration is limited and often symbolic and the working language is mainly German. This is usually justified by cantonal officials on the grounds that all Romansh speakers are perfectly bilingual and able to understand and speak German. Up until the 1980s it was usually seen as a provocation when a deputy in the cantonal parliament used Romansh during a speech.

Cantonal law leaves it to the districts and municipalities to specify their own language of administration and schooling. According to Article 3 of the cantonal constitution, however, the municipalities are to &quot;take into consideration the traditional linguistic composition and respect the autochthonous linguistic minorities&quot;. This means that the language area of Romansh has never officially been defined, and that any municipality is free to change its official language. In 2003, Romansh was the sole official language in 56 municipalities of the Grisons, and 19 were bilingual in their administrative business. In practice, even those municipalities which only recognize Romansh as an official working language, readily offer services in German as well. Additionally, since the working language of the canton is mainly German and many official publications of the canton are available only in German, it is virtually impossible for a municipal administration to operate only in Romansh.

=== Romansh in education ===

Within the Romansh-speaking areas, three different types of educational models can be found: Romansh schools, bilingual schools, and German schools with Romansh as a subject.

In the Romansh schools, Romansh is the primary language of instruction during the first 3–6 years of the nine years of compulsory schooling, and German during the last 3–9 years. Due to this, this school type is often called the &quot;so-called Romansh school&quot;. In practice, the amount of Romansh schooling varies between half and 4/5 of the compulsory school term, often depending on how many Romansh-speaking teachers are available. This &quot;so-called Romansh school&quot; was found in 82 municipalities of the Grisons as of 2001. The bilingual school was found only in Samedan, Pontresina, and Ilanz/Schnaus. In 15 municipalities, German was the sole medium of instruction as of 2001, with Romansh being taught as a subject.

Outside of areas where Romansh is traditionally spoken, Romansh is not offered as a subject and as of 2001, 17 municipalities within the historical language area of Romansh do not teach Romansh as a subject. On the secondary level, the language of instruction is mainly German, with Romansh as a subject in Romansh-speaking regions.

Outside of the traditional Romansh-speaking areas, the capital of the Grisons, Chur, runs a bilingual Romansh-German elementary school.

On the tertiary level, the University of Fribourg offers Bachelor- and Master programs for Romansh language and literature. The Romansh department there has been in existence since 1991. The University of Zürich also maintains a partial chair for Romansh language and literature together with the ETH Zürich since 1985.

== Geographic distribution ==
Whereas Romansh was spoken as far north as Lake Constance in the early Middle Ages, the language area of Romansh is today limited to parts of the canton of the Grisons; the last areas outside the canton to speak Romansh, the Vinschgau in South Tyrol, became German-speaking in the 17th century. Inside the Grisons, the language borders largely stabilized in the 16th century and remained almost unchanged until the 19th century. This language area is often called the &quot;Traditional Romansh-speaking territory&quot;, a term introduced by the statistician Jean-Jacques Furer based on the results of the Swiss censuses. Furer defines this language area as those municipalities in which a majority declared Romansh as their mother tongue in any of the first four Swiss censuses between 1860 and 1888. In addition, he includes Fürstenau. This represented 121 municipalities at the time, corresponding to 116 present-day municipalities. The villages of Samnaun, Sils im Domleschg, Masein, and Urmein, which were still Romansh-speaking in the 17th century, had lost their Romansh majority by 1860, and are not included in this definition. This historical definition of the language area has been taken up in many subsequent publications, but the Swiss Federal Statistical Office for instance defines the language area of Romansh as those municipalities, where a majority declared to habitually use Romansh in the census of 2000.

The presence of Romansh within its traditional language area varies from region to region. In 2000, 66 municipalities still had a Romansh majority, an additional 32 had at least 20% who declared Romansh as their language of best command or as a habitually spoken language, while Romansh is either extinct or spoken only by a small minority in the remaining 18 municipalities within the traditional language area. In the Surselva region, it is the habitually spoken language of 78.5% and the language of best command of 66%. In the Sutselva region by contrast, Romansh is extinct or spoken only by a small number of older people, with the exception of Schams, where it is still transmitted to children and where some villages still have a Romansh majority, notably in the vicinity of the Schamserberg. In the Surmiran region, it is the main language in the Surses region, but no longer widely spoken in the Albula Valley.

In the Upper Engadine valley, it is a habitually spoken language for 30.8% and the language of best command for 13%. However, most children still acquire Romansh through the school system, which has retained Romansh as the primary language of instruction, even though Swiss German is more widely spoken inside the home. In the Lower Engadine, Romansh speakers form the majority in virtually all municipalities, with 60.4% declaring Romansh as their language of best command in 2000, and 77.4% declaring it as a habitually spoken language.

Outside of the traditional Romansh language area, Romansh is spoken by the so-called &quot;Romansh diaspora&quot;, meaning people who have moved out of the Romansh-speaking valleys. A significant number are found in the capital of Grisons, Chur, as well as in Swiss cities outside of Grisons.

=== Current distribution ===
The current situation of Romansh is quite well researched. The number of speakers is known through the Swiss censuses, with the most recent having taken place in 2000, in addition to surveys by the Radio e Televisiun Rumantscha. The quantitative data from these surveys was summed up by statistician Jean-Jacques Furer in 2005. In addition, linguist Regula Cathomas performed a detailed survey of everyday language use, published in 2008.

Virtually all Romansh-speakers today are bilingual in Romansh and German. Whereas monolingual Romansh were still common at the beginning of the twentieth century, they are now found only among pre-school children. As Romansh linguist Ricarda Liver wrote in 1999:
The language situation today consists of a complex relationship between several diglossia, since there is a functional distribution within Romansh itself between the local dialect, the regional standard variety, and nowadays the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun as well; and German is also acquired in two varieties: Swiss German and Standard German. Additionally, in Val Müstair many people also speak Bavarian German as a second language. Aside from German, many Romansh also speak additional languages, such as French, Italian, or English, learned at school or acquired through direct contact.

The Swiss census of 1990 and 2000 asked for the &quot;language of best command&quot; as well as for the languages habitually used in the family, at work, and in school. Previous censuses had asked only for the &quot;mother tongue&quot;. In 1990, Romansh was named as the &quot;language of best command&quot; by 39,632 people, with a decrease to 35,095 in 2000. As a family language, Romansh is more widespread, with 55,707 having named it in 1990, and 49,134 in 2000. As a language used at work, Romansh was more widely used in 2000 with 20,327 responses than in 1990 with 17,753, as it was as a language used at school, with 6,411 naming it in 2000 as compared to 5,331 in 1990. Overall, a total of 60,561 people reported that they used Romansch of some sort on a habitual basis, representing 0.83% of the Swiss population. As the language of best command, Romansh comes in 11th in Switzerland with 0.74%, with the non-national languages Serbian, Croatian, Albanian, Portuguese, Spanish, English, and Turkish all having more speakers than Romansh.

In the entire canton of the Grisons, where about two-thirds of all speakers live, roughly a sixth report it as the language of best command (29,679 in 1990 and 27,038 in 2000). As a family language it was used by 19.5% in 2000 (33,707), as a language used on the job by 17.3% (15,715), and as a school language by 23.3% (5,940). Overall, 21.5% (40,168) of the population of the Grisons reported to be speaking Romansh habitually in 2000. Within the traditional Romansh-speaking areas, where 56.1% (33,991) of all speakers lived in 2000, it is the majority language in 66 municipalities.


The status of Romansh differs widely within this traditional area. Whereas in some areas Romansh is used by virtually the entire population, in others the only speakers are people who have moved there from elsewhere. Overall, Romansh dominates in most of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine as well as parts of the Surses, whereas German is the dominant daily language in most other areas, though Romansh is often still used and transmitted in a limited manner regardless.

In general, Romansh is the dominant language in most of the Surselva. In the western areas, the Cadi and the Lumnezia, it is the language of a vast majority, with around 80% naming it as their language of best command, and it often being a daily language for virtually the entire population. In the eastern areas of the Gruob around Ilanz, German is significantly more dominant in daily life, though most people still use Romansh regularly. Romansh is still acquired by most children in the Cadi and Gruob even in villages where Romansh speakers are in the minority, since it is usually the language of instruction in primary education there. Even in villages where Romansh dominates, newcomers rarely learn Romansh, as Sursilvan speakers quickly accommodate by switching to German, so that there is often little opportunity to practice Romansh even when people are willing to learn it. Some pressure is often exerted by children, who will sometimes speak Romansh even with their non-Romansh-speaking parents.

In the Imboden District by contrast, it is only used habitually by 22%, and is the language of best command for only 9.9%. Even within this district, the presence of Romansh varies, with 41.3% in Trin reporting to speak it habitually. In the Sutselva, the local Romansh dialects are extinct in most villages, with a few elder speakers remaining in places such as Präz, Scharans, Feldis/Veulden, and Scheid, though passive knowledge is slightly more common. Some municipalities still offer Romansh as a foreign language subject in school, though it is often under pressure of being replaced by Italian. The notably exception is Schams, where it is still regularly transmitted to children and where the language of instruction is Romansh. In the Surmeir region, it is still the dominant everyday language in the Surses, but has mostly disappeared from the Albula Valley. The highest proportion of habitual speakers is found in Salouf with 86.3%, the lowest in Obervaz with 18.9%. In these areas, many Romansh speakers only speak German with their spouses as an accommodation or because of a habit, though they sometimes speak Romansh to their children. In most cases, this is not because of a will to preserve the language, but because of other reasons such as Romansh having been their own childhood language or a belief that their children will later find it easier to learn additional languages.

In the Upper Engadine, it is used habitually by 30.8% and the language of best command for 13%, with only S-chanf having a Romansh majority. Even though the main every-day and family language is German, Romansh is not in imminent danger of disappearing in the Upper Engadine, due to the strong emotional attachment to the language and in particular the Romansh-language school, which means that a Romansh-speaking core always exists in some form. Romansh is often a sign of being one of the locals, and used to distinguish oneself from tourists or temporary residents, so that outsiders will sometimes acquire Romansh in order to fit in. In the Lower Engadine by contrast, Romansh is the majority language virtually everywhere, with over 80% reporting it as a habitually spoken language in most villages. The status of Romansh is even stronger in the Val Müstair, where 86.4% report to speak it habitually, and 74.1% as their language of best command. In the Lower Engadine, outsiders are generally expected to learn Romansh if they wish to be integrated into the local community and take part in social life. In addition, there is often pressure from inside the family to learn Romansh.

Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer concludes that the shrinkage of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh is still very much alive, a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as most parts of the Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.

== Phonology ==

Romansh has up to 26 consonant phonemes. Two are found only in some varieties, and one is found only in loanwords borrowed from German.
Notes:
: in only some dialects, notably Surmiran, and only word-final as in &quot;bread&quot;.
: often transcribed as the palatal stops and in broad transcriptions.
: in only some dialects, notably Putèr, and only word-finally as in , &quot;friend&quot;.
: occurs only in German loanwords such as &quot;crook&quot;.
: also pronounced in some dialects of Sursilvan.
The voiced obstruents are fully voiced in Romansh, in contrast to Swiss German with which Romansh is in extensive contact, and voiceless obstruents are non-aspirated. Voiced obstruents are devoiced word-finally, however, as in &quot;boy&quot; &gt; , &quot;warm&quot; &gt; , &quot;blood&quot; &gt; , or &quot;key&quot; &gt; .
The vowel inventory varies somewhat between dialects, as the front rounded vowels and are found only in Putèr and Vallader. They have historically been unrounded in the other varieties and are found only in recent loans from German there. They are not found in the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun either. The now nearly extinct Sutsilvan dialects of the Heinzenberg have as in &quot;plant&quot; or &quot;tree&quot;, but this is etymologically unrelated to the found in Putèr and Vallader. The exact realization of the phoneme varies from to depending on the dialect: / &quot;book&quot;. It is regarded as either a marginal phoneme or not a separate phoneme from by some linguists.

Word stress generally falls either on the last or the penult syllable of a word. Unstressed vowels are generally reduced to a schwa, whose exact pronunciation varies between or as in &quot;song&quot;. Vowel length is predictable:
* Unstressed vowels are short.
* Stressed vowels in closed syllables (those with a coda) are:
*: long before 
*: short elsewhere
* Stressed vowels in open syllables are:
*: short before voiceless consonants
*: long elsewhere

The number of diphthongs varies significantly between dialects. Sursilvan dialects contain eleven diphthongs and four triphthongs (, , , and ).

Other dialects have different inventories; Putèr, for instance, lacks , , and as well as the triphthongs but has , which is missing in Sursilvan. A phenomenon known as &quot;hardened diphthongs&quot;, in which the second vowel of a falling Diphthong is pronounced as , was once common in Putèr as well, but is nowadays limited to Surmiran: &#x27;barely &gt; . 

== Orthography ==

Romansh is written in the Latin alphabet, and mostly follows a phonemic orthography, with a high correspondence between letters and sounds. The orthography varies slightly depending on the variety.

The vowel inventories of the five regional written varieties differ widely (in particular in regards to diphthongs), and the pronunciation often differs depending on the dialect even within them. The orthography of Sutsilvan is particularly complex, allowing for different pronunciations of the vowels depending on the regional dialect, and is not treated in this table.

== Morphology ==
The following description deals mainly with the Sursilvan dialect, which is the best-studied so far. The dialects Putèr and Vallader of the Engadine valley in particular diverge considerably from Sursilvan in many points. When possible, such differences are described.

Nouns are not inflected for case in Romansh; the grammatical category is expressed through word order instead. As in most other Romance languages, Romansh nouns belong to two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. A definite article (masc. or before a vowel; fem. ) is distinguished from an indefinite article (masc. , , or , depending on the dialect; fem. , , or ). The plural is usually formed by adding the suffix -s. In Sursilvan, masculine nouns are sometimes irregular, with the stem vowel alternating:
* &quot;the wall&quot; – &quot;the walls&quot;.
* &quot;the house&quot; – &quot;the houses&quot;.
* irregular: &quot;the egg&quot; – &quot;the eggs&quot;.

A particularity of Romansh is the so-called &quot;collective plural&quot; to refer to a mass of things as a whole:
* &quot;the stone&quot; – &quot;the stones&quot;.
* collective: &quot;rock&quot;.

Adjectives are inflected according to gender and number. Feminine forms are always regular, but the stem vowel sometimes alternates in the masculine forms:
* fem. (sg.) – (pl.) &quot;good&quot;
* masc. (sg.) – (pl.) &quot;good&quot;.

Sursilvan also distinguishes an attributive and predicative form of adjectives in the singular. This is not found in some of the other dialects:
* Attributive: &quot;a good human (person)&quot;
* Predicative : &quot;the human (person) is good&quot;

There are three singular and three plural pronouns in Romansh (Sursilvan forms shown below):
There is a T–V distinction between familiar and polite . Putèr and Vallader distinguish between familiar and and polite / and /. Pronouns for the polite forms in Putèr and Vallader are always capitalized to distinguish them from third person pronouns: &quot;I know your sister&quot; and &quot;I know his/her sister&quot;.

The 1st and 2nd person pronouns for a direct object have two distinct forms, with one occurring following the preposition : &quot;give me your book&quot;.

A particularity of Sursilvan is that reflexive verbs are all formed with the reflexive pronoun , which was originally only the third person pronoun:
* &quot;I am washing myself&quot;.
* &quot;you are washing yourself&quot;.
* &quot;he/she is washing her/himself&quot;.
* &quot;we are washing ourselves&quot;.
* &quot;they are washing themselves&quot;.

The other Romansh dialects distinguish different reflexive pronouns.

Possessive pronouns occur in a pronominal and a predicative form that differ only in the masculine form, however:

* &quot;my dog&quot; – &quot;the dog is mine&quot;.
* &quot;your problem&quot; – &quot;that problem is yours&quot;.
The feminine remains the same: &quot;her/his house&quot; – &quot;this house is hers/his&quot;.

Three different demonstrative pronouns , , and are distinguished: &quot;I trust that one, but not that other one&quot; or &quot;and the father, what is he going to say?&quot;.

Verb tenses are divided into synthetic forms (present, imperfect) and analytic forms (perfect, pluperfect, future, passive) distinguished by the grammatical moods indicative, subjunctive, conditional, and imperative. These are most common forms in Sursilvan:

== Syntax ==
The syntax of Romansh has not been thoroughly investigated so far. Regular word order is subject–verb–object, but subject-auxiliary inversion occurs in several cases, placing the verb at the beginning of a sentence:
* To form a question: – &quot;Is he still there?&quot;.
* In declarative sentences: – &quot;Tomorrow, we go on vacation&quot;.
* When an independent clause is placed after the dependent clause: – &quot;When he entered, everyone stood up&quot;.
* As well as in other stylistic variations.

These features are in close concord with German syntax, which has likely reinforced them. However, this need not mean that they are due entirely to language contact. In fact, similar tendencies can be observed in Old French.

A sentence is negated by adding a negative particle. In Sursilvan, this is , placed after the verb, while in other dialects such as Putèr and Vallader, it is , placed before the verb:
* Sursilvan: – &quot;I didn&#x27;t do that&quot;.
* Putèr: – &quot;The village does not get cut off by snow&quot;.

A feature found only in Putèr and Vallader (as it is in Castilian Spanish) is the preposition of a direct object, when that direct object is a person or an animal, with , as in &quot;did you see Peter?&quot;, &quot;I took the dog out for a walk&quot;, but &quot;did you see the church?&quot;.

== Vocabulary ==
No systematic synchronic description of Romansh vocabulary has been carried out so far. Existing studies usually approach the subject from a historical perspective, taking particular interest in pre-Roman substratum, archaic words preserved only in Romansh, or in loan words from German. A project to compile together all known historic and modern Romansh vocabulary is the Dicziunari Rumantsch Grischun, first published in 1904, with the 13th edition currently in preparation.

=== Raetic and Celtic ===
The influence of the languages (Raetic and Celtic) spoken in Grisons before the arrival of the Romans is most obvious in placenames, which are often pre-Roman. Since very little is known about the Celtic language once spoken in Grisons, and almost nothing about Raetic, words or placenames thought to come from them are usually simply referred to as &quot;pre-Roman&quot;. Apart from placenames, such words are found in landscape features, plant and animal names unique to the Alps, and tools and methods related to alpine transhumance. Such words include:
* Raetic: &quot;gnieu&quot; (Surs. &quot;igniv&quot;; Suts. &quot;(a)gnieu, ugnieu&quot;; Surm. &quot;nia&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;gnieu&quot;; Jauer &quot;agnieu&quot;) &quot;nest, eyrie&quot;, &quot;ampauna&quot; (Surs. &quot;puauna&quot;; Suts. &quot;omgia, ontga&quot;; Surm. &quot;omgia&quot;; Puter &quot;ampa&quot;; Val. &quot;amp(u)a&quot;) &quot;raspberry&quot;, &quot;izun&quot; (Surs. &quot;izun&quot;; Suts. &quot;(n)izùn&quot;; Surm. &quot;izung&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;uzun&quot;; Jauer &quot;anzola&quot;) &quot;bilberry&quot;, &quot;chamutsch&quot; (Surs. &quot;camutsch&quot;; Suts., Surm. &quot;tgamutsch&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;chamuotsch&quot;) &quot;chamois&quot;, &quot;crap&quot; (all dialects) &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;gonda&quot; (Val.) &quot;scree slope&quot;, &quot;grip&quot; (Surs., Suts. &quot;grep&quot;; Surm. &quot;crepel, crap&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;grip&quot;) &#x27;cliff&#x27;, &quot;grusaida&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Put., Val. &quot;grusaida&quot;) &quot;snow rose&quot;, &quot;panaglia&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Val. &quot;panaglia&quot;) &quot;butter churn&quot;, &quot;schember&quot; (Surs. &quot;schiember&quot;; Suts., Surm. &quot;schember&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;dschember&quot;) &quot;Swiss pine&quot; (&lt; &quot;*gimberu&quot; &lt; Raetic &quot;*𐌊𐌉𐌌𐌓𐌖 (*kimru, *gimru)&quot;.), &quot;signun&quot; (Surs. &quot;&quot;; Val. &quot;signun&quot;, Put. &quot;signun, sain&quot;) &quot;chief herder on a seasonal pasture&quot; (cf. German &quot;Senn&quot;), &quot;tschess&quot; (Surs. &quot;tschéss&quot;; Surm. &quot;tschess, tschissùn&quot;) &#x27;(golden) eagle&#x27;, &quot;urlaun&quot; (Surs.) &#x27;ptarmigan&#x27;;
* Celtic: &quot;carmun&quot; (Surs. &quot;carmun&quot;) &quot;weasel&quot;, &quot;dischariel&quot; (Surs. &quot;derschalet&quot;; Surm. &quot;darschalet, ischier&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;dischöl&quot;) &quot;goblin, nightmare&quot;, &quot;draig&quot; &quot;sieve&quot;, &quot;glitta&quot; (Surs. &quot;gliet(ta)&quot;) &quot;silt, mud&quot;, &quot;grava&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Val. &quot;grava&quot;) &quot;scree&quot;, &quot;mat&quot; &quot;boy&quot; ~ &quot;matta&quot; (Surs., Surm., Put., Val. &quot;matta&quot;; Suts. &quot;mata&quot;) &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;mellen&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Surm., Put. &quot;mellen&quot;; Suts. &quot;melen&quot;) &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;tegia&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Suts., Surm. &quot;tigia&quot;; Put. &quot;tegia&quot;; Val. &quot;teja&quot;) &quot;alpine hut&quot;, &quot;trutg&quot; (Surs., Suts. &quot;trutg&quot;; Surm. &quot;trotg&quot;; Put. &quot;truoch&quot;; Val. &quot;truoi&quot;) &quot;footpath, drove way&quot;, &quot;tschigrun&quot; (Surs. &#x27;; Put., Val. &quot;tschigrun&quot;) &quot;whey cheese&quot;.
* Other Pre-Roman words include: &quot;chalun&quot; (Surs. &quot;calun&quot;; Suts. &quot;calùn&quot;; Surm. &quot;calung&quot;; Put., Val. &quot;gialun&quot;) &quot;hip&quot; (&lt; &quot;*galon&quot;), &quot;tschanc&quot; (Put., Val.) &quot;left (hand)&quot; (&lt; &quot;*čaŋk, *čamp&quot;), &quot;lisüra&quot; (Put., Val.) &quot;joint, link&quot; (&lt; &quot;*lisura&quot;). Some other possibly Pre-Roman origin words are: &quot;tatona&quot; (Surs., Suts. &quot;totona&quot;; Surm. &quot;tutona&quot;) &quot;nape of the neck, back of the neck&quot;, &quot;brentina&quot; (Surs. &quot;brentina&quot;; Suts. &quot;brenta, brantgegna&quot;; Surm. &quot;brainta&quot;; Val. &quot;brenta&quot;) &quot;fog, mist&quot;, &quot;dascha&quot; (Val.) &quot;twig&quot;.

=== Latin stock ===
Like all languages, Romansh has its own archaisms, that is, words derived from Latin that in most other Romance languages have fallen out of use or taken niche meanings. Examples include &quot;baselgia&quot; &quot;church&quot; (cf. Vegliote &quot;bašalka&quot;, Romanian &quot;biserică&quot;), &quot;nuidis&quot; &quot;grudgingly, reluctantly&quot; (&lt; Latin &quot;invitus&quot;), &quot;urar&quot; &quot;to pray&quot; (cf. Portuguese &quot;orar&quot;, Romanian &quot;a ura&quot; ‘to wish’), &quot;aura&quot; &quot;weather&quot; (cf. Old French &quot;ore&quot;, Aromanian &quot;avrî&quot;), &quot;scheiver&quot; &quot;carnival&quot;, &quot;cudesch&quot; &quot;book&quot;, the last two of which are only found in Romansh. The non-Engadinese dialects retain &quot;anceiver&quot; ~ &quot;entschaiver&quot; &quot;to begin&quot;, from Latin &quot;incipere&quot;, otherwise found only in Romanian &quot;începe&quot;, whereas Surmiran and Engadinese (Putèr, Vallader) and all other Romance languages retain a reflex of Latin *&quot;cuminitiāre&quot;, e.g. Engadinese &quot;(s)cumanzar&quot;, Italian &quot;cominciare&quot;, French &quot;commencer&quot;. Other examples are &quot;memia&quot; (adv.) &quot;too much&quot; from Latin &quot;nimia&quot; (adj., fem.) (otherwise only found in Old Occitan), &quot;vess&quot; &quot;difficult&quot; from Latin &quot;vix&quot; &quot;seldom&quot; (cf. Old Spanish &quot;abés&quot;, Romanian &quot;abia&quot; &lt; &quot;ad vix&quot;), and Engadinese &quot;encleger&quot; &quot;to understand&quot; (vs. non-Engadinese &quot;capir&quot;), also found in Romanian &quot;înțelege&quot; and Albanian &quot;(n)dëgjoj&quot;, from Latin &quot;intellegere&quot;. Some unique innovations include &quot;tedlar&quot; &quot;to listen&quot; from Latin &quot;titulare&quot; and &quot;patertgar&quot; &quot;to think&quot; from &quot;pertractare&quot;.

=== Germanic loanwords ===
Another distinguishing characteristic of Romansh vocabulary is its numerous Germanic loanwords.

Some Germanic loan words already entered the language in Late Antiquity or the Early Middle Ages, and they are often found in other Romance languages as well. Words more particular to Romansh include Surs./ Suts. &quot;tschadun&quot;, Surm. &quot;sdom&quot;/&quot;sdong&quot;, Engad. &quot;sdun&quot; &quot;spoon&quot;, which is also found in Ladin as &quot;sciadon&quot; and Friulian as &quot;sedòn&quot; and is thought to go back to Ostrogothic *skeitho, and it was once probably common throughout Northern Italy. Another such early loan is &quot;bletsch&quot; &quot;wet&quot;, which probably goes back to Old Frankish &quot;blettjan&quot; &quot;to squeeze&quot;, from where French &quot;blesser&quot; &quot;to wound&quot; is also derived. The change in meaning probably occurred by the way of &quot;bruised fruit&quot;, as is still found in French &quot;blet&quot;. Early Germanic loans found more commonly in the other Romance languages includes Surs./Vall. &quot;blau&quot;, Suts. &quot;blo&quot;/&quot;blova&quot;, Surm. &quot;blo&quot;/&quot;blava&quot;, Put. &quot;blov&quot; &quot;blue&quot;, which is derived from Germanic &quot;blao&quot; and also found for instance in French as &quot;bleu&quot; and Italian as &quot;blu&quot;.

Others were borrowed into Romansh during the Old High German period, such as &quot;glieud&quot; &quot;people&quot; from OHG &quot;liut&quot; or Surs. &quot;uaul&quot;, Suts. &quot;gòld&quot;, Surm. &quot;gôt&quot;, eng. &quot;god&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; from OHG &quot;wald&quot;. Surs. &quot;baul&quot;, Suts. &quot;bòld&quot;, Engad. &quot;bod&quot; &#x27;soon, early, nearly&#x27; is likely derived from Middle High German &quot;bald, balde&quot; &quot;keen, fast&quot; as are Surs. &quot;nez&quot;, Engad. &quot;nüz&quot; &quot;use&quot; from Middle High German &quot;nu(t)z&quot;, or &quot;losch&quot; &quot;proud&quot; likely from Middle High German &quot;lôs&quot;. Other examples include Surs. &quot;schuber&quot; &quot;clean&quot; from Swiss German &quot;suuber&quot;, Surs. &quot;schumber&quot; &quot;drum&quot; from Swiss German or Middle High German &quot;sumber&quot;, and Surs. &quot;schufar&quot; &quot;to drink greedily&quot; from Swiss German &quot;suufe&quot;.

Some words were adapted into Romansh through different dialects of German, such as the word for &quot;farmer&quot;, borrowed as &quot;paur&quot; from Bavarian in Vallader and Putèr, but from Alemannic as &quot;pur&quot; in the other dialects.

In addition, many German words entered Romansh beginning in the 19th century, when numerous new objects and ideas were introduced. Romansh speakers often simply adopted the German words, such as &quot;il zug&quot; &quot;the train&quot; or &quot;il banhof&quot; &quot;the train station&quot;. Language purists attempted to coin new Romansh words instead, which were occasionally successful in entering popular usage. Whereas &quot;il tren&quot; and &quot;la staziun&quot; managed to replace &quot;il zug&quot; and &quot;il banhof&quot;, other German words have become established in Romansh usage, such as &quot;il schalter&quot; &quot;the switch&quot;, &quot;il hebel&quot; &quot;the lever&quot;, &quot;la schlagbohrmaschina&quot; &quot;the hammer drill&quot;, or &quot;in schluc&quot; &quot;a sip&quot;. Especially noticeable are interjections such as &quot;schon&quot;, &quot;aber&quot; or &quot;halt&quot;, which have become established in everyday language. In a few cases, there was a semantic shift, such as &quot;uaffen&quot;, &quot;tool&quot;, derived from &quot;Waffe&quot;, &quot;weapon&quot;.

== Language contact ==
Romansh speakers have been in close contact with speakers of German dialects such as Alemannic and Bavarian for centuries, as well as speakers of various Italian dialects and Standard German more recently. These languages have influenced Romansh, most strongly the vocabulary, whereas the German and Italian influences on morphology and syntax are much more limited. This means that despite German influence, Romansh has remained a Romance language in its core structure. Romansh linguist Ricarda Liver also notes that an influence of Swiss German on intonation is obvious, in particular in the Sursilvan dialect, even though this has so far not been linguistically studied. The influence of German is generally strongest in the Rhenish varieties Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, and Sursilvan, where French loanwords (frequently not borrowed directly but transmitted through German) are also more numerous. In the dialects of the Engadine, by contrast, the influence of Italian is stronger.

In the Engadinese written languages, Putèr and Vallader, Italian-influenced spellings, learned words, and derivations were previously abundant, for instance in Zaccaria Pallioppi&#x27;s 1895 dictionary, but came under scrutiny at the start of the 20th century and were gradually eliminated from the written language. Following reforms of the written languages of the Engadine, many of these Italian words fell out of usage (such as &quot;contadin&quot; &#x27;farmer&#x27; instead of &quot;paur&quot;, &quot;nepotin&quot; &#x27;nephew&#x27; rather than &quot;abiadi&quot;, &quot;ogni&quot; &#x27;everyone&#x27; instead of &quot;inmincha&quot;, &quot;saimper&quot; &#x27;always&#x27; instead of &quot;adüna&quot;, and &quot;abbastanza&quot; &#x27;enough&#x27; instead of &quot;avuonda&quot;), while others persisted as synonyms of more traditional Ladin words (such as &quot;tribunal&quot; &#x27;court&#x27; alongside &quot;drettüra&quot;, &quot;chapir&quot; alongside &quot;incleger&quot;, and &quot;testimoni&quot; &#x27;witness&#x27; alongside &quot;perdütta&quot;).

Aside from the written language, everyday Romansh was also influenced by Italian through the large number of emigrants, especially from the Engadine, to Italy, the so-called Randulin. These emigrants often returned with their Romansh speech influenced by Italian.

=== German loanwords ===
German loanwords entered Romansh as early as the Old High German period in the Early Middle Ages, and German has remained an important source of vocabulary since. Many of these words have been in use in Romansh for long enough that German speakers no longer recognize them as German, and for morphological derivations of them to have appeared, in particular through the suffix &quot;-egiar ~ iar&quot;, as in Surs. &quot;baghegiar&quot;, sut. &quot;biagear&quot;, Surm. &quot;biagier&quot;, Put. &quot;biager&quot;, Vall. &quot;bear&quot; &quot;to build&quot;, derived from Middle High German &quot;bûwen&quot;. Other examples include &quot;malegiar&quot; &quot;to paint&quot; (← &quot;malen&quot;), &quot;schenghegiar&quot; &quot;to give (a present)&quot; (← &quot;schenken&quot;), &quot;schazegiar&quot; &quot;to estimate&quot; (← &quot;schätzen&quot;), or Surs. &quot;betlegiar&quot; (sut. &quot;batlagear&quot;, Surm./Put. &quot;batlager&quot;, Vall. &quot;supetliar&quot;) &quot;to beg&quot;, derived from Swiss German &quot;bettle&quot; with the same meaning. Nouns derived from these verbs include &quot;maletg&quot; &quot;painting&quot;, &quot;schenghetg&quot; &quot;gift&quot;, &quot;schazetg&quot; &quot;estimation&quot;, or &quot;bagetg&quot; &quot;building&quot;. The adjective &quot;flissi&quot; &quot;hard-working&quot; has given rise to the noun &quot;flissiadad&quot; &quot;industriousness&quot;. The word &quot;pur&quot; has given rise to derived words such as &quot;pura&quot; &quot;farmwife, female farmer&quot; or &quot;puranchel&quot; &quot;small-time farmer&quot;, as has &quot;buob&quot; &quot;boy&quot; from Swiss German &quot;bueb&quot; &quot;boy&quot;, with the derivations &quot;buoba&quot; &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;buobanaglia&quot; &quot;crowd of children&quot;.

=== Italian, Ladin and Gallo-italic loanwords ===
Common nouns of Italian origin include &quot;resposta/risposta&quot; &quot;answer&quot;, &quot;vista/vesta&quot; &quot;view&quot;, &quot;proposta&quot; &quot;proposal&quot;, &quot;surpresa/surpraisa&quot; &quot;surprise&quot;, and &quot;offaisa/offesa&quot; &quot;insult&quot;. In Ladin, many such nouns are borrowed or derived from Italian and end in –a, whereas the same group of nouns in Sursilvan frequently ends in –iun and where borrowed either from French or formed through analogy with Latin. Examples include &quot;pretensiun&quot; &quot;opinion, claim&quot; vs. &quot;pretaisa&quot;, &quot;defensiun&quot; &quot;defense&quot; vs. &quot;defaisa&quot;, or &quot;confirmaziun&quot; &quot;confirmation&quot; vs. &quot;conferma&quot;.

Other Italian words used throughout Romansh include the words for &quot;nail&quot;, which are derived from Italian &quot;acuto&quot; &quot;sharp&quot;, which has yielded Sur. &quot;guota&quot;, Sut. &quot;guta&quot;, Surm. &quot;gotta&quot;, and Ladin &quot;guotta/aguotta&quot;, whereas the Romansh word for &quot;sharp&quot; itself (Rhenish: &quot;git&quot;, Ladin &quot;agüz&quot;) is derived from the same Latin source ACUTUM. Words from Lombard and Venetian related to crafts include Ladin &quot;marangun&quot; &quot;carpenter&quot; (← Venetian &quot;marangon&quot;), as opposed to &quot;lennari&quot; in other Romansh dialects, &quot;chazzoula&quot; &quot;trowel&quot; (← Lombard &quot;cazzola&quot;), or &quot;filadè&quot; &quot;spinning wheel&quot; (← Lombard &quot;filadel&quot;). Other words include culinary items such as &quot;macaruns&quot; &quot;macaroni&quot; (← &quot;maccheroni&quot;); &quot;tschiculatta/tschugalata&quot; &quot;chocolate&quot; (← &quot;cioccolata&quot; or Lombard &quot;ciculata/cicolata&quot;), Ladin and Surmiran &quot;limun/limung&quot; &quot;lemon&quot; as opposed to Sursilvan &quot;citrona&quot; (← &quot;limone&quot;), &quot;giabus/baguos&quot; &quot;cabbage&quot; (← Lombard &quot;gabüs&quot;), &quot;chanella/canella&quot; &quot;cinnamon&quot; (← &quot;cannella&quot;). In Sursilvan, the word &quot;ogna&quot; &quot;flat cake&quot; can be found, which is derived from Italian &quot;lasagna&quot;, with the initial &quot;las-&quot; having been mistaken for the plural article, and the vowel having been adapted to Sursilvan sound patterns through analogy with words such as &quot;muntogna&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;. Others are words for animals such as &quot;lodola&quot; &quot;lark&quot; (← &quot;lodola&quot;) or &quot;randulina&quot; &quot;swallow&quot; (← Lombard &quot;randulina&quot;), as well as Ladin &quot;scarafagi/scarvatg&quot; &quot;beetle&quot; (← &quot;scarafaggio&quot;). Other Italian words include &quot;impostas&quot; &quot;taxes&quot; (← &quot;imposte&quot;; as opposed to Rhenish &quot;taglia&quot;), &quot;radunanza/radunonza&quot; &quot;assembly&quot; (← &quot;radunanza&quot;), Ladin &quot;ravarenda&quot; &quot;(Protestant) priest&quot; (← &quot;reverendo&quot;), &quot;bambin&quot; &quot;Christmas child (giftbringer)&quot; (← &quot;Gesù Bambino&quot;), &quot;marchadant/marcadont&quot; &quot;merchant&quot; (← &quot;mercatante&quot;) or &quot;butia/buteia&quot; &quot;shop&quot; (← &quot;bottega&quot;).

In Ladin, Italian borrowings also include words groups not usually borrowed readily. Examples include pronouns such as &quot;qualchosa&quot; &quot;something&quot; (← &quot;qualcosa&quot;), &quot;listess&quot; &quot;the same one&quot; (← Lombard or Venetian &quot;l&#x27;istess&quot;), adverbs such as &quot;apunta&quot; &quot;exactly&quot; (← &quot;appunto&quot;), &quot;magara/magari&quot; &quot;fairly/quite&quot; (← &quot;magari&quot;), prepositions like &quot;dürant/duront&quot; &quot;during&quot; (← &quot;durante&quot;) and &quot;malgrà/malgrad&quot; &quot;despite&quot; (← &quot;malgrado&quot;), and conjunctions such as &quot;però&quot; &quot;but&quot; (← &quot;però&quot;) and &quot;fin cha&quot; &#x27;until&#x27; (← &quot;finché&quot;). Most of these are confined to Ladin, with some exceptions such as Sursilvan &quot;magari&quot;, &quot;duront&quot;, and &quot;malgrad&quot;.

=== Germanic calques ===
Aside from outright loanwords, the German influence on Romansh often takes the form of calques, where Romanic vocabulary has taken on the meaning of German words, summed up by Italian dialectologist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli in 1880 as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Roman body and German soul&quot;). The earliest examples go back to Carolingian times and show the influence of Germanic law. Such words include &quot;statute&quot;, a derivation of the verb (from Latin * &quot;to sit&quot;) as an analogy to Middle High German or Surs./sut./Surm. , Put. , Vall. &quot;marriage&quot;, derived from Latin (accusative singular of &quot;law&quot;), with the meaning of Middle High German . A more recent example of a loan translation is the verb &quot;to betray&quot;, which has taken on the additional meaning of German of &quot;to give away&quot; as in &quot;to give away a secret&quot;, originally covered by the verb .

Particularly common are combinations of verbs with locative adverbs, such as &quot;to accompany&quot; (literally &quot;to come with&quot;), &quot;to come back&quot;, &quot;to participate&quot; (literally &quot;to do with&quot;), &quot;to agree on&quot; (literally &quot;to do down&quot;), or &quot;to fail&quot; (literally &quot;to fall through&quot;). Whereas such verbs also occur sporadically in other Romance languages as in French &quot;to take along&quot; or Italian &quot;to go away&quot;, the large number in Romansh suggests an influence of German, where this pattern is common. However, prepositional verbs are also common in the (Romance) Lombard language spoken in the bordering Swiss and Italian regions. The verbs &quot;to participate&quot; or &quot;to fail&quot; for example, are direct equivalents of German (from &quot;with&quot; and &quot;to do&quot;) and (from &quot;through&quot; and &quot;to fall&quot;).

Less integrated into the Romansh verbal system are constructions following the pattern of (&quot;doing the&quot;) + a German infinitive. Examples include &quot;to solder&quot;, &quot;to season&quot;, or &quot;to miss, to feel the absence of&quot;.

German also often serves as a model for the creation of new words. An example is Surs. &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;, a compound of &quot;to suck&quot; and &quot;dust&quot;, following the model of German – the Italian word, possibly being itself a calque on the German word. The Engadinese dialects on the other hand have adopted from Italian , which, however, does not mean &quot;vacuum cleaner&quot;. A skyscraper, which is a direct loan translation from English in many Romance languages (as in French , Italian ), is a loan translation of German (literally &quot;cloud-scraper&quot;) in Sursilvan: (from &quot;to scratch&quot; and &quot;clouds&quot;). The Engadinese varieties again follow the Italian pattern of (from &quot;sky&quot;). A more recent word is &quot;the cell phone number&quot;, which follows the word order of Swiss German , and is found alongside .

Examples of idiomatic expressions include Surs. , Engad. , a direct translation of German , literally meaning &quot;to hand a basket&quot;, but used in the sense of &quot;turning down a marriage proposal&quot; or , a loan translation of the German expression , literally meaning &quot;to be sausage to someone&quot; but meaning &quot;not cared about, to be unimportant&quot;.

=== Morphosyntax ===
Apart from vocabulary, the influence of German is noticeable in grammatical constructions, which are sometimes closer to German than to other Romance languages.

For instance, Romansh is the only Romance language in which indirect speech is formed using the subjunctive mood, as in Sursilvan , Putèr , &quot;He says that he is sick&quot;, as compared to Italian or French . Ricarda Liver attributes this to the influence of German. Limited to Sursilvan is the insertion of entire phrases between auxiliary verbs and participles as in &quot;Mariano Tschuor has spoken with Augustin Beeli&quot; as compared to Engadinese &quot;Rudolf Gasser has spoken with Gion Peider Mischol&quot;.

In contemporary spoken language, adjective forms are often not distinguished from adverbs, as in Sursilvan &quot;I am going directly&quot;, rather than . This usage is rare in most other Romance languages with a few sporadic exceptions as in French or Italian &quot;speak aloud&quot;, and the common usage in colloquial Romansh is likely an influence from German.

Especially noticeable and often criticized by language purists are particles such as , , , , , or , which have become an integral part of everyday Romansh speech, especially in Sursilvan.

Negation was originally formed by a double negative in all Romansh dialects. Today, this usage is limited to Surmiran as in &quot;I do not know&quot; (it has also been included in panregional Rumantsch Grischun). While the first particle was lost in Sursilvan, where negation is now formed only with as in , the Ladin varieties lost the second particle , apparently under the influence of Italian, as in Putér .

=== Romansh influences on German ===
The influence of Romansh on the local vernacular German has not been studied as thoroughly as vice versa. Apart from place names throughout the former speech area of Romansh, only a handful of Romansh words have become part of wider German usage. Such words include &quot;glacier&quot; or &quot;marmot&quot; (derived from Romansh ), as well as culinary items such as Maluns or Capuns. The Romansh influence is much stronger in the German dialects of Grisons. It is sometimes controversially suspected that the pronunciation or in words such as and , as opposed to in other Swiss German dialects ( and ), is an influence of Romansh.

In morphosyntax, the use of the auxiliary verb &quot;to come&quot; as opposed to &quot;will&quot; in phrases such as (&quot;put on warm clothes, otherwise you will get sick&quot;) in Grisons-German is sometimes attributed to Romansh, as well as the lack of a distinction between the accusative and dative case in some Grisons-German dialects and the word order in phrases such as (&quot;I would ask someone who knows&quot;). In addition, some words, neuter in most dialects of German, are masculine in Grisons-German. Examples include &quot;the bread&quot; or &quot;the money&quot;. Common words of Romansh origin in Grisons-German include &quot;bridegroom&quot; and &quot;bride&quot;, &quot;cart used for moving dung&quot;, and &quot;container made of wood&quot;. In areas where Romansh either is still spoken or has disappeared recently, Romansh words are even more common in the local dialects of German.

=== Attitudes towards language contact ===
The influence of German has been seen in different ways by linguists and language activists. The Italian dialectologist Ascoli for instance described Romansh as &quot;a body that has lost its soul and taken on an entirely foreign one in its place&quot; in the 1880s. This opinion was shared by many, who saw the influence of German as a threat to and corruption of Romansh, often referring to it as a disease infecting Romansh. This view was prevalent until after World War II, with many contemporary linguists and activists by contrast seeing these loan elements as completely natural and as an integral part of Romansh, which should be seen as an enrichment of the language. This position is currently held among others by the language activists Bernard Cathomas, Iso Camartin, or Alexi Decurtins, who argue for a relaxed attitude towards loan elements, which they point out are often among the most down-to-earth elements of the language, and that the dual nature of Romansh can also be seen as an advantage in being open to cultural elements from both sides. This position is also shared by several contemporary authors in particular from the Surselva, such as Arno Camenisch, who makes heavy use of Germanisms in his works.

== Literature, music and media ==
Romansh had a rich oral tradition before the appearance of Romansh writing, but apart from songs such as the &quot;Canzun da Sontga Margriata&quot;, virtually none of it survives. Prior to the 16th century, Romansh writings are known from only a few fragments, although the Swiss Literary Archives do have a number of collections of Romansh literature, spanning from the late 19th to the early 21st century.

The oldest known written records of Romansh dating from the period before 1500 are:
* the &quot;Würzburg manuscript&quot; (10th century);
* the &quot;Einsiedeln Homily&quot; dates from the early 12th century, discovered in 1907, and consists of a few lines, in an early form of the Romonsch dialect, of interlinear translation (with the original Latin text) of a sermon attributed to St Augustine;
* the &quot;Müstair linguistic monument&quot; dated 1389 and consisting of a fragment of a document about grazing rights on common land in the Val Müstair, it is a court testimony in Romansh attested in an otherwise Latin document:

The first substantial surviving work in Romansh is the &quot;Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da Müs&quot; written in the Putèr dialect in 1527 by Gian Travers. It is an epic poem describing the First Musso war which Travers himself had taken part in.

Subsequent works usually have religious themes, including Bible translations, manuals for religious instructions, and biblical plays. In 1560, the first Romansh translation of the New Testament: &quot;L&#x27;g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ&quot; by Giachem Bifrun, was published. Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the &quot;Cudesch da Psalms&quot;, a collection of Romansh church songs in the Vallader dialect. In the Sursilvan dialect, the first surviving works are also religious works such as catechism by Daniel Bonifaci, and in 1611 &quot;Ilg Vêr Sulaz da pievel giuvan&quot; (&quot;The true joys of young people&quot;), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later in 1615, a Catholic catechism &quot;Curt Mussament&quot; was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the New Testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel. The first complete translation of the Bible, the &quot;Bibla da Cuera&quot; was published between 1717 and 1719.

In music, choirs have a long tradition in the Romansh-speaking areas. Apart from traditional music and song, Romansh is also used in contemporary pop or hip-hop music, some of which has become known outside the Romansh-speaking regions, for instance, in the Eurovision Song Contest 1989, Switzerland was represented by a Romansh song, &quot;Viver senza tei&quot;. Since 2004, the hip-hop group Liricas Analas has become known even outside of Grisons through their Romansh songs. Other contemporary groups include the rock-band &quot;Passiunai&quot; with its lead singer Pascal Gamboni, or the rock/pop band The Capoonz. Composer Gion Antoni Derungs has written three operas with Romansh librettos: &quot;Il cerchel magic&quot; (1986), &quot;Il semiader&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tredeschin&quot; (2000).

Romansh is used to varying extents in newspapers, the radio, and television. Radio and television broadcasts in Romansh are produced by the Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha, which is part of the Swiss public broadcasting company SRG SSR. The radio Radio Rumantsch broadcasts a 24-hour program including informational and music broadcasts. The broadcasters generally speak their own regional dialect on the air, which is considered a key factor in familiarizing Romansh speakers with the dialects outside their home region. News broadcasts are generally in the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun. The two local radio stations Radio Grischa and Radio Engiadina occasionally broadcast in Romansh, but primarily use German. The Televisiun Rumantscha airs regular broadcasts on SF 1, which are subtitled in German. Programs include the informational broadcast , which is broadcast daily from Monday to Friday. The children&#x27;s show and the informational broadcast are aired on weekends. Additionally, the shows , , and others are broadcast during irregular intervals.

The Romansh newspapers used to be heavily fragmented by regions and dialects. The more long-lived newspapers included the &quot;Gasetta Romontscha&quot; in the Surselva, the &quot;Fögl Ladin&quot; in the Engadine, &quot;Casa Paterna/La Punt&quot; in the Sutselva, and &quot;La Pagina da Surmeir&quot; in the Surmeir. Due to financial difficulties, most of these merged into a pan-regional daily newspaper called &quot;La Quotidiana&quot; in 1997. This newspaper includes articles in all five dialects and in Rumantsch Grischun. Apart from &quot;La Quotidiana&quot;, &quot;La Pagina da Surmeir&quot; continues to be published to a regional audience, and the &quot;Engadiner Post&quot; includes two pages in Romansh. A Romansh news agency, the Agentura da Novitads Rumantscha, has been in existence since 1997.

Several Romansh-language magazines are also published regularly, including the youth magazine &quot;Punts&quot; and the yearly publications &quot;Calender Romontsch&quot; and &quot;Chalender Ladin&quot;.

In September 2018, &quot;Amur senza fin&quot;, the first-ever Romansh-language television film, debuted on Swiss national television.

== Sample text ==
The fable &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; by Aesop with a French version by Jean de La Fontaine; translated into the Dachsprache Rumantsch Grischun and all six dialects of Romansh: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and the similar-looking but noticeably different-sounding dialects Vallader and Jauer, as well as a translation into English.

<text>Robert Anthony Rodriguez (; born June 20, 1968) is an American filmmaker, composer, and visual effects supervisor. He shoots, edits, produces, and scores many of his films in Mexico and in his home state of Texas. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film &quot;El Mariachi&quot;, which was a commercial success after grossing $2.6 million ($5.5 million in 2023 dollars) against a budget of $7,000 ($14,937 in 2023 dollars). The film spawned two sequels known collectively as the &quot;Mexico Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995) and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003).

Rodriguez directed &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; in 1996 and developed its television series adaptation (2014–2016). He co-directed the 2005 neo-noir crime thriller anthology &quot;Sin City&quot; (adapted from the graphic novel of the same name) and the 2014 sequel, &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;.
He is also the creator of the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; franchise, as well as &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D&quot; (2005), &quot;Planet Terror&quot; (2007), &quot;Machete&quot; (2010), &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; (2020), and also directed &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

Rodriguez is a close friend and frequent collaborator of filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who founded the production company A Band Apart, of which Rodriguez was a member. In December 2013, Rodriguez launched his own cable television channel, El Rey.

==Early life==
Rodriguez was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Mexican parents Rebecca (&quot;née&quot; Villegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodríguez, a salesman. He began his interest in film at age eleven, when his father bought one of the first VCRs, which came with a camera.
While attending St. Anthony High School Seminary in San Antonio, Rodriguez was commissioned to videotape the school&#x27;s football games. According to his sister, he was fired soon afterward as he had shot footage in a cinematic style, getting shots of parents&#x27; reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. In high school, he met Carlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college.

Rodriguez went to the College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, where he also developed a love of cartooning. Not having grades high enough to be accepted into the school&#x27;s film program, he created a daily comic strip entitled &quot;Los Hooligans.&quot; Many of the characters were based on his siblings – in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic ran for three years in the student newspaper &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, while Rodriguez continued to make short films.

Rodriguez shot action and horror short films on video and edited on two VCRs. In late 1990, his entry in a local film contest earned him a spot in the university&#x27;s film program. There he made the award-winning 16 mm short &quot;Bedhead&quot; (1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an incredibly tangled mess of hair which she detests. Even at this early stage, Rodriguez&#x27;s trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with a sense of humor.

&quot;Bedhead&quot; was recognized for excellence in the Black Maria Film Festival. It was selected by Film/Video Curator Sally Berger for the Black Maria 20th-anniversary retrospective at MoMA in 2006.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
The short film &quot;Bedhead&quot; attracted enough attention to encourage him to seriously attempt a career as a filmmaker. He went on to shoot the action flick &quot;El Mariachi&quot; (1992) in Spanish; he shot it for around $7,000 with money raised by his friend Adrian Kano and from payments for his own participation in medical testing studies. During the process of these medical studies, he met Peter Marquardt, who went on to act in &quot;El Mariachi&quot;. Rodriguez won the Audience Award for this film at the Sundance Film Festival in 1993. Intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, the film was &quot;cleaned up&quot; by Columbia Pictures with post-production work costing several hundred thousand dollars before it was distributed in the United States. Its promotion still advertised it as &quot;the movie made for $7,000&quot;. Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book &quot;Rebel Without a Crew&quot; (1995).

=== Mainstream success ===

&quot;Desperado&quot; was a sequel to &quot;El Mariachi&quot; that starred Antonio Banderas and introduced Salma Hayek to international audiences as her English-language breakthrough role. Rodriguez went on to collaborate with Quentin Tarantino on the vampire thriller &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (also both co-producing its two sequels), and he wrote, directed, and produced the TV series for his own cable network, El Rey. Rodriguez has also worked with Kevin Williamson, on the sci-fi thriller film &quot;The Faculty&quot;.

Rodriguez, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America West, left and maintained financial core status in 2001.

That year, Rodriguez enjoyed his first Hollywood hit with &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, which went on to become a movie franchise. A third &quot;mariachi&quot; film also appeared in late 2003, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, which completed the Mexico Trilogy (also called the Mariachi Trilogy). He operates a production company called Troublemaker Studios, formerly Los Hooligans Productions.

Rodriguez co-directed &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), an adaptation of the comic books by Frank Miller; Quentin Tarantino guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodriguez insisted Miller be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller&#x27;s comic art to be just as important as his own in the film. However, the Directors Guild of America would not allow it, citing that only &quot;legitimate teams&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot;, the Wachowskis, could share the director&#x27;s credit. Rodriguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, &quot;It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I&#x27;d be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on.&quot; By resigning from the DGA, Rodriguez was forced to relinquish his director&#x27;s seat on the film &quot;John Carter of Mars&quot; for Paramount Pictures. Rodriguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completing &quot;Sin City&quot;.

&quot;Sin City&quot; was a critical hit in 2005 as well as a box office success, particularly for a hyperviolent comic book adaptation that did not have name recognition comparable to the &quot;X-Men&quot; or &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. He has an interest in adapting all of Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot; comic books.

Rodriguez released &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl&quot; in 2005, a superhero-kid movie intended for the same younger audiences as his &quot;Spy Kids&quot; series. &quot;Sharkboy and Lavagirl&quot; was based on a story conceived by Rodriguez&#x27;s 7-year-old son, Racer, who was given credit for the screenplay. The film grossed over $69 million worldwide at the box office.

Rodriguez wrote and directed the film &quot;Planet Terror&quot; as part of the double-bill release &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007). Quentin Tarantino directed &quot;Grindhouse&quot;&#x27;s other film.

He has a series of &quot;Ten Minute Film School&quot; segments on several of his DVD releases, showing aspiring filmmakers how to make good, profitable movies using inexpensive tactics. Starting with the &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; DVD, Rodriguez began creating a series called &quot;Ten Minute Cooking School&quot; in which he revealed his recipe for &quot;Puerco Pibil&quot; (based on Cochinita pibil, an old dish from Yucatán), the same food Johnny Depp&#x27;s character, Agent Sands, ate in the film. The popularity of this series led to the inclusion of another &quot;Cooking School&quot; on the two-disc version of the &quot;Sin City&quot; DVD where Rodriguez teaches the viewer how to make &quot;Sin City Breakfast Tacos&quot;, a dish (made for his cast and crew during late-night shoots and editing sessions) utilizing his grandmother&#x27;s tortilla recipe and different egg mixes for the filling. He had initially planned to release a third &quot;Cooking School&quot; with the DVD release of &quot;Planet Terror&quot; but then announced on the &quot;Film School&quot; segment of the DVD that he would put it on the &quot;Grindhouse&quot; DVD set instead. The Cooking School, titled &quot;Texas Barbecue...from the GRAVE!&quot;, is a dish based on the &quot;secret barbecue recipe&quot; of JT Hague, Jeff Fahey&#x27;s character in the film.

Rodriguez is a strong supporter of digital filmmaking, having been introduced to the practice by director George Lucas, who personally invited Rodriguez to use the digital cameras at Lucas&#x27;s headquarters. He was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2010 Austin Film Festival.

===&quot;Predators&quot;===
In 2010, Rodriguez produced a new Predator sequel, entitled &quot;Predators&quot;. This film&#x27;s script was based on early drafts he had written after seeing the original. Rodriguez&#x27;s ideas included a planet-sized game preserve and various creatures used by the Predators to hunt a group of abducted yet skilled humans. Opening to mostly positive reviews, the film fared reasonably well at the box office.

===&quot;Machete&quot;===

&quot;Machete&quot; is a feature film directed by Rodriguez and released in September 2010. It is an expansion of a fake trailer Rodriguez directed for the 2007 film &quot;Grindhouse&quot;. It starred Danny Trejo as the title character. Trejo, Rodriguez&#x27;s 2nd cousin, has worked with him in some of his other movies such as &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, where Trejo first appeared as Machete. Although originally announced to be released direct-to-DVD as an extra on the &quot;Planet Terror&quot; DVD, the film was produced as a theatrical release.

According to Rodriguez, the origins of the film go back to &quot;Desperado&quot;. He says, &quot;When I met Danny, I said, &#x27;This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.&#x27; So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in &quot;Desperado&quot;. &quot;So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don&#x27;t want to get their own agents killed on, they&#x27;ll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, &quot;That&#x27;s &quot;Machete&quot;. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it&#x27;s peanuts.&quot; But I never got around to making it.&quot;

Rodriguez hoped to film &quot;Machete&quot; at the same time as &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;. Additionally, during Comic-Con International 2008, he took the time to speak about Machete, including such topics as: status, possible sequels after the release of Machete, and production priorities. It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions, including &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico. [&quot;Citation Needed] &quot;Machete&quot; was released in theaters September 3, 2010, in the U.S.

On May 5, 2010, Rodriguez responded to Arizona&#x27;s controversial immigration law by releasing an &quot;illegal&quot; trailer on Ain&#x27;t It Cool News. The fake trailer combined elements of the &quot;Machete&quot; trailer that appeared in &quot;Grindhouse&quot; with footage from the actual film, and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes. Several movie websites, including Internet Movie Database, reported that it was the official teaser for the film. However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining &quot;it was Cinco de Mayo and I had too much tequila.&quot;

=== Streaming projects ===
In May 2020, Rodriguez announced, via an Instagram post in which he posed with a puppet of Grogu, that he would direct an episode from the second season of the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, part of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He also tweeted a video of himself on the set of the episode playing a guitar next to Grogu. Rodriguez was also an executive producer on &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; released in December 2021, where he also voiced Dokk Strassi and Mok Shaiz.

In 2020, Rodriguez wrote and directed &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot;, a &quot;Sharkboy and Lavagirl&quot; spinoff, which was released on December 25, 2020, on Netflix to mixed reviews.

In August 2021, Rodriguez had signed a two-year first-look deal with HBO and HBO Max.

In 2023, he released &quot;Spy Kids: Armageddon&quot; on Netflix. The film received mixed reviews from critics.

=== Unrealized projects ===
Since 1998, Rodriguez has owned the film rights to Mike Allred&#x27;s off-beat comic &quot;Madman&quot;. The two have hinted at the project being close to beginning on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first. (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodriguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production of &quot;Sin City&quot;.) In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic book &quot;The Golden Plates&quot;, announced that a screenplay by George Huang was near completion. Allred announced at the 2006 WonderCon that production would likely commence on &quot;Madman the Movie&quot; in 2006. Huang is friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal with Columbia Pictures where Huang was an employee.

In May 2007, it was announced that Rodriguez had signed on to direct a remake of &quot;Barbarella&quot; for a 2008 release. At the 2007 Comic-Con convention, actress Rosario Dawson announced that because of &quot;Barbarella&quot;, production of &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; would be put on hold. She also announced that she would be playing an amazon in the Barbarella film. As of June 2008, plans to remake the film Barbarella with Rose McGowan as the lead have been delayed; the actress and director were instead remaking the film &quot;Red Sonja&quot;.

In May 2008, Rodriguez was said to be shopping around a prison drama television series called &quot;Woman in Chains!&quot;, with Rose McGowan being a possibility for a lead role. In May 2009, Rodriguez planned to produce a live-action remake of &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, a 1983 film collaboration between painter Frank Frazetta and animator Ralph Bakshi. The deal was closed shortly after Frazetta&#x27;s death.

In 2011, Rodriguez announced at Comic-Con that he had purchased the film rights to &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios.

In November 2015, it was announced that Rodriguez directed the film &quot;100 Years&quot;, which would not be released until 2115.

In March 2017, it was announced that Rodriguez would direct a remake of the dystopian sci-fi action film &quot;Escape from New York&quot;, with original director John Carpenter producing.

== Appearances ==
Rodriguez has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27;s book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rodriguez announced in April 2006 that he and his wife Elizabeth Avellán, with whom he had five children, had separated after 16 years of marriage.

He reportedly had a &quot;dalliance&quot; with actress Rose McGowan during the shooting of &quot;Grindhouse&quot;. In October 2007, &quot;Elle Magazine&quot; revealed that Rodriguez had cast McGowan in the title role in his remake of &quot;Barbarella&quot;. They split up in October 2009.

In October 2010, he walked Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez in &quot;Spy Kids&quot; series) down the aisle at her wedding to producer Sean Covel.

In March 2014, Rodriguez showed his collection of Frank Frazetta original paintings in Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival.

==Style==
Rodriguez not only has the credits of producing, directing and writing his films, he also frequently serves as editor, director of photography, camera operator, steadicam operator, composer, production designer, visual effects supervisor, and sound editor on his films. This has earned him the nickname of &quot;the one-man film crew&quot;. He abbreviates his numerous roles in his film credits; &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;, for instance, is &quot;shot, chopped, and scored by Robert Rodriguez&quot;, and &quot;Sin City&quot; is &quot;shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez&quot;.

He calls his style of making movies &quot;Mariachi-style&quot; (in reference to his first feature film &quot;El Mariachi&quot;) in which (according to the back cover of his book &quot;Rebel Without a Crew&quot;) &quot;Creativity, not money, is used to solve problems.&quot; He prefers to work at night, spending his day-time hours with his kids, when they&#x27;re home, and says that he believes many creative people are &quot;night people&quot;.

In his book &quot;The DV Rebel&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Stu Maschwitz coined the term &quot;Robert Rodriguez list&quot;, i.e. the filmmaker compiling a list of things they have access to like cool cars, apartments, horses, samurai swords and so on, and then writing the screenplay based on that list.

Rodriguez wrote a blurb for the book that stated:
I&#x27;d been wanting to write a book for the new breed of digital filmmakers, but now I don&#x27;t have to. My pal and fellow movie maker Stu Maschwitz has compressed years of experience into this thorough guide. Don&#x27;t make a movie without reading this book!

==Influences==
Robert Rodriguez has brought a number of his favorite and most influential directors on his television show, &quot;The Director&#x27;s Chair&quot;. Some of these directors included John Carpenter, Quentin Tarantino, and George Miller. 

Rodriguez&#x27;s favorite movie as a child was &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;, and admits that film, alongside &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, various &quot;James Bond&quot; films and various Ray Harryhaussen films influenced and inspired him while he was working on the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; series.

He also said on IGN that children will support anything that is empowering to them, citing &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, saying &quot;You can&#x27;t understand, &#x27;Why do you like Power Rangers?&#x27; Well, it&#x27;s empowerment, and children – especially younger children – they need their mom just to go to the mall, you know? They can&#x27;t drive themselves wherever they want. So when they see kids being very empowered, flying around in jet packs, being proactive, it&#x27;s empowering to them&quot;.

==Collaborations==
Rodriguez has cast certain actors in more than one of his projects. Danny Trejo has appeared in ten of his projects, while Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Cheech Marin have all appeared in seven; Alexa PenaVega has appeared in six, and Jessica Alba, Daryl Sabara, Tom Savini, and Patricia Vonne have all appeared in five.

<text>Romantic comedy (also known as romcom or rom-com) is a sub-genre of comedy and romance fiction, focusing on lighthearted, humorous plot lines centered on romantic ideas, such as how true love is able to surmount all obstacles.

==History==
Comedies, rooted in the fertility rites and satyr plays of ancient Greece, have often incorporated sexual or social elements.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms&quot; defines romantic comedy as &quot;a general term for comedies that deal mainly with the follies and misunderstandings of young lovers, in a light‐hearted and happily concluded manner which usually avoids serious satire&quot;. This reference states that the &quot;best‐known examples are Shakespeare&#x27;s comedies of the late 1590s, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;As You Like It&quot; being the most purely romantic, while &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; approaches the comedy of manners and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; is closer to tragicomedy.&quot;

It was not until the development of the literary tradition of romantic love in the western European medieval period, though, that &quot;romance&quot; came to refer to &quot;romantic love&quot; situations. They were previously referred to as the heroic adventures of medieval Romance. Those adventures traditionally focused on a knight&#x27;s feats on behalf of a lady, so the modern themes of love were quickly woven into them, as in Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;.

The contemporary romantic comedy genre was shaped by 18th-century Restoration comedy and 19th-century romantic melodrama. Restoration comedies were typically comedies of manners that relied on knowledge of the complex social rules of high society, particularly related to navigating the marriage-market, an inherent feature of the plot in many of these plays, such as William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot;. While the melodramas of the Romantic period had little to do with comedy, they were hybrids incorporating elements of domestic and sentimental tragedies, pantomime &quot;with an emphasis on gesture, on the body, and the thrill of the chase,&quot; and other genres of expression such as songs and folk tales.

In the 20th century, as Hollywood grew, the romantic comedy in America mirrored other aspects of society in its rapid changes, developing many sub-genres through the decades. We can see this through the screwball comedy in response to the censorship of the Hays Code in the 1920s–1930s, the career woman comedy 
(such as George Stevens&#x27; &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) post-WWII, and the sex comedy made popular by Rock Hudson and Doris Day in the 1950s–1960s.

==Evolution==

Over the years, romantic comedies have slowly been becoming more popular to both men and women. They have begun to spread out of their conventional and traditional structure into other territory, and to explore more complex topics. These films still follow the typical plot of &quot;a light and humorous movie, play, etc., whose central plot is a happy love story&quot; but with more complexity. 

Some romantic comedies have adopted special circumstances for the main characters, as in &quot;Warm Bodies&quot; where the protagonist is a zombie who falls in love with a human girl after eating her boyfriend. The effect of their love towards each other is that it starts spreading to the other zombies and even starts to cure them. With the zombie cure, the two main characters can now be together since they do not have a barrier between them anymore. Another strange set of circumstances is in &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot; where the two protagonists are building a relationship while trying to make a pornographic film together. Both these films take the typical story arc and then add strange circumstances to add originality.

Other romantic comedies flip the standard conventions of the romantic comedy genre. In films like &quot;500 Days of Summer&quot;, the two main interests do not end up together, leaving the protagonist somewhat distraught. Other films, like &quot;Adam,&quot; have the two main interests end up separated but still content and pursuing other goals and love interests.

Some romantic comedies use reversal of gender roles to add comedic effect. These films contain characters who possess qualities that diverge from the gender role that society has imposed upon them, as seen in &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall,&quot; in which the male protagonist is especially in touch with his emotions. It can also be seen in &quot;Made of Honor,&quot; in which the female bridesmaids are shown in a negative and somewhat masculine light in order to advance the likability of the male lead.

Other remakes of romantic comedies involve similar elements, but they explore more adult themes such as marriage, responsibility, or even disability. Two films by Judd Apatow, &quot;This Is 40&quot; and &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, deal with these issues. &quot;This Is 40&quot; chronicles the mid-life crisis of a couple entering their 40s, and &quot;Knocked Up&quot; addresses unintended pregnancy and the ensuing assuming of responsibility. &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; deals with mental illness and the courage to start a new relationship.

All of these go against the stereotype of what romantic comedy has become as a genre. Yet, the genre of romantic comedy is simply a structure, and all of these elements do not negate the fact that these films are still romantic comedies.

==Contrived romantic encounters: the &quot;meet cute&quot;==
One of the conventions of romantic comedy films is the entertainment factor in a contrived encounter of two potential romantic partners in unusual or comic circumstances, which film critics such as Roger Ebert or the Associated Press&#x27;s Christy Lemire have called a &quot;meet-cute&quot; situation. During a &quot;meet-cute&quot;, scriptwriters often create a sense of awkwardness between the two potential partners by depicting an initial clash of personalities or beliefs, an embarrassing situation, or by introducing a comical misunderstanding or mistaken identity situation. Sometimes, the term is used without a hyphen (a &quot;meet cute&quot;), or as a verb (&quot;to meet cute&quot;).

Roger Ebert describes the &quot;concept of a Meet Cute&quot; as &quot;when in a cute way.&quot; As an example, he cites &quot;The Meet Cute in &quot;Lost and Found&quot; [which] has Jackson and Segal running their cars into each other in Switzerland. Once recovered, they Meet Cute again when they run into each other while on skis. Eventually, they fall in love.&quot;

In many romantic comedies, the potential couple comprises polar opposites, two people of different temperaments, situations, social statuses, or all three (&quot;It Happened One Night&quot;), who would not meet or talk under normal circumstances, and the meet cute&#x27;s contrived situation provides the opportunity for these two people to meet.
