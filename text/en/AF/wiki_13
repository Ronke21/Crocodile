<text>Polygamy (from Late Greek , &quot;state of marriage to many spouses&quot;) is the practice of marrying multiple spouses. When a man is married to more than one wife at the same time, it is called polygyny. When a woman is married to more than one husband at the same time, it is called polyandry. In sociobiology and zoology, researchers use &quot;polygamy&quot; in a broad sense to mean any form of multiple mating.

In contrast to polygamy, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties. Like &quot;monogamy&quot;, the term &quot;polygamy&quot; is often used in a &quot;de facto&quot; sense, applied regardless of whether a state recognizes the relationship. In many countries, the law only recognises monogamous marriages (a person can only have one spouse, and bigamy is illegal), but adultery is not illegal, leading to a situation of &quot;de facto&quot; polygamy being allowed without legal recognition for non-official &quot;spouses&quot;.

Worldwide, different societies variously encourage, accept or outlaw polygamy. In societies which allow or tolerate polygamy, polygyny is the accepted form in the vast majority of cases. According to the &quot;Ethnographic Atlas Codebook&quot;, of 1,231 societies noted between from 1960 to 1980, 588 had frequent polygyny, 453 had occasional polygyny, 186 were monogamous, and 4 had polyandryalthough more recent research found some form of polyandry in 53 communities, which is more common than previously thought. In cultures which practice polygamy, its prevalence among that population often correlates with social class and socioeconomic status. Polygamy (taking the form of polygyny) is most common in a region known as the &quot;polygamy belt&quot; in West Africa and Central Africa, with the countries estimated to have the highest polygamy prevalence in the world being Burkina Faso, Mali, Gambia, Niger and Nigeria.

==Biological and social distinctions==
The term &quot;polygamy&quot; may be referring to one of various relational types, depending upon context. Four overlapping definitions can be adapted from the work of Ulrich Reichard and others:
* &quot;Marital polygamy&quot; occurs when an individual is married to more than one person. The other spouses may or may not be married to one another.
* &quot;Social polygamy&quot; occurs when an individual has multiple partners that they live with, have sex with, and cooperate with in acquiring basic resources (such as shelter, food and money).
* &quot;Sexual polygamy&quot; refers to individuals who have more than one sexual partner or who have sex partners outside of a primary relationship.
* &quot;Genetic polygamy&quot; refers to sexual relationships that result in children who have genetic evidence of different paternity.

Biologists, biological anthropologists, and behavioral ecologists often use &quot;polygamy&quot; in the sense of a lack of sexual or genetic (reproductive) exclusivity. When cultural or social anthropologists and other social scientists use the term polygamy, the meaning is social or marital polygamy.

In contrast, marital monogamy may be distinguished between:
# &quot;classical monogamy&quot;, &quot;a single relationship between people who marry as virgins, remain sexually exclusive their entire lives, and become celibate upon the death of the partner&quot;
# &quot;serial monogamy&quot;, marriage with only one other person at a time, in contrast to bigamy or polygamy Some definitions of serial monogamy consider it to be polygamy, as it can result in evidence of genetic polygamy. It can also be considered polygamy for anthropological reasons.

Outside of the legal sphere, defining polygamy can be difficult because of differences in cultural assumptions regarding monogamy. Some societies believe that monogamy requires limiting sexual activity to a single partner for life. Others accept or endorse pre-marital sex prior to marriage. Some societies consider sex outside of marriage or &quot;spouse swapping&quot; to be socially acceptable. Some consider a relationship monogamous even if partners separate and move to a new monogamous relationship through death, divorce, or simple dissolution of the relationship, regardless of the length of the relationship (serial monogamy). Anthropologists characterize human beings as “mildly polygynous” or “monogamous with polygynous tendencies.” The average pre-historic man with modern descendants appears to have had children with between 1.5 women (70,000 years ago) to 3.3 women (45,000 years ago), except in East Asia. While the forms of non-monogamy in prehistorical times is unknown, these rates could be consistent with a society that practices serial monogamy. Anthropological observations indicate that even when polygyny is accepted in the community, the majority of relationships in the society are monogamous in practice – while couples remain in the relationship, which may not be lifelong. Thus, in many historical communities, serial monogamy may have been the accepted practice rather than a lifelong monogamous bond. The genetic record indicates that monogamy increased within the last 5,000-10,000 years, a period associated with the development of human agriculture, non-communal land ownership, and inheritance.

==Forms==
Polygamy exists in three specific forms:
* Polygyny, where a man has multiple simultaneous wives
* Polyandry, where a woman has multiple simultaneous husbands
* Group marriage, where the family unit consists of multiple husbands and multiple wives of legal age

===Polygyny===


====Incidence====

Polygyny, the practice wherein a man has more than one wife at the same time, is by far the most common form of polygamy. Many Muslim-majority countries and some countries with sizable Muslim minorities accept polygyny to varying extents both legally and culturally. In several countries, such as India, the law only recognizes polygamous marriages for the Muslim population. Islamic law or &quot;sharia&quot; is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition which allows polygyny. It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the Quran and the hadith. In Arabic, the term &quot;sharīʿah&quot; refers to God&#x27;s (Arabic: الله Allāh) immutable divine law and is contrasted with &quot;fiqh&quot;, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.

Polygyny is more widespread in Africa than on any other continent, especially in West Africa, and some scholars see the slave trade&#x27;s impact on the male-to-female sex ratio as a key factor in the emergence and fortification of polygynous practices in regions of Africa. In the region of sub-Saharan Africa, polygyny is common and deeply rooted in the culture, with 11% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa living in such marriages (25% of the Muslim population and 3% of the Christian population, as of 2019). According to Pew, polygamy is widespread in a cluster of countries in West and Central Africa, including Burkina Faso, (36%), Mali (34%) and Nigeria (28%).

Anthropologist Jack Goody&#x27;s comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated a historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygamy in the majority of sub-Saharan African societies. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies between the male-dominated intensive plough-agriculture common in Eurasia and the extensive shifting horticulture found in sub-Saharan Africa. In some of the sparsely-populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place in Africa, women do much of the work. This favours polygamous marriages in which men seek to monopolize the production of women &quot;who are valued both as workers and as child bearers&quot;. Goody however, observes that the correlation is imperfect and varied, and also discusses more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those traditionally common in much of West Africa, especially in the West African savanna, where more agricultural work is done by men, and where polygyny is desired by men more for the generation of male offspring whose labor is valued.

Anthropologists Douglas R. White and Michael L. Burton discuss and support Jack Goody&#x27;s observation regarding African male farming systems in &quot;Causes of Polygyny: Ecology, Economy, Kinship, and Warfare&quot; where these authors note:

An analysis by James Fenske (2012) found that child mortality and ecologically related economic shocks had a significant association with rates of polygamy in sub-Saharan Africa, rather than female agricultural contributions (which are typically relatively small in the West African savanna and sahel, where polygyny rates are higher), finding that polygyny rates decrease significantly with child mortality rates.

==== Types of polygyny ====
Polygynous marriages fall into two types: &quot;sororal polygyny&quot;, in which the co-wives are sisters, and &quot;non-sororal&quot;, where the co-wives are not related. Polygyny offers husbands the benefit of allowing them to have more children, may provide them with a larger number of productive workers (where workers are family), and allows them to establish politically useful ties with a greater number of kin groups. Senior wives can benefit as well when the addition of junior wives to the family lightens their workload. Wives&#x27;, especially senior wives&#x27;, status in a community can increase through the addition of other wives, who add to the family&#x27;s prosperity or symbolize conspicuous consumption (much as a large house, domestic help, or expensive vacations operate in a western country). For such reasons, senior wives sometimes work hard or contribute from their own resources to enable their husbands to accumulate the bride price for an extra wife.

Polygyny may also result from the practice of levirate marriage. In such cases, the deceased man&#x27;s heir may inherit his assets and wife; or, more usually, his brothers may marry the widow. This provides support for the widow and her children (usually also members of the brothers&#x27; kin group) and maintains the tie between the husbands&#x27; and wives&#x27; kin groups. The sororate resembles the levirate, in that a widower must marry the sister of his dead wife. The family of the late wife, in other words, must provide a replacement for her, thus maintaining the marriage alliance. Both levirate and sororate may result in a man having multiple wives.
In monogamous societies, wealthy and powerful men may establish enduring relationships with, and established separate household for, multiple female partners, aside from their legitimate wives; a practice accepted in Imperial China up until the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). This constitutes a form of &quot;&quot; polygyny referred to as &quot;concubinage&quot;.

====Household organization====
Marriage is the moment at which a new household is formed, but different arrangements may occur depending upon the type of marriage and some polygamous marriages do not result in the formation of a single household. In many polygynous marriages the husband&#x27;s wives may live in separate households. They can thus be described as a &quot;series of linked nuclear families with a &#x27;father&#x27; in common&quot;.

===Polyandry===
====Incidence====

Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband at one time, is much less prevalent than polygyny. It is specifically provided in the legal codes of some countries, such as Gabon.

Polyandry is believed to be more common in societies with scarce environmental resources, as it is believed to limit human population growth and enhance child survival. It is a rare form of marriage that exists not only among poor families, but also the elite. For example, in the Himalayan Mountains polyandry is related to the scarcity of land; the marriage of all brothers in a family to the same wife allows family land to remain intact and undivided. If every brother married separately and had children, family land would be split into unsustainable small plots. In Europe, this outcome was avoided through the social practice of impartible inheritance, under which most siblings would be disinherited.

====Types====
&quot;Fraternal polyandry&quot; was traditionally practiced among nomadic Tibetans in Nepal, parts of China and part of northern India, in which two or more brothers would marry the same woman. It is most common in societies marked by high male mortality. It is associated with &quot;partible paternity&quot;, the cultural belief that a child can have more than one father.

&quot;Non-fraternal polyandry&quot; occurs when the wives&#x27; husbands are unrelated, as among the Nayar tribe of India, where girls undergo a ritual marriage before puberty, and the first husband is acknowledged as the father of all her children. However, the woman may never cohabit with that man, taking multiple lovers instead; these men must acknowledge the paternity of their children (and hence demonstrate that no caste prohibitions have been breached) by paying the midwife. The women remain in their maternal home, living with their brothers, and property is passed matrilineally. A similar form of matrilineal, de facto polyandry can be found in the institution of walking marriage among the Mosuo tribe of China.

===Serial monogamy===
Serial monogamy refers to remarriage after divorce or death of a spouse from a monogamous marriage, i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time (a series of monogamous relationships).

According to Danish scholar Miriam K. Zeitzen, anthropologists treat serial monogamy, in which divorce and remarriage occur, as a form of polygamy as it also can establish a series of households that may continue to be tied by shared paternity and shared income. As such, they are similar to the household formations created through divorce and serial monogamy.

Serial monogamy creates a new kind of relative, the &quot;ex-&quot;. The &quot;ex-wife&quot;, for example, can remain an active part of her &quot;ex-husband&#x27;s&quot; life, as they may be tied together by legally or informally mandated economic support, which can last for years, including by alimony, child support, and joint custody. Bob Simpson, the British social anthropologist, notes that it creates an &quot;extended family&quot; by tying together a number of households, including mobile children. He says that Britons may have ex‑wives or ex‑brothers‑in‑law, but not an &quot;ex‑child&quot;. According to him, these &quot;unclear families&quot; do not fit the mold of the monogamous nuclear family.

===Group marriage===

Group marriage is a non-monogamous marriage-like arrangement where three or more adults live together, all considering themselves partners, sharing finances, children, and household responsibilities. Polyamory is on a continuum of family-bonds that includes group marriage. The term does not refer to bigamy as no claim to being married in formal legal terms is made.

==Scientific and prehistorical perspectives==
Scientific studies classify humans as &quot;mildly polygynous&quot; or &quot;monogamous with polygynous tendencies.&quot; As mentioned above, data from 1960 to 1980 in the &quot;Ethnographic Atlas Codebook&quot; indicated that polygamy was common. A separate 1988 review examined the practices of 849 societies from before Western imperialism and colonization. The review found that 708 of the societies (83%) accepted polygyny. Only 16% were monogamous and 1% polyandrous. Subsequent evidence in 2012 found that polyandry (in which women have multiple male partners) was likely in pre-history; it also identified 53 communities studied between 1912 and 2010 with either formal or informal polyandry, indicating that polyandry was more common worldwide than previously believed. The authors found that polyandry was most common in egalitarian societies, and suspected contributors to polyandry included fewer men (due to the existence or threat of high adult male mortality or absence/travel) and higher male contributions towards food production. Polyandry still appears to occur in the minority of societies. Regardless of the type of polygamy, even when polygyny is accepted in the community, the majority of relationships in the society are monogamous in practice – while couples remain in the relationship, which may not be lifelong. In many historical communities, serial monogamy may have been the accepted practice rather than a lifelong monogamous bond. How monogamy is defined when it comes to accepted sexual activity outside of the relationship, however, may differ by society.

Recent anthropological data suggest that the modern concept of life-long monogamy has been in place for only the last 1,000 years. Genetic evidence has demonstrated that a greater proportion of men began contributing to the genetic pool between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, which suggests that reproductive monogamy became more common at that time. This would correspond to the Neolithic agricultural revolution. During this time, formerly nomadic societies began to claim and settle land for farming, leading to the advent of property ownership and therefore inheritance. Men would therefore seek to ensure that their land would go to direct descendants and had a vested interest in limiting the sexual activities of their reproductive partners. It is possible that the concept of marriage and permanent monogamy evolved at this time.

Other scientific arguments for monogamy prior to 2003 were based on characteristics of reproductive physiology, such as sperm competition, sexual selection in primates, and body size characteristics. A 2019 synthesis of these and other data found that the weight of the evidence supports a mating bond that may include polygyny or polyandry, but is most likely to be predominantly serial monogamy.

More recent genetic data has clarified that, in most regions throughout history, a smaller proportion of men contributed to human genetic history compared to women. Assuming an equal number of men and women are born and survive to reproduce, this would indicate that historically, only a subset of men fathered children and did so with multiple women (and may suggest that many men either did not procreate or did not have children that survived to create modern ancestors). This circumstance could occur for several reasons, but there are three common interpretations:
# The first interpretation is a harem model, where one man will out-compete other men (presumably through acts of violence or power) for exclusive sexual access to a group of women. Groups of women could be related or unrelated. This does not seem to reflect real-world observations in more modern polygyny societies, where the majority of individuals seldom have more than one partner at a time.
# Second, it may suggest that some men had either more sex or more reproductive success with multiple women simultaneously; this could be caused by sexual liaisons outside of a lifelong &quot;monogamous&quot; relationship (which may or may not be acceptable in their society), having multiple committed partners at once (polygyny), or simply sexual reproduction with multiple partners entirely outside of committed relationships (i.e., casual sex without relationships or pair-bonding).
# Third, it may suggest that some men were more likely than other men to have a series of monogamous relationships that led to children with different women throughout the man&#x27;s life (serial monogamy). There are a variety of explanations for this that range from the woman&#x27;s decisions (the man&#x27;s perceived attractiveness or ability to produce food) to the man&#x27;s (social or coercive power).

The serial monogamy interpretation of genetic history would be congruent with other findings, such as the fact that humans form pair bonds (although not necessarily for life) and that human fathers invest in at least the early upbringing of their children. Serial monogamy would also be consistent with the existence of a &quot;honeymoon period&quot;, a period of intense interest in a single sexual partner (with less interest in other women) which may help to keep men invested in staying with the mother of their child for this period. When reciprocated, this &quot;honeymoon period&quot; lasts 18 months to three years in most cases. This would correspond to the period necessary to bring a child to relative independence in the traditionally small, interdependent, communal societies of pre-Neolithic humans, before they settled into agricultural communities.

While genetic evidence typically displays a bias towards a smaller number of men reproducing with more women, some regions or time periods have shown the opposite. In a 2019 investigation, Musharoff et al. applied modern techniques to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 high-coverage Complete Genomics whole-genome dataset. They found that the Southern Han Chinese had a male bias (45% female, indicating that women were likely to reproduce with multiple men). This region is known for its lack of a concept of paternity and for a sense of female equality or superiority. The Musharoff study also found a male bias in Europeans (20% female) during an out-of-Africa migration event that may have increased the number of men successfully reproducing with women, perhaps by replenishing the genetic pool in Europe. The study did confirm a more typical female bias in Yorubans (63% female), Europeans (84%), Punjabis (82%), and Peruvians (56%).

==Religious attitudes towards polygamy==

===Buddhism===
Buddhism does not regard marriage as a sacrament; it is purely a secular affair. Normally Buddhist monks do not participate in it (though in some sects priests and monks do marry). Hence marriage receives no religious sanction. Forms of marriage, in consequence, vary from country to country. The Parabhava Sutta states that &quot;a man who is not satisfied with one woman and seeks out other women is on the path to decline&quot;. Other fragments in the Buddhist scripture seem to treat polygamy unfavorably, leading some authors to conclude that Buddhism generally does not approve of it or alternatively regards it as a tolerated, but subordinate, marital model.

Polygamy in Thailand was legally recognized until 1935. Polygamy in Myanmar was outlawed in 2015. In Sri Lanka, polyandry was legal in the kingdom of Kandy, but outlawed by British after conquering the kingdom in 1815. When the Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese, the concubines of others were added to the list of inappropriate partners. Polyandry in Tibet was traditionally common, as was polygyny, and having several wives or husbands was never regarded as having sex with inappropriate partners.
Most typically, fraternal polyandry is practiced, but sometimes father and son have a common wife, which is a unique family structure in the world. Other forms of marriage are also present, like group marriage and monogamous marriage. Polyandry (especially fraternal polyandry) is also common in Tibet

===Celtic traditions===
Some pre-Christian Celtic pagans were known to practice polygamy, although the Celtic peoples wavered between it, monogamy and polyandry depending on the time period and the area. In some areas this continued even after Christianization began, for instance the Brehon Laws of Gaelic Ireland explicitly allowed for polygamy, especially amongst the noble class. Some modern Celtic pagan religions accept the practice of polygamy to varying degrees, though how widespread the practice is within these religions is unknown.

===Christianity===

Although the Old Testament describes numerous examples of polygamy among devotees to God, most Christian groups have rejected the practice of polygamy and have upheld monogamy alone as normative. Nevertheless, some Christians groups in different periods have practiced, or currently do practice, polygamy. Some Christians actively debate whether the New Testament or Christian ethics allows or forbids polygamy.

In the New Testament, Jesus recalled the earlier scriptures, noting that a man and a wife &quot;shall become one flesh&quot;. 
Paul stated in one of his letters that &quot;For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does&quot;.

However, some look to Paul&#x27;s writings to the Corinthians: &quot;Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, &#x27;The two will become one flesh. Supporters of polygamy claim that this verse indicates that the term refers to a physical, rather than a spiritual, union. Such a claim also contradicts Paul&#x27;s statement regarding authority other each other&#x27;s bodies.

Some Christian theologians argue that in Matthew 19:3–9 and referring to Genesis 2:24, Jesus explicitly states a man should have only one wife:
1 Timothy 3:2 states:
 See verse 12 regarding deacons having only one wife. Similar counsel is repeated in the first chapter of the Epistle to Titus.

Periodically, Christian reform movements that have sought to rebuild Christian doctrine based on the Bible alone (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;) have temporarily accepted polygyny as a Biblical practice. For example, during the Protestant Reformation, in a document which was simply referred to as &quot;Der Beichtrat&quot; (or &quot;The Confessional Advice&quot; ), Martin Luther granted the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, who, for many years, had been living &quot;constantly in a state of adultery and fornication&quot;, a dispensation to take a second wife. The double marriage was to be done in secret, however, to avoid public scandal. Some fifteen years earlier, in a letter to the Saxon Chancellor Gregor Brück, Luther stated that he could not &quot;forbid a person to marry several wives, for it does not contradict Scripture.&quot; (&quot;Ego sane fateor, me non posse prohibere, si quis plures velit uxores ducere, nec repugnat sacris literis.&quot;)

In Sub-Saharan Africa, tensions have frequently erupted between advocates of the Christian insistence on monogamy and advocates of the traditional practice of polygamy. For instance, Mswati III, the Christian king of Eswatini, has 15 wives. In some instances in recent times, there have been moves for accommodation; in other instances, churches have strongly resisted such moves. African Independent Churches have sometimes referred to those parts of the Old Testament that describe polygamy in defense of the practice.

The illegality of polygamy in certain areas creates, according to certain Bible passages, additional arguments against it. Paul the Apostle writes &quot;submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience&quot; (Romans 13:5), for &quot;the authorities that exist have been established by God.&quot; (Romans 13:1) St Peter concurs when he says to &quot;submit yourselves for the Lord&#x27;s sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.&quot; (1 Peter 2:13,14) Pro-polygamists argue that, as long as polygamists currently do not obtain legal marriage licenses nor seek &quot;common law marriage status&quot; for additional spouses, no enforced laws are being broken any more than when monogamous couples similarly co-habitate without a marriage license.

====Roman Catholic Church====
The Roman Catholic Church condemns polygamy; the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; lists it in paragraph 2387 under the head &quot;Other offenses against the dignity of marriage&quot; and states that it &quot;is not in accord with the moral law.&quot; Also in paragraph 1645 under the head &quot;The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love&quot; states &quot;The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is made clear in the equal personal dignity which must be accorded to husband and wife in mutual and unreserved affection. Polygamy is contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.&quot;

Saint Augustine saw a conflict with Old Testament polygamy. He refrained from judging the patriarchs, but did not deduce from their practice the ongoing acceptability of polygyny. On the contrary, he argued that the polygamy of the Fathers, which was tolerated by the Creator because of fertility, was a diversion from His original plan for human marriage. Augustine wrote: &quot;That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself.&quot;

Augustine taught that the reason patriarchs had many wives was not because of fornication, but because they wanted more children. He supported his premise by showing that their marriages, in which husband was the head, were arranged according to the rules of good management: those who are &quot;in command&quot; (&quot;quae principantur&quot;) in their society were always singular, while &quot;subordinates&quot; (&quot;subiecta&quot;) were multiple. He gave two examples of such relationships: &quot;dominus-servus&quot; – master-servant (in older translation: &quot;slave&quot;) and &quot;God-soul&quot;. The Bible often equates worshiping multiple gods, i.e. idolatry to fornication. Augustine relates to that: &quot;On this account there is no True God of souls, save One: but one soul by means of many false gods may commit fornication, but not be made fruitful.&quot;

As tribal populations grew, fertility was no longer a valid justification of polygamy: it &quot;was lawful among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce (utrum et nunc fas sit, non temere dixerim). For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was, when, even when wives bear children, it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful.&quot;

Augustine saw marriage as a covenant between one man and one woman, which may not be broken. It was the Creator who established monogamy: &quot;Therefore, the first natural bond of human society is man and wife.&quot; Such marriage was confirmed by the Saviour in the Gospel of Matthew (Mat 19:9) and by His presence at the wedding in Cana (John 2:2). In the Church—the City of God—marriage is a sacrament and may not and cannot be dissolved as long as the spouses live: &quot;But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God, where, even from the first union of the two, the man and the woman, marriage bears a certain sacramental character, can in no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them.&quot; In chapter 7, Augustine pointed out that the Roman Empire forbad polygamy, even if the reason of fertility would support it: &quot;For it is in a man&#x27;s power to put away a wife that is barren, and marry one of whom to have children. And yet it is not allowed; and now indeed in our times, and after the usage of Rome (nostris quidem iam temporibus ac more Romano), neither to marry in addition, so as to have more than one wife living.&quot; Further on he notices that the Church&#x27;s attitude goes much further than the secular law regarding monogamy: It forbids remarrying, considering such to be a form of fornication: &quot;And yet, save in the City of our God, in His Holy Mount, the case is not such with the wife. But, that the laws of the Gentiles are otherwise, who is there that knows not.&quot;

The Council of Trent condemns polygamy: &quot;If anyone saith, that it is lawful for Christians to have several wives at the same time, and that this is not prohibited by any divine law; let him be anathema.&quot;

In modern times a minority of Roman Catholic theologians have argued that polygamy, though not ideal, can be a legitimate form of Christian marriage in certain regions, in particular Africa. The Roman Catholic Church teaches in its Catechism that: 
polygamy is not in accord with the moral law. [Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God that was revealed from the beginning, because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive.

====Lutheran Church====
The Lutheran World Federation hosted a regional conference in Africa, in which the acceptance of polygamists into full membership by the Lutheran Church in Liberia was defended as being permissible. The Lutheran Church in Liberia, however, does not permit polygamists who have become Christians to marry more wives after they have received the sacrament of Holy Baptism. Evangelical Lutheran missionaries in Maasai also tolerate the practice of polygamy and in Southern Sudan, some polygamists are becoming Lutheran Christians.

====Anglican Communion====
The 1988 Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion ruled that polygamy was permissible in certain circumstances:
====Latter Day Saint movement====

In accordance with what Joseph Smith indicated was a revelation, the practice of plural marriage, the marriage of one man to two or more women, was instituted among members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the early 1840s. Despite Smith&#x27;s revelation, the 1835 edition of the 101st Section of the &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot;, written after the doctrine of plural marriage began to be practiced, publicly condemned polygamy. This scripture was used by John Taylor in 1850 to quash Mormon polygamy rumors in Liverpool, England. Polygamy was made illegal in the state of Illinois during the 1839–44 Nauvoo era when several top Mormon leaders, including Smith, Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball took multiple wives. Mormon elders who publicly taught that all men were commanded to enter plural marriage were subject to harsh discipline. On 7 June 1844 the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot; criticized Smith for plural marriage.

=====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)=====
After Joseph Smith was killed by a mob on 27 June 1844, the main body of Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo and followed Brigham Young to Utah where the practice of plural marriage continued. In 1852, Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, publicly acknowledged the practice of plural marriage through a sermon he gave. Additional sermons by top Mormon leaders on the virtues of polygamy followed. Controversy followed when polygamy became a social cause, writers began to publish works condemning polygamy. The key plank of the Republican Party&#x27;s 1856 platform was &quot;to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery&quot;. In 1862, Congress issued the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act which clarified that the practice of polygamy was illegal in all US territories. The LDS Church believed that their religiously based practice of plural marriage was protected by the United States Constitution, however, the unanimous 1878 Supreme Court decision &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; declared that polygamy was not protected by the Constitution, based on the longstanding legal principle that &quot;laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.&quot;

Increasingly harsh anti-polygamy legislation in the US led some Mormons to emigrate to Canada and Mexico. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff issued a public declaration (the Manifesto) announcing that the LDS Church had discontinued new plural marriages. Anti-Mormon sentiment waned, as did opposition to statehood for Utah. The Smoot Hearings in 1904, which documented that the LDS Church was still practicing polygamy spurred the LDS Church to issue a Second Manifesto again claiming that it had ceased performing new plural marriages. By 1910 the LDS Church excommunicated those who entered into, or performed, new plural marriages. Even so, many plural husbands and wives continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.

Enforcement of the 1890 Manifesto caused various splinter groups to leave the LDS Church in order to continue the practice of plural marriage. Polygamy among these groups persists today in Utah and neighboring states as well as in the spin-off colonies. Polygamist churches of Mormon origin are often referred to as &quot;Mormon fundamentalist&quot; churches even though they are not parts of the LDS Church. Such fundamentalists often use a purported 1886 revelation to John Taylor as the basis for their authority to continue the practice of plural marriage. &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; stated in 2005 that there were as many as 37,000 fundamentalists with less than half of them living in polygamous households.

On 13 December 2013, US Federal Judge Clark Waddoups ruled in &quot;Brown v. Buhman&quot; that the portions of Utah&#x27;s anti-polygamy laws which prohibit multiple cohabitation were unconstitutional, but also allowed Utah to maintain its ban on multiple marriage licenses. Unlawful cohabitation, where prosecutors did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), had been the primary tool used to prosecute polygamy in Utah since the 1882 Edmunds Act.

=====Mormon fundamentalism=====
The Council of Friends (also known as the Woolley Group and the Priesthood Council) was one of the original expressions of Mormon fundamentalism, having its origins in the teachings of Lorin C. Woolley, a dairy farmer excommunicated from the LDS Church in 1924. Several Mormon fundamentalist groups claim lineage through the Council of Friends, including but not limited to, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church), the Apostolic United Brethren, the Centennial Park group, the Latter Day Church of Christ, and the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

=====Community of Christ=====
The Community of Christ, known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) prior to 2001, has never sanctioned polygamy since its foundation in 1860. Joseph Smith III, the first Prophet-President of the RLDS Church following the reorganization of the Church, was an ardent opponent of the practice of plural marriage throughout his life. For most of his career, Smith denied that his father had been involved in the practice and insisted that it had originated with Brigham Young. Smith served many missions to the western United States, where he met with and interviewed associates and women claiming to be widows of his father, who attempted to present him with evidence to the contrary. Smith typically responded to such accusations by saying that he was &quot;not positive nor sure that was innocent&quot;, and that if, indeed, the elder Smith had been involved, it was still a false practice. However, many members of the Community of Christ and some of the groups that were previously associated with it are not convinced that Joseph Smith practiced plural marriage and they believe that the evidence which indicates that he practiced it is flawed.

===Hinduism===
The &quot;Rigveda&quot; mentions that during the Vedic period, a man could have more than one wife. The practice is attested in epics like the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The &quot;Dharmashastra&quot;s permit a man to marry women provided that the first wife agree to marry him. Despite its existence, it was most usually practiced by men of higher status. Common people were only allowed a second marriage if the first wife could not bear a son or have some dispute because there is no law for divorce in Hinduism.

According to the &quot;Vishnu Smriti&quot;, the number of wives one could have is linked to one&#x27;s social class, referred to as &quot;varna&quot;:
This linkage of the number of permitted wives to the varna system is also supported by the &quot;Baudhayana&quot; &quot;Dharmasutra&quot; and the &quot;Paraskara Grihyasutra&quot;.

The &quot;Apastamba Dharmasutra&quot; and the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; allow marriage to a second wife if the first one is unable to discharge her religious duties or is unable to bear a child or have any dispute because in Hinduism there was no law for divorce.

For a Brahmana, only one wife could rank as the chief consort who performed the religious rites (&quot;dharma-patni&quot;) along with the husband. The chief consort had to be of an equal knowledge. If a man married several women from the same knowledgeable, then the eldest wife held the position of the chief consort. Hindu kings commonly had more than one wife and are regularly attributed four wives by the scriptures. They were: Mahisi, who was the chief consort, Parivrkti, who had no son, Vaivata, who is considered the favorite wife and the Palagali, who was the daughter of the last of the court officials.

Traditional Hindu law allowed polygamy if the first wife could not bear a child.

The Hindu Marriage Act was enacted in 1955 by the Indian Parliament and made polygamy illegal for everyone in India except for Muslims. Prior to 1955, polygamy was permitted for Hindus. Marriage laws in India are dependent upon the religion of the parties in question.

Some Hindus in Indonesia practice polygamy. 

===Islam===

In Islamic marital jurisprudence, under warranted conditions, a Muslim man may have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four. Muslim women are not permitted to have more than one husband at the same time under any circumstances.

Based on verse 30:21 of Quran the ideal relationship is the comfort that a couple find in each other&#x27;s embrace:
The polygyny that is allowed in the Quran is for special situations. There are strict requirements to marrying more than one woman, as the man must treat them fairly financially and in terms of support given to each wife, according to Islamic law. However, Islam advises monogamy for a man if he fears he cannot deal justly with his wives. This is based on verse 4:3 of Quran which says:

Muslim women are not allowed to marry more than one husband at once. However, in the case of a divorce or their husbands&#x27; death they can remarry after the completion of Iddah, as divorce is legal in Islamic law. A non-Muslim woman who flees from her non-Muslim husband and accepts Islam has the option to remarry without divorce from her previous husband, as her marriage with non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved on her fleeing. A non-Muslim woman captured during war by Muslims, can also remarry, as her marriage with her non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved at capture by Muslim soldiers. This permission is given to such women in verse 4:24 of Quran. The verse also emphasizes on transparency, mutual agreement and financial compensation as prerequisites for matrimonial relationship as opposed to prostitution; it says:
Muhammad was monogamously married to Khadija, his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married multiple women. Muhammad had a total of 9 wives at the same time, even though Muslim men were limited to 4 wives. His total wives are 11.

One reason cited for polygyny is that it allows a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, some Islamic scholars say the wife can set a condition, in the marriage contract, that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage. In such a case, the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife. However, other Islamic scholars state that this condition is not allowed. According to traditional Islamic law, each of those wives keeps their property and assets separate; and are paid Mahr separately by their husband. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.

In most Muslim-majority countries, polygyny is legal with Kuwait being the only one where no restrictions are imposed on it. The practice is illegal in Muslim-majority Turkey, Tunisia, Albania, Kosovo, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Sierra Leone, Guinea,
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan, Tajikistan.

Countries that allow polygyny typically also require a man to obtain permission from his previous wives before marrying another, and require the man to prove that he can financially support multiple wives. In Malaysia and Morocco, a man must justify taking an additional wife at a court hearing before he is allowed to do so. In Sudan, the government encouraged polygyny in 2001 to increase the population.

===Judaism===
Polygyny is not forbidden in the Hebrew Bible, and over 40 important figures had more than one wife, such as Jacob, Solomon, and possibly Moses. However, the Torah contains a few specific regulations that apply to polygamy, such as (&quot;If he take another wife for himself; her food, her clothing, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish&quot;), (a man must award the inheritance due to a first-born son to the son who was actually born first, even if he hates that son&#x27;s mother and likes another wife more), and (the king shall not have too many wives). Polygyny was still practiced well into the biblical period, and it is attested among Jews as late as the second century CE. The incidence was limited, however, and it was likely largely restricted to the wealthy.

The Dead Sea Scrolls show that several smaller Jewish sects forbade polygamy before and during the first century. The Temple Scroll (11QT LVII 17–18) seems to prohibit polygamy. The rabbinical era, beginning with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, saw a continuation of some degree of legal acceptance for polygamy. Statements in the Talmud include, &quot;[If a man declares,] &#x27;Be thou betrothed to half of me,&#x27; she is betrothed; &#x27;Half of thee be betrothed to me,&#x27; she is not betrothed&quot; and elsewhere, &quot;A man may marry wives in addition to the first wife; provided only that he possesses the means to maintain them&quot;, though another opinion in the Talmud requires divorcing a first wife before taking a second. In practice, polygamy was extremely rare in Jewish society in the Talmudic period.

Later on, the Jewish codices began a process of restricting polygamy in Judaism. Most notable was the synod of Rabbeinu Gershom, whose rulings were accepted by Ashkenazi Jews. About 1000 CE he called a synod which instituted the following new laws: (1) prohibition of polygamy; (2) necessity of obtaining the consent of both parties to a divorce; (3) modification of the rules concerning those who became apostates under compulsion; (4) prohibition against opening correspondence addressed to another. Gershon left an exception to his ban on polygamy, called heter meah rabbanim, by which a man separated from his wife - but unable to officially divorce her due to certain extreme circumstances - could instead take a second wife.

Rabbeinu Gershom&#x27;s ban on polygamy was not adopted by Sephardic communities. Some later Sephardic Jews such as Abraham David Taroç are known to have multiple wives. Polygamy was common among Jewish communities in the Levant, possibly due to the influence of Muslim society, with 17% of divorce claims by women being due to complaints over husbands taking additional wives. According to R. Joseph Karo (16th century author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the Shulchan Aruch), and many other rabbis from Safed, the ban of Rabbeinu Gershom had expired, and therefore even Ashkenazim could marry additional wives. Even in instances where the husband made prenuptial agreements not to marry additional wives, local rabbis found loopholes to allow them to do so anyway.

In the modern day, polygamy is generally not condoned by Jews. Ashkenazi Jews have continued to follow Rabbenu Gershom&#x27;s ban since the 11th century. Some Mizrahi Jewish communities (particularly Yemenite Jews and Persian Jews) discontinued polygyny more recently, after they immigrated to countries where it was forbidden or illegal. Israel prohibits polygamy by law,and Mizrahi Jews are not permitted to enter into new polygamous marriages in Israel, though existing marriages may be maintained. In practice, however, the law is loosely enforced, primarily to avoid interference with Bedouin culture, where polygyny is practiced. Polygamy may still occur in non-European Jewish communities that exist in countries where it is not forbidden, such as Jewish communities in Iran or Morocco.

Late Sephardic chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef supported the legalisation by the Israeli government of polygamy and the practice of pilegesh (the keeping of concubines). Tzvi Zohar, a professor from the Bar-Ilan University, recently suggested that based on the opinions of leading halachic authorities, the concept of concubines may serve as a practical halachic justification for premarital or non-marital cohabitation.

Karaite Judaism has no rules against polygyny, though the practice itself in modern times is rare, and is not found at all among Karaites living in countries where polygamy is against the law. The husband, however, is only allowed to take other wives if he has the means and ability to treat them equally to the primary wife, and even then only if there was no anti-polygamy clause in their marriage contract from either party. Polyandry, on the other hand, is expressly forbidden.

===Zoroastrianism===

There is limited information about polygamy in Zoroastrian tradition. There is no passage in the Avesta that favors polygamy or monogamy. However, tradition holds that Zoroaster had three wives. Polygamy appears to have been a right of spiritual dignitaries and aristocrats. It is mentioned in foreign writings, such as the letter of Tansar.

It was also written about in the 4th century CE by the Roman soldier and historian Ammianus Marcellinus, writing about Zoroastrian communities.

== Legal status ==

===International law===
In 2000, the United Nations Human Rights Committee reported that polygamy violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), citing concerns that the lack of &quot;equality of treatment with regard to the right to marry&quot; meant that polygamy, restricted to polygyny in practice, violates the dignity of women and should be outlawed. Specifically, reports to UN Committees have noted violations of ICCPR due to these inequalities, and reports to the UN General Assembly have recommended it be outlawed.

ICCPR does not apply to countries that have not signed it, which includes many Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Malaysia, Brunei, Oman, and South Sudan.

===Canada===
Canada has taken a strong stand against polygamy, and the Canadian Department of Justice has argued that polygyny is a violation of International Human Rights Law, as a form of gender discrimination. In Canada, the federal Criminal Code applies throughout the country. It extends the definition of polygamy to having any kind of conjugal union with more than one person at the same time. Also anyone who assists, celebrates, or is a part to a rite, ceremony, or contract that sanctions a polygamist relationship is guilty of polygamy. Polygamy is an offence punishable by up to five years in prison.

In 2017, two Canadian religious leaders were found guilty of practicing polygamy by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Both of them are former bishops of the Mormon denomination of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).

===Russia===
===United Kingdom===
Bigamy is illegal in the United Kingdom. &quot;De facto&quot; polygamy (having multiple partners at the same time) is not a criminal offence, provided the person does not register more than one marriage at the same time. In the UK, adultery is not a criminal offence (it is only a ground for divorce). In a written answer to the House of Commons, &quot;In Great Britain, polygamy is only recognized as valid in law in circumstances where the marriage ceremony has been performed in a country whose laws permit polygamy and the parties to the marriage were domiciled there at the time. In addition, immigration rules have generally prevented the formation of polygamous households in this country since 1988.&quot;

The 2010 UK government decided that Universal Credit (UC), which replaces means-tested benefits and tax credits for working-age people and will not be completely introduced until 2021, will not recognize polygamous marriages. A House of Commons briefing paper states &quot;Treating second and subsequent partners in polygamous relationships as separate claimants could in some situations mean that polygamous households receive more under Universal Credit than they do under the current rules for means-tested benefits and tax credits. This is because, as explained above, the amounts which may be paid in respect of additional spouses are lower than those which generally apply to single claimants.&quot; There is currently no official statistics data on cohabiting polygamous couples who have arranged marriage in religious ceremonies.

===United States===


Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states in the U.S.; in Utah it currently remains a controversial issue that has been subject to legislative battles throughout the years. As of 2020 Utah is the only state where the practice is designated as an infraction rather than the more serious designation as a crime. However, recognizing polygamous unions is still illegal under the Constitution of Utah. Federal legislation to outlaw the practice was endorsed as constitutional in 1878 by the Supreme Court in &quot;Reynolds v. United States,&quot; despite the religious objections of Mormonism&#x27;s largest denomination the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS Church subsequently ended the practice of polygamy around the turn of the twentieth century; however, several smaller fundamentalist Mormon groups across the state (not associated with the mainstream Church) continue the practice.

On 13 December 2013, a federal judge, spurred by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups, struck down the parts of Utah&#x27;s bigamy law that criminalized cohabitation, while also acknowledging that the state may still enforce bans on having multiple marriage licenses. This decision was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, thus effectively recriminalizing polygamy as a felony. In 2020, Utah voted to downgrade polygamy from a felony to an infraction, but it remains a felony if force, threats or other abuses are involved.

Prosecutors in Utah have long had a policy of not pursuing polygamy in the absence of other associated crimes (e.g. fraud, abuse, marriage of underage persons, etc.). There are about 30,000 people living in polygamous communities in Utah.

Individualist feminism and advocates such as Wendy McElroy and journalist Jillian Keenan support the freedom for adults to voluntarily enter polygamous marriages.

Authors such as Alyssa Rower and Samantha Slark argue that there is a case for legalizing polygamy on the basis of regulation and monitoring of the practice, legally protecting the polygamous partners and allowing them to join mainstream society instead of forcing them to hide from it when any public situation arises.

In an October 2004 op-ed for &quot;USA Today&quot;, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley argued that, as a simple matter of equal treatment under the law, polygamy ought to be legal. Acknowledging that underage girls are sometimes coerced into polygamous marriages, Turley replied that &quot;banning polygamy is no more a solution to child abuse than banning marriage would be a solution to spousal abuse&quot;.

Stanley Kurtz, a conservative fellow at the Hudson Institute, rejects the decriminalization and legalization of polygamy. He stated:

In January 2015, Pastor Neil Patrick Carrick of Detroit, Michigan, brought a case (&quot;Carrick v. Snyder&quot;) against the State of Michigan that the state&#x27;s ban of polygamy violates the Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case was dismissed with prejudice on 10 February 2016, for lack of standing.

=== Indonesia ===
Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country. Most polygamous families in the country are of Muslim background; they may also be aristocrats, registered civil servants, Islamic students (santri), and wholesalers.

Constitutionally, Indonesia (basically) only recognizes monogamy. But, government allows polygamy in some conditions:
* The wife cannot carry out her obligations as a wife.
* The wife has a physical disability or an incurable disease.
* The wife cannot bear children.

There are other requirements for registered civil servants.

==Nazi plans for post-war Germany==

In Nazi Germany, there was an effort by Martin Bormann and Heinrich Himmler to introduce new legislation concerning plural marriage. The argument ran that after the war, 3 to 4 million women would have to remain unmarried due to the great number of soldiers fallen in battle. In order to make it possible for these women to have children, a procedure for application and selection for suitable men (i.e. decorated war heroes) to enter a marital relationship with an additional woman was planned. The privileged position of the first wife was to be secured by awarding her the title &quot;Domina&quot;.

<text>A postscript (P.S., PS, PS.) may be a sentence, a paragraph, or occasionally many paragraphs added, often hastily and incidentally, after the signature of a letter or (sometimes) the main body of an essay or book. The term comes from the Latin &quot;post scriptum&quot;, an expression meaning &quot;written after&quot; (which may be interpreted in the sense of &quot;that which comes after the writing&quot;).
In a book or essay, a more carefully composed addition (e.g., for a second edition) is called an afterword. The word &quot;postscript&quot; has poetically been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work even if it is not attached to a main work, for example Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s book titled &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript.&quot; 

Sometimes when additional points are made after the first postscript, abbreviations such as P.P.S. (&quot;post-post-scriptum&quot;) and P.P.P.S. (&quot;post-post-post-scriptum&quot;) and so on are added, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

<doc id="24479" wikidata="Q967839" url="?curid=24479" title="Penectomy">
<text>Penectomy is penis removal through surgery, generally for medical or personal reasons.

==Medical reasons for penectomy==
Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of part or all of the penis. The amount of penis removed depends on the severity of the cancer. Some men have only the tip of their penis removed. For others with more advanced cancer, the entire penis must be removed.

In rare instances, a botched circumcision can also result in a full or partial penectomy, as with David Reimer.

Fournier gangrene can also be a reason for penectomy and/or orchiectomy.

===Follow-up support===
Because of the rarity of cancers which require the partial or total removal of the penis, support from people who have had the penis removed can be difficult to find locally. Website support networks are available. For instance, the American Cancer Society&#x27;s Cancer Survivors Network website provides information for finding support networks. Phalloplasty is also an option for surgical reconstruction of a penis.
===Sexual support===
Patients who have undergone a partial penectomy as a result of a penile cancer diagnosis have reported similar sexual outcomes as prior to surgery. Sexual support therapists and specialists are available nationally in the United States and can be accessed through the specialist cancer services. Many surgeons or hospitals will also provide this information postoperatively. Local government health services departments may be able to provide advice, names, and contact numbers.

<doc id="24481" wikidata="Q422467" url="?curid=24481" title="Provirus">
<text>A provirus is a virus genome that is integrated into the DNA of a host cell. In the case of bacterial viruses (bacteriophages), proviruses are often referred to as prophages. However, proviruses are distinctly different from prophages and these terms should not be used interchangeably. Unlike prophages, proviruses do not excise themselves from the host genome when the host cell is stressed.

This state can be a stage of virus replication, or a state that persists over longer periods of time as either inactive viral infections or an endogenous viral element. In inactive viral infections the virus will not replicate itself except through replication of its host cell. This state can last over many host cell generations.

Endogenous retroviruses are always in the state of a provirus. When a (nonendogenous) retrovirus invades a cell, the RNA of the retrovirus is reverse-transcribed into DNA by reverse transcriptase, then inserted into the host genome by an integrase.

A provirus does not directly make new DNA copies of itself while integrated into a host genome in this way. Instead, it is passively replicated along with the host genome and passed on to the original cell&#x27;s offspring; all descendants of the infected cell will also bear proviruses in their genomes. This is known as lysogenic viral reproduction. Integration can result in a latent infection or a productive infection. In a productive infection, the provirus is transcribed into messenger RNA which directly produces new virus, which in turn will infect other cells via the lytic cycle. A latent infection results when the provirus is transcriptionally silent rather than active.

A latent infection may become productive in response to changes in the host&#x27;s environmental conditions or health; the provirus may be activated and begin transcription of its viral genome. This can result in the destruction of its host cell because the cell&#x27;s protein synthesis machinery is hijacked to produce more viruses.

Proviruses may account for approximately 8% of the human genome in the form of inherited endogenous retroviruses.

A provirus not only refers to a retrovirus but is also used to describe other viruses that can integrate into the host chromosomes, another example being adeno-associated virus.
Not only eukaryotic viruses integrate into the genomes of their hosts; many bacterial and archaeal viruses also employ this strategy of propagation. All families of bacterial viruses with circular (single-stranded or double-stranded) DNA genomes or replicating their genomes through a circular intermediate (e.g., tailed dsDNA viruses) have temperate members.

<doc id="24484" wikidata="Q657449" url="?curid=24484" title="Parade">
<text>A parade is a procession of people, usually organized along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by marching bands, floats, or sometimes large balloons. Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually some variety of celebration.

The term &quot;parade&quot; may also be used for multiple different subjects; for example, in the Canadian Armed Forces, &quot;parade&quot; is used both to describe the procession and in other informal connotations.

Protest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but such cases are usually referred to as a march instead.

== History ==
The first parades date back to , only being used for religious or military purposes. The Babylonians celebrated Akitu by parading their deities and performing rituals.

To celebrate the federal government&#x27;s victory in the American Civil War, 145,000 Union soldiers marched in a two-day Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. They passed before the President, the Cabinet, and senior officers from May 23–24, 1865.

At the end of hostilities in Europe in 1944–45, &quot;victory parades&quot; were a common feature throughout the recently liberated territories. For example, on 3 September 1944, the personnel of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division marched six abreast to the music of massed regimental pipe and drum bands through the streets of Dieppe, France, to commemorate the liberation of the city from German occupation, as well as commemorate the loss of over 900 soldiers from that formation during the Dieppe Raid two years earlier. On the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 held in Moscow, Soviet Union in June 1945, the Red Army commemorated Victory in Europe with a parade and the ceremonial destruction of captured Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS standards.

==Parade float==
The parade float got its name because the first floats were decorated barges that were towed along the canals with ropes held by parade marchers on the shore. Floats were occasionally propelled from within by concealed oarsmen, but the practice was abandoned because of the high incidence of drowning when the lightweight and unstable frames capsized. Strikingly, among the first uses of grounded floats – towed by horses – was a ceremony in memory of recently drowned parade oarsmen. Today, parade floats are traditionally pulled by motor vehicles or are powered themselves.

==Parade grand marshals==
Multiple grand marshals may often be designated for an iteration of the parade, and may or may not be in actual attendance due to circumstances (including death). A &quot;community grand marshal&quot; or other designations may be selected alongside a &quot;grand marshal&quot; to lead the front or other parts of the parade.

==Aircraft and boats==
Since the advent of such technology, it became possible for aircraft and boats to parade. A flypast is an aerial parade of anything from one to dozens of aircraft, both in commercial context at airshows and also to mark important dates, such as national days or significant anniversaries. They are particularly common in the United Kingdom, where they are often associated with Royal occasions. Similarly, for ships, there may be a sail-past of, e.g., tall ships (as was seen during Trafalgar 200) or other sailing vessels as during the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of World War II.
==Longest parade==
The longest parade in the world is the Hanover Schützenfest that takes place in Hanover every year during the Schützenfest. The parade is long with more than 12,000 participants from all over the world, among them more than 100 bands and around 70 floats and carriages.

<text>In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack abstract data type. Each element in a priority queue has an associated &quot;priority.&quot; In a priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority. In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued. In other implementations, the order of elements with the same priority is undefined.

While priority queues are often implemented using heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract data type like a list or a map; just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or with an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or another method such as an ordered array.

== Operations ==

A priority queue must at least support the following operations:

* &quot;is_empty&quot;: check whether the queue has no elements.
* &quot;insert_with_priority&quot;: add an element to the queue with an associated priority.
* &quot;pull_highest_priority_element&quot;: remove the element from the queue that has the &quot;highest priority&quot;, and return it.
*: This is also known as &quot;&quot;pop_element(Off)&quot;, &quot;get_maximum_element&quot; or &quot;get_front(most)_element&quot;.
*: Some conventions reverse the order of priorities, considering lower values to be higher priority, so this may also be known as &quot;get_minimum_element&quot;, and is often referred to as &quot;get-min&quot; in the literature.
*: This may instead be specified as separate &quot;peek_at_highest_priority_element&quot; and &quot;delete_element&quot; functions, which can be combined to produce &quot;pull_highest_priority_element&quot;&quot;.

In addition, &quot;peek&quot; (in this context often called &quot;find-max&quot; or &quot;find-min&quot;), which returns the highest-priority element but does not modify the queue, is very frequently implemented, and nearly always executes in &quot;O&quot;(1) time. This operation and its &quot;O&quot;(1) performance is crucial to many applications of priority queues.

More advanced implementations may support more complicated operations, such as &quot;pull_lowest_priority_element&quot;, inspecting the first few highest- or lowest-priority elements, clearing the queue, clearing subsets of the queue, performing a batch insert, merging two or more queues into one, incrementing priority of any element, etc.

Stacks and queues can be implemented as particular kinds of priority queues, with the priority determined by the order in which the elements are inserted. In a stack, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically increasing; thus, the last element inserted is always the first retrieved. In a queue, the priority of each inserted element is monotonically decreasing; thus, the first element inserted is always the first retrieved.

== Implementation ==

=== Naive implementations ===

There are a variety of simple, usually inefficient, ways to implement a priority queue. They provide an analogy to help one understand what a priority queue is.

For instance, one can keep all the elements in an unsorted list (&quot;O&quot;(1) insertion time). Whenever the highest-priority element is requested, search through all elements for the one with the highest priority. (&quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) pull time),

 insert(node) {
 list.append(node)

 pull() {
 highest = list.get_first_element()
 foreach node in list {
 if highest.priority &lt; node.priority {
 highest = node
 }
 list.remove(highest)
 return highest

In another case, one can keep all the elements in a priority sorted list (&quot;O&quot;(n) insertion sort time), whenever the highest-priority element is requested, the first one in the list can be returned. (&quot;O&quot;(1) pull time)
 insert(node) {
 foreach (index, element) in list {
 if node.priority &lt; element.priority {
 list.insert_at_index(node,index)
 break
 }

 pull() {
 highest = list.get_at_index(list.length-1)
 list.remove(highest)
 return highest

=== Usual implementation ===

To improve performance, priority queues are typically based on a heap, giving &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) performance for inserts and removals, and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) to build the heap initially from a set of &quot;n&quot; elements. Variants of the basic heap data structure such as pairing heaps or Fibonacci heaps can provide better bounds for some operations.

Alternatively, when a self-balancing binary search tree is used, insertion and removal also take &quot;O&quot;(log &quot;n&quot;) time, although building trees from existing sequences of elements takes &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time; this is typical where one might already have access to these data structures, such as with third-party or standard libraries. From a space-complexity standpoint, using self-balancing binary search tree with linked list takes more storage, since it requires to store extra references to other nodes.

From a computational-complexity standpoint, priority queues are congruent to sorting algorithms. The section on the equivalence of priority queues and sorting algorithms, below, describes how efficient sorting algorithms can create efficient priority queues.

===Specialized heaps===
There are several specialized heap data structures that either supply additional operations or outperform heap-based implementations for specific types of keys, specifically integer keys. Suppose the set of possible keys is {1, 2, ..., C}.

* When only &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;find-min&quot; and &quot;extract-min&quot; are needed and in case of integer priorities, a bucket queue can be constructed as an array of linked lists plus a pointer , initially . Inserting an item with key appends the item to the &#x27;th list, and updates , both in constant time. &quot;Extract-min&quot; deletes and returns one item from the list with index , then increments if needed until it again points to a non-empty list; this takes time in the worst case. These queues are useful for sorting the vertices of a graph by their degree.
* A van Emde Boas tree supports the &quot;minimum&quot;, &quot;maximum&quot;, &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;search&quot;, &quot;extract-min&quot;, &quot;extract-max&quot;, &quot;predecessor&quot; and &quot;successor]&quot; operations in &quot;O&quot;(log log &quot;C&quot;) time, but has a space cost for small queues of about &quot;O&quot;(2&quot;m&quot;/2), where &quot;m&quot; is the number of bits in the priority value. The space can be reduced significantly with hashing.
* The Fusion tree by Fredman and Willard implements the &quot;minimum&quot; operation in &quot;O&quot;(1) time and &quot;insert&quot; and &quot;extract-min&quot; operations in formula_1time. However it is stated by the author that, &quot;Our algorithms have theoretical interest only; The constant factors involved in the execution times preclude practicality.&quot;

For applications that do many &quot;peek&quot; operations for every &quot;extract-min&quot; operation, the time complexity for peek actions can be reduced to &quot;O&quot;(1) in all tree and heap implementations by caching the highest priority element after every insertion and removal. For insertion, this adds at most a constant cost, since the newly inserted element is compared only to the previously cached minimum element. For deletion, this at most adds an additional &quot;peek&quot; cost, which is typically cheaper than the deletion cost, so overall time complexity is not significantly impacted.

Monotone priority queues are specialized queues that are optimized for the case where no item is ever inserted that has a lower priority (in the case of min-heap) than any item previously extracted. This restriction is met by several practical applications of priority queues.

===Summary of running times===
== Equivalence of priority queues and sorting algorithms ==

=== Using a priority queue to sort ===

The semantics of priority queues naturally suggest a sorting method: insert all the elements to be sorted into a priority queue, and sequentially remove them; they will come out in sorted order. This is actually the procedure used by several sorting algorithms, once the layer of abstraction provided by the priority queue is removed. This sorting method is equivalent to the following sorting algorithms:

=== Using a sorting algorithm to make a priority queue ===

A sorting algorithm can also be used to implement a priority queue. Specifically, Thorup says:
We present a general deterministic linear space reduction from priority queues to sorting implying that if we can sort up to &quot;n&quot; keys in &quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) time per key, then there is a priority queue supporting &quot;delete&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;S&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time and &quot;find-min&quot; in constant time.
That is, if there is a sorting algorithm which can sort in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) time per key, where &quot;S&quot; is some function of &quot;n&quot; and word size, then one can use the given procedure to create a priority queue where pulling the highest-priority element is &quot;O&quot;(1) time, and inserting new elements (and deleting elements) is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) time. For example, if one has an &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) sort algorithm, one can create a priority queue with &quot;O&quot;(1) pulling and &quot;O&quot;( log &quot;n&quot;) insertion.

== Libraries ==

A priority queue is often considered to be a &quot;container data structure&quot;.

The Standard Template Library (STL), and the C++ 1998 standard, specifies std::priority_queue as one of the STL container adaptor class templates. However, it does not specify how two elements with same priority should be served, and indeed, common implementations will not return them according to their order in the queue. It implements a max-priority-queue, and has three parameters: a comparison object for sorting such as a function object (defaults to less&lt;T&gt; if unspecified), the underlying container for storing the data structures (defaults to std::vector&lt;T&gt;), and two iterators to the beginning and end of a sequence. Unlike actual STL containers, it does not allow iteration of its elements (it strictly adheres to its abstract data type definition). STL also has utility functions for manipulating another random-access container as a binary max-heap. The Boost libraries also have an implementation in the library heap.

Python&#x27;s heapq module implements a binary min-heap on top of a list.

Java&#x27;s library contains a class, which implements a min-priority-queue as a binary heap.

.NET&#x27;s library contains a PriorityQueue class, which implements an array-backed, quaternary min-heap.

Scala&#x27;s library contains a PriorityQueue class, which implements a max-priority-queue.

Go&#x27;s library contains a container/heap module, which implements a min-heap on top of any compatible data structure.

The Standard PHP Library extension contains the class SplPriorityQueue.

Apple&#x27;s Core Foundation framework contains a CFBinaryHeap structure, which implements a min-heap.

== Applications ==

=== Bandwidth management ===

Priority queuing can be used to manage limited resources such as bandwidth on a transmission line from a network router. In the event of outgoing traffic queuing due to insufficient bandwidth, all other queues can be halted to send the traffic from the highest priority queue upon arrival. This ensures that the prioritized traffic (such as real-time traffic, e.g. an RTP stream of a VoIP connection) is forwarded with the least delay and the least likelihood of being rejected due to a queue reaching its maximum capacity. All other traffic can be handled when the highest priority queue is empty. Another approach used is to send disproportionately more traffic from higher priority queues.

Many modern protocols for local area networks also include the concept of priority queues at the media access control (MAC) sub-layer to ensure that high-priority applications (such as VoIP or IPTV) experience lower latency than other applications which can be served with best-effort service. Examples include IEEE 802.11e (an amendment to IEEE 802.11 which provides quality of service) and ITU-T G.hn (a standard for high-speed local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).

Usually a limitation (policer) is set to limit the bandwidth that traffic from the highest priority queue can take, in order to prevent high priority packets from choking off all other traffic. This limit is usually never reached due to high level control instances such as the Cisco Callmanager, which can be programmed to inhibit calls which would exceed the programmed bandwidth limit.
=== Discrete event simulation ===

Another use of a priority queue is to manage the events in a discrete event simulation. The events are added to the queue with their simulation time used as the priority. The execution of the simulation proceeds by repeatedly pulling the top of the queue and executing the event thereon.

=== Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm ===

When the graph is stored in the form of adjacency list or matrix, priority queue can be used to extract minimum efficiently when implementing Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, although one also needs the ability to alter the priority of a particular vertex in the priority queue efficiently.

If instead, a graph is stored as node objects, and priority-node pairs are inserted into a heap, altering the priority of a particular vertex is not necessary if one tracks visited nodes. Once a node is visited, if it comes up in the heap again (having had a lower priority number associated with it earlier), it is popped-off and ignored.

=== Huffman coding ===

Huffman coding requires one to repeatedly obtain the two lowest-frequency trees. A priority queue is one method of doing this.

=== Best-first search algorithms ===

Best-first search algorithms, like the A* search algorithm, find the shortest path between two vertices or nodes of a weighted graph, trying out the most promising routes first. A priority queue (also known as the &quot;fringe&quot;) is used to keep track of unexplored routes; the one for which the estimate (a lower bound in the case of A*) of the total path length is smallest is given highest priority. If memory limitations make best-first search impractical, variants like the SMA* algorithm can be used instead, with a double-ended priority queue to allow removal of low-priority items.

=== ROAM triangulation algorithm ===

The Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM) algorithm computes a dynamically changing triangulation of a terrain. It works by splitting triangles where more detail is needed and merging them where less detail is needed. The algorithm assigns each triangle in the terrain a priority, usually related to the error decrease if that triangle would be split. The algorithm uses two priority queues, one for triangles that can be split and another for triangles that can be merged. In each step the triangle from the split queue with the highest priority is split, or the triangle from the merge queue with the lowest priority is merged with its neighbours.

=== Prim&#x27;s algorithm for minimum spanning tree ===
Using min heap priority queue in Prim&#x27;s algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected and undirected graph, one can achieve a good running time. This min heap priority queue uses the min heap data structure which supports operations such as &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;minimum&quot;, &quot;extract-min&quot;, &quot;decrease-key&quot;. In this implementation, the weight of the edges is used to decide the priority of the vertices. Lower the weight, higher the priority and higher the weight, lower the priority.

== Parallel priority queue ==
Parallelization can be used to speed up priority queues, but requires some changes to the priority queue interface. The reason for such changes is that a sequential update usually only has formula_2 or formula_3 cost, and there is no practical gain to parallelize such an operation. One possible change is to allow the concurrent access of multiple processors to the same priority queue. The second possible change is to allow batch operations that work on formula_4 elements, instead of just one element. For example, &quot;extractMin&quot; will remove the first formula_4 elements with the highest priority.

=== Concurrent parallel access ===
If the priority queue allows concurrent access, multiple processes can perform operations concurrently on that priority queue. However, this raises two issues. First of all, the definition of the semantics of the individual operations is no longer obvious. For example, if two processes want to extract the element with the highest priority, should they get the same element or different ones? This restricts parallelism on the level of the program using the priority queue. In addition, because multiple processes have access to the same element, this leads to contention.
The concurrent access to a priority queue can be implemented on a Concurrent Read, Concurrent Write (CRCW) PRAM model. In the following the priority queue is implemented as a skip list. In addition, an atomic synchronization primitive, CAS, is used to make the skip list lock-free. The nodes of the skip list consists of a unique key, a priority, an array of pointers, for each level, to the next nodes and a &quot;delete&quot; mark. The &quot;delete&quot; mark marks if the node is about to be deleted by a process. This ensures that other processes can react to the deletion appropriately.
*&quot;insert(e)&quot;: First, a new node with a key and a priority is created. In addition, the node is assigned a number of levels, which dictates the size of the array of pointers. Then a search is performed to find the correct position where to insert the new node. The search starts from the first node and from the highest level. Then the skip list is traversed down to the lowest level until the correct position is found. During the search, for every level the last traversed node will be saved as parent node for the new node at that level. In addition, the node to which the pointer, at that level, of the parent node points towards, will be saved as the successor node of the new node at that level. Afterwards, for every level of the new node, the pointers of the parent node will be set to the new node. Finally, the pointers, for every level, of the new node will be set to the corresponding successor nodes.
*&quot;extract-min&quot;: First, the skip list is traversed until a node is reached whose &quot;delete&quot; mark is not set. This &quot;delete&quot; mark is than set to true for that node. Finally the pointers of the parent nodes of the deleted node are updated.

If the concurrent access to a priority queue is allowed, conflicts may arise between two processes. For example, a conflict arises if one process is trying to insert a new node, but at the same time another process is about to delete the predecessor of that node. There is a risk that the new node is added to the skip list, yet it is not longer reachable. (See image)

=== &quot;K&quot;-element operations ===
In this setting, operations on a priority queue is generalized to a batch of formula_4 elements.
For instance, &quot;k_extract-min&quot; deletes the formula_4 smallest elements of the priority queue and returns those. 

In a shared-memory setting, the parallel priority queue can be easily implemented using parallel binary search trees and join-based tree algorithms. In particular, &quot;k_extract-min&quot; corresponds to a &quot;split&quot; on the binary search tree that has formula_3 cost and yields a tree that contains the formula_4 smallest elements. &quot;k_insert&quot; can be applied by a &quot;union&quot; of the original priority queue and the batch of insertions. If the batch is already sorted by the key, &quot;k_insert&quot; has formula_10 cost. Otherwise, we need to first sort the batch, so the cost will be formula_11. Other operations for priority queue can be applied similarly. For instance, &quot;k_decrease-key&quot; can be done by first applying &quot;difference&quot; and then &quot;union&quot;, which first deletes the elements and then inserts them back with the updated keys. All these operations are highly parallel, and the theoretical and practical efficiency can be found in related research papers.

The rest of this section discusses a queue-based algorithm on distributed memory. We assume each processor has its own local memory and a local (sequential) priority queue. The elements of the global (parallel) priority queue are distributed across all processors.

A &quot;k_insert&quot; operation assigns the elements uniformly random to the processors which insert the elements into their local queues. Note that single elements can still be inserted into the queue. Using this strategy the global smallest elements are in the union of the local smallest elements of every processor with high probability. Thus each processor holds a representative part of the global priority queue.

This property is used when &quot;k_extract-min&quot; is executed, as the smallest formula_12 elements of each local queue are removed and collected in a result set. The elements in the result set are still associated with their original processor. The number of elements formula_12 that is removed from each local queue depends on formula_4 and the number of processors formula_15. 

By parallel selection the formula_4 smallest elements of the result set are determined. With high probability these are the global formula_4 smallest elements. If not, formula_12 elements are again removed from each local queue and put into the result set. This is done until the global formula_4 smallest elements are in the result set. Now these formula_4 elements can be returned. All other elements of the result set are inserted back into their local queues. The running time of &quot;k_extract-min&quot; is expected formula_21, where formula_22 and formula_23 is the size of the priority queue.

The priority queue can be further improved by not moving the remaining elements of the result set directly back into the local queues after a &quot;k_extract-min&quot; operation. This saves moving elements back and forth all the time between the result set and the local queues.

By removing several elements at once a considerable speedup can be reached. But not all algorithms can use this kind of priority queue. Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm for example can not work on several nodes at once. The algorithm takes the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue and calculates new distances for all its neighbor nodes. If you would take out formula_4 nodes, working at one node could change the distance of another one of the formula_4 nodes. So using k-element operations destroys the label setting property of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm.

<text>Pāramitā (Sanskrit, Pali: पारमिता) or pāramī (Pāli: पारमी) is a Buddhist term often translated as &quot;perfection&quot;. It is described in Buddhist commentaries as a noble character quality generally associated with enlightened beings. &quot;Pāramī&quot; and &quot;pāramitā&quot; are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to &quot;pāramī&quot;, while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit &quot;pāramitā.&quot;

== Etymology ==
Donald S. Lopez Jr. describes the etymology of the term:

== Theravāda Buddhism ==
Theravada teachings on the &quot;pāramīs&quot; can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries. Theravada commentator Dhammapala describes them as noble qualities usually associated with bodhisattvas. American scholar-monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu describes them as perfections &quot;(paramī)&quot; of character necessary to achieve enlightenment as one of the three enlightened beings, a &quot;samma sambuddha&quot;, a &quot;pacceka-buddha&quot;, or an &quot;arahant&quot;.

=== Canonical sources ===
In the Pāli Canon, the &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot; of the &quot;Khuddaka Nikāya&quot; lists the ten perfections (&quot;dasa pāramiyo&quot;) as:

# &quot;Dāna pāramī&quot;: generosity, giving of oneself
# &quot;Sīla pāramī&quot;: virtue, morality, proper conduct
# &quot;Nekkhamma pāramī&quot;: renunciation
# &quot;Paññā pāramī&quot;: wisdom, discernment
# &quot;Viriya pāramī&quot;: energy, diligence, vigour, effort
# &quot;Khanti pāramī&quot;: patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
# &quot;Sacca pāramī&quot;: truthfulness, honesty
# &quot;Adhiṭṭhāna pāramī&quot;: determination, resolution
# &quot;Mettā pāramī&quot;: goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
# &quot;Upekkhā pāramī&quot;: equanimity, serenity

Two of these virtues—&quot;mettā&quot; and &quot;upekkhā&quot;—are also brahmavihāras, and two – &quot;vīrya&quot; and &quot;upekkhā&quot;—are factors of awakening.

=== Historicity ===
The Theravāda teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (&quot;Jataka tales&quot;, &quot;Apadāna&quot;, &quot;Buddhavamsa&quot;, &quot;Cariyāpiṭaka&quot;) and post-canonical commentaries written to supplement the Pāli Canon that therefore might not be an original part of the Theravāda teachings. The oldest parts of the &quot;Sutta Piṭaka&quot; (for example, &quot;Majjhima Nikāya&quot;, &quot;Digha Nikāya&quot;, &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot; and the &quot;Aṅguttara Nikāya&quot;) do not mention the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).

Some scholars refer to the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion. However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk&#x27;s life in the forest. Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Mahāyāna Buddhism may have been close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the śramaṇa.

=== Traditional practice ===
Bhikkhu Bodhi maintains that in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four &quot;nikāyas&quot;), those seeking the extinction of suffering (&quot;nibbana&quot;) pursued the noble eightfold path. As time went on, a backstory was provided for the multi-life development of the Buddha; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva (Pāli: &quot;bodhisatta&quot;). Over subsequent centuries, the &quot;pāramīs&quot; were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship. Bhikkhu Bodhi summarizes:

== Sarvāstivāda ==
The Sarvāstivāda Vaibhāṣika school&#x27;s main commentary, the &quot;Mahāvibhāṣā,&quot; teaches the bodhisattva path based on a system of four pāramitās: 

* generosity (&quot;dāna&quot;), 
* discipline (&quot;śīla&quot;), 
* energy (&quot;vīrya&quot;),
* wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;),

The &quot;Mahāvibhāṣā&quot; also mentions the system of six pāramitās, arguing that patience (&quot;&quot;) is classified as a kind of discipline and that meditation (&quot;Dhyāna&quot;) is to be seen as a mode of wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;).

== Mahāyāna Buddhism ==
Mahāyāna texts refer to the &quot;pāramitās&quot; as &quot;bases of training&quot; used for self-cultivation on the bodhisattva path to Buddhahood.

=== Six perfections ===
The Prajñapāramitā sūtras and a large number of other Mahāyāna texts list six perfections: giving, ethical discipline, patience, vigorous effort, meditation, wisdom (&quot;prajñā&quot;). 

The list of six paramitas is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator Dhammapala, who describes it as a categorization of the same ten perfections of Theravada Buddhism. According to Dhammapala, &quot;Sacca&quot; is classified as both &quot;Śīla&quot; and &quot;Prajñā&quot;, &quot;Mettā&quot; and &quot;Upekkhā&quot; are classified as &quot;Dhyāna&quot;, and &quot;Adhiṭṭhāna&quot; falls under all six. Bhikkhu Bodhi states that the correlations between the two sets shows there was a shared core before the Theravada and Mahayana schools split.

==== Dānapāramitā ====
Dāna-pāramitā (Chinese: 布施波羅蜜, pinyin: bushi boluomi; Tibetan Wylie: byin pa’i pha rol tu phyin pa) refers to a bodhisattva&#x27;s practice of generosity, giving, charity. There are three main types of giving: the &quot;gift of material goods&quot; (&quot;āmisa-dāna&quot;), the &quot;gift of fearlessness&quot; (&quot;abhaya-dāna&quot;), and the &quot;gift of the Dharma&quot; (&quot;dharma-dāna&quot;).

The perfection of giving is fully developed on the first of the ten bodhisattva stages (&quot;bhūmi&quot;). At this stage, the bodhisattva, through insight into emptiness, is inspired to perfect the practice of giving. This involves offering even the most cherished possessions—such as wealth, family, and even the bodhisattva’s own body (&quot;dehadāna&quot;)—without attachment.

A key element of the perfection of giving which distinguishes it from regular charity is how the bodhisattva, through their the understanding of emptiness, realizes that there is no inherent existence in the donor, the recipient, or the gift itself. With this realization, ordinary acts of giving are transformed into &quot;perfected&quot; acts of giving. This perfection leads to an awareness of universal suchness.

==== Śīlapāramitā ====
Śīla-pāramitā (C. 戒波羅蜜, jie boluomi; T. tshul khrims kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of virtue, moral conduct, or ethical discipline. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the perfection of ethical discipline is fulfilled by observing the bodhisattva precepts, which is divided into the &quot;three sets of pure precepts&quot; (&quot;trividhāni śīlāni&quot;; C. 三聚净戒, &quot;sanju jingjie&quot;). These are:

# The &quot;saṃvaraśīla&quot; (restraining precepts), which pertain to the rules of discipline (&quot;prātimokṣa&quot;) and proper conduct that prevent unwholesome actions. For laypersons this mainly refers to the five precepts. For monks, it includes the entire Vinaya.
# The accumulation of wholesome qualities (&quot;kuśaladharmasaṃgrāhaka&quot;), which fosters all virtuous behaviors leading to the development of the Buddha-dharma. This includes things like making offerings and dedication of merit.
# Acting for the benefit of sentient beings (&quot;sattvārthakriyā&quot;), which involves providing assistance and compassion to others. It includes taking care of the sick, protecting people from danger, teaching people the Dharma, giving to the poor, and so on.

The first category corresponds to foundational precepts emphasized in the &quot;Hīnayāna&quot; tradition, while the latter two represent the Mahāyāna perspective on moral conduct. Together, the three sets of precepts form a comprehensive framework that integrates both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna views on morality into a unified system.

Śīla-pāramitā is the main focus of cultivation on the second bodhisattva stage. At this stage, the bodhisattva overcomes the obstruction of deluded conduct (&quot;mithyāpratipattyāvaraṇa&quot;; C. 邪行障, &quot;xiexing zhang&quot;).

==== Kṣāntipāramitā ====
Kṣānti-pāramitā (Ch: 忍辱波羅蜜 renru boluomi; T. bzod pa’i pha rol tu) is the bodhisattva&#x27;s perfection of patience, a virtue which also has connotations of tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, and endurance. The term &quot;kṣānti&quot; holds multiple meanings. It often refers to the patience and endurance demonstrated by a bodhisattva in various aspects of their spiritual journey and includes the ability to endure abuse and hardship inflicted by sentient beings without wavering in compassion or resolve. It also means that a bodhisattva maintains a commitment to persevere through the difficulties encountered on the path to buddhahood, maintaining the dedication to liberate all beings from saṃsāra. Furthermore, it also refers to the capacity to accept and be receptive to the profound truths of reality, such as impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and not-self, without being overwhelmed or fearful for them.

This latter sense is particularly important in Mahāyāna, which culminates in the attainment of &quot;receptivity to the non-production of dharmas&quot; (anutpattikadharmakṣānti). This attainment refers to a bodhisattva&#x27;s unwavering receptive realization that all phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) are intrinsically &quot;unproduced&quot; (&quot;anutpāda&quot;) and &quot;empty&quot; (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), including themselves, Buddhahood and the Dharma itself. The acceptance and realization of this ultimate truth is crucial for attaining the stage of non-retrogression (&quot;avaivartika&quot;) in which a bodhisattva cannot fall back to a lesser level, which is often identified with the first or eighth &quot;bhūmi&quot; on the bodhisattva path.

==== Vīryapāramitā ====
Vīrya-pāramitā (C. 精進波羅蜜, jingjin boluomiduo; T. brtson ’grus kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of energy, diligence, vigour, or effort. Vīrya-pāramitā represents the tireless and unwavering energy and effort necessary to overcome obstacles, cultivate virtue, and realize wisdom on the bodhisattva path. This perfection is fully realized during the fourth stage of the bodhisattva path. At this stage, the radiant intensity of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (&quot;bodhipākṣikadharma&quot;) becomes so powerful that it burns away all defilements and obstructions. This purification grants the bodhisattva boundless energy to pursue enlightenment and the liberation of all beings.

==== Dhyānapāramitā ====
Dhyāna-pāramitā (C. 禪定波羅蜜, jinglü boluomiduo; T. bsam gtan gyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of meditation or contemplative absorption and is closely associated with the bodhisattva&#x27;s mastery of numerous samādhis. The perfection of dhyana in Mahayana Buddhism includes the classic early Buddhist meditative states called the four dhyānas, which gradually take a mediator to a place beyond all thought.

However, according to the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot;, a bodhisattva&#x27;s meditations are also significantly different than the non-Mahayana dhyānas. While in Theravada, the dhyānas are meant to go beyond all thought into a perfectly peaceful unmoving state of mind, the &quot;Dazhidulun&quot; mentions that regarding the practice of the four meditations or dhyānas &quot;the bodhisattva practicing dhyānapāramitā enters the successive dhyāna stages &quot;with thoughts of the realm of desire&quot;.&quot; This is because a bodhisattva, while having no coarse thinking (vitarka) or subtle examination (vicara), they are still focused on all sentient beings in all realms and seek to guide them to nirvana. This is due to the Mahayana emphasis on compassion for all beings, which rejects the idea that we must retreat to state of mind which is completely detached from all beings.

As such, Mahayana texts are careful to warn bodhisattvas not to practice dhyāna in the same manner as Hinayanists, that is to say, to practice them in a self-centered manner that seeks only an individual escape from samsara. As such, the &quot;Aṣṭādaśasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā&quot; states that a bodhisattva must master the eight dhyānas without seeking their karmic fruit (i.e. rebirth outside the realm of desire). This is done through developing bodhicitta, as the &quot;Aṣṭādaśasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā&quot; states, the bodhisattva meditates by &quot;not clinging to the level of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, and [practices meditation thinking], &#x27;Having stood in the perfection of dhyāna, I must now liberate all beings from the cycle of rebirths.&#x27;&quot;

==== Prajñāpāramitā ====
&quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; (C. 般若波羅蜜, bore boluomiduo; T. shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa), the perfection of wisdom, is the most important and foundational of all the pāramitās and the source of them all. This term carries multiple meanings, but generally speaking, &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; refers to a transcendent kind of wisdom surpassing ordinary understanding, particularly the wisdom required for achieving buddhahood. It is often defined as the realization of emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;) and suchness (Tathātā), and the insight that agent, object, and action lack a permanent essence or svabhava. When linked to the ten bodhisattva stages (&quot;bhūmi&quot;), the perfection of wisdom corresponds to the sixth stage.

=== Ten perfections ===
In the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;, four more pāramitās are listed, bringing the total count to ten perfection. The extra four are: &quot;Upāya-pāramitā&quot; (perfection of skillful means), &quot;Praṇidhāna-pāramitā&quot; (perfection of aspiration or vows), &quot;Bala-pāramitā&quot; (perfection of power) and &quot;Jñāna pāramitā&quot; (perfection of knowledge)&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Sutra of the Heap of Jewels&quot;) also includes these additional four pāramitās, with the order of numbers 8 and 9 switched.

==== Upāyapāramitā ====
The perfection of skillful means (&quot;upāya-kauśalya&quot;) is the skill of a Buddha or an advanced bodhisattva which allows them to perfectly tailor their teachings and actions to align with the inclinations and capacities of his audience. Because buddhas and bodhisattvas have profound understanding, they can provide teachings that are most suitable for each individual, akin to a physician prescribing specific treatments for particular ailments. Moreover, &quot;skillful means&quot; can serve to explain why certain actions, which might seem unethical to beings of limited spiritual insight, become virtuous when undertaken by a bodhisattva who acts with the ultimate welfare of others in mind.

==== Praṇidhānapāramitā ====
Praṇidhānapāramitā (C. 願波羅 yuan boluomi; T. smon lam gyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the perfection of the bodhisattva&#x27;s vow or &quot;aspiration&quot;. This refers to how bodhisattvas make solemn declarations of their intent to achieve buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. These vows can take the form of an oath, where one commits to achieving a goal, or a prayer, where one dedicates merit toward its realization. The term also appears in the context of &quot;pūrvapraṇidhāna&quot;, meaning &quot;prior vow.&quot; This refers to a pledge made in the past, either already fulfilled in the present or destined for fulfillment in the future, typically in relation to the aspiration for buddhahood.

==== Balapāramitā ====
Balapāramitā (C. 力波羅蜜 li bo-luomi; T. stobs kyi pha rol tu phyin pa) is the “perfection of power” or “strength”. This refers to the power of a bodhisattva which allows him to master elements of the teaching, such as the four analytical knowledges or four discriminations (pratisaṃvid).

==== Jñānapāramitā ====
Jñāna-pāramitā (C. 智 zhi; T. ye shes) is the perfection of &quot;gnosis,&quot; or &quot;knowledge,&quot;, which denotes a distinct understanding of an object’s nature. While &quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot; signifies perfected spiritual insight into ultimate reality, &quot;jñāna&quot; refers to more general forms of knowledge specific to the path of the bodhisattva. There are various schemas of these types of knowledge. One text, the &quot;Abhisamayālaṅkāra&quot;, divides knowledge into three main types: knowledge of all aspects (sarvākārajñatā, only Buddhas have this), knowledge of paths (mārgākārajñatā, which is accessible to bodhisattvas) and all-knowledge (sarvajñatā, accessible even to sravakas).

=== Tibetan Buddhism ===
According to the perspective of Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of accumulating paramitas is generally considered very important. In most contexts, they are seen as a fundamental basis for practice of the higher teachings, such as Vajrayana.  His Holiness the Dalai Lama has said:To attain enlightenment, we need better rebirths; and the six perfections – in particular, far-reaching ethical self-discipline – enable us to attain better rebirths. We won’t be able to help others materially if we aren’t wealthy, and so we need to cultivate generosity. We need virtuous friends, and so we must reject anger and practice patience. In order to accomplish anything, we need perseverance. To gain friends, we must control our disturbing emotions, and so we must practice mental constancy (concentration). And finally, to really be effective in helping others, we need the discriminating awareness (wisdom) of knowing what is beneficial and what is of harm. Therefore, we need to cultivate all six far-reaching attitudes.Similarly, concerning the six paramitas, or &quot;the six far-reaching attitudes,&quot; and how they relate to the practice of the three vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has said: The Hinayana path is the preliminary path, the Mahayana sutra one is the main path, and tantra is something to train in only as a branch. The four tenet systems are like stairs. The higher systems highlight contradictions in the lower ones, but by knowing the lower, we can appreciate the profundity of the higher. The higher systems are vast and profound since they do not contradict logic. If we are aware of the areas in which we can make mistakes, it helps us to stay on the right path and have confidence in it. Thus, the study of the tenet systems gives stability to our view. Then, on the basis of the six far-reaching attitudes and bodhichitta, we will be able to fulfill our own aims and those of others.Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche renders &quot;pāramitā&quot; into English as &quot;transcendent action&quot; and then frames and qualifies it:
The initial four perfections involve skillful means practice, while the last two pertain to wisdom practice. Together, they encompass all the necessary methods and skills to dispel delusion and meet the needs of others, and to rise from states of contentment to even greater happiness.

== General concepts ==

=== Basic principles ===
Physics – branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. Physics is one of the &quot;fundamental sciences&quot; because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:
* Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.
** Newton&#x27;s laws of motion
** Mass, force and weight (mass versus weight)

** Gravity, theories of gravity
** Energy, work, and their relationship
** Motion, position, and energy

<text>Prakrit () is a group of vernacular classical Middle Indo-Aryan languages that were used in the Indian subcontinent from around the 5th century BCE to the 12th century CE. The term Prakrit is usually applied to the middle period of Middle Indo-Aryan languages, excluding Pali.

The oldest stage of Middle Indo-Aryan language is attested in the inscriptions of Ashoka (ca. 260 BCE), as well as in the earliest forms of Pāli, the language of the Theravāda Buddhist canon. The most prominent form of Prakrit is Ardhamāgadhı̄, associated with the ancient kingdom of Magadha, in modern Bihar, and the subsequent Mauryan Empire. Mahāvı̄ra, the last tirthankar of 24 tirthankar of Jainism, was born in Magadha, and the earliest Jain texts were composed in Ardhamāgadhı̄.

==Etymology==
There are two major views concerning the way in which Sanskrit and Prakrit are related. One holds that the original matter in question is the speech of the common people, unadorned by grammar, and that prākṛta thus refers to vernacular usage in contrast to the elevated register of Sanskrit usage. This is one of several views noted, for example, by Nami Sadhu (11th century ce) in his commentary on Rudraṭa’s Kāvyālaṅkāra (“Ornaments of Poetry”), a 9th-century treatise on poetics. It is also the usual explanation accepted by Western linguists. In contrast, the view most commonly held by Prakrit grammarians holds that the Prakrit languages are vernaculars that arose from Sanskrit:

# According to the &quot;Prākrṭa Prakāśa&quot;, an ancient Prakrit grammar, “Saṃskṛtam is the prakṛti (source) and the language that originates in, or comes from, that prakṛti, is therefore called prākṛtam.”
# Hemachandra (a Jain grammarian of the 10th century who lived in Gujarat) in his grammar of Sanskrit and Prākrit named &quot;Siddha-Hema-Śabdanuśāsana&quot;, defines prākṛt’s origin to be sanskṛt: “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtam, tatrabhavaṃ tata āgataṃ vā prākṛtaṃ”[Sanskrit is the prakṛti (source) and Prākṛta is so called because it either ‘originates in’ or ‘comes from’ Sanskrit.]
# Another prākṛt grammarian, Mārkaṇḍeya, writes in his grammar &quot;Prākṛtasarvasva:&quot; “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtaṃ, tatrabhavaṃ prākṛtam ucyate” [Sanskrit is called the prakṛti (origin), and from there prākṛtam originates].
# Dhanika, in his ‘Daśarūpakāvaloka’ commentary on Daśarūpaka (one of the most important treatises explaining the 10 types of Indian Drama), says: “prakṛter āgataṃ prākṛtam, prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtam” [from the prakṛti (source) comes Prākṛtam, and that prakṛti is Sanskrit]
# Siṃhadevagaṇin while commenting on Vāgbhaṭālaṅkāra writes: “prakṛteḥ saṃskrtād āgataṃ prākṛtam” [from Sanskrit (which is the source, i.e. prakṛti) comes Prākṛt]
# The Prākṛtacandrikā (a grammar of Prākṛt) says: “prakṛtiḥ saṃskṛtaṃ, tatrabhavatvāt prākṛtaṃ smṛtam” [Sanskrit is the prakṛti, it is remembered that prākṛtam originates from that (prakṛti)]
# The Prākṛtaśabdapradīpikā of Narasiṃha says: “prakṛteḥ saṃskṛtāyāstu vikṛtiḥ prākṛtī matā” [Alterations/changes (vikṛti) of the original Sanskrit is known as Prākṛt]

# Śaṅkara, in his Rasacandrikā commentary on the Abhijñānaśākuntala (play by Kālidāsa), says something slightly different from the above: “saṃskṛtāt prākṛtam śreṣṭhaṃ tato ’pabhraṃśabhāṣaṇam” [From Sanskrit is derived best prākṛt, and from that is derived the corrupt-speech, i.e. apabhraṃśa]

The dictionary of Monier Monier-Williams (1819–1899), and other modern authors, however, interpret the word in the opposite sense: “The most frequent meanings of the term &#x27;, from which the word ‘prakrit’ is derived, are ‘original, natural, normal’ and the term is derived from &#x27;, ‘making or placing before or at first, the original or natural form or condition of anything, original or primary substance.’”

== Definition ==

Modern scholars have used the term &quot;Prakrit&quot; to refer to two concepts:

*Prakrit languages: a group of closely related literary languages
* the Prakrit language: one of the Prakrit languages, which alone was used as the primary language of entire poems

Some modern scholars include all Middle Indo-Aryan languages under the rubric of &#x27;Prakrits&#x27;, while others emphasize the independent development of these languages, often separated from the history of Sanskrit by wide divisions of caste, religion, and geography.

The broadest definition uses the term &quot;Prakrit&quot; to describe any Middle Indo-Aryan language that deviates from Sanskrit in any manner. American scholar Andrew Ollett points out that this unsatisfactory definition makes &quot;Prakrit&quot; a cover term for languages that were not actually called Prakrit in ancient India, such as:

* Ashokan Prakrit: the language of Ashoka&#x27;s inscriptions
* the language of later inscriptions of India, labeled &quot;Monumental Prakrit&quot;, &quot;Lena Prakrit&quot;, or &quot;Stupa dialect&quot;
* the language of inscriptions of Sri Lanka, labeled &quot;Sinhalese Prakrit&quot;
* Pali, the language of the Theravada Buddhist canon
* the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit
* Gandhari, the language of birch-bark scrolls discovered in the region stretching from northwestern Pakistan to western China.
* Kannada – one of the Chalukya inscriptions describes Kannada as a Prakrit.

According to some scholars, such as German Indologists Richard Pischel and Oskar von Hinüber, the term &quot;Prakrit&quot; refers to a smaller set of languages that were used exclusively in literature:

* Scenic Prakrits
** These languages are used exclusively in plays, as secondary languages
** Their names indicate regional association (e.g. Shauraseni, Magadhi, and Avanti), although these associations are mostly notional
* Primary Prakrits
** These languages are used as primary languages of literary classics such as &quot;Gaha Sattasai&quot;
** This includes the Maharashtri Prakrit or &quot;Prakrit &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;, which according to Dandin&#x27;s &quot;Kavya-darsha&quot;, was prevalent in the Maharashtra region, and in which poems such as &quot;Ravana-vaho&quot; (or &quot;Setubandha&quot;) were composed.

According to Sanskrit and Prakrit scholar Shreyansh Kumar Jain Shastri and A. C. Woolner, the Ardhamāgadhı̄ (or simply Magadhi) Prakrit, which was used extensively to write the scriptures of Jainism, is often considered to be the definitive form of Prakrit, while others are considered variants of it. Prakrit grammarians would give the full grammar of Ardhamāgadhı̄ first, and then define the other grammars with relation to it. For this reason, courses teaching &#x27;Prakrit&#x27; are often regarded as teaching Ardhamāgadhı̄.

== Grammar ==

Medieval grammarians such as Markandeya (late 16th century) describe a highly systematized Prakrit grammar, but the surviving Prakrit texts do not adhere to this grammar. For example, according to Vishvanatha (14th century), in a Sanskrit drama, the characters should speak Maharashtri Prakrit in verse and Shauraseni Prakrit in prose. But the 10th century Sanskrit dramatist Rajashekhara does not abide by this rule. Markandeya, as well as later scholars such as Sten Konow, find faults with the Prakrit portions of Rajashekhara&#x27;s writings, but it is not clear if the rule enunciated by Vishvanatha existed during Rajashekhara&#x27;s time. Rajashekhara himself imagines Prakrit as a single language or a single kind of language, alongside Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, and Paishachi.

German Indologist Theodor Bloch (1894) dismissed the medieval Prakrit grammarians as unreliable, arguing that they were not qualified to describe the language of the texts composed centuries before them. Other scholars such as Sten Konow, Richard Pischel and Alfred Hillebrandt disagree with Bloch. It is possible that the grammarians sought to codify only the language of the earliest classics of the Prakrit literature, such as the &quot;Gaha Sattasai&quot;. Another explanation is that the extant Prakrit manuscripts contain scribal errors. Most of the surviving Prakrit manuscripts were produced in a variety of regional scripts during 1300–1800 CE. It appears that the scribes who made these copies from the earlier manuscripts did not have a good command of the original language of the texts, as several of the extant Prakrit texts contain inaccuracies or are incomprehensible.

Also, like Sanskrit and other ancient languages Prakrit was spoken and written long before grammars were written for it. The Vedas do not follow Panini&#x27;s Sanskrit grammar which is now the basis for all Sanskrit grammar. Similarly, the Agamas, and texts like Shatkhandagama, do not follow the modern Prakrit grammar.

Prakrita Prakasha, a book attributed to Vararuchi, summarizes various Prakrit languages.

== Prevalence ==

Prakrit literature was produced across a wide area of South Asia. Outside India, the language was also known in Cambodia and Java.

Literary Prakrit is often wrongly assumed to have been a language (or languages) spoken by the common people, because it is different from Sanskrit, which is the predominant language of the ancient Indian literature. Several modern scholars, such as George Abraham Grierson and Richard Pischel, have asserted that the literary Prakrit does not represent the actual languages spoken by the common people of ancient India. This theory is corroborated by a market scene in Uddyotana&#x27;s &quot;Kuvalaya-mala&quot; (779 CE), in which the narrator speaks a few words in 18 different languages: some of these languages sound similar to the languages spoken in modern India; but none of them resemble the language that Uddyotana identifies as &quot;Prakrit&quot; and uses for narration throughout the text.The local variants of Apabhramsha evolved into the modern day Indo-Aryan vernaculars of South Asia.

== Literature ==

Literary Prakrit was among the main languages of the classical Indian culture. Dandin&#x27;s &quot;Kavya-darsha&quot; () mentions four kinds of literary languages: Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, and mixed. Bhoja&#x27;s &quot;Sarasvati-Kanthabharana&quot; (11th century) lists Prakrit among the few languages suitable for composition of literature. Mirza Khan&#x27;s &quot;Tuhfat al-hind&quot; (1676) names Prakrit among the three kinds of literary languages native to India, the other two being Sanskrit and the vernacular languages. It describes Prakrit as a mixture of Sanskrit and vernacular languages, and adds that Prakrit was &quot;mostly employed in the praise of kings, ministers, and chiefs&quot;.

During a large period of the first millennium, literary Prakrit was the preferred language for the fictional romance in India. Its use as a language of systematic knowledge was limited, because of Sanskrit&#x27;s dominance in this area, but nevertheless, Prakrit texts exist on topics such as grammar, lexicography, metrics, alchemy, medicine, divination, and gemology. In addition, the Jains used Prakrit for religious literature, including commentaries on the Jain canonical literature, stories about Jain figures, moral stories, hymns and expositions of Jain doctrine. Prakrit is also the language of some Shaiva &quot;tantras&quot; and Vaishnava hymns.

Besides being the primary language of several texts, Prakrit also features as the language of low-class men and most women in the Sanskrit stage plays. American scholar Andrew Ollett traces the origin of the Sanskrit Kavya to Prakrit poems.

Some of the texts that identify their language as Prakrit include:

* Hāla&#x27;s &quot;Gaha Sattasai&quot; (), anthology of single verse poems
* Ananda-vardhana&#x27;s now-lost &quot;God of Five Arrows at Play&quot;, poem
* Sarvasena&#x27;s &quot;Hari-vijaya&quot; (late 4th century), epic
* Pravarasena II&#x27;s &quot;Ravana-vaho&quot; (early 5th century), epic
* Palitta&#x27;s &quot;Tarangavati&quot; (probably 1st or 2nd century), fictional romance
* Palitta&#x27;s &quot;Rasikaprakāśana&quot; or &quot;Brilliance of the Connoisseurs&quot;
* Vakpati&#x27;s &quot;Gaudavaho&quot; (c. 8th century)
* Haribhadra&#x27;s &quot;Samaraditya-charitra&quot; (c. 8th century), fictional romance
* Uddyotana&#x27;s &quot;Kuvalaya-mala&quot; (779 CE), fictional romance
* Kautuhala&#x27;s &quot;Lilavati&quot; or Kouhala&#x27;s &quot;Lilavai&quot; (c. 8th century), fictional romance
* Madhuka&#x27;s &quot;Haramekhalā&quot; or &quot;Hara&#x27;s Belt&quot; (10th century), a compendium covering a wide range of topics, such as casting love spells and treating snakebites
* Jineshvara&#x27;s &quot;Treasury of Gatha-Jewels&quot; (1194), anthology of verses
* Addahamana&#x27;s &quot;Sandesha-rasaka&quot; (13th century), a message poem; the author states that his family came from &quot;the land of the Muslims&quot;, which suggests that Addahamana is the Prakrit variant of &#x27;Abd ur-Rahman.

==List of Prakrits==

The languages that have been labeled &quot;Prakrit&quot; in modern times include the following:

Not all of these languages were actually called &quot;Prakrit&quot; in the ancient period.

===Dramatic Prakrits===

Dramatic Prakrits were those that were used in dramas and other literature. Whenever dialogue was written in a Prakrit, the reader would also be provided with a Sanskrit translation.

The phrase &quot;Dramatic Prakrits&quot; often refers to three most prominent of them: Shauraseni Prakrit, Magadhi Prakrit, and Maharashtri Prakrit. However, there were a slew of other less commonly used Prakrits that also fall into this category. These include Prachya, Bahliki, Dakshinatya, Shakari, Chandali, Shabari, Abhiri, Dramili, and Odri. There was a strict structure to the use of these different Prakrits in dramas. Characters each spoke a different Prakrit based on their role and background; for example, Dramili was the language of &quot;forest-dwellers&quot;, Sauraseni was spoken by &quot;the heroine and her female friends&quot;, and Avanti was spoken by &quot;cheats and rogues&quot;. Maharashtri and Shaurseni Prakrit were more common and were used in literature extensively.

=== Jain Prakrit ===

Some 19th–20th century European scholars, such as Hermann Jacobi and Ernst Leumann, made a distinction between Jain and non-Jain Prakrit literature. Jacobi used the term &quot;Jain Prakrit&quot; (or &quot;Jain Maharashtri&quot;, as he called it) to denote the language of relatively late and relatively more Sanskrit-influenced narrative literature, as opposed to the earlier Prakrit court poetry. Later scholars used the term &quot;Jain Prakrit&quot; for any variety of Prakrit used by Jain authors, including the one used in early texts such as &quot;Tarangavati&quot; and &quot;Vasudeva-Hindi&quot;. However, the works written by Jain authors do not necessarily belong to an exclusively Jain history, and do not show any specific literary features resulting from their belief in Jainism. Therefore, the division of Prakrit literature into Jain and non-Jain categories is no longer considered tenable.

== Status ==
Under the Mauryan Empire various Prakrits enjoyed the status of royal language. Prakrit was the language of Emperor Ashoka who was patron of Buddhism.

Prakrit languages are said to have held a lower social status than Sanskrit in classical India. In the Sanskrit stage plays, such as Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Shakuntala&quot;, lead characters typically speak Sanskrit, while the unimportant characters and most female characters typically speak Prakrit.

While Prakrits were originally seen as &#x27;lower&#x27; forms of language, the influence they had on Sanskrit – allowing it to be more easily used by the common people – as well as the converse influence of Sanskrit on the Prakrits, gave Prakrits progressively higher cultural prestige.

Mirza Khan&#x27;s &quot;Tuhfat al-hind&quot; (1676) characterizes Prakrit as the language of &quot;the lowest of the low&quot;, stating that the language was known as &quot;Patal-bani&quot; (&quot;Language of the underground&quot;) or &quot;Nag-bani&quot; (&quot;Language of the snakes&quot;).

Among modern scholars, Prakrit literature has received less attention than Sanskrit. Few modern Prakrit texts have survived in modern times, and even fewer have been published or attracted critical scholarship. Prakrit was designated as a classical language on 3 October 2024 by the Government of India, as the earliest Prakrit literature is older than most Indian literatures.

== Research institutes ==

In 1955, government of Bihar established at Vaishali, the Research Institute of Prakrit Jainology and Ahimsa with the aim to promote research work in Prakrit.

The National Institute of Prakrit Study and Research is located in Shravanabelagola, Karnataka, India.

<text>Progressive music is music that attempts to expand existing stylistic boundaries associated with specific genres of music. The word comes from the basic concept of &quot;progress&quot;, which refers to advancements through accumulation, and is often deployed in the context of distinct genres, with progressive rock being the most notable example. Music that is deemed &quot;progressive&quot; usually synthesizes influences from various cultural domains, such as European art music, Celtic folk, West Indian, or African. It is rooted in the idea of a cultural alternative, and may also be associated with auteur-stars and concept albums, considered traditional structures of the music industry.

As an art theory, the progressive approach falls between formalism and eclecticism. &quot;Formalism&quot; refers to a preoccupation with established external compositional systems, structural unity, and the autonomy of individual art works. Like formalism, &quot;eclecticism&quot; connotes a predilection toward style synthesis or integration. However, contrary to formalist tendencies, eclecticism foregrounds discontinuities between historical and contemporary styles and electronic media, sometimes referring simultaneously to vastly different musical genres, idioms, and cultural codes. In marketing, &quot;progressive&quot; is used to distinguish a product from &quot;commercial&quot; pop music. 

==Jazz==

Progressive jazz is a form of big band that is more complex or experimental. It originated in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its &quot;progressive&quot; features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography: &quot;They tried to make Stan Kenton a &#x27;white hope&#x27;, called modern jazz and my music &#x27;progressive&#x27;, then tried to tell me I played &#x27;progressive&#x27; music. I said, &#x27;You&#x27;re full of shit!&#x27; &#x27;Stan Kenton? There ain&#x27;t nothing in my music that&#x27;s cold, cold like his.&quot;

Progressive big band is a style of big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernist arrangements and more room to improvise. The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.

==Pop and rock==


===Definitions===

&quot;Progressive rock&quot; is almost synonymous with &quot;art rock&quot;; the latter is more likely to have experimental or avant-garde influences. Although a unidirectional English &quot;progressive&quot; style emerged in the late 1960s, by 1967, progressive rock had come to constitute a diversity of loosely associated style codes. With the arrival of a &quot;progressive&quot; label, the music was dubbed &quot;progressive pop&quot; before it was called &quot;progressive rock&quot;. &quot;Progressive&quot; referred to the wide range of attempts to break with the standard pop music formula. A number of additional factors contributed to the label—lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of &quot;art&quot;, some harmonic language was imported from jazz and 19th-century classical music, the album format overtook singles, and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.

===Background===

During the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word &quot;progressive&quot; was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a &quot;progression&quot; from the last. In 1966, the degree of social and artistic dialogue among rock musicians dramatically increased for bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Byrds who fused elements of composed (cultivated) music with the oral (vernacular) musical traditions of rock. Rock music started to take itself seriously, paralleling earlier attempts in jazz (as swing gave way to bop, a move which did not succeed with audiences). In this period, the popular song began signaling a new possible means of expression that went beyond the three-minute love song, leading to an intersection between the &quot;underground&quot; and the &quot;establishment&quot; for listening publics. The Beach Boys&#x27; leader Brian Wilson is credited for setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers.

The music was developed immediately following a brief period in the mid 1960s where creative authenticity among musical artists and consumer marketing coincided with each other. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid 1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. The growing student market serviced record labels with the word &quot;progressive&quot;, being adopted as a marketing term to differentiate their product from &quot;commercial&quot; pop.Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between &quot;progressive&quot; pop and &quot;mass/chart&quot; pop, a separation which was &quot;also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class&quot;. Before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful British sound of the early 1970s, the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism, broaching the question of what it meant to be an artist in a mass medium. Progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy, and so the strategy of &quot;progressive&quot; rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers &quot;above&quot; normal pop practice.

&quot;Proto-prog&quot; is a retrospective label for the first wave of progressive rock musicians. The musicians that approached this genre harnessed modern classical and other genres usually outside of traditional rock influences, longer and more complicated compositions, interconnected songs as medley, and studio composition. Progressive rock itself evolved from psychedelic/acid rock music, specifically a strain of classical/symphonic rock led by the Nice, Procol Harum, and the Moody Blues. Critics assumed King Crimson&#x27;s debut album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; (1969) to be the logical extension and development of late 1960s proto-progressive rock exemplified by the Moody Blues, Procol Harum, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. According to Macan, the album may be the most influential to progressive rock for crystallizing the music of earlier &quot;proto-progressive bands [...] into a distinctive, immediately recognizable style&quot;. He distinguishes 1970s &quot;classic&quot; prog from late 1960s proto-prog by the conscious rejection of psychedelic rock elements, which proto-progressive bands continued to incorporate.

===Post-progressive===

&quot;Post-progressive&quot; is a term invented to distinguish a type of rock music from the persistent &quot;progressive rock&quot; style associated with the 1970s. In the mid to late 1970s, progressive music was denigrated for its assumed pretentiousness, specifically the likes of Yes, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. According to musicologist John Covach, &quot;by the early 1980s, progressive rock was thought to be all but dead as a style, an idea reinforced by the fact that some of the principal progressive groups has developed a more commercial sound. [...] What went out of the music of these now ex-progressive groups [...] was any significant evocation of art music.&quot; In the opinion of King Crimson&#x27;s Robert Fripp, &quot;progressive&quot; music was an attitude, not a style. He believed that genuinely &quot;progressive&quot; music pushes stylistic and conceptual boundaries outwards through the appropriation of procedures from classical music or jazz, and that once &quot;progressive rock&quot; ceased to cover new ground – becoming a set of conventions to be repeated and imitated – the genre&#x27;s premise had ceased to be &quot;progressive&quot;. 

A direct reaction to prog came in the form of the punk movement, which rejected classical traditions, virtuosity, and textural complexity. Post-punk, which author Doyle Green characterizes &quot;as a kind of ″progressive punk, was played by bands like Talking Heads, Pere Ubu, Public Image Ltd, and Joy Division. It differs from punk rock by balancing punk&#x27;s energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. It was also majorly influenced from world music, especially African and Asian traditions. In the same period, new wave music was more sophisticated in production terms than some contemporaneous progressive music, but was largely perceived as simplistic, and thus had little overt appeal to art music or art-music practice. Musicologist Bill Martin writes; &quot;[Talking] Heads created a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A good deal of the more interesting rock since that time is clearly &#x27;post-Talking Heads&#x27; music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well.&quot;

== Soul and funk ==

&quot;Progressive soul&quot; is used by Martin to refer to a musical development in which many African-American recording artists by the 1970s were creating music in a manner similar to progressive rock. This development inspired greater musical diversity and sophistication, ambitious lyricism, and conceptual album-oriented approach in black pop. Among the musicians at its forefront were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton. According to Geoffrey Himes, &quot;the short-lived progressive-soul movement flourished&quot; from 1968 to 1973 and demonstrated &quot;adventurous rock guitar, socially conscious lyrics and classic R&amp;B melody&quot;. Similar to contemporaneous white prog musicians, progressive black musicians in the 1970s directed their creative control toward ideals of &quot;individualism, artistic progression and writing for posterity&quot;, according to music academic Jay Keister, who notes that this pursuit sometimes conflicted with the collective political values of the Black Arts Movement.

Among the stylistic characteristics shared from progressive rock in black progressive music of this period were extended composition, diverse musical appropriation, and recording music intended for listening rather than dancing. Rather than the song-based extended compositions and suites of progressive white music, black counterparts in the 1970s generally unified an extended recording with an underlying rhythmic groove. Instrumental textures were altered in order to signify a change in section over an extended track&#x27;s course. Examples of these characteristics include Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;Wars of Armageddon&quot; (1971) and Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Space Is the Place&quot; (1973). Unlike the European art music appropriations used by white artists, progressive black music featured musical idioms from African and African-American music sources. However, some also borrowed elements from European American traditions to augment a song&#x27;s lyrical idea. For example, Wonder added pleasant-sounding instrumental textures from a string section to &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot; (1976), lending a sense of irony to an otherwise bleak critique of social ills in urban ghettos.

==Electronic==

&quot;Progressive electronic&quot; is defined by AllMusic as a subgenre of new age music, and a style that &quot;thrives in more unfamiliar territory&quot; where the results are &quot;often dictated by the technology itself&quot;. According to Allmusic, &quot;rather than sampling or synthesizing acoustic sounds to electronically replicate them&quot; producers of this music &quot;tend to mutate the original timbres, sometimes to an unrecognizable state&quot;. Allmusic also states that &quot;true artists in the genre also create their own sounds&quot;.

Tangerine Dream&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Phaedra&quot;, recorded with a Moog sequencer, was described as &quot;an early masterpiece of progressive electronic music&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In house music, a desire to define precise stylistic strands and taste markets saw the interposition of prefixes like &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;tribal&quot;, and &quot;intelligent&quot;. According to disc jockey and producer Carl Craig, the term &quot;progressive&quot; was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italian disco. The music was dubbed &quot;progressive&quot; because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic Philadelphia sound. By 1993, progressive house and trance music had emerged in dance clubs. &quot;Progressive house&quot; was an English style of house distinguished by long tracks, big riffs, mild dub inflections, and multitiered percussion. According to Simon Reynolds, the &quot;&#x27;progressive&#x27; seemed to signify not just its anti-cheese, nongirly credentials, but its severing of house&#x27;s roots from gay black disco&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, the lowercase movement, a reductive approach towards new digital technologies, was spearheaded by a number of so-called &quot;progressive electronica&quot; artists.

===Criticism===
Reynolds posited in 2013 that &quot;the truly progressive edge in electronic music involves doing things that can&#x27;t be physically achieved by human beings manipulating instruments in real-time&quot;. He criticized terms like &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;intelligent&quot;, arguing that &quot;it&#x27;s usually a sign that it&#x27;s gearing up the media game as a prequel to buying into traditional music industry structure of auteur-stars, concept albums, and long-term careers. Above all, it&#x27;s a sign of impending musical debility, creeping self-importance, and the hemorrhaging away of fun.&quot; Reynolds also identifies links between progressive rock and other electronic music genres, and that &quot;many post-rave genres bear an uncanny resemblance to progressive rock: conceptualism, auteur-geniuses, producers making music to impress other producers, [and] showboating virtuosity reborn as the &#x27;science&#x27; of programming finesse&quot;.

== Hip hop ==

&quot;Progressive rap&quot; has been used by academics to describe a certain type of hip hop music. Anthony B. Pinn regards it as a thematic subset alongside gangsta rap and &quot;status rap&quot;, which expresses concerns about social status and mobility. While exploring existential crises and philosophical contradictions similar to gangsta rap, progressive rap, he says, &quot;seeks to address these concerns without intracommunal aggression and in terms of political and cultural education, providing an interpretation of American society and a constructive agenda (e.g. self respect, knowledge, pride, and unity) for the uplift of Black America&quot;. He adds that works of the genre also utilize &quot;a more overt dialogue with and interpretation of Black religiosity&quot;. In a corollary analysis, fellow academic Evelyn L. Parker says that progressive rap &quot;seeks to transform systems of injustice by transforming the perspective of their victims&quot; while demonstrating &quot;the clear prophetic voice reflecting the rage caused by the dehumanizing injustices that African Americans experience&quot;.

Early works of progressive rap such as the 1982 Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song &quot;The Message&quot; and the music of Public Enemy featured expressions of anger about chaotic urban life. Other formative groups such as De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and Brand Nubian helped establish the genre&#x27;s thematic mode. At the turn of the 2000s, Outkast and The Roots were among the few progressive-rap acts who &quot;ruminated on hip-hop&#x27;s post-millennial direction&quot; and &quot;produced records in an avant-garde vein purposely intended to evolve the music&quot; while achieving commercial success, according to Miles Marshall Lewis. Kanye West, another influential artist in hip hop&#x27;s progressive tradition, achieved even greater success with his opening trilogy of education-themed albums in the 2000s. His 2010 album &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot; has also been associated with prog-rap due largely to its sampling of records from progressive rock as well as its ostentatious sensibilities.

The UK has also produced notable performers in progressive rap, including Gaika and Kojey Radical, who are credited by &quot;Vice&quot; in 2016 for working &quot;deliberately outside the confines of grime and traditional UK hip hop to create genuinely progressive rap that rivals the US for creativity, urgency, and importance, and portrays a much broader black British music landscape than you hear on the radio&quot;. More recently, American studies and media scholar William Hoynes highlights the progressive rap of Kendrick Lamar as being in the tradition of African-American art and activism that operated &quot;both inside and outside of the mainstream to advance a counterculture that opposes the racist stereotypes being propagated in white-owned media and culture&quot;.

<doc id="24503" wikidata="Q7315" url="?curid=24503" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">
<text>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( ; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer during the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally. Tchaikovsky wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the classical repertoire, including the ballets &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, the &quot;1812 Overture&quot;, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; Overture-Fantasy, several symphonies, and the opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant as there was little opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no public music education system. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching Tchaikovsky received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From that reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style. The principles that governed melody, harmony, and other fundamentals of Russian music diverged from those that governed Western European music, which seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky&#x27;s self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. That resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country&#x27;s national identity, an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s career.

Despite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by her early death, the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, his failed marriage to Antonina Miliukova, and the collapse of his 13-year association with the wealthy patroness Nadezhda von Meck. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor, though some scholars have downplayed its importance. His dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir Davydov and the feelings he expressed about Davydov in letters to others have been cited as evidence for romantic love between the two, especially after Davydov&#x27;s suicide. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause and whether the death was intentional.

While his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it sufficiently represented native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of that claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than exoticism, and said he transcended the stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music as deficient because it did not stringently follow Western principles.

==Early life and education==
Tchaikovsky was born on 7 May 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in Vyatka Governorate during the Russian Empire in present-day Udmurtia near the banks of the Kama River. His father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, served as a lieutenant colonel and engineer in the Department of Mines and managed the Ironworks in Kamsko-Votkinsk. His grandfather, Pyotr Fedorovich Tchaikovsky, was born in the village of Nikolaevka, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire in present-day Mykolaivka, Ukraine, and served first as a physician&#x27;s assistant in the army and later as city governor of Glazov in Vyatka. His great-grandfather, a Zaporozhian Cossack named Fyodor Chaika, served in the Russian military at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s mother, Alexandra Andreyevna (née d&#x27;Assier), was the second of Ilya&#x27;s three wives; his first wife died several years before Pyotr&#x27;s birth. She was 18 years younger than her husband and was of French and German ethnicity through her paternal side. Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts, including music. Of his six siblings, Tchaikovsky was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers Anatoly and Modest. Alexandra&#x27;s marriage to Lev Davydov produced seven children and lent Tchaikovsky the only real family life he knew as an adult, especially during his years of wandering. One of those children, Vladimir Davydov, who went by the nickname &quot;Bob&quot;, became very close to him.

In 1844, the family hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was initially thought too young to study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise. By age six, he was fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached to Dürbach; her affection for him reportedly counterbalanced his mother&#x27;s coldness and emotional distance, though others assert that the mother doted on her son. Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s work from this period, including his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes.

Tchaikovsky began piano lessons at age five. Within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s parents, initially supportive, hired a tutor, bought an orchestrion, a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects, and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons. But in 1850 they sent Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence, which mainly served the lesser nobility, and thought that this education would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant. Regardless of talent, the only musical careers available in Russia at that time—except for the affluent aristocracy—were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters. Both were considered on the lowest rank of the social ladder, with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s father&#x27;s income was also growing increasingly uncertain, so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time, he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence&#x27;s preparatory school, from his family. Once those two years had passed, Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of study.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s early separation from his mother, despite the aforementioned alleged distant relationship, caused emotional trauma that lasted the rest of his life and was intensified by her death from cholera in 1854, when he was 14. The loss of his mother also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition, a waltz in her memory. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s father, who had also contracted cholera but recovered, sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boy&#x27;s mind. Isolated, Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong; these included Aleksey Apukhtin and Vladimir Gerard.

Music, while not an official priority at school, also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers. They regularly attended the opera and Tchaikovsky improvised at the school&#x27;s harmonium on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice. &quot;We were amused&quot;, Gerard later remembered, &quot;but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory&quot;. Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies with Franz Becker, an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school, but the results, according to musicologist David Brown, were &quot;negligible&quot;.

In 1855, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s father funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy&#x27;s talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own bad experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.

==Career==
On 10 June 1859, the 19-year-old Tchaikovsky graduated as a titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. Appointed to the Ministry of Justice, he became a junior assistant within six months and a senior assistant two months after that. He remained a senior assistant for the rest of his three-year civil service career.

Meanwhile, the Russian Musical Society (RMS) was founded in 1859 by the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (a German-born aunt of Tsar Alexander II) and her protégé, pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein. Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent. The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander II&#x27;s wish to foster native talent. It hosted a regular season of public concerts (previously held only during the six weeks of Lent when the Imperial Theaters were closed) and provided basic professional training in music. In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in music theory taught by Nikolai Zaremba at the Mikhailovsky Palace (now the Russian Museum). These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, which opened in 1862. Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory as part of its premiere class. He studied harmony and counterpoint with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein. He was awarded a silver medal for his thesis, a cantata on Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.

The Conservatory benefited Tchaikovsky in two ways. It transformed him into a musical professional, with tools to help him thrive as a composer, and the in-depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western. This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style. He believed and attempted to show that both these aspects were &quot;intertwined and mutually dependent&quot;. His efforts became both an inspiration and a starting point for other Russian composers to build their own individual styles.

Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky&#x27;s musical talent on the whole and cited him as &quot;a composer of genius&quot; in his autobiography. He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s student work. Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s reputation grew. He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his First Symphony for performance by the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg. Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made. Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony. Tchaikovsky, distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student, withdrew the symphony. It was given its first complete performance, minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested, in Moscow in February 1868.

Once Tchaikovsky graduated in 1865, Rubinstein&#x27;s brother Nikolai offered him the post of Professor of Music Theory at the soon-to-open Moscow Conservatory. While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month, the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky&#x27;s morale and he accepted the post eagerly. He was further heartened by news of the first public performance of one of his works, his &quot;Characteristic Dances&quot;, conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 (Tchaikovsky later included this work, re-titled &quot;Dances of the Hay Maidens&quot;, in his opera &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;).

From 1867 to 1878, Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with music criticism while continuing to compose. This activity exposed him to a range of contemporary music and afforded him the opportunity to travel abroad. In his reviews, he praised Beethoven, considered Brahms overrated and, despite his admiration, took Schumann to task for poor orchestration. He appreciated the staging of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; at its inaugural performance in Bayreuth (Germany), but not the music, calling &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; &quot;unlikely nonsense, through which, from time to time, sparkle unusually beautiful and astonishing details&quot;. A recurring theme he addressed was the poor state of Russian opera.

===Relationship with The Five===
In 1856, while Tchaikovsky was still at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the Russian Musical Society, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a nationalist agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use non-Western harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent.

Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin became known as the &quot;moguchaya kuchka&quot;, translated into English as the &quot;Mighty Handful&quot; or &quot;The Five&quot;. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle.

While ambivalent about much of The Five&#x27;s music, Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms with most of its members. In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky&#x27;s first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, later nicknamed the &quot;Little Russian&quot;. Despite their support, Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as well as from the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.

===Opera composer===
The infrequency of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s musical successes, won with tremendous effort, exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism. Nikolai Rubinstein&#x27;s private fits of rage critiquing his music, such as attacking the First Piano Concerto, did not help matters. His popularity grew, however, as several first-rate artists became willing to perform his compositions. Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor. Other artists included Adele aus der Ohe, Max Erdmannsdörfer, Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev.

Another factor that helped Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight works, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the composition itself. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer&#x27;s popularity.

During the late 1860s, Tchaikovsky began to compose operas. His first, &quot;The Voyevoda&quot;, based on a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, premiered in 1869. The composer became dissatisfied with it, however, and, having re-used parts of it in later works, destroyed the manuscript. &quot;Undina&quot; followed in 1870. Only excerpts were performed and it, too, was destroyed. Between these projects, Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called &quot;Mandragora&quot;, to a libretto by Sergei Rachinskii; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects.

The first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact, &quot;The Oprichnik&quot;, premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky&#x27;s part-finished libretto. Tchaikovsky, too embarrassed to ask for another copy, decided to write the libretto himself, modeling his dramatic technique on that of Eugène Scribe. Cui wrote a &quot;characteristically savage press attack&quot; on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to Vladimir Stasov, disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, &quot;The Oprichnik&quot; continues to be performed from time to time in Russia.

The last of the early operas, &quot;Vakula the Smith&quot; (Op. 14), was composed in the second half of 1874. The libretto, based on Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, was to have been set to music by Alexander Serov. With Serov&#x27;s death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. After Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the opera &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, based on the same story.

Other works of this period include the &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; for cello and orchestra, the Third and Fourth Symphonies, the ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and the opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible.

During this time, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s call for &quot;universal unity&quot; with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoevsky&#x27;s speech, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music had been considered &quot;overly dependent on the West&quot;. As Dostoevsky&#x27;s message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music evaporated. The unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.

Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the &quot;1812 Overture&quot;, would be &quot;very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it&quot;. He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that &quot;I shan&#x27;t be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts&quot;. Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, &quot;the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best&quot;, particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores.

On 23 March 1881, Nikolai Rubinstein died in Paris. That December, Tchaikovsky started work on his Piano Trio in A minor, &quot;dedicated to the memory of a great artist&quot;. First performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory on the first anniversary of Rubinstein&#x27;s death, the piece became extremely popular during the composer&#x27;s lifetime; in November 1893, it would become Tchaikovsky&#x27;s own elegy at memorial concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

===Return to Russia===
In 1884, Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness. That March, Emperor Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of Saint Vladimir (fourth class), which included a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This was seen as a seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky&#x27;s social standing and might have been cemented in the composer&#x27;s mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg.

In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, at the instigation of Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in the actual title.

Despite Tchaikovsky&#x27;s disdain for public life, he now participated in it as part of his increasing celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season. In this post, he invited many international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet.

During this period, Tchaikovsky also began promoting Russian music as a conductor, In January 1887, he substituted, on short notice, at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow for performances of his opera &quot;Cherevichki&quot;. Within a year, he was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia. These appearances helped him overcome life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance. In 1888, Tchaikovsky led the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in Saint Petersburg, repeating the work a week later with the first performance of his tone poem &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Although critics proved hostile, with César Cui calling the symphony &quot;routine&quot; and &quot;meretricious&quot;, both works were received with extreme enthusiasm by audiences and Tchaikovsky, undeterred, continued to conduct the symphony in Russia and Europe. Conducting brought him to the United States in 1891, where he led the New York Music Society&#x27;s orchestra in his &quot;Festival Coronation March&quot; at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall.

===Belyayev circle and growing reputation===

In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived at Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts, devoted exclusively to the music of Russian composers. One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch.

Rimsky-Korsakov, with Alexander Glazunov, Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle, named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher. Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle, becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the &#x27;Five&#x27; and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs. This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death.

In 1892, Tchaikovsky was voted a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in France, only the second Russian subject to be so honored (the first was sculptor Mark Antokolsky). The following year, the University of Cambridge in England awarded Tchaikovsky an honorary Doctor of Music degree.

==Personal life==
Discussion of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s personal life, especially his sexuality, has perhaps been among the most extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time. It has also at times caused considerable confusion, from Soviet efforts to expunge all references to homosexuality and portray him as a heterosexual, to efforts at analysis by Western biographers.

Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was homosexual. He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods, &quot;associating openly and establishing professional connections with them.&quot; His first love was reportedly Sergey Kireyev, a younger fellow student at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence. According to Modest Tchaikovsky, this was Pyotr Ilyich&#x27;s &quot;strongest, longest and purest love&quot;. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir &quot;Bob&quot; Davydov (21 at the time) and his feelings expressed about Davydov in letters to others, especially following Davydov&#x27;s suicide, has been cited as evidence for romantic love between the two. The degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual desires has, however, remained open to debate. It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky, according to musicologist and biographer David Brown, &quot;felt tainted within himself, defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape&quot; or whether, according to Alexander Poznansky, he experienced &quot;no unbearable guilt&quot; over his sexual desires and &quot;eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality ... without experiencing any serious psychological damage&quot;.

Relevant portions of his brother Modest&#x27;s autobiography, where he tells of the composer&#x27;s same-sex attraction, have been published, as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it. Such censorship has persisted in the Russian government, resulting in many officials, including the former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, denying his homosexuality outright. Passages in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s letters which reveal his homosexual desires have been censored in Russia. In one such passage he said of a homosexual acquaintance: &quot;Petashenka used to drop by with the criminal intention of observing the Cadet Corps, which is right opposite our windows, but I&#x27;ve been trying to discourage these compromising visits—and with some success.&quot; In another one, he wrote: &quot;After our walk, I offered him some money, which was refused. He does it for the love of art and adores men with beards.&quot;

Tchaikovsky lived as a bachelor for most of his life. In 1868, he met Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt with whom he considered marriage, but, owing to various circumstances, the relationship ended. Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved. In 1877, at the age of 37, he wed a former student, Antonina Miliukova. The marriage was a disaster. Mismatched psychologically and sexually, the couple lived together for only two and a half months before Tchaikovsky left, overwrought emotionally and suffering from acute writer&#x27;s block. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage.

Tchaikovsky was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck, the widow of a railway magnate, who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage. As well as an important friend and emotional support, she became his patroness for the next 13 years, which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition. Although Tchaikovsky called her his &quot;best friend&quot;, they agreed never to meet under any circumstances.

==Death==
On 16/28 October 1893, Tchaikovsky conducted the premiere of his Sixth Symphony, the &quot;Pathétique&quot;, in Saint Petersburg. Nine days later, on 6 November, Tchaikovsky died there, aged 53. He was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, near the graves of fellow-composers Alexander Borodin, Mikhail Glinka, and Modest Mussorgsky; later, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Mily Balakirev were also buried nearby.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death is attributed to cholera, caused by drinking unboiled water at a local restaurant. In the 1980s in Britain, however, there was academic speculation that he killed himself, either with poison or by contracting cholera intentionally; in the &quot;New Grove Dictionary of Music&quot;, Roland John Wiley wrote: &quot;the polemics over Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death have reached an impasse ... . As for illness, problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory resolution: the state of diagnosis; the confusion of witnesses; disregard of long-term effects of smoking and alcohol. We do not know how Tchaikovsky died. We may never find out.&quot;

==Music==

===Antecedents and influences===

Of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Western predecessors, Robert Schumann stands out as an influence in formal structure, harmonic practices, and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. Boris Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky not just as a formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein argues the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky&#x27;s orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach&#x27;s works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them.

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s teacher Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s opera &quot;The Demon&quot; became a model for the final tableau of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. So did Léo Delibes&#x27; ballets &quot;Coppélia&quot; and &quot;Sylvia&quot; for &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot; (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet &quot;Giselle&quot; was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky&#x27;s attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Gioachino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, Vincenzo Bellini, Carl Maria von Weber and Henry Litolff.

===Creative range===
Tchaikovsky displayed a wide stylistic and emotional range, from light salon works to grand symphonies. Some of his works, such as the &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot;, employ a &quot;Classical&quot; form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as Mozart (his favorite composer). Other compositions, such as his &quot;Little Russian&quot; symphony and his opera &quot;Vakula the Smith&quot;, flirt with musical practices more akin to those of the &#x27;Five&#x27;, especially in their use of folk song. Other works, such as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s last three symphonies, employ a personal musical idiom that facilitated intense emotional expression.

===Compositional style===
====Melody====
American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;sweet, inexhaustible, supersensuous fund of melody&quot;, a feature that has ensured his music&#x27;s continued success with audiences. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions. Sometimes he used Western-style melodies, sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song; sometimes he used actual folk songs. According to &quot;The New Grove&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways.

The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage. Unlike Western themes, the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self-contained: they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development. On a technical level, it made modulating to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult, as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music.

The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic-age composers. They did not write in the regular, symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form, such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven; rather, the themes favored by Romantics were complete and independent in themselves. This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another. This challenge was why the Romantics &quot;were never natural symphonists&quot;. All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them, even when he modified them to generate tension, maintain interest, and satisfy listeners.

====Harmony====
Harmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky, according to Brown, since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self-enclosed tableaux, while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and, on a larger scale, shape it. Modulation, the shifting from one key to another, was a driving principle in both harmony and sonata form, the primary Western large-scale musical structure since the middle of the 18th century. Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time scale, provided a clear contrast between musical themes, and showed how those themes were related to each other.

One point in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s favor was &quot;a flair for harmony&quot; that &quot;astonished&quot; Rudolph Kündinger, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence. Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies, this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music, from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the whole-tone scale in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony, a practice more typically used by The Five.

====Rhythm====
Rhythmically, Tchaikovsky sometimes experimented with unusual meters. More often, he used a firm, regular meter, a practice that served him well in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements—a &quot;synthetic propulsion&quot;, as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music. (For more on this, please see Repetition below.)

====Structure====
Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form. Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice. The traditional argument that Tchaikovsky seemed unable to develop themes in this manner fails to consider this point; it also discounts the possibility that Tchaikovsky might have intended the development passages in his large-scale works to act as &quot;enforced hiatuses&quot; to build tension, rather than grow organically as smoothly progressive musical arguments.

According to Brown and musicologists Hans Keller and Daniel Zhitomirsky, Tchaikovsky found his solution to large-scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony. He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an &quot;outline&quot;, as Zhitomirsky phrases it. Within this outline, the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition. Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another, with what Keller calls &quot;new and violent contrasts&quot; between musical themes, keys, and harmonies. This process, according to Brown and Keller, builds momentum and adds intense drama. While the result, Warrack charges, is still &quot;an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them&quot; in the Germanic sense, Brown counters that it took the listener of the period &quot;through a succession of often highly charged sections which &quot;added up&quot; to a radically new kind of symphonic experience&quot; (italics Brown), one that functioned not on the basis of summation, as Austro-German symphonies did, but on one of accumulation.

Partly owing to the melodic and structural intricacies involved in this accumulation and partly due to the composer&#x27;s nature, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music became intensely expressive. This intensity was entirely new to Russian music and prompted some Russians to place Tchaikovsky&#x27;s name alongside that of Dostoevsky. German musicologist Hermann Kretzschmar credits Tchaikovsky in his later symphonies with offering &quot;full images of life, developed freely, sometimes even dramatically, around psychological contrasts ... This music has the mark of the truly lived and felt experience&quot;. Leon Botstein, in elaborating on this comment, suggests that listening to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music &quot;became a psychological mirror connected to everyday experience, one that reflected on the dynamic nature of the listener&#x27;s own emotional self&quot;. This active engagement with the music &quot;opened for the listener a vista of emotional and psychological tension and an extremity of feeling that possessed relevance because it seemed reminiscent of one&#x27;s own &#x27;truly lived and felt experience&#x27; or one&#x27;s search for intensity in a deeply personal sense&quot;.

====Repetition====

As mentioned above, repetition was a natural part of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music, just as it is an integral part of Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) could go on for extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements.

By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener&#x27;s interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building &quot;into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity&quot;, as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of that tension would take place. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. (For more on this practice, see the next section.)

====Orchestration====

Like other late Romantic composers, Tchaikovsky relied heavily on orchestration for musical effects. Tchaikovsky, however, became noted for the &quot;sensual opulence&quot; and &quot;voluptuous timbrel virtuosity&quot; of his orchestration. Like Glinka, Tchaikovsky tended toward bright primary colors and sharply delineated contrasts of texture. However, beginning with the Third Symphony, Tchaikovsky experimented with an increased range of timbres. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s scoring was noted and admired by some of his peers. Rimsky-Korsakov regularly referred his students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to it and called it &quot;devoid of all striving after effect, [to] give a healthy, beautiful sonority&quot;. This sonority, musicologist Richard Taruskin pointed out, is essentially Germanic in effect. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s expert use of having two or more instruments play a melody simultaneously (a practice called doubling) and his ear for uncanny combinations of instruments resulted in &quot;a generalized orchestral sonority in which the individual timbres of the instruments, being thoroughly mixed, would vanish&quot;.

====Pastiche (Passé-ism)====
In works like the &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot; and the &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot;, Tchaikovsky showed he was highly gifted at writing in a style of 18th-century European pastiche. Tchaikovsky graduated from imitation to full-scale evocation in the ballet &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and the opera &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. This practice, which Alexandre Benois calls &quot;passé-ism&quot;, lends an air of timelessness and immediacy, making the past seem as though it were the present. On a practical level, Tchaikovsky was drawn to past styles because he felt he might find the solution to certain structural problems within them. His Rococo pastiches also may have offered escape into a musical world purer than his own, into which he felt himself irresistibly drawn. (In this sense, Tchaikovsky operated in the opposite manner to Igor Stravinsky, who turned to Neoclassicism partly as a form of compositional self-discovery.) Tchaikovsky&#x27;s attraction to ballet might have allowed a similar refuge into a fairy-tale world, where he could freely write dance music within a tradition of French elegance.

===Aesthetic impact===
Maes maintains that, regardless of what he was writing, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s main concern was how his music affected his listeners on an aesthetic level, at specific moments in the piece, and on a cumulative level once the music had finished. What his listeners experienced on an emotional or visceral level became an end in itself. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s focus on pleasing his audience might be considered closer to that of Mendelssohn or Mozart. Considering that he lived and worked in what was probably the last 19th-century feudal nation, the statement is not actually that surprising.

And yet, even when writing so-called &#x27;programme&#x27; music, for example, his Romeo and Juliet fantasy overture, he cast it in sonata form. His use of stylized 18th-century melodies and patriotic themes was geared toward the values of Russian aristocracy. He was aided in this by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who commissioned &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; from Tchaikovsky and the libretto for &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; from Modest with their use of 18th-century settings stipulated firmly. Tchaikovsky also used the polonaise frequently, the dance being a musical code for the Romanov dynasty and a symbol of Russian patriotism. Using it in the finale of a work could assure its success with Russian listeners.

==Reception==
===Dedicatees and collaborators===

Tchaikovsky&#x27;s relationship with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue Leopold Auer rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught it to his students, who included Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein. Wilhelm Fitzenhagen &quot;intervened considerably in shaping what he considered &#x27;his&#x27; piece&quot;, the &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot;, according to music critic Michael Steinberg. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen&#x27;s license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist&#x27;s amendments.

His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in Marius Petipa, who worked with him on the last two, he might have found an advocate. When &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.

===Critics===

Critical reception to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music was varied but also improved over time. Even after 1880, some inside Russia held it suspect for not being nationalistic enough and thought Western European critics lauded it for exactly that reason. There might have been a grain of truth in the latter, according to musicologist and conductor Leon Botstein, as German critics especially wrote of the &quot;indeterminacy of [Tchaikovsky&#x27;s] artistic character ... being truly at home in the non-Russian&quot;. Of the foreign critics who did not care for his music, Eduard Hanslick lambasted the Violin Concerto as a musical composition &quot;whose stink one can hear&quot; and William Forster Abtrop wrote of the Fifth Symphony, &quot;The furious peroration sounds like nothing so much as a horde of demons struggling in a torrent of brandy, the music growing drunker and drunker. Pandemonium, delirium tremens, raving, and above all, noise worse confounded!&quot;

The division between Russian and Western critics remained through much of the 20th century but for a different reason. According to Brown and Wiley, the prevailing view of Western critics was that the same qualities in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music that appealed to audiences—its strong emotions, directness and eloquence and colorful orchestration—added up to compositional shallowness. The music&#x27;s use in popular and film music, Brown says, lowered its esteem in their eyes still further. There was also the fact, pointed out earlier, that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music demanded active engagement from the listener and, as Botstein phrases it, &quot;spoke to the listener&#x27;s imaginative interior life, regardless of nationality&quot;. Conservative critics, he adds, may have felt threatened by the &quot;violence and &#x27;hysteria they detected and felt such emotive displays &quot;attacked the boundaries of conventional aesthetic appreciation—the cultured reception of art as an act of formalist discernment—and the polite engagement of art as an act of amusement&quot;.

There has also been the fact that the composer did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed &quot;a professional reevaluation&quot; of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters has not gone away entirely, while his intention of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Allan Kozinn writes, &quot;It is Tchaikovsky&#x27;s flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out music—entertaining and widely beloved though it is—that seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded in the context of the whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow&quot;.

In the 21st century, however, critics are reacting more positively to Tchaikovsky&#x27;s tunefulness, originality, and craftsmanship. &quot;Tchaikovsky is being viewed again as a composer of the first rank, writing music of depth, innovation and influence,&quot; according to cultural historian and author Joseph Horowitz. Important in this reevaluation is a shift in attitude away from the disdain for overt emotionalism that marked half of the 20th century. &quot;We have acquired a different view of Romantic &#x27;excess, Horowitz says. &quot;Tchaikovsky is today more admired than deplored for his emotional frankness; if his music seems harried and insecure, so are we all&quot;.

===Public===
Horowitz maintains that, while the standing of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music has fluctuated among critics, for the public, &quot;it never went out of style, and his most popular works have yielded iconic sound-bytes , such as the love theme from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;&quot;. Along with those tunes, Botstein adds, &quot;Tchaikovsky appealed to audiences outside of Russia with an immediacy and directness that were startling even for music, an art form often associated with emotion&quot;. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s melodies, stated with eloquence and matched by his inventive use of harmony and orchestration, have always ensured audience appeal. His popularity is considered secure, with his following in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, second only to that of Beethoven. His music has also been used frequently in popular music and film.

==Legacy==
According to Wiley, Tchaikovsky was a pioneer in several ways. &quot;Thanks in large part to Nadezhda von Meck&quot;, Wiley writes, &quot;he became the first full-time professional Russian composer&quot;. This, Wiley adds, allowed him the time and freedom to consolidate the Western compositional practices he had learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory with Russian folk song and other native musical elements to fulfill his own expressive goals and forge an original, deeply personal style. He made an impact in not only complete works such as the symphony but also program music and, as Wiley phrases it, &quot;transformed Liszt&#x27;s and Berlioz&#x27;s achievements ... into matters of Shakespearean elevation and psychological import&quot;. Wiley and Holden both note that Tchaikovsky did all this without a native school of composition upon which to fall back. They point out that only Glinka had preceded him in combining Russian and Western practices and his teachers in Saint Petersburg had been thoroughly Germanic in their musical outlook. He was, they write, for all intents and purposes alone in his artistic quest.

Maes and Taruskin write that Tchaikovsky believed that his professionalism in combining skill and high standards in his musical works separated him from his contemporaries in The Five. Maes adds that, like them, he wanted to produce music that reflected Russian national character but which did so to the highest European standards of quality. Tchaikovsky, according to Maes, came along at a time when the nation itself was deeply divided as to what that character truly was. Like his country, Maes writes, it took him time to discover how to express his Russianness in a way that was true to himself and what he had learned. Because of his professionalism, Maes says, he worked hard at this goal and succeeded. The composer&#x27;s friend, music critic Herman Laroche, wrote of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; that the score contained &quot;an element deeper and more general than color, in the internal structure of the music, above all in the foundation of the element of melody. This basic element is undoubtedly Russian&quot;.

Tchaikovsky was inspired to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him to think it belonged to not just Russia but also the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia&#x27;s place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him to become the first Russian composer to acquaint foreign audiences personally with his own works, Warrack writes, as well as those of other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky&#x27;s birth, then places the composer&#x27;s achievements into historical perspective: &quot;Twenty years after Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; erupted onto the musical scene, signaling Russia&#x27;s arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music became the sole bridge&quot;.

==Voice recording==
A recording was made in Moscow in January 1890, by on behalf of Thomas Edison. A transcript of the recording follows (identification of the speakers is speculative):
According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not comfortable with being recorded for posterity and tried to shy away from it. On an apparently separate visit from the one related above, Block asked the composer to play something on a piano or at least say something. Tchaikovsky refused. He told Block, &quot;I am a bad pianist and my voice is raspy. Why should one eternalize it?&quot;

<text>Phospholipids are a class of lipids whose molecule has a hydrophilic &quot;head&quot; containing a phosphate group and two hydrophobic &quot;tails&quot; derived from fatty acids, joined by an alcohol residue (usually a glycerol molecule). Marine phospholipids typically have omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA integrated as part of the phospholipid molecule. The phosphate group can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline, ethanolamine or serine.

Phospholipids are a key component of all cell membranes. They can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic. In eukaryotes, cell membranes also contain another class of lipid, sterol, interspersed among the phospholipids. The combination provides fluidity in two dimensions combined with mechanical strength against rupture. Purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science.

The first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was lecithin, or phosphatidylcholine, in the egg yolk of chickens by the French chemist and pharmacist Theodore Nicolas Gobley.

== Phospholipids in biological membranes ==

===Arrangement===
The phospholipids are amphiphilic. The hydrophilic end usually contains a negatively charged phosphate group, and the hydrophobic end usually consists of two &quot;tails&quot; that are long fatty acid residues.

In aqueous solutions, phospholipids are driven by hydrophobic interactions, which result in the fatty acid tails aggregating to minimize interactions with the water molecules. The result is often a phospholipid bilayer: a membrane that consists of two layers of oppositely oriented phospholipid molecules, with their heads exposed to the liquid on both sides, and with the tails directed into the membrane. That is the dominant structural motif of the membranes of all cells and of some other biological structures, such as vesicles or virus coatings.
In biological membranes, the phospholipids often occur with other molecules (e.g., proteins, glycolipids, sterols) in a bilayer such as a cell membrane. Lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another, forming a membrane of hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water.

===Dynamics===
These specific properties allow phospholipids to play an important role in the cell membrane. Their movement can be described by the fluid mosaic model, which describes the membrane as a mosaic of lipid molecules that act as a solvent for all the substances and proteins within it, so proteins and lipid molecules are then free to diffuse laterally through the lipid matrix and migrate over the membrane. Sterols contribute to membrane fluidity by hindering the packing together of phospholipids. However, this model has now been superseded, as through the study of lipid polymorphism it is now known that the behaviour of lipids under physiological (and other) conditions is not simple.

==Main phospholipids==

===Diacylglyceride structures===
: &quot;See: Glycerophospholipid&quot;
* Phosphatidic acid (phosphatidate) (PA)
* Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephalin) (PE)
* Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) (PC)
* Phosphatidylserine (PS)
* Phosphoinositides:
** Phosphatidylinositol (PI)
** Phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP)
** Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and
** Phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3)

===Phosphosphingolipids===
: &quot;See Sphingolipid&quot;
* Ceramide phosphorylcholine (Sphingomyelin) (SPH)
* Ceramide phosphorylethanolamine (Sphingomyelin) (Cer-PE)
* Ceramide phosphoryllipid

== Applications ==
Phospholipids have been widely used to prepare liposomal, ethosomal and other nanoformulations of topical, oral and parenteral drugs for differing reasons like improved bio-availability, reduced toxicity and increased permeability across membranes. Liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed phospholipid chains with surfactant properties. The ethosomal formulation of ketoconazole using phospholipids is a promising option for transdermal delivery in fungal infections. Advances in phospholipid research lead to exploring these biomolecules and their conformations using lipidomics.

== Simulations ==
Computational simulations of phospholipids are often performed using molecular dynamics with force fields such as GROMOS, CHARMM, or AMBER.

== Characterization ==
Phospholipids are optically highly birefringent, i.e. their refractive index is different along their axis as opposed to perpendicular to it. Measurement of birefringence can be achieved using cross polarisers in a microscope to obtain an image of e.g. vesicle walls or using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry to quantify lipid order or disruption in supported bilayers.

=== Analysis ===
There are no simple methods available for analysis of phospholipids, since the close range of polarity between different phospholipid species makes detection difficult. Oil chemists often use spectroscopy to determine total phosphorus abundance and then calculate approximate mass of phospholipids based on molecular weight of expected fatty acid species. Modern lipid profiling employs more absolute methods of analysis, with NMR spectroscopy, particularly 31P-NMR, while HPLC-ELSD provides relative values.

== Phospholipid synthesis ==

Phospholipid synthesis occurs in the cytosolic side of ER membrane that is studded with proteins that act in synthesis (GPAT and LPAAT acyl transferases, phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase) and allocation (flippase and floppase). Eventually a vesicle will bud off from the ER containing phospholipids destined for the cytoplasmic cellular membrane on its exterior leaflet and phospholipids destined for the exoplasmic cellular membrane on its inner leaflet.

==Sources==
Common sources of industrially produced phospholipids are soya, rapeseed, sunflower, chicken eggs, bovine milk, fish eggs etc. Phospholipids for gene delivery, such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine and dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane, are produced synthetically. Each source has a unique profile of individual phospholipid species, as well as fatty acids, and consequently differing applications in food, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and drug delivery.

==In signal transduction==
Some types of phospholipid can be split to produce products that function as second messengers in signal transduction. Examples include phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), that can be split by the enzyme phospholipase C into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which both carry out the functions of the Gq type of G protein in response to various stimuli and intervene in various processes from long term depression in neurons to leukocyte signal pathways started by chemokine receptors.

Phospholipids also intervene in prostaglandin signal pathways as the raw material used by lipase enzymes to produce the prostaglandin precursors. In plants they serve as the raw material to produce jasmonic acid, a plant hormone similar in structure to prostaglandins that mediates defensive responses against pathogens.

==Food technology==
Phospholipids can act as emulsifiers, enabling oils to form a colloid with water. Phospholipids are one of the components of lecithin, which is found in egg yolks, as well as being extracted from soybeans, and is used as a food additive in many products and can be purchased as a dietary supplement. Lysolecithins are typically used for water–oil emulsions like margarine, due to their higher HLB ratio.

==Phospholipid derivatives==

<doc id="24507" wikidata="Q8619" url="?curid=24507" title="Pierre Trudeau">
<text>Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000) was a Canadian politician, statesman, and lawyer who served as the 15th prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. Between his non-consecutive terms as prime minister, he served as the leader of the Opposition from 1979 to 1980.

Trudeau was born and raised in Outremont, Quebec, and studied politics and law. In the 1950s, he rose to prominence as a labour activist in Quebec politics by opposing the conservative Union Nationale government. Trudeau was then an associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal. He was originally part of the social democratic New Democratic Party, though felt they could not achieve power, and instead joined the Liberal Party in 1965. That year, he was elected to the House of Commons, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s parliamentary secretary. In 1967, he was appointed as minister of justice and attorney general. As minister, Trudeau liberalized divorce and abortion laws and decriminalized homosexuality. Trudeau&#x27;s outgoing personality and charismatic nature caused a media sensation, inspiring &quot;Trudeaumania&quot;, and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he succeeded Pearson and became prime minister of Canada.

From the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Trudeau&#x27;s personality dominated the Canadian political scene to an extent never seen before. After his appointment as prime minister, he won the 1968, 1972, and 1974 elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980, and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election. Trudeau is the most recent prime minister to win four elections (having won three majority governments and one minority government) and to serve two non-consecutive terms. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada&#x27;s third-longest-serving prime minister, behind John A. Macdonald and William Lyon Mackenzie King.

In domestic policy, Trudeau suppressed the 1970 Quebec terrorist crisis by controversially invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, and Quebec&#x27;s proposal to negotiate a sovereignty-association agreement with the federal government was overwhelmingly rejected in the 1980 Quebec referendum. His government also expanded social programs, introduced the capital gains tax, and oversaw major increases in deficit spending. In a bid to move the Liberal Party towards economic nationalism, Trudeau oversaw the creation of Petro-Canada and launched the National Energy Program, both of which generated uproar in oil-rich Western Canada, leading to a rise in what many called &quot;Western alienation&quot;. He also pioneered official bilingualism and multiculturalism, fostering a pan-Canadian identity. Trudeau&#x27;s foreign policy included making Canada more independent; he patriated the Constitution and established the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, actions that achieved full Canadian sovereignty. He distanced Canada from the United States and rather formed close ties with the Soviet Union, China, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, putting him at odds with other capitalist Western nations.

Despite his personal motto, &quot;Reason before passion&quot;, Trudeau&#x27;s personality and policy decisions aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. While critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies, admirers praised what they considered to be the force of his intellect and his political acumen that maintained national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement. In his retirement, Trudeau practiced law at the Montreal law firm of Heenan Blaikie. He also successfully campaigned against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords (which proposed granting Quebec certain concessions), arguing they would strengthen Quebec nationalism. Trudeau died in 2000. He is ranked highly among scholars in rankings of Canadian prime ministers, though he remains a divisive figure in Canadian politics and is viewed less favourably in Western Canada and Quebec. His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current prime minister, following the 2015 Canadian federal election; Justin Trudeau is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.

== Early life ==
The Trudeau family can be traced to Marcillac-Lanville in France in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544–1589). In 1659, the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was Étienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641–1712), a carpenter and home builder from La Rochelle.

Pierre Trudeau was born at home in Outremont, Montreal, Quebec, on October 18, 1919, to Charles-Émile &quot;Charley&quot; Trudeau (1887–1935), a French-Canadian businessman and lawyer, and Grace Elliott, who was of mixed Scottish and French-Canadian descent. He had an older sister named Suzette and a younger brother named Charles Jr. Trudeau remained close to both siblings for his entire life. Trudeau attended the prestigious Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf (a private French Jesuit school), where he supported Quebec nationalism. Trudeau&#x27;s paternal grandparents were French-speaking Quebec farmers. His father had acquired the B&amp;A gas station chain (now defunct), some &quot;profitable mines, the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Montreal Royals, the city&#x27;s minor-league baseball team&quot;, by the time Trudeau was fifteen. When his father died in Orlando, Florida, on April 10, 1935, Trudeau and each of his siblings inherited $5,000 (), a considerable sum at that time, which meant that he was financially secure and independent. His mother, Grace, &quot;doted on Pierre&quot; and he remained close to her throughout her long life. After her husband died, she left the management of her inheritance to others and spent a lot of her time working for the Roman Catholic Church and various charities, travelling frequently to New York, Florida, Europe, and Maine, sometimes with her children. Already in his late teens, Trudeau was &quot;directly involved in managing a large inheritance&quot;.

== Early education ==
From the age of six until twelve, Trudeau attended the primary school, Académie Querbes, in Outremont, where he became immersed in the Catholic religion. The school, which was for both English and French Catholics, was an exclusive school with very small classes and he excelled in mathematics and religion. From his earliest years, Trudeau was fluently bilingual, which would later prove to be a &quot;big asset for a politician in bilingual Canada.&quot; As a teenager, he attended the Jesuit French-language Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a prestigious secondary school known for educating elite francophone families in Quebec.

In his seventh and final academic year, 1939–1940, Trudeau focused on winning a Rhodes Scholarship. In his application he wrote that he had prepared for public office by studying public speaking and publishing many articles in &quot;Brébeuf&quot;. His letters of recommendations praised him highly. Father Boulin, who was the head of the college, said that during Trudeau&#x27;s seven years at the college (1933–1940), he had won a &quot;hundred prizes and honourable mentions&quot; and &quot;performed with distinction in all fields&quot;. Trudeau graduated from Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in 1940 at the age of twenty-one.

Trudeau did not win the Rhodes Scholarship. He consulted several people on his options, including Henri Bourassa, the economist Edmond Montpetit, and Father Robert Bernier, a Franco-Manitoban. Following their advice, he chose a career in politics and a degree in law at the Université de Montréal.

== Second World War ==
In his obituary, &quot;The Economist&quot; described Trudeau as &quot;parochial as a young man&quot;, who &quot;dismissed the second world war as a squabble between the big powers, although he later regretted &#x27;missing one of the major events of the century&#x27;.&quot; In his 1993 &quot;Memoir,&quot; Trudeau wrote that the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 and his father&#x27;s death were the two &quot;great bombshells&quot; that marked his teenage years. In his first year at university, the prime topics of conversation were the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and the London blitz. He wrote that in the early 1940s, when he was in his early twenties, he thought, &quot;So there was a war? Tough. It wouldn&#x27;t stop me from concentrating on my studies so long as that was possible...[I]f you were a French Canadian in Montreal [at that time], you did not automatically believe that this was a just war. In Montreal in the early 1940s, we still knew nothing about the Holocaust and we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers.&quot;

Young Trudeau opposed conscription for overseas service, and in 1942 he campaigned for the anti-conscription candidate Jean Drapeau (later the mayor of Montreal) in Outremont. Trudeau described a speech he heard in Montreal by Ernest Lapointe, minister of justice and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant. Lapointe had been a Liberal MP during the 1917 Conscription Crisis, in which the Canadian government had deployed up to 1,200 soldiers to suppress the anti-conscription Easter Riots in Quebec City in March and April 1918. In a final and bloody conflict, armed rioters fired on the troops, and the soldiers returned fire. At least five men were killed by gunfire and there were over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage. In 1939, it was Lapointe who helped draft the Liberals&#x27; policy against conscription for service overseas. Lapointe was aware that a new conscription crisis would destroy the national unity that Mackenzie King had been trying to build since the end of the First World War. Trudeau believed Lapointe had lied and broken his promise. His criticisms of King&#x27;s wartime policies, such as &quot;suspension of habeas corpus&quot;, the &quot;farce of bilingualism and French-Canadian advancement in the army,&quot; and the &quot;forced &#x27;voluntary&#x27; enrolment&quot;, were scathing.

As a university student, Trudeau joined the Canadian Officers&#x27; Training Corps (COTC), which trained at the local armoury in Montreal during the school term and undertook further training at Camp Farnham each summer. Although the &quot;National Resources Mobilization Act&quot;, enacted in 1940, originally provided that conscripts could not be required to serve outside of Canada, in 1942 Parliament amended the act and removed that restriction. The Conscription Crisis of 1944 arose in response to the invasion of Normandy in June 1944.

== Education ==
Trudeau continued his full-time studies in law at the Université de Montréal while in the COTC from 1940 until his graduation in 1943. Following his graduation, he articled for a year and, in the fall of 1944, began his Masters in political economy at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government). In his &quot;Memoir&quot;, he admitted that it was at Harvard&#x27;s &quot;super-informed environment&quot; that he realized the &quot;historic importance&quot; of the war and that he had &quot;missed one of the major events of the century in which [he] was living. Harvard had become a major intellectual centre, as fascism in Europe led to a great migration of intellectuals to the United States.

Trudeau&#x27;s Harvard dissertation was on the topic of communism and Christianity. At Harvard, an American and predominantly Protestant university, Trudeau, a French Canadian Catholic living outside the province of Quebec for the first time, felt like an outsider. As his sense of isolation deepened, he decided in 1947 to continue his work on his Harvard dissertation in Paris, where he studied at the Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). The Harvard dissertation remained unfinished when Trudeau briefly entered a doctoral program to study under the socialist economist Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE). This cemented Trudeau&#x27;s belief that Keynesian economics and social sciences were essential to the creation of the &quot;good life&quot; in a democratic society. Over a five-week period he attended many lectures and became a follower of personalism after being influenced most notably by Emmanuel Mounier. He also was influenced by Nikolai Berdyaev, particularly his book &quot;Slavery and Freedom&quot;. Max and Monique Nemni argue that Berdyaev&#x27;s book influenced Trudeau&#x27;s rejection of nationalism and separatism.

In the summer of 1948, Trudeau embarked on world travels to find a sense of purpose. At the age of twenty-eight, he travelled to Poland where he visited Auschwitz, then Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the Middle East, including Turkey, Jordan and southern Iraq. Although he was wealthy, Trudeau travelled with a back pack in &quot;self-imposed hardship&quot;. He used his British passport instead of his Canadian passport in his travels through Pakistan, India, China, and Japan, often wearing local clothing to blend in. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, when Trudeau returned to Canada in 1949 after an absence of five months, his mind was &quot;seemingly broadened&quot; from his studies at Harvard, Sciences Po, and the LSE, as well as his travels. He was &quot;appalled at the narrow nationalism in his native French-speaking Quebec, and the authoritarianism of the province&#x27;s government&quot;.

== Quiet Revolution ==

Beginning while Trudeau was travelling overseas, several events took place in Quebec that were precursors to the Quiet Revolution. These included the 1948 release of the anti-establishment manifesto Refus global, the publication of &quot;Les insolences du Frère Untel&quot;, the 1949 Asbestos Strike, and the 1955 Richard Riot. Artists and intellectuals in Quebec signed the &quot;Refus global&quot; on August 9, 1948 in opposition to the repressive rule of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis and the decadent &quot;social establishment&quot; in Quebec, including the Catholic Church. When he returned to Montreal in 1949, Trudeau quickly became a leading figure opposing Duplessis&#x27;s rule. Trudeau actively supported the workers in the Asbestos Strike who opposed Duplessis in 1949. Trudeau was the co-founder and editor of &quot;Cité Libre&quot;, a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the Quiet Revolution. In 1956, he edited an important book on the subject, &quot;La grève de l&#x27;amiante&quot;, which argued that the asbestos miners&#x27; strike of 1949 was a seminal event in Quebec&#x27;s history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, Francophone clerical establishment and Anglophone business class that had long ruled the province.

== Career ==
Because of Trudeau&#x27;s labour union activities in Asbestos, Duplessis blacklisted him, and he was unable to teach law at the Université de Montréal. He surprised his closest friends in Quebec when he became a civil servant in Ottawa in 1949. Until 1951 he worked in the Privy Council Office of the Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent as an economic policy advisor. He wrote in his memoirs that he found this period very useful when he entered politics later on, and that senior civil servant Norman Robertson tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay on.

Trudeau&#x27;s progressive values and his close ties with Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) intellectuals (including F. R. Scott, Eugene Forsey, Michael Kelway Oliver and Charles Taylor) led to his support of and membership in that federal democratic socialist party throughout the 1950s.

An associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal from 1961 to 1965, Trudeau&#x27;s views evolved towards a liberal position in favour of individual rights counter to the state and made him an opponent of Quebec nationalism. He admired the labour unions, which were tied to the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal Party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first. In economic theory he was influenced by professors Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith while he was at Harvard. In 1963, Trudeau criticized the Liberal Party of Lester Pearson when it supported arming Bomarc missiles in Canada with nuclear warheads.

During his time as a professor at the Université de Montréal, he had a small appearance in Denis Héroux&#x27;s 1964 student film &quot;Over My Head (Jusqu&#x27;au cou)&quot;, as himself in a political debate.

Trudeau was offered a position at Queen&#x27;s University teaching political science by James Corry, who later became principal of Queen&#x27;s, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Quebec.

== Early political career (1965–1967) ==

In 1965, Trudeau joined the Liberal Party, along with his friends Gérard Pelletier and Jean Marchand. Dubbed the &quot;three wise men&quot; by the media, they ran successfully for the Liberals in the 1965 election. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of Mount Royal in Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities. His decision to join the Liberals rather than the CCF&#x27;s successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP), was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power. He also doubted the feasibility of the NDP&#x27;s centralizing policies, and felt that the party leadership tended toward a &quot;deux nations&quot; approach he could not support.

Upon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the United Nations. In 1967, he was appointed to Pearson&#x27;s Cabinet as Minister of Justice and Attorney General.

== Minister of Justice and Attorney General (1967–1968) ==

As Justice Minister and Attorney General, Trudeau was responsible for introducing the landmark &quot;Criminal Law Amendment Act&quot;, an omnibus bill whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, new gun ownership restrictions and the legalization of contraception, abortion and lotteries, as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers. Trudeau famously defended the segment of the bill decriminalizing homosexual acts by telling reporters that &quot;there&#x27;s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation&quot;, adding that &quot;what&#x27;s done in private between adults doesn&#x27;t concern the Criminal Code&quot;. Trudeau paraphrased the term from Martin O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s editorial piece in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on December 12, 1967. Trudeau also liberalized divorce laws, and clashed with Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. during constitutional negotiations.

=== Liberal leadership convention (1968) ===
At the end of Canada&#x27;s centennial year in 1967, Pearson announced his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered the race to succeed him as party leader and Prime Minister. His energetic campaign attracted widespread media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. However, many Liberals still had reservations, given that he had only joined the party in 1965. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister Judy LaMarsh was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau was not a Liberal.

Nevertheless, at the April 1968 Liberal leadership convention, Trudeau was elected leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51 percent of the delegates. He defeated several prominent and long-serving Liberals, including Paul Martin Sr., Robert Winters and Paul Hellyer.

== First premiership (1968–1979) ==

=== Swearing-in and subsequent election ===
As the new leader of the governing Liberals, Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister on April 20. Though the term of the Parliament was not due to expire until November 1970, Pearson&#x27;s government had almost fallen before the leadership contest could even take place after a tax bill was voted down in Parliament, leading to much confusion over whether this counted as a matter of confidence in the government. Governor General Roland Michener ultimately ruled that it did not, and the government subsequently won an actual confidence motion, but the incident made it clear that the minority government Trudeau had inherited would not realistically last the full parliamentary term, and that he would soon need to call an early election in order to win a parliamentary majority. Trudeau eventually called this election for June 25, 1968.

Trudeau&#x27;s campaign benefited from an unprecedented wave of personal popularity called &quot;Trudeaumania&quot;, which saw him mobbed by throngs of youths. His main national opponents were PC leader Robert Stanfield and NDP leader Tommy Douglas, both popular figures who had respectively been premiers of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan (albeit in Trudeau&#x27;s native Quebec, the main competition to the Liberals was from the Ralliement créditiste, led by Réal Caouette). As a candidate, Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a &quot;Just Society&quot;. He vigorously defended the newly implemented universal health care and regional development programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.

On the eve of the election, during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, rioting Quebec sovereigntists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting &quot;Trudeau au poteau!&quot; (&quot;Trudeau to the stake!&quot;). Rejecting the pleas of aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the defiant Prime Minister impressed the public. The next day, Trudeau handily won the 1968 election with a strong majority government; this was the Liberals&#x27; first majority since 1953.

=== Social policy ===
==== Bilingualism and multiculturalism ====
Trudeau&#x27;s first major legislative push was implementing the majority of recommendations from Pearson&#x27;s Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism via the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot;, which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the federal government. More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was the implementation of the Act&#x27;s principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada who felt they were being disadvantaged.

Trudeau&#x27;s Cabinet fulfilled Part IV of the Royal Commission&#x27;s report by announcing a &quot;Multiculturalism Policy&quot; on October 8, 1971. It was the first of its kind in the world, subsequently being emulated by several provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba; even other countries, most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern, emulated the policy. Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that Pearson had brought in. The policy recognized that while Canada was a country of two official languages, it recognized a plurality of cultures – &quot;a multicultural policy within a bilingual framework&quot;. This annoyed public opinion in Quebec, which believed that it challenged Quebec&#x27;s claim of Canada being a country of two nations.

==== Immigration ====
Following the Vietnam War, a refugee crisis was caused by the flight of the &quot;boat people&quot; from Vietnam, as thousands of people, mostly ethnic Chinese, fled the country in makeshift boats across the South China Sea, usually to the British colony of Hong Kong. The Trudeau government was generous in granting asylum to the refugees. By 1980, Canada had accepted about 44,000 of the &quot;boat people&quot;, making it one of the top destinations for them.

==== Indigenous issues ====

In 1969, Trudeau, along with his then-Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chrétien, proposed the 1969 White Paper (officially entitled &quot;Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy&quot;). The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper was widely seen as racist and an attack on Canada&#x27;s indigenous peoples, and prompted the first major national mobilization of indigenous activists against the federal government&#x27;s proposal, leading Trudeau to set aside the legislation.

==== Death penalty ====
On July 14, 1976, after a long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the death penalty completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.

=== Quebec ===
==== October Crisis ====
Trudeau&#x27;s first serious test as Prime Minister came during the October Crisis of 1970, when a Marxist-influenced Quebec separatist group, the &quot;Front de libération du Québec&quot; (FLQ), kidnapped British Trade Consul James Cross at his residence on October 5. Five days later, the group also kidnapped Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis; when questioned by CBC Television journalist Tim Ralfe regarding how far he would go to stop the violence, Trudeau answered, &quot;Just watch me&quot;. Laporte was found dead on October 17 in the trunk of a car. Five of the FLQ members were flown to Cuba in 1970 as part of a deal in exchange for James Cross&#x27; life, although they eventually returned to Canada years later, where they served time in prison.

Although this response is still controversial and was opposed at the time as excessive by parliamentarians like Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, it was met with only limited objections from the public.

==== Quebec provincial affairs ====
After consultations with the provincial premiers, Trudeau agreed to attend a conference called by British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett to attempt to finally patriate the Canadian constitution. Negotiations between the provinces and Justice Minister John Turner created a draft agreement, known as the Victoria Charter, that entrenched a charter of rights, bilingualism, and a guarantee of a veto of constitutional amendments for Ontario and Quebec, as well as regional vetoes for Western Canada and Atlantic Canada, within the new constitution. The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, but Quebec&#x27;s premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet. After a strong backlash of popular opinion against the agreement in Quebec, Bourassa stated Quebec would not accept it.

Trudeau faced increasing challenges in Quebec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his Quebec Liberal government. Following a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Quebec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the federal government on the constitution, French language laws, and the language of air traffic control in Quebec. Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against Ottawa&#x27;s bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.

Partially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a surprise election in 1976 that resulted in René Lévesque and the sovereigntist Parti Québécois (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a &quot;good government&quot; platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and Lévesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau&#x27;s intellectualism contrasting with Lévesque&#x27;s more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the &quot;clarity&quot; provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the Quebec sovereignty movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.

As the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged breakdown of his marriage, which the English-language press covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis. Trudeau&#x27;s reserve was seen as dignified by contemporaries, and his poll numbers actually rose during the height of coverage, but aides felt the personal tensions left him uncharacteristically emotional and prone to outbursts.

===Economic policy===
Trudeau&#x27;s first government implemented many procedural reforms to make Parliament and the Liberal caucus meetings run more efficiently, significantly expanded the size and role of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, and substantially expanded social-welfare programs.

====Deficit spending====
Trudeau&#x27;s government ran large budget deficits throughout its time in office. The government&#x27;s first budget in 1968 produced a deficit of $667 million, while the 1969 budget produced a surplus of $140 million. However, the 1970 budget (which produced a deficit of over $1 billion) marked the start of consecutive budget deficits run by the Trudeau government; the budget would not be balanced until 1997. By the time Trudeau&#x27;s first tenure ended in 1979, the deficit grew to $12 billion.

====Social programs and spending====
In 1971, Trudeau&#x27;s government greatly expanded unemployment insurance, making coverage nearly universal as coverage for the Canadian labour force jumped to 96 percent from 75 percent. The system was sometimes called the 8/42, because one had to work for eight weeks (with at least 20 hours per week), and wait two weeks, to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. This expansion also opened the UI program up to maternity, sickness, and retirement benefits, covered seasonal workers for the first time, and allowed mothers to receive up to 15 weeks of benefits if they had 20 or more insurable weeks. The reforms increased the maximum benefit period to 50 weeks, though the benefit duration was calculated using a complex formula depending on labour force participation and the regional and national unemployment rates. In 1977, the government simplified the benefit duration formula but introduced a variable entrance requirement dependent on the unemployment rate in the applicant&#x27;s region; the changes also mandated that workers in areas with low unemployment regions work twice as long to be eligible for benefits as workers in high unemployment regions.

In 1973, Trudeau&#x27;s government amended the &quot;National Housing Act&quot; to provide financial assistance for new home buying, loans for co-operative housing, and low interest loans for municipal and private non-profit housing. The amendments saw the introduction the Rental Rehabilitation Assistance Program, which established that homeowners and occupants in low income neighborhoods could qualify for small grants to be used for home repair. Also introduced was the Assisted Home Ownership Program which allowed the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to start providing grants and subsidized interest rates to low income families (though in 1978 an amendment discontinued the provision of grant money to these families, which led to a high incidence of defaults, and in turn, necessitated that the federal government provide financial assistance to the CMHC). The amendments saw the passage of the &quot;Rent Supplement Act&quot;, which enabled the CMHC to partner with private landlords, cooperatives, and not-for-profit associations to provide affordable housing; in addition, the act saw the CMHC agree to fund the difference between market rental prices and rent prices geared to the specific occupant&#x27;s income. Lastly, the Canada Rental Supply Program was introduced to provide interest-free loans for 15 years to developers who agreed to allocate a proportion of units toward social housing initiatives. In order to ensure that loans contributed to the provision of low income housing, the CMHC was restricted to giving loans amounting to $7500 or less per unit.

The Registered home ownership savings plan (RHOSP) was introduced in the government&#x27;s November 1974 budget. Similar to RRSPs, proceeds from the RHOSP could be received tax-free for either a down payment for the acquisition of an owner-occupied dwelling or to buy furnitures for the dwelling (or the spouse&#x27;s dwelling). Individuals who already owned a home (either owner-occupied or rented to another person) could not deduct RHOSP contributions. In 1976, Trudeau&#x27;s government allowed for transfers of funds between the RHOSP (for instance to select a plan with better returns). In 1977, the government tightened the rules of the RHOSP (the reforms removed the purchase of furnitures from the list of usage allowed for tax-free use of RHOSP proceeds starting in 1978; disallowed deductible contributions for a taxpayer whose spouse owned a home; suspended tax-free rollover of RHSOP funds to an RRSP; and capped the lifetime of the RHOSP at 20 years).

In 1977, Trudeau&#x27;s government established the financial program Established Programs Financing to help finance the provincially-run healthcare and post-secondary education system, through transfer payments, by cash and tax points. This system lasted until 1995.

In 1979, Trudeau&#x27;s government restructured family allowances by increasing the role of the tax system in child support and decreasing the role of family allowances. The government established an annual Refundable Child Tax Credit of $200 for families with incomes of $18,000 or less. As incomes increased above this level, benefits would be taxed away to disappear completely at $26,000. Since the median income for families during this time was $19,500, the majority of families received some benefit from the new program.

====Taxation====
In 1969, Trudeau&#x27;s first finance minister, Edgar Benson, introduced a white paper on tax reform which included tax deductions for child care and advocated shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy. Measures to fulfill the latter proposal included a capital gains tax, which was severely criticized by corporate Canada and the business community (notably Israel Asper). The bill was debated in Parliament for over a year, with its more radical proposals being removed in parliamentary committee. The reforms managed to be passed through the use of closure, with the capital gains tax (that had an inclusion rate of 50 percent) coming into effect on January 1, 1972, as prescribed by the 1971 budget. Also implemented in 1972 was the child care expense deduction which allowed for a deduction of up to $500 per child. As Benson had now become a political liability, Trudeau replaced him with John Turner (who was seen as a &quot;Business Liberal&quot;) in 1972.

In 1973, Trudeau&#x27;s government fully indexed the person income tax system (both the exemptions and the brackets) to match inflation. The indexation was made effective in 1974; during that year, inflation had jumped from six percent to double digits. The government also implemented three personal income tax cuts from 1973 to 1975.

====Inflation====
While popular with the electorate, Trudeau&#x27;s promised minor reforms had little effect on the growing rate of inflation, and he struggled with conflicting advice on the crisis. In September 1975, finance minister John Turner resigned over refusing to implement wage and price controls. In December 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the &quot;Anti-Inflation Act&quot;, despite campaigning against them in the 1974 election. Amongst its many controls, it limited pay increases for federal government employees and employees in companies with over 500 workers to 10 percent in 1976, 8 percent in 1977, and 6 percent in 1978. The Act also established the anti-inflation board which oversaw the implementation of wage and price controls and had the ability to recommend decreases in prices of goods, wage cuts, and rebates to customers of various services. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the &quot;British North America Act&quot;. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders. The controls lasted until 1978 and the anti-inflation board was dissolved in 1979.

====Energy policy====
On September 4, 1973, Trudeau requested that the Western Canadian provinces agree to a voluntary freeze on oil prices during the ongoing Arab oil embargo. Nine days later, the Trudeau government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of Canadian oil exported to the United States to combat rising inflation and oil prices. The tax was equivalent to the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize oil imports for Eastern refiners. The Premier of oil-rich Alberta, Peter Lougheed, called the decision &quot;the most discriminatory action taken by a federal government against a particular province in the entire history of Confederation.&quot; While revenues decreased for Western provinces (particularly Alberta) and for the petroleum industry, Trudeau&#x27;s government subsidized Eastern consumers, angering Alberta, who successfully fought for control of its natural resources in 1930.

In the early 1970s, the petroleum industry was largely under foreign (mainly American) control, the recent discovery of oil in Alaska put corporate pressure on the Canadian Arctic, and Canada&#x27;s energy sector increasingly focused on North American rather than domestic needs. Trudeau&#x27;s government initially rejected the idea of creating a nationalized oil company (which was perceived to secure supplies, improve revenue collection, and give governments better information on the global energy market), arguing it would be costly and inefficient. However, after the late 1973 oil crisis saw global oil prices quadruple, questions arose about whether Canada should continue importing oil. Though Canada also exported oil at times, the provinces of Quebec and Atlantic Canada were at risk of a cut-off of imports; as a result, Canada was in need of knowing more about its potential to produce energy. In late October 1973, Trudeau&#x27;s government adopted a motion from the New Democratic Party (which the Trudeau minority government relied on for support) to establish a nationalized oil company. The &quot;Petro-Canada Act&quot; was passed in 1975 (under a Trudeau majority government), resulting in the creation of a new crown corporation, Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada was mandated to acquire imported oil supplies, take part in energy research and development, and engage in downstream activities such as refining and marketing. The corporation started with an initial $1.5 billion in capital and had preferential access to debt capital as &quot;an agent of Her Majesty&quot;. Trudeau&#x27;s government gave itself authority over Petro-Canada&#x27;s capital budget and its corporate strategy, making the company its policy arm; the government also wanted the company to be mainly active on the frontiers (the oil sands, the Arctic, and the East Coast offshore areas) rather than Western Canada, where most Canadian oil is extracted. In 1976, Trudeau appointed his friend, Maurice Strong, to become the first chair of the company.

=== Foreign affairs ===
In foreign affairs, Trudeau kept Canada in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but often pursued an independent path in international relations.

Trudeau was the first world leader to meet John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono on their 1969 &quot;tour for world peace&quot;. Lennon said, after talking with Trudeau for 50 minutes, that Trudeau was &quot;a beautiful person&quot; and that &quot;if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace&quot;. The diplomat John G. H. Halstead who worked as a close adviser to Trudeau for a time described him as a man who never read any of the policy papers submitted by the External Affairs department, instead preferring short briefings on the issues before meeting other leaders and that Trudeau usually tried to &quot;wing&quot; his way through international meetings by being witty. Halstead stated that Trudeau viewed foreign policy as &quot;only for dabbing&quot;, saying he much preferred domestic affairs.

==== NATO ====
In August 1968, the Trudeau government expressed disapproval of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, having the Canadian delegation at the United Nations vote for a resolution condemning the invasion, which failed to pass owing to a Soviet veto. However, Trudeau made it clear that he did not want an intensified Cold War as a result of the invasion, and worked to avoid a rupture with Moscow. In a speech in December 1968, Trudeau asked: &quot;Can we assume Russia wants war because it invaded Czechoslovakia?&quot;.

In 1968–1969, Trudeau wanted to pull Canada out of NATO, arguing that the MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) caused by a Soviet-American nuclear exchange made it highly unlikely that the Soviet Union would ever invade West Germany, thereby making NATO into an expensive irrelevance in his view. In March 1969, Trudeau visited Washington to meet President Richard Nixon. Though the meeting was very civil, Nixon came to intensely dislike Trudeau over time, referring to the Prime Minister in 1971 as &quot;that asshole Trudeau&quot;. Nixon made it clear to Trudeau that a Canada that remained in NATO would be taken more seriously in Washington than a Canada that left NATO. Trudeau himself noted during a speech given before the National Press Club during the same visit that the United States was by far Canada&#x27;s largest trading partner, saying: &quot;Living next to you is in some way like sleeping with an elephant; no matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt&quot;.

The NATO question badly divided the Cabinet. The diplomat Marcel Cadieux accused Trudeau of being &quot;ne semble pas croire du tout au danger soviétique&quot;. As a diplomat, the devout Catholic Cadieux had served on the International Control Commission in 1954–55, where his experiences of witnessing the exodus of two million Vietnamese Catholics from North Vietnam to South Vietnam made him into a very firm anti-Communist. In late March 1969, Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet was torn by debate as ministers divided into pro-NATO and anti-NATO camps, and Trudeau&#x27;s own feelings were with the latter. Defence Minister Léo Cadieux threatened to resign in protest if Canada left NATO, leading Trudeau, who wanted to keep a French-Canadian in a high-profile portfolio such as the Department of National Defence, to meet Cadieux on April 2 to discuss a possible compromise. Trudeau and Cadieux agreed that Canada would stay in NATO, but drastically cut back its contributions, despite warnings from Ross Campbell, the Canadian member of the NATO Council, that the scale of the cuts envisioned would break Canada&#x27;s treaty commitments. Ultimately, the fact the United States would be more favourably disposed to a Canada in NATO and the need to maintain Cabinet unity led Trudeau to decide, despite his own inclinations, to stay in NATO. After much discussion within the cabinet, Trudeau finally declared that Canada would stay within NATO after all on April 3, but he would cut back Canada&#x27;s forces within Europe by 50%. The way that Canada cut its NATO contributions by 50% caused tensions with other NATO allies, with the British government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson publicly protesting the cuts.

==== United States ====
Relations with the United States deteriorated on many points during the Nixon presidency (1969–74), including trade disputes, defence agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. On January 4, 1973, Trudeau voted for a resolution in the House of Commons that condemned the American Christmas bombings against North Vietnam between 18 and 29 December 1972. As a consequence, Canadian-American relations, already under stress because of the mutual contempt between Nixon and Trudeau, reached a post-war nadir. Nixon was infuriated by the resolution and refused to see Marcel Cadieux, the Canadian ambassador in Washington, in protest for the rest of 1973. Nixon was only prevented from lashing out more by his desire to have Canada continue as the pro-Western member on the International Control Commission for Vietnam. Prompted by Halstead, who was known as a proponent of economic &quot;rebalancing&quot; by seeking closer economic ties with the EEC, Trudeau made a visit to Brussels in October 1973 to see François-Xavier Ortoli, the president of the European Commission, to ask for a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement. Halstead used Nixon&#x27;s displeasure with Canada as an argument that it was finally time for &quot;economic rebalancing&quot; by seeking closer ties with the EEC, a thesis that Halstead had been advocating ever since the early 1960s. Ortoli refused Trudeau&#x27;s request for a free trade agreement with the EEC, saying that was out of the question, but did agree to open talks on lowering tariffs between Canada and the EEC.

Trudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada&#x27;s international profile, including joining the G7 group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of U.S. President Gerald Ford. American-Canadian relations changed for the better when Trudeau found a better rapport with Ford&#x27;s successor, Jimmy Carter. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the &quot;stagflation&quot; (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.

==== United Kingdom and France====
Trudeau attached little importance to relations with the United Kingdom. While he shot down a suggestion by one of his ministers to turn Canada into a republic in 1968, he treated the monarchy with a certain bemused contempt. Britain&#x27;s 1973 decision to join the European Economic Community (EEC) confirmed Trudeau&#x27;s view that the UK was a declining power that had little to offer Canada, while the way that Japan had replaced Britain as Canada&#x27;s second-largest trading partner was taken as further confirmation of these views. However, Trudeau was attached to the Commonwealth, believing it was an international body that allowed Canada to project influence into the Third World; he noted it was one of the few bodies that allowed leaders from the First and Third Worlds to meet on a regular basis. Although France was no longer as supportive of Quebec separatism as it had been under President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s, the way that French politicians expressed the idea of a special Franco-Quebecois bond as opposed to a special Franco-Canadian bond throughout the 1970s led to tensions with Paris.

In 1970–71, the Commonwealth was threatened with a split as a number of African members, supported by India, denounced Britain&#x27;s policy of selling arms to apartheid South Africa, which the UK argued was necessary because South Africa was not only one of the world&#x27;s largest gold producers, but its government was anti-Communist and pro-Western. The Wilson government had imposed an arms embargo on South Africa in 1964, which the new Conservative Heath government ended in 1970. A number of African Commonwealth nations led by Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania threatened to leave the organization if Britain continued with arms sales to South Africa. When British Prime Minister Edward Heath visited Ottawa in December 1970, his meetings with Trudeau went badly. In what was described as a &quot;no holds-barred&quot; style, Trudeau told Heath that the British arms sales to white supremacist South Africa were threatening the unity of the Commonwealth. At a Commonwealth summit in Singapore between 14 and 22 January 1971, Trudeau argued that apartheid was not sustainable in the long run given that the black population of South Africa vastly outnumbered the white population, and it was extremely myopic for Britain to be supporting South Africa, given that majority rule in South Africa was inevitable. However, Trudeau worked for a compromise to avoid a split in the Commonwealth, arguing that it needed to do more to pressure South Africa to end apartheid peacefully, and saying that a &quot;race war&quot; in South Africa would be the worse possible way to end apartheid. The conference ended with a compromise agreement in which Britain would fulfill its existing arms contracts to South Africa but henceforth sell no more weapons to the country; ultimately, the British only sold South Africa five attack helicopters. Singaporean Prime Minister and conference host Lee Kuan Yew later praised Trudeau for his efforts at the summit to hold the Commonwealth together, despite the passions aroused by the South African issue.

==== Germany ====
Trudeau had an especially close friendship with the Social Democratic West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, whom he greatly liked both for his left-wing politics and as a practical politician who was more concerned about getting things done rather than with ideological questions. Schmidt was sympathetic towards Trudeau&#x27;s &quot;rebalancing&quot; concept, telling Trudeau that he wanted West Germany to have two North American partners instead of one, and promised at a 1975 meeting to use West German influence within the EEC to grant Canada better trade terms in exchange for Canada spending more on its NATO commitments. After meeting Schmidt, Trudeau performed a &quot;volte-face&quot; on NATO, speaking at a press conference of how much he valued NATO as an alliance that was established for collective security in Europe. To show his approval of Schmidt, Trudeau not only agreed to spend more on NATO, but insisted that the Canadian Army buy the German-built Leopard tanks, which thereby boosted the West German arms industry, over the opposition of the Finance department, which felt that buying the Leopard tanks was wasteful. Schmidt&#x27;s support was especially welcome as Wilson, once again back as the British prime minister, proved unwilling to lobby for the EEC lowering tariffs on Canadian goods, merely saying that he was willing &quot;to interpret Canadian policy&quot; to the other EEC leaders. By contrast, the West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave Trudeau a firm promise of West German support for an EEC-Canadian economic agreement. The major hold-out was France, which was stoutly opposed to an EEC-Canadian agreement, seeing giving EEC market access to Canadian agriculture as a threat to French agriculture. In July 1976 a Canadian-EEC Framework Economic Agreement was signed, which came into effect on 1 October 1976. Trudeau hoped would be the Framework Agreement would be the first step towards a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement, but the EEC proved to be uninterested in free trade with Canada.

==== China ====
Trudeau established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China before the United States did in 1979, and went on an official visit to Beijing. On 10 February 1969, the government announced its wish to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic, and Trudeau was mortified when the Chinese refused to respond at first, which made him look foolish. Unknown to Trudeau, the Chinese diplomatic corps had been so thoroughly purged during the Cultural Revolution that the Chinese Foreign Ministry barely functioned by early 1969. On 19 February 1969, the Chinese finally responded and agreed to open talks in Stockholm on establishing diplomatic relations, which began on 3 April 1969. Trudeau expected the negotiations to be a mere formality, but relations were not finally established until October 1970. The delay was largely because the Chinese insisted that Canada have no relations whatsoever with &quot;the Chiang Kai-shek gang&quot; as they called the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan and agree to support the Chinese position that Taiwan was a part of the People&#x27;s Republic, a position that caused problems on the Canadian side as it implied Canadian support for China&#x27;s viewpoint that it had the right to take Taiwan by force into the People&#x27;s Republic. On 10 October 1970, a statement was issued by the External Affairs department in Ottawa saying: &quot;The Chinese government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Canadian government takes note of the Chinese position&quot;. After the statement was issued, China and Canada established diplomatic relations on the same day. The so-called &quot;Canadian formula&quot; under which a nation &quot;takes note&quot; of the Chinese viewpoint that Taiwan is part of the People&#x27;s Republic has been often copied by other nations that have established diplomatic relations with Beijing, most notably the United States in 1979. In October 1973, Trudeau visited Beijing to meet Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, where Trudeau was hailed as &quot;old friend&quot;, a term of high approval in China.

In 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the Chinese government, issued an order barring Taiwan from participating as China in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, although technically it was a matter for the IOC. His action strained relations with the United States – from President Ford, future President Carter and the press – and subjected Canada to international condemnation and shame.

==== Trudeau and Castro ====
Trudeau was known as a friend of Fidel Castro, the leader of Cuba. In January 1976, Trudeau visited Cuba to meet Castro and shouted to a crowd in Havana &quot;Viva Cuba! Viva Castro!&quot; (&quot;Long Live Cuba! Long Live Castro!&quot;). In November 1975, Cuba had intervened in the Angolan Civil War on the side of the Marxist MPLA government supported by the Soviet Union which was fighting against the UNITA and FNLA guerrilla movements supported by the United States, South Africa and Zaire (the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo). Though both Zaire and South Africa had also intervened in Angola, sending in troops to support the FLNA and UNITA respectively, it was the Cuban intervention in Angola that caused the controversy in the West. Many people in the West saw the Cuban intervention as &quot;aggression&quot;, and as a power play by the Soviet Union to win a sphere of influence in Africa. Angola was amply endowed with oil, and many saw the victory of the MPLA/Cuban forces in the first round of the Angolan civil war in 1975–1976 as a major blow to Western interests in Africa. Trudeau&#x27;s remarks in Havana were widely seen in the West as not only expressing approval of Cuba&#x27;s Communist government, but also the Cuban intervention in Angola. In fact, Trudeau did press Castro in private to pull his troops out of Angola, only for Castro to insist that Cuba would pull its forces out of Angola only when South Africa likewise pulled its forces out of not only Angola, but also Southwest Africa (modern Namibia) as well. Trudeau&#x27;s embrace of Castro attracted much criticism in the United States, which allowed Trudeau to pose as a leader who was &quot;standing up&quot; to the United States without seriously damaging American-Canadian relations.

=== Re-elections ===
==== 1972 election ====
On September 1, 1972, over four years into the Liberals&#x27; five-year mandate, Trudeau called an election for October 30. At the start of the campaign, polls showed the Liberals 10 points ahead of the Progressive Conservatives led by Robert Stanfield, who previously lost to Trudeau in the 1968 election. However, the results produced a Liberal minority government, with the Liberals winning 109 seats compared to the PCs&#x27; 107; this was one of the closest elections in Canadian history. Trudeaumania from the 1968 election had worn off, not least because of a slumping economy and rising unemployment. The New Democratic Party led by David Lewis held the balance of power.

==== 1974 election ====
In May 1974, the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis. The ensuing election focused mainly on the then-ongoing economic recession. Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of wage and price controls to help end the increasing inflation Canada was facing. Trudeau mocked the proposal, telling a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying &quot;Zap! You&#x27;re frozen&quot;, and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation. According to Trudeau&#x27;s biographer John English, NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals during the campaign.

The Liberals were re-elected with a majority government, winning 141 out of 264 seats, prompting Stanfield&#x27;s retirement. However, the Liberals did not win any seats in Alberta, where Premier Peter Lougheed was a vociferous opponent of Trudeau&#x27;s 1974 budget.

=== Defeat in 1979 ===
As the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau&#x27;s personality and the country&#x27;s constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s. At the 1978 G7 summit, he discussed strategies for the upcoming election with West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who advised him to announce several spending cuts to quell criticism of the large deficits his government was running.

After a series of by-election defeats in 1978, Trudeau waited as long as he could to call a general election in 1979. He finally did so, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the &quot;British North America Act&quot;. During the election campaign, the Liberals faced declining poll numbers, while the Joe Clark–led Progressive Conservatives focused on &quot;pocketbook&quot; issues. To contrast Trudeau&#x27;s image with that of the mild-mannered Clark, Trudeau and his advisors based their campaign on Trudeau&#x27;s decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public&#x27;s apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at Maple Leaf Gardens saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign &quot;photo-ops&quot; were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark&#x27;s struggles justifying his party&#x27;s populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.

Though the Liberals won the popular vote by four points, its vote was concentrated in Quebec but faltered in industrial Ontario. This allowed the PCs to win a plurality of the seats in the House of Commons and form a minority government.

== Opposition (1979–1980) ==
Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor. However, before a leadership convention could be held, with Trudeau&#x27;s blessing and Allan MacEachen&#x27;s manoeuvring in the House, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark&#x27;s budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a Westminster system, budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their failure automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139–133, thereby toppling Clark&#x27;s government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisors, persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau&#x27;s main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Quebec sovereignty.

Trudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the &quot;low bridge&quot;, it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau&#x27;s role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day, Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a majority government.

== Second premiership (1980–1984) ==

The Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of Manitoba. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent&#x27;s NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.

=== 1980 Quebec referendum ===
The first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the 1980 Quebec sovereignty referendum, called by the Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government&#x27;s policy of leaving the issue to the Quebec Liberals and Claude Ryan. He appointed Jean Chrétien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the &quot;Non&quot; cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the &quot;association&quot; required consent from the other provinces.

In the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum, Lévesque said that Trudeau&#x27;s middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau&#x27;s aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French. A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question. He described the origin of the name as Canadian. Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement should Quebec decide to stay in Canada, in which English-speaking Canadians would have to listen to valid concerns made by the Québécois. On May 20, sixty percent of Quebeckers voted to remain in Canada. Following the announcement of the results, Trudeau said that he &quot;had never been so proud to be a Quebecker and a Canadian&quot;.

=== Economy and oil ===
In the government&#x27;s first budget, delivered in October 1980 by Finance Minister Allan MacEachen (a long-time Trudeau loyalist), the National Energy Program (NEP) was introduced. One of the Liberals&#x27; most contentious policies, the NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces and was seen as unfairly depriving them of the full economic benefit of their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta, where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP. The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEP, which led to what many termed &quot;Western alienation&quot;. Alberta premier Peter Lougheed entered into tough negotiations with Trudeau, reaching a revenue-sharing agreement on energy in 1982. Estimates have placed Alberta&#x27;s losses between $50 billion and $100 billion because of the NEP.

This first budget was one of a series of unpopular budgets delivered in response to the oil shock of 1979 and the ensuing severe global economic recession which began at the start of 1980. In his budget speech, MacEachen said that the global oil price shocks—in 1973 and again in 1979—had caused a &quot;sharp renewal of inflationary forces and real income losses&quot; in Canada and in the industrial world...They are not just Canadian problems ... they are world-wide problems.&quot; Leaders of developed countries raised their concerns at the Venice Summit, at meetings of Finance Ministers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Bank of Canada wrote that there was a &quot;deeply troubling air of uncertainty and anxiety&quot; about the economy.

Amongst the policies introduced by Trudeau&#x27;s last term in office were an expansion in government support for Canada&#x27;s poorest citizens. By the time Trudeau left office in 1984, the budget deficit was at $37 billion (fiscal year 1984–1985). Trudeau&#x27;s first budget (fiscal year 1968–1969) only had a deficit of $667 million. Inflation and unemployment marred much of Trudeau&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18 billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200 billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.

=== Patriation of the constitution ===
In 1982, Trudeau succeeded in patriating the Constitution. In response to a formal request from the Canadian Houses of Parliament, with the consent of all provinces except Quebec, the British Parliament passed an act ceding to the governments of Canada the full responsibility for amending Canada&#x27;s Constitution. Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chrétien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Quebec referendum in which Quebeckers voted to remain in Canada.

After chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the federal government&#x27;s intention to proceed with a request to the British Parliament to patriate the constitution unilaterally, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier Bill Davis, and New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their reference power, conflicting decisions prompted a Supreme Court decision that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a constitutional convention that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.

After the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British Parliament of accepting a unilateral request, Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At this meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, with the caveat that Parliament and the provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a notwithstanding clause to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was Lévesque who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Quebec government to the new constitutional provisions became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Quebec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau&#x27;s reputation amongst nationalists in the province.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, including the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, on April 17, 1982. With the enactment of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, the British Parliament ceded all authority over Canada to the governments of Canada. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, part of the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;, established the supremacy of the Constitution of Canada, which now could only be amended by the federal and provincial governments, under the amending formula established by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

The Charter represented the final step in Trudeau&#x27;s liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of Métis. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the Charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the Charter&#x27;s notwithstanding clause has been infrequently used.

=== Resignation ===
By 1984, the Progressive Conservatives held a substantial lead in opinion polls under their new leader Brian Mulroney, and polls indicated that the Liberals faced all-but-certain defeat if Trudeau led them into the next election.

On February 29, 1984, a day after what he described as a walk through the snowy streets of Ottawa, Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election. He was frequently known to use the term &quot;walk in the snow&quot; as a trope; he claimed to have taken a similar walk in December 1979 before deciding to take the Liberals into the 1980 election.

Trudeau formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as prime minister. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former Cabinet minister under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson. Before handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal Senators from Western provinces to his Cabinet. He advised Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage positions. He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees&#x27; qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum. However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due.

Turner&#x27;s appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be cancelled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that &quot;I had no option&quot; but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, &quot;You had an option, sir–to say &#x27;no&#x27;–and you chose to say &#x27;yes&#x27; to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.&quot; (Mulroney himself soon engaged in his own series of patronage appointments.)Accessed Dec 24, 2024 

In the election, Mulroney&#x27;s PCs took slightly more than half the votes cast and 73 percent of the seats, winning the largest majority government (by total number of seats) and second-largest majority (by proportion of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats – at the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level (by proportion of seats).

== After politics (1984–2000) ==
Trudeau joined the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie as counsel and settled in the historic Maison Cormier in Montreal following his retirement from politics. Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. The Meech Lake Accord granted Quebec the constitutional right to be a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada, which theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of power to Quebec. The Quebec government potentially could have been allowed to pass any law short of secession to protect Quebec&#x27;s constitutional right to be a &quot;distinct society&quot;. Trudeau claimed in his speeches that giving Quebec the constitutional status of a &quot;distinct society&quot; would lead to the Quebec government deporting members of Quebec&#x27;s English-speaking minority. His opposition to both accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.

He also continued to speak against the Parti Québécois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.

Trudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the Club of Rome. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met U.S. President Ronald Reagan to discuss easing world tensions.

He published his reminiscences in &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1993. The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.

In his old age, he was afflicted with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and prostate cancer, and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80. He was devastated by the death of his youngest son, Michel Trudeau, who was killed in an avalanche on November 13, 1998.

== Death and funeral ==


Trudeau succumbed to several health complications at his Montreal home on September 28, 2000. His death has been attributed to his prostate cancer, Parkinson’s disease, a prior battle with pneumonia, as well as the depression felt following his son&#x27;s death in 1998. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by Margaret as well as his sons Justin and Sacha. He was 80 years old.

Following his death, Trudeau&#x27;s casket lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament Hill&#x27;s Centre Block from September 30 to October 1, 2000. His funeral took place on October 3, 2000, at the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. Several world politicians, including U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, attended the funeral. His son Justin delivered the eulogy during the state funeral, which led to widespread speculation in the media that a career in politics was in his future.

Pierre Elliot Trudeau was interred in the Trudeau family mausoleum at St-Rémi-de-Napierville Cemetery in Saint-Rémi, Quebec. Per his family&#x27;s wishes, the burial was private and attended only by immediate family and friends.

== Personal life ==
=== Religious beliefs ===
Trudeau was Catholic and attended Mass throughout his life. While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the &quot;United Church Observer&quot; in 1971: &quot;I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I&#x27;m a Christian.&quot; Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.

Michael W. Higgins, a former president of Catholic St. Thomas University, researched Trudeau&#x27;s spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the Jesuits, who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau&#x27;s life was Dominican. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at Dominican University College, Trudeau &quot;considered himself a lay Dominican&quot;. He studied philosophy under Dominican Father Louis-Marie Régis and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding Régis as &quot;spiritual director and friend&quot;. Another skein in Trudeau&#x27;s spirituality was a contemplative aspect acquired from his association with the Benedictine tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of meditation in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into Transcendental Meditation by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He took retreats at Saint-Benoît-du-Lac, Quebec and regularly attended Hours and Mass at Montreal&#x27;s Benedictine community.

Although never publicly theological in the way of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair, nor evangelical, in the way of Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush, Trudeau&#x27;s spirituality, according to Michael W. Higgins, &quot;suffused, anchored, and directed his inner life. In no small part, it defined him.&quot;

=== Marriage and children ===
Described as a &quot;swinging young bachelor&quot; when he became prime minister, in 1968, Trudeau was reportedly dating Hollywood star Barbra Streisand in 1969 and 1970. While a serious romantic relationship, there was no express marriage proposal, contrary to one contemporary published report.

On March 4, 1971, while prime minister, Trudeau quietly married 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair, who was 29 years younger, at St. Stephen&#x27;s Catholic Church in North Vancouver.

Belying his publicized social exploits, and nicknames like &quot;Swinging Pierre&quot; and &quot;Trendy Trudeau&quot;; he was an intense intellectual with robust work habits and little time for family or fun. As a result, Margaret felt trapped and bored in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her bipolar depression, with which she was later diagnosed.

The couple had three sons: the first two, 23rd and current Prime Minister Justin (born 1971), and Alexandre (born 1973), were both born on Christmas Day two years apart. Their third son, Michel (1975–1998), died in an avalanche while skiing in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. Trudeau and Margaret separated in 1977, and were divorced in 1984. He was involved with guitarist Liona Boyd for eight years during this time.

When his divorce was finalized in 1984, Trudeau became the first Canadian prime minister to become a single parent as the result of divorce. In 1984, Trudeau was romantically involved with Margot Kidder (a Canadian actress famous for her role as Lois Lane in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; and its sequels) in the last months of his prime-ministership and after leaving office.

In 1991, Trudeau became a father again, with Deborah Margaret Ryland Coyne, to his only daughter, Sarah. Coyne later stood for the 2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election and came fifth in a poll won by Justin.

Trudeau began practicing judo sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade, he was ranked &quot;ikkyū&quot; (brown belt). Later, when he travelled to Japan as prime minister, he was promoted to &quot;shodan&quot; (first-degree black belt) by the Kodokan, and then promoted to &quot;nidan&quot; (second-degree black belt) by Masao Takahashi in Ottawa before leaving office. Trudeau began the night of his famous &quot;walk in the snow&quot; before announcing his retirement in 1984 by going to judo with his sons.

== Intellectual contributions ==
Trudeau was a strong advocate for a federalist model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Quebec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis&#x27; time in power.

Federalism in this context can be defined as &quot;a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples ... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples&quot;.

As a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on social democracy with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government. In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:

Trudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, &quot;in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people&quot;.

Trudeau&#x27;s idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: &quot;While the idea of a &#x27;nation&#x27; in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates—emotive and particularistic—to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict&quot;.

This position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Quebec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood. First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chrétien.

Trudeau and the Quebec federalist historian Fernand Ouellet, who was a devout follower and admirer of Trudeau and Trudeauism, frequently influenced each other intellectually in their ideas and texts on their anti-nationalist conception of the history of Quebec, though they never formed a personal friendship.

== Legacy ==
Trudeau remains well regarded by many Canadians. However, the passage of time has only slightly softened the strong antipathy he inspired among his opponents. Trudeau&#x27;s strong personality, contempt for his opponents and distaste for compromise on many issues have made him, as historian Michael Bliss puts it, &quot;one of the most admired and most disliked of all Canadian prime ministers&quot;. &quot;He haunts us still&quot;, biographers Christina McCall and Stephen Clarkson wrote in 1990. Trudeau&#x27;s electoral successes were matched in the 20th century only by those of William Lyon Mackenzie King.

Trudeau&#x27;s most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to Canadian nationalism, and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the British Commonwealth. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Quebec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced—and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.

Many politicians still use the term &quot;taking a walk in the snow&quot;, the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are &quot;just watch me&quot;, the &quot;Trudeau Salute&quot;, and &quot;Fuddle Duddle&quot;.

Maclean&#x27;s 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys ranked him twice as the fifth best Canadian prime minister, and in 2016, the fourth best. The CBC&#x27;s special on &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; saw him ranked as the third greatest Canadian of all time, behind Tommy Douglas and Terry Fox, from the over 1.2 million votes cast by watchers of the program.

=== Bilingualism ===

Bilingualism is one of Trudeau&#x27;s most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government&#x27;s services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for full bilingualism in New Brunswick and some French language service rights in Ontario and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.

However, Trudeau&#x27;s ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term &quot;bilingualism&quot;, because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau&#x27;s vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which &quot;all&quot; cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Quebec to Canada.

=== Constitutional legacy ===

The &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; was one of Trudeau&#x27;s most enduring legacies. It is seen as advancing civil rights and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. Court challenges based on the &quot;Charter&quot; have been used to advance the cause of women&#x27;s equality, establish French school boards in provinces with majority anglophone populations, and provide constitutional protection to English school boards in Quebec. Court actions under the Charter resulted in the adoption of same-sex marriage all across Canada by the federal Parliament.

=== Legacy in western Canada ===
Trudeau&#x27;s posthumous reputation in the western provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the &quot;father of Western alienation&quot;. To many westerners, Trudeau&#x27;s policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially Ontario and Québec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta. In British Columbia, Premier W. A. C. Bennett in 1970 argued that Trudeau&#x27;s government is Quebec nationalist-oriented. He also implied that Quebec received special treatment from Ottawa as a result.

More particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters&#x27; concerns with &quot;Why should &quot;I&quot; sell your wheat?&quot; – however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he &quot;gave the finger&quot; to a group of protesters through the carriage window less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.

=== Legacy in Quebec ===
Trudeau&#x27;s legacy in Quebec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) as a force in Quebec, and ensuring that the campaign for Quebec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his imposition of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.

At the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Quebec during his time as prime minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Québec seats in the 1980 federal election. Provincially, though, Québécois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Québécois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the Bloc Québécois. Since the signing of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Quebec. He was disliked by the Québécois nationalists.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Trudeau&quot; is a 2002 television miniseries which aired on CBC Television. It was written by Wayne Grigsby, directed by Jerry Ciccoritti and features Colm Feore in the title role.

A prequel, &quot;Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making&quot;, was released in 2005. The four-hour CBC production examines Trudeau&#x27;s early life. Stéphane Demers performs in the role.

== Supreme Court appointments ==
Trudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:

=== Order of Canada citation ===
Trudeau was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on June 24, 1985. His citation reads:
Lawyer, professor, author and defender of human rights this statesman served as Prime Minister of Canada for fifteen years. Lending substance to the phrase &quot;the style is the man&quot;, he has imparted, both in his and on the world stage, his quintessentially personal philosophy of modern politics.
== Major biographies ==
In 1990, Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall published a major biography &quot;Trudeau and Our Times&quot; in two volumes. Volume 1, &quot;The magnificent obsession&quot; reprinted in 1997, was the winner of the Governor General&#x27;s Award. The most recent reprint was in 2006.

== In film ==
Through hours of archival footage and interviews with Trudeau himself, the 1990 documentary &quot;Memoirs&quot; details the story of a man who used intelligence and charisma to bring together a country that was very nearly torn apart.

Trudeau&#x27;s life was also depicted in two CBC Television mini-series. The first, &quot;Trudeau&quot; (2002, with Colm Feore in the title role), depicts his years as prime minister. &quot;Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making&quot; (2005, with Stéphane Demers as the young Pierre, and Tobie Pelletier as Trudeau in later years) portrays his earlier life.

The 1999 feature-length documentary by the National Film Board (NFB) entitled &quot;Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the &#x27;70s Generation&quot; explores the impact of Trudeau&#x27;s vision of Canadian bilingualism through interviews with eight Canadians on how Trudeau&#x27;s concept of nationalism and bilingualism affected them personally in the 1970s.

In the documentary mini-series &quot;The Champions&quot; directed by Donald Brittain, Trudeau was the co-subject along with René Lévesque.

In 2001, the CBC produced a full-length documentary entitled &quot;Reflections&quot;.

<text>A pencil () is a writing or drawing implement with a solid pigment core in a protective casing that reduces the risk of core breakage and keeps it from marking the user&#x27;s hand.

Pencils create marks by physical abrasion, leaving a trail of solid core material that adheres to a sheet of paper or other surface. They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.

Most pencil cores are made of graphite powder mixed with a clay binder. Graphite pencils (traditionally known as &quot;lead pencils&quot;) produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most solvents, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging. Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching. Coloured pencils are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts, but are typically regarded as art supplies, especially those with cores made from wax-based binders that tend to smear when erasers are applied to them. Grease pencils have a softer, oily core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.

The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section, but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core. Casings may be of other materials, such as plastic or paper. To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point. Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted (usually through the casing&#x27;s tip) as needed. These casings can be reloaded with new cores (usually graphite) as the previous ones are exhausted.

==History==
===Camel hair===
&quot;Pencil&quot;, from Old French &quot;pincel&quot;, from late Latin a &quot;little tail&quot; (see &quot;penis&quot;; &quot;pincellus&quot;) originally referred to an artist&#x27;s fine brush of camel hair, also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencils.

Though the archetypal pencil was an artist&#x27;s brush, the stylus, a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets, was used extensively by the Romans and for palm-leaf manuscripts.

===Graphite deposit discoveries===
As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint or leadpoint until, in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called &quot;plumbago&quot; (Latin for &quot;lead ore&quot;). Because the pencil core is still referred to as &quot;lead&quot;, or &quot;a lead&quot;, many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as &quot;lead&quot;, even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (&quot;Bleistift&quot;), Irish (&quot;peann luaidhe&quot;), Arabic (قلم رصاص &quot;qalam raṣāṣ&quot;), and some other languages literally mean &quot;lead pen&quot;.

The value of graphite would soon be realised to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs; the mines were taken over by the Crown and were guarded. When sufficient stores of graphite had been accumulated, the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required.

The usefulness of graphite for pencils was discovered as well, but initially graphite for pencils had to be smuggled out of England. Because graphite is soft, it requires some form of encasement. Graphite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheepskin for stability. England would enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found in 1662 in Germany. However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s. The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Derwent Pencil Museum. The meaning of &quot;graphite writing implement&quot; apparently evolved late in the 16th century.

===Wood encasement===

Around 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-encased carpentry pencil. Their version was a flat, oval, more compact type of pencil. Their concept involved the hollowing out of a stick of juniper wood. Shortly thereafter, a superior technique was discovered: two wooden halves were carved, a graphite stick inserted, and the halves then glued together—essentially the same method in use to this day.

===Graphite powder and clay===
The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1662. It used a mixture of graphite, sulphur, and antimony.

English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars; France, under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain, was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines – the only known source in the world. France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute. It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleon&#x27;s army to change this. In 1795, Nicolas-Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln. By varying the ratio of graphite to clay, the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied. This method of manufacture, which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth, the founder of the Koh-I-Noor in 1790, remains in use. In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna.

In England, pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite. Henry Bessemer&#x27;s first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused.

===United States===
American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; in 1729, and George Washington used a pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Country in 1762. William Munroe, a cabinetmaker in Concord, Massachusetts, made the first American wood pencils in 1812. This was not the only pencil-making occurring in Concord. According to Henry Petroski, transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father&#x27;s pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar.

Munroe&#x27;s method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of Acton, a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook. He used the first circular saw in pencil production. He constructed the first of the hexagon- and octagon-shaped wooden casings. Ebenezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with anyone. One of those was Eberhard Faber, which built a factory in New York and became the leader in pencil production.

Joseph Dixon, an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the Tantiusques graphite mine in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, developed a means to mass-produce pencils. By 1870, The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world&#x27;s largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary Dixon Ticonderoga pencil and art supplies company.

By the end of the nineteenth century, over 240,000 pencils were used each day in the US. The favoured timber for pencils was Red Cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened. In the early twentieth century supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply.

One effect of this was that &quot;during World War II rotary pencil sharpeners were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood, and pencils had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner – with knives.&quot;

It was soon discovered that incense cedar, when dyed and perfumed to resemble Red Cedar, was a suitable alternative. Most pencils today are made from this timber, which is grown in managed forests. Over 14 billion pencils are manufactured worldwide annually. Less popular alternatives to cedar include basswood and alder.

In Southeast Asia, the wood Jelutong may be used to create pencils (though the use of this rainforest species is controversial). Environmentalists prefer the use of Pulai – another wood native to the region in pencil manufacturing.

===Eraser attachment===

On 30 March 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil. In 1862, Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went on to sue pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for infringement. In &quot;Reckendorfer v. Faber&quot; (1875), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer, declaring the patent invalid.

===Extenders===
Historian Henry Petroski notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencils has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down, before this people would continue to use even the stub of a pencil. For those who did not feel comfortable using a stub, pencil extenders were sold. These devices function something like a &quot;porte-crayon&quot;...the pencil stub can be inserted into the end of a shaft...Extenders were especially common among engineers and draftsmen, whose favorite pencils were priced dearly. The use of an extender also has the advantage that the pencil does not appreciably change its heft as it wears down. Artists use extenders to maximize the use of their colored pencils.

==Types==
===By marking material===


====Graphite====
Graphite pencils are the most common types of pencil, and are encased in wood. They are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from light grey to black. Their composition allows for the smoothest strokes.

====Solid====
Solid graphite pencils are solid sticks of graphite and clay composite (as found in a &#x27;graphite pencil&#x27;), about the diameter of a common pencil, which have no casing other than a wrapper or label. They are often called &quot;woodless&quot; pencils. They are used primarily for art purposes as the lack of casing allows for covering larger spaces more easily, creating different effects, and providing greater economy as the entirety of the pencil is used. They are available in the same darkness range as wood-encased graphite pencils.

====Liquid====
Liquid graphite pencils are pencils that write like pens. The technology was first invented in 1955 by Scripto and Parker Pens. Scripto&#x27;s liquid graphite formula came out about three months before Parker&#x27;s liquid lead formula. To avoid a lengthy patent fight the two companies agreed to share their formulas.

====Charcoal====
Charcoal pencils are made of charcoal and provide fuller blacks than graphite pencils, but tend to smudge easily and are more abrasive than graphite. Sepia-toned and white pencils are also available for duotone techniques.

====Carbon pencils====
Carbon pencils are generally made of a mixture of clay and lamp black, but are sometimes blended with charcoal or graphite depending on the darkness and manufacturer. They produce a fuller black than graphite pencils, are smoother than charcoal, and have minimal dust and smudging. They also blend very well, much like charcoal.

====Colored====
Colored pencils, or pencil crayons, have wax-like cores with pigment and other fillers. Several colors are sometimes blended together.

====Grease====
Grease pencils can write on virtually any surface (including glass, plastic, metal and photographs). The most commonly found grease pencils are encased in paper (Berol and Sanford Peel-off), but they can also be encased in wood (Staedtler Omnichrom).

====Watercolor====
Watercolor pencils are designed for use with watercolor techniques. Their cores can be diluted by water. The pencils can be used by themselves for sharp, bold lines. Strokes made by the pencil can also be saturated with water and spread with brushes.

===By use===
====Carpentry====
Carpenter&#x27;s pencils are pencils that have two main properties: their shape prevents them from rolling, and their graphite is strong. The oldest surviving pencil is a German carpenter&#x27;s pencil dating from the 17th Century and now in the Faber-Castell collection.

====Copying====
Copying pencils (or indelible pencils) are graphite pencils with an added dye that creates an indelible mark. They were invented in the late 19th century for press copying and as a practical substitute for fountain pens. Their markings are often visually indistinguishable from those of standard graphite pencils, but when moistened their markings dissolve into a coloured ink, which is then pressed into another piece of paper. They were widely used until the mid-20th century when ball pens slowly replaced them. In Italy their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referendums.

====Eyeliner====
Eye liner pencils are used for make-up. Unlike traditional copying pencils, eyeliner pencils usually contain non-toxic dyes.

====Erasable coloring====
Unlike wax-based colored pencils, the erasable variants can be easily erased. Their main use is in sketching, where the objective is to create an outline using the same color that other media (such as wax pencils, or watercolor paints) would fill or when the objective is to scan the color sketch. Some animators prefer erasable color pencils as opposed to graphite pencils because they do not smudge as easily, and the different colors allow for better separation of objects in the sketch. Copy-editors find them useful too as markings stand out more than those of graphite, but can be erased.

====Non-reproduction====
Also known as non-photo blue pencils, the non-reproducing types make marks that are not reproducible by photocopiers (examples include &quot;Copy-not&quot; by Sanford and &quot;Mars Non-photo&quot; by Staedtler) or by whiteprint copiers (such as &quot;Mars Non-Print&quot; by Staedtler).

====Stenography====
Stenographer&#x27;s pencils, also known as a steno pencil, are expected to be very reliable, and their lead is break-proof. Nevertheless, steno pencils are sometimes sharpened at both ends to enhance reliability. They are round to avoid pressure pain during long texts.

====Golf====
Golf pencils are usually short (a common length is ) and very cheap. They are also known as library pencils, as many libraries offer them as disposable writing instruments.

===By shape===
* Triangular (more accurately a Reuleaux triangle)
* Hexagonal
* Round
* Bendable (flexible plastic)

===By size===
====Typical====
A standard, hexagonal, &quot;#2 pencil&quot; is cut to a hexagonal height of , but the outer diameter is slightly larger (about )
A standard, &quot;#2&quot;, hexagonal pencil is long.

====Biggest====
On 3 September 2007, Ashrita Furman unveiled his giant US$20,000 pencil – long, with over for the graphite centre – after three weeks of creation in August 2007 as a birthday gift for teacher Sri Chinmoy. It is longer than the pencil outside the Malaysia HQ of stationers Faber-Castell.

===By manufacture===
====Mechanical====
Mechanical pencils use mechanical methods to push lead through a hole at the end. These can be divided into two groups: with propelling pencils an internal mechanism is employed to push the lead out from an internal compartment, while clutch pencils merely hold the lead in place (the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force, usually gravity, to pull it out of the body). The erasers (sometimes replaced by a sharpener on pencils with larger lead sizes) are also removable (and thus replaceable), and usually cover a place to store replacement leads. Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpening. Lead types are based on grade and size; with standard sizes being , , , , , , , , and (ISO 9175-1)—the size is available, but is not considered a standard ISO size.

====Pop a Point====
Pioneered by Taiwanese stationery manufacturer Bensia Pioneer Industrial Corporation in the early 1970s, Pop a Point Pencils are also known as Bensia Pencils, stackable pencils or non-sharpening pencils. It is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge-style plastic holder. A blunt tip is removed by pulling it from the writing end of the body and re-inserting it into the open-ended bottom of the body, thereby pushing a new tip to the top.

====Plastic====
Invented by Harold Grossman for the Empire Pencil Company in 1967, plastic pencils were subsequently improved upon by Arthur D. Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s; the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the &quot;EPCON&quot; Pencil. These pencils were co-extruded, extruding a plasticised graphite mix within a wood-composite core.

===Other aspects===
* By factory state: sharpened, unsharpened
* By casing material: wood, paper, plastic
* The P&amp;P Office Waste Paper Processor recycles paper into pencils

==Health==
Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.

Although lead has not been used for writing since antiquity, such as in Roman styli, lead poisoning from pencils was not uncommon. Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead, and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed.

==Manufacture==
The lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a &quot;slat,&quot; and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood. A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.

==Grading and classification==
Graphite pencils are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from black to light grey. A higher amount of clay added to the pencil makes it harder, leaving lighter marks. There is a wide range of grades available, mainly for artists who are interested in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black. Engineers prefer harder pencils which allow for a greater control in the shape of the lead.

Manufacturers distinguish their pencils by grading them, but there is no common standard. Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness.

Most manufacturers, and almost all in Europe, designate their pencils with the letters &quot;H&quot; (commonly interpreted as &quot;hardness&quot;) to &quot;B&quot; (commonly &quot;blackness&quot;), as well as &quot;F&quot; (usually taken to mean &quot;fineness&quot;, although F pencils are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade. Also referred as &quot;firm&quot; by many manufacturers). The standard writing pencil is graded &quot;HB&quot;. This designation, in the form &quot;H. B.&quot;, was in use at least as early as 1814. Softer or harder pencil grades were described by a sequence or successive Bs or Hs such as &quot;BB&quot; and &quot;BBB&quot; for successively softer leads, and &quot;HH&quot; and &quot;HHH&quot; for successively harder ones. The Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth pencil manufacturers claim to have first used the HB designations, with &quot;H&quot; standing for Hardtmuth, &quot;B&quot; for the company&#x27;s location of Budějovice, and &quot;F&quot; for Franz Hardtmuth, who was responsible for technological improvements in pencil manufacture.

As of 2021, a set of pencils ranging from a very soft, black-marking pencil to a very hard, light-marking pencil usually ranges from softest to hardest as follows:
Koh-i-noor offers twenty grades from 10H to 8B for its 1500 series. Mitsubishi Pencil offers twenty-two grades from 10H to 10B for its Hi-uni range. Derwent produces twenty grades from 9H to 9B for its graphic pencils. Staedtler produces 24 from 10H to 12B for its Mars Lumograph pencils.

Numbers as designation were first used by Conté and later by John Thoreau, father of Henry David Thoreau, in the 19th century.
Although Conté/Thoreau&#x27;s equivalence table is widely accepted, not all manufacturers follow it; for example, Faber-Castell uses a different equivalence table in its &quot;Grip 2001&quot; pencils: 1 = 2B, 2 = B, 2½ = HB, 3 = H, 4 = 2H.

===Hardness test===
Graded pencils can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but cannot be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coatings. This test defines a &quot;pencil hardness&quot; of a coating as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle. For standardized measurements, there are Mohs hardness testing pencils on the market. 

==External colour and shape==

The majority of pencils made in the US are painted yellow. According to Henry Petroski, this tradition began in 1890 when the L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth Company of Austria-Hungary introduced their Koh-I-Noor brand, named after the famous diamond. It was intended to be the world&#x27;s best and most expensive pencil, as the ends of the pencil was dipped in 14-carat gold, and at a time when most pencils were either painted in dark colours or not at all, the Koh-I-Noor was yellow.
As well as simply being distinctive, the colour may have been inspired by the Austro-Hungarian flag; it was also suggestive of the Orient at a time when the best-quality graphite came from Siberia. Other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencils would be associated with this high-quality brand, and chose brand names with explicit Oriental references, such as Mikado (renamed Mirado) and Mongol.

Not all countries use yellow pencils. German and Brazilian pencils, for example, are often green, blue or black, based on the trademark colours of Faber-Castell, a major German stationery company which has plants in those countries. In southern European countries, pencils tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines, while in Australia, they are red with black bands at one end. In India, the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines, and pencils with a large number of colour schemes are produced.

Pencils are commonly round, hexagonal, or sometimes triangular in section. Carpenters&#x27; pencils are typically oval or rectangular, so they cannot easily roll away during work.

<text>Pierre Curie ( ; ; 15 May 1859 – 19 April 1906) was a French chemist, physicist and a pioneer in crystallography, magnetism, piezoelectricity and radioactivity. He shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel&quot;. With their win, the Curies became the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize, launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.

== Early life ==
Born in Paris on 15 May 1859, Pierre Curie was the son of Eugène Curie (1827–1910), a doctor of French Huguenot Protestant origin from Alsace, and Sophie-Claire Curie (née Depouilly; 1832–1897). He was educated by his father and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry. When he was 16, he earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematics. By the age of 18, he earned his license in physical sciences from the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne, also known as the University of Paris. He did not proceed immediately to a doctorate due to lack of money. Instead, he worked as a laboratory instructor. When Pierre Curie was preparing for his Bachelor of Science degree, he worked in the laboratory of Jean-Gustave Bourbouze in the Faculty of Science. In 1895, he went on to receive his doctorate at the University of Paris. The submission material for his doctorate consisted of his research over magnetism. After obtaining his doctorate, he became professor of physics and in 1900, he became professor in the faculty of sciences.

In 1880, Pierre and his older brother Paul-Jacques (1856–1941) demonstrated that an electric potential was generated when crystals were compressed, i.e., piezoelectricity. To aid this work they invented the piezoelectric quartz electrometer. The following year they demonstrated the reverse effect: that crystals could be made to deform when subject to an electric field. Almost all digital electronic circuits now rely on this in the form of crystal oscillators. In subsequent work on magnetism Pierre Curie defined the Curie scale. This work also involved delicate equipment – balances, electrometers, etc.

Pierre Curie was introduced to Maria Skłodowska by their friend, physicist Józef Wierusz-Kowalski. Curie took her into his laboratory as his student. His admiration for her grew when he realized that she would not inhibit his research. He began to regard Skłodowska as his muse. She refused his initial proposal, but finally agreed to marry him on 26 July 1895.

The Curies had a happy, affectionate marriage, and they were known for their devotion to each other.

== Research ==

Before his famous doctoral studies on magnetism, he designed and perfected an extremely sensitive torsion balance for measuring magnetic coefficients. Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area. Pierre Curie studied ferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and diamagnetism for his doctoral thesis, and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as Curie&#x27;s law. The material constant in Curie&#x27;s law is known as the Curie constant. He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a critical temperature transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields. The Curie is a unit of measurement (3.7 × 1010 decays per second or 37 gigabecquerels) used to describe the intensity of a sample of radioactive material and was named after Marie and Pierre Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910.

Pierre Curie formulated what is now known as the &quot;Curie Dissymmetry Principle&quot;: a physical effect cannot have a dissymmetry absent from its efficient cause. For example, a random mixture of sand in zero gravity has no dissymmetry (it is isotropic). Introduce a gravitational field, and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can &#x27;self-sort&#x27; with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation.

Curie worked with his wife in isolating polonium and radium. They were the first to use the term &quot;radioactivity&quot;, and were pioneers in its study. Their work, including Marie Curie&#x27;s celebrated doctoral work, made use of a sensitive piezoelectric electrometer constructed by Pierre and his brother Jacques Curie. Pierre Curie&#x27;s 26 December 1898 publication with his wife and M. G. Bémont for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the ESPCI ParisTech (officially the École supérieure de physique et de Chimie industrielles de la Ville de Paris) in 2015. In 1903, to honor the Curies&#x27; work, the Royal Society of London invited Pierre to present their research. Marie Curie was not permitted to give the lecture so Lord Kelvin sat beside her while Pierre spoke on their research. After this, Lord Kelvin held a luncheon for Pierre. While in London, Pierre and Marie were awarded the Davy Medal of the Royal Society of London. In the same year, Pierre and Marie Curie, as well as Henri Becquerel, were awarded a Nobel Prize in physics for their research of radioactivity.

Curie and one of his students, Albert Laborde, made the first discovery of nuclear energy, by identifying the continuous emission of heat from radium particles. Curie also investigated the radiation emissions of radioactive substances, and through the use of magnetic fields was able to show that some of the emissions were positively charged, some were negative and some were neutral. These correspond to alpha, beta and gamma radiation.

=== Spiritualism ===
In the late nineteenth century, Pierre Curie was investigating the mysteries of ordinary magnetism when he became aware of the spiritualist experiments of other European scientists, such as Charles Richet and Camille Flammarion. Pierre Curie initially thought the systematic investigation into the paranormal could help with some unanswered questions about magnetism. He wrote to Marie, then his fiancée: &quot;I must admit that those spiritual phenomena intensely interest me. I think they are questions that deal with physics.&quot; Pierre Curie&#x27;s notebooks from this period show he read many books on spiritualism. He did not attend séances such as those of Eusapia Palladino in Paris in June 1905 as a mere spectator, and his goal certainly was not to communicate with spirits. He saw the séances as scientific experiments, tried to monitor different parameters, and took detailed notes of every observation. Curie considered himself as atheist.

== Family ==
Pierre Curie&#x27;s grandfather, Paul Curie (1799–1853), a doctor of medicine, was a committed Malthusian humanist and married Augustine Hofer, daughter of Jean Hofer and great-granddaughter of Jean-Henri Dollfus, great industrialists from Mulhouse in the second half of the 18th century and the first part of the 19th century.
Through this paternal grandmother, Pierre Curie is also a direct descendant of the Basel scientist and mathematician Jean Bernoulli (1667–1748), as is Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Pierre and Marie Curie&#x27;s daughter, Irène, and their son-in-law, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, were also physicists involved in the study of radioactivity, and each also received Nobel prizes for their work. The Curies&#x27; other daughter, Ève, wrote a noted biography of her mother. She was the only member of the Curie family to not become a physicist. Ève married Henry Richardson Labouisse Jr., who received a Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of UNICEF in 1965. Pierre and Marie Curie&#x27;s granddaughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot, is a professor of nuclear physics at the University of Paris, and their grandson, Pierre Joliot, who was named after Pierre Curie, is a noted biochemist.

== Death ==
Pierre Curie died in a street collision in Paris on 19 April 1906. Crossing the busy Rue Dauphine in the rain at the Quai de Conti, he slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn cart. One of the wheels ran over his head, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.

Both the Curies experienced radium burns, both accidentally and voluntarily, and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research. They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died from radiation-induced aplastic anemia in 1934. Even now, all their papers from the 1890s, even her cookbooks, are radioactive. Their laboratory books are kept in special lead boxes and people who want to see them have to wear protective clothing. Most of these items can be found at . Had Pierre Curie not been killed in an accident as he was, he would most likely have eventually died of the effects of radiation, as did his wife, their daughter Irène, and her husband Frédéric Joliot.

In April 1995, Pierre and Marie Curie were moved from their original resting place, a family cemetery, and enshrined in the crypt of the Panthéon in Paris.

<text>In the theory of computation, a branch of theoretical computer science, a pushdown automaton (PDA) is 
a type of automaton that employs a stack.

Pushdown automata are used in theories about what can be computed by machines. They are more capable than finite-state machines but less capable than Turing machines (see below).
Deterministic pushdown automata can recognize all deterministic context-free languages while nondeterministic ones can recognize all context-free languages, with the former often used in parser design.

The term &quot;pushdown&quot; refers to the fact that the stack can be regarded as being &quot;pushed down&quot; like a tray dispenser at a cafeteria, since the operations never work on elements other than the top element. A stack automaton, by contrast, does allow access to and operations on deeper elements. Stack automata can recognize a strictly larger set of languages than pushdown automata.
A nested stack automaton allows full access, and also allows stacked values to be entire sub-stacks rather than just single finite symbols.

== Informal description ==
A finite-state machine just looks at the input signal and the current state: it has no stack to work with, and therefore is unable to access previous values of the input. It can only choose a new state, the result of following the transition. A pushdown automaton (PDA) differs from a finite state machine in two ways:
# It can use the top of the stack to decide which transition to take. 
# It can manipulate the stack as part of performing a transition.

A pushdown automaton reads a given input string from left to right. In each step, it chooses a transition by indexing a table by input symbol, current state, and the symbol at the top of the stack. A pushdown automaton can also manipulate the stack, as part of performing a transition. The manipulation can be to push a particular symbol to the top of the stack, or to pop off the top of the stack. The automaton can alternatively ignore the stack, and leave it as it is. 

Put together: Given an input symbol, current state, and stack symbol, the automaton can follow a transition to another state, and optionally manipulate (push or pop) the stack.

If, in every situation, at most one such transition action is possible, then the automaton is called a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA). In general, if several actions are possible, then the automaton is called a general, or nondeterministic, PDA. A given input string may drive a nondeterministic pushdown automaton to one of several configuration sequences; if one of them leads to an accepting configuration after reading the complete input string, the latter is said to belong to the &quot;language accepted by the automaton&quot;.
== Formal definition ==
We use standard formal language notation: formula_1 denotes the set of finite-length strings over alphabet formula_2 and formula_3 denotes the empty string.

A PDA is formally defined as a 7-tuple:

formula_4
where

*formula_5 is a finite set of &quot;states&quot;
*formula_6 is a finite set which is called the &quot;input alphabet&quot;
*formula_2 is a finite set which is called the &quot;stack alphabet&quot;
*formula_8 is a finite subset of formula_9, the &quot;transition relation&quot;
*formula_10 is the &quot;start state&quot;
*formula_11 is the &quot;initial stack symbol&quot;
*formula_12 is the set of &quot;accepting states&quot;

An element formula_13 is a transition of formula_14. It has the intended meaning that formula_14, in state formula_16, on the input formula_17 and with formula_18 as topmost stack symbol, may read formula_19, change the state to formula_20, pop formula_21, replacing it by pushing formula_22. The formula_23 component of the transition relation is used to formalize that the PDA can either read a letter from the input, or proceed leaving the input untouched.
In many texts the transition relation is replaced by an (equivalent) formalization, where

* formula_8 is the &quot;transition function&quot;, mapping formula_25 into finite subsets of formula_26

Here formula_27 contains all possible actions in state formula_28 with formula_21 on the stack, while reading formula_19 on the input. One writes for example formula_31 precisely when formula_32 because formula_33. Note that &quot;finite&quot; in this definition is essential.

 &quot;Computations&quot; 
In order to formalize the semantics of the pushdown automaton a description of the current situation is introduced. Any 3-tuple formula_34 is called an instantaneous description (ID) of formula_14, which includes the current state, the part of the input tape that has not been read, and the contents of the stack (topmost symbol written first). The transition relation formula_8 defines the step-relation formula_37 of formula_14 on instantaneous descriptions. For instruction formula_13 there exists a step formula_40, for every formula_41 and every formula_42.

In general pushdown automata are nondeterministic meaning that in a given instantaneous description formula_43 there may be several possible steps. Any of these steps can be chosen in a computation.
With the above definition in each step always a single symbol (top of the stack) is popped, replacing it with as many symbols as necessary. As a consequence no step is defined when the stack is empty.

Computations of the pushdown automaton are sequences of steps. The computation starts in the initial state formula_44 with the initial stack symbol formula_45 on the stack, and a string formula_46 on the input tape, thus with initial description formula_47. 
There are two modes of accepting. The pushdown automaton either accepts by final state, which means after reading its input the automaton reaches an accepting state (in formula_48), or it accepts by empty stack (formula_3), which means after reading its input the automaton empties its stack. The first acceptance mode uses the internal memory (state), the second the external memory (stack).

Formally one defines
# formula_50 with formula_51 and formula_52 (final state)
# formula_53 with formula_54 (empty stack)

Here formula_55 represents the reflexive and transitive closure of the step relation formula_56 meaning any number of consecutive steps (zero, one or more).

For each single pushdown automaton these two languages need to have no relation: they may be equal but usually this is not the case. A specification of the automaton should also include the intended mode of acceptance. Taken over all pushdown automata both acceptance conditions define the same family of languages.

Theorem. For each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a pushdown automaton formula_58 such that formula_59, and vice versa, for each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a pushdown automaton formula_58 such that formula_62

== Example ==

The following is the formal description of the PDA which recognizes the language formula_63 by final state:
formula_64, where

*states: formula_65
*input alphabet: formula_66
*stack alphabet: formula_67
*start state: formula_68
*start stack symbol: 
*accepting states: formula_69

The transition relation formula_8 consists of the following six instructions:

:formula_71,
:formula_72,
:formula_73,
:formula_74,
:formula_75, and
:formula_76.

In words, the first two instructions say that in state any time the symbol is read, one is pushed onto the stack. Pushing symbol on top of another is formalized as replacing top by (and similarly for pushing symbol on top of a ).

The third and fourth instructions say that, at any moment the automaton may move from state to state .

The fifth instruction says that in state , for each symbol read, one is popped.

Finally, the sixth instruction says that the machine may move from state to accepting state only when the stack consists of a single .

There seems to be no generally used representation for PDA. Here we have depicted the instruction formula_77 by an edge from state to state labelled by formula_78 (read ; replace by formula_79).

=== Explanation ===

The following illustrates how the above PDA computes on different input strings. The subscript from the step symbol formula_80 is here omitted.
==Context-free languages==

Every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the topmost nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a grammatical rule (&quot;expand&quot;). Where the grammar generates a terminal symbol, the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the topmost symbol on the stack (&quot;match&quot;). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the unprocessed data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.

Technically, given a context-free grammar, the PDA has a single state, 1, and its transition relation is constructed as follows.

# formula_81 for each rule formula_82 (&quot;expand&quot;)
# formula_83 for each terminal symbol formula_19 (&quot;match&quot;)

The PDA accepts by empty stack. Its initial stack symbol is the grammar&#x27;s start symbol.

For a context-free grammar in Greibach normal form, defining (1,γ) ∈ δ(1,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) for each grammar rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;γ also yields an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton.

The converse, finding a grammar for a given PDA, is not that easy. The trick is to code two states of the PDA into the nonterminals of the grammar.

Theorem. For each pushdown automaton formula_14 one may construct a context-free grammar formula_86 such that 

The language of strings accepted by a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA) is called a deterministic context-free language. Not all context-free languages are deterministic. As a consequence, the DPDA is a strictly weaker variant of the PDA. Even for regular languages, there is a size explosion problem: for any recursive function formula_87 and for arbitrarily large integers formula_88, there is a PDA of size formula_88 describing a regular language whose smallest DPDA has at least formula_90 states. For many non-regular PDAs, any equivalent DPDA would require an unbounded number of states.

A finite automaton with access to two stacks is a more powerful device, equivalent in power to a Turing machine. A linear bounded automaton is a device which is more powerful than a pushdown automaton but less so than a Turing machine.

==Turing machines==

A pushdown automaton is computationally equivalent to a &#x27;restricted&#x27; Turing Machine (TM) with two tapes which is restricted in the following manner- On the first tape, the TM can only read the input and move from left to right (it cannot make changes). On the second tape, it can only &#x27;push&#x27; and &#x27;pop&#x27; data. Or equivalently, it can read, write and move left and right with the restriction that the only action it can perform at each step is to either delete the left-most character in the string (pop) or add an extra character left to the left-most character in the string (push).

That a PDA is weaker than a TM can be brought down to the fact that the procedure &#x27;pop&#x27; deletes some data. In order to make a PDA as strong as a TM, we need to save somewhere the data lost through &#x27;pop&#x27;. We can achieve this by introducing a second stack. In the TM model of PDA of last paragraph, this is equivalent to a TM with 3 tapes, where the first tape is the read-only input tape, and the 2nd and the 3rd tape are the &#x27;push and pop&#x27; (stack) tapes. In order for such a PDA to simulate any given TM, we give the input of the PDA to the first tape, while keeping both the stacks empty. It then goes on to push all the input from the input tape to the first stack. When the entire input is transferred to the 1st stack, now we proceed like a normal TM, where moving right on the tape is the same as popping a symbol from the 1st stack and pushing a (possibly updated) symbol into the second stack, and moving left corresponds to popping a symbol from the 2nd stack and pushing a (possibly updated) symbol into the first stack. We hence have a PDA with 2 stacks that can simulate any TM.

==Generalization==

A generalized pushdown automaton (GPDA) is a PDA that writes an entire string of some known length to the stack or removes an entire string from the stack in one step.

A GPDA is formally defined as a 6-tuple: 
:formula_91
where formula_92, and are defined the same way as a PDA.
:formula_93: formula_94
is the transition function.

Computation rules for a GPDA are the same as a PDA except that the formula_95&#x27;s and formula_96&#x27;s are now strings instead of symbols.

GPDA&#x27;s and PDA&#x27;s are equivalent in that if a language is recognized by a PDA, it is also recognized by a GPDA and vice versa.

One can formulate an analytic proof for the equivalence of GPDA&#x27;s and PDA&#x27;s using the following simulation:

Let formula_97 be a transition of the GPDA

where formula_98.

Construct the following transitions for the PDA:

:formula_99

==Stack automata==
As a generalization of pushdown automata, Ginsburg, Greibach, and Harrison (1967) investigated stack automata, which may additionally step left or right in the input string (surrounded by special endmarker symbols to prevent slipping out), and step up or down in the stack in read-only mode. 
A stack automaton is called &quot;nonerasing&quot; if it never pops from the stack. The class of languages accepted by nondeterministic, nonerasing stack automata is &quot;NSPACE&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2), which is a superset of the context-sensitive languages. The class of languages accepted by deterministic, nonerasing stack automata is &quot;DSPACE&quot;(&quot;n&quot;⋅log(&quot;n&quot;)).

==Alternating pushdown automata ==
An alternating pushdown automaton (APDA) is a pushdown automaton with a state set

* formula_100 where formula_101.

States in formula_102 and formula_103 are called &quot;existential&quot; resp. &quot;universal&quot;. In an existential state an APDA nondeterministically chooses the next state and accepts if &quot;at least one&quot; of the resulting computations accepts. In a universal state APDA moves to all next states and accepts if &quot;all&quot; the resulting computations accept.

The model was introduced by Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer. Ladner, Lipton and Stockmeyer proved that this model is equivalent to EXPTIME i.e. a language is accepted by some APDA if, and only if, it can be decided by an exponential-time algorithm.

Aizikowitz and Kaminski introduced &quot;synchronized alternating pushdown automata&quot; (SAPDA) that are equivalent to conjunctive grammars in the same way as nondeterministic PDA are equivalent to context-free grammars.

<text>Protein primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein. By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. Protein biosynthesis is most commonly performed by ribosomes in cells. Peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory. Protein primary structures can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences.

== Formation ==

=== Biological ===

Amino acids are polymerised via peptide bonds to form a long backbone, with the different amino acid side chains protruding along it. In biological systems, proteins are produced during translation by a cell&#x27;s ribosomes. Some organisms can also make short peptides by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, which often use amino acids other than the encoded 22, and may be cyclised, modified and cross-linked.

=== Chemical ===

Peptides can be synthesised chemically via a range of laboratory methods. Chemical methods typically synthesise peptides in the opposite order (starting at the C-terminus) to biological protein synthesis (starting at the N-terminus).

== Notation ==
Protein sequence is typically notated as a string of letters, listing the amino acids starting at the amino-terminal end through to the carboxyl-terminal end. Either a three letter code or single letter code can be used to represent the 22 naturally encoded amino acids, as well as mixtures or ambiguous amino acids (similar to nucleic acid notation).

Peptides can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences. Large sequence databases now exist that collate known protein sequences.



==Modification==

In general, polypeptides are unbranched polymers, so their primary structure can often be specified by the sequence of amino acids along their backbone. However, proteins can become cross-linked, most commonly by disulfide bonds, and the primary structure also requires specifying the cross-linking atoms, e.g., specifying the cysteines involved in the protein&#x27;s disulfide bonds. Other crosslinks include desmosine.

===Isomerisation===
The chiral centers of a polypeptide chain can undergo racemization. Although it does not change the sequence, it does affect the chemical properties of the sequence. In particular, the -amino acids normally found in proteins can spontaneously isomerize at the formula_1 atom to form -amino acids, which cannot be cleaved by most proteases. Additionally, proline can form stable trans-isomers at the peptide bond.

===Post-translational modification===
Additionally, the protein can undergo a variety of post-translational modifications, which are briefly summarized here.

The N-terminal amino group of a polypeptide can be modified covalently, e.g.,
* acetylation formula_2
:The positive charge on the N-terminal amino group may be eliminated by changing it to an acetyl group (N-terminal blocking).
* formylation formula_3
:The N-terminal methionine usually found after translation has an N-terminus blocked with a formyl group. This formyl group (and sometimes the methionine residue itself, if followed by Gly or Ser) is removed by the enzyme deformylase.
* pyroglutamate

:An N-terminal glutamine can attack itself, forming a cyclic pyroglutamate group.
* myristoylation formula_4
:Similar to acetylation. Instead of a simple methyl group, the myristoyl group has a tail of 14 hydrophobic carbons, which make it ideal for anchoring proteins to cellular membranes.

The C-terminal carboxylate group of a polypeptide can also be modified, e.g.,
* amination (see Figure)
:The C-terminus can also be blocked (thus, neutralizing its negative charge) by amination.
* glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment
:Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol(GPI) is a large, hydrophobic phospholipid prosthetic group that anchors proteins to cellular membranes. It is attached to the polypeptide C-terminus through an amide linkage that then connects to ethanolamine, thence to sundry sugars and finally to the phosphatidylinositol lipid moiety.

Finally, the peptide side chains can also be modified covalently, e.g.,
* phosphorylation
:Aside from cleavage, phosphorylation is perhaps the most important chemical modification of proteins. A phosphate group can be attached to the sidechain hydroxyl group of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, adding a negative charge at that site and producing an unnatural amino acid. Such reactions are catalyzed by kinases and the reverse reaction is catalyzed by phosphatases. The phosphorylated tyrosines are often used as &quot;handles&quot; by which proteins can bind to one another, whereas phosphorylation of Ser/Thr often induces conformational changes, presumably because of the introduced negative charge. The effects of phosphorylating Ser/Thr can sometimes be simulated by mutating the Ser/Thr residue to glutamate.
* glycosylation
:A catch-all name for a set of very common and very heterogeneous chemical modifications. Sugar moieties can be attached to the sidechain hydroxyl groups of Ser/Thr or to the sidechain amide groups of Asn. Such attachments can serve many functions, ranging from increasing solubility to complex recognition. All glycosylation can be blocked with certain inhibitors, such as tunicamycin.
* deamidation (succinimide formation)
:In this modification, an asparagine or aspartate side chain attacks the following peptide bond, forming a symmetrical succinimide intermediate. Hydrolysis of the intermediate produces either aspartate or the β-amino acid, iso(Asp). For asparagine, either product results in the loss of the amide group, hence &quot;deamidation&quot;.
* hydroxylation
: Proline residues may be hydroxylated at either of two atoms, as can lysine (at one atom). Hydroxyproline is a critical component of collagen, which becomes unstable upon its loss. The hydroxylation reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme that requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C), deficiencies in which lead to many connective-tissue diseases such as scurvy.
* methylation
: Several protein residues can be methylated, most notably the positive groups of lysine and arginine. Arginine residues interact with the nucleic acid phosphate backbone and commonly form hydrogen bonds with the base residues, particularly guanine, in protein–DNA complexes. Lysine residues can be singly, doubly and even triply methylated. Methylation does &quot;not&quot; alter the positive charge on the side chain, however.
* acetylation
: Acetylation of the lysine amino groups is chemically analogous to the acetylation of the N-terminus. Functionally, however, the acetylation of lysine residues is used to regulate the binding of proteins to nucleic acids. The cancellation of the positive charge on the lysine weakens the electrostatic attraction for the (negatively charged) nucleic acids.
* sulfation
: Tyrosines may become sulfated on their formula_5 atom. Somewhat unusually, this modification occurs in the Golgi apparatus, not in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similar to phosphorylated tyrosines, sulfated tyrosines are used for specific recognition, e.g., in chemokine receptors on the cell surface. As with phosphorylation, sulfation adds a negative charge to a previously neutral site.
* prenylation and palmitoylation formula_6
: The hydrophobic isoprene (e.g., farnesyl, geranyl, and geranylgeranyl groups) and palmitoyl groups may be added to the formula_7 atom of cysteine residues to anchor proteins to cellular membranes. Unlike the GPI and myritoyl anchors, these groups are not necessarily added at the termini.
* carboxylation
: A relatively rare modification that adds an extra carboxylate group (and, hence, a double negative charge) to a glutamate side chain, producing a Gla residue. This is used to strengthen the binding to &quot;hard&quot; metal ions such as calcium.
* ADP-ribosylation
: The large ADP-ribosyl group can be transferred to several types of side chains within proteins, with heterogeneous effects. This modification is a target for the powerful toxins of disparate bacteria, e.g., &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; and &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;.
* ubiquitination and SUMOylation
: Various full-length, folded proteins can be attached at their C-termini to the sidechain ammonium groups of lysines of other proteins. Ubiquitin is the most common of these, and usually signals that the ubiquitin-tagged protein should be degraded.

Most of the polypeptide modifications listed above occur &quot;post-translationally&quot;, i.e., after the protein has been synthesized on the ribosome, typically occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, a subcellular organelle of the eukaryotic cell.

Many other chemical reactions (e.g., cyanylation) have been applied to proteins by chemists, although they are not found in biological systems.

===Cleavage and ligation===
In addition to those listed above, the most important modification of primary structure is peptide cleavage (by chemical hydrolysis or by proteases). Proteins are often synthesized in an inactive precursor form; typically, an N-terminal or C-terminal segment blocks the active site of the protein, inhibiting its function. The protein is activated by cleaving off the inhibitory peptide.

Some proteins even have the power to cleave themselves. Typically, the hydroxyl group of a serine (rarely, threonine) or the thiol group of a cysteine residue will attack the carbonyl carbon of the preceding peptide bond, forming a tetrahedrally bonded intermediate [classified as a hydroxyoxazolidine (Ser/Thr) or hydroxythiazolidine (Cys) intermediate]. This intermediate tends to revert to the amide form, expelling the attacking group, since the amide form is usually favored by free energy, (presumably due to the strong resonance stabilization of the peptide group). However, additional molecular interactions may render the amide form less stable; the amino group is expelled instead, resulting in an ester (Ser/Thr) or thioester (Cys) bond in place of the peptide bond. This chemical reaction is called an N-O acyl shift.

The ester/thioester bond can be resolved in several ways:
* Simple hydrolysis will split the polypeptide chain, where the displaced amino group becomes the new N-terminus. This is seen in the maturation of glycosylasparaginase.
* A β-elimination reaction also splits the chain, but results in a pyruvoyl group at the new N-terminus. This pyruvoyl group may be used as a covalently attached catalytic cofactor in some enzymes, especially decarboxylases such as S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) that exploit the electron-withdrawing power of the pyruvoyl group.
* Intramolecular transesterification, resulting in a &quot;branched&quot; polypeptide. In inteins, the new ester bond is broken by an intramolecular attack by the soon-to-be C-terminal asparagine.
* Intermolecular transesterification can transfer a whole segment from one polypeptide to another, as is seen in the Hedgehog protein autoprocessing.

==Sequence compression==
The compression of amino acid sequences is a comparatively challenging task. The existing specialized amino acid sequence compressors are low compared with that of DNA sequence compressors, mainly because of the characteristics of the data. For example, modeling inversions is harder because of the reverse information loss (from amino acids to DNA sequence). The current lossless data compressor that provides higher compression is AC2. AC2 mixes various context models using Neural Networks and encodes the data using arithmetic encoding.

==History==
The proposal that proteins were linear chains of α-amino acids was made nearly simultaneously by two scientists at the same conference in 1902, the 74th meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, held in Karlsbad. Franz Hofmeister made the proposal in the morning, based on his observations of the biuret reaction in proteins. Hofmeister was followed a few hours later by Emil Fischer, who had amassed a wealth of chemical details supporting the peptide-bond model. For completeness, the proposal that proteins contained amide linkages was made as early as 1882 by the French chemist E. Grimaux.

Despite these data and later evidence that proteolytically digested proteins yielded only oligopeptides, the idea that proteins were linear, unbranched polymers of amino acids was not accepted immediately. Some scientists such as William Astbury doubted that covalent bonds were strong enough to hold such long molecules together; they feared that thermal agitations would shake such long molecules asunder. Hermann Staudinger faced similar prejudices in the 1920s when he argued that rubber was composed of macromolecules.

Thus, several alternative hypotheses arose. The colloidal protein hypothesis stated that proteins were colloidal assemblies of smaller molecules. This hypothesis was disproved in the 1920s by ultracentrifugation measurements by Theodor Svedberg that showed that proteins had a well-defined, reproducible molecular weight and by electrophoretic measurements by Arne Tiselius that indicated that proteins were single molecules. A second hypothesis, the cyclol hypothesis advanced by Dorothy Wrinch, proposed that the linear polypeptide underwent a chemical cyclol rearrangement C=O + HN formula_8 C(OH)-N that crosslinked its backbone amide groups, forming a two-dimensional &quot;fabric&quot;. Other primary structures of proteins were proposed by various researchers, such as the diketopiperazine model of Emil Abderhalden and the pyrrol/piperidine model of Troensegaard in 1942. Although never given much credence, these alternative models were finally disproved when Frederick Sanger successfully sequenced insulin and by the crystallographic determination of myoglobin and hemoglobin by Max Perutz and John Kendrew.

==Primary structure in other molecules==
Any linear-chain heteropolymer can be said to have a &quot;primary structure&quot; by analogy to the usage of the term for proteins, but this usage is rare compared to the extremely common usage in reference to proteins. In RNA, which also has extensive secondary structure, the linear chain of bases is generally just referred to as the &quot;sequence&quot; as it is in DNA (which usually forms a linear double helix with little secondary structure). Other biological polymers such as polysaccharides can also be considered to have a primary structure, although the usage is not standard.

==Relation to secondary and tertiary structure==
The primary structure of a biological polymer to a large extent determines the three-dimensional shape (tertiary structure). Protein sequence can be used to predict local features, such as segments of secondary structure, or trans-membrane regions. However, the complexity of protein folding currently prohibits predicting the tertiary structure of a protein from its sequence alone. Knowing the structure of a similar homologous sequence (for example a member of the same protein family) allows highly accurate prediction of the tertiary structure by homology modeling. If the full-length protein sequence is available, it is possible to estimate its general biophysical properties, such as its isoelectric point.

Sequence families are often determined by sequence clustering, and structural genomics projects aim to produce a set of representative structures to cover the sequence space of possible non-redundant sequences.

<doc id="24512" wikidata="Q497359" url="?curid=24512" title="Peter principle">
<text>The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to &quot;a level of respective incompetence&quot;: employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.

The concept was explained in the 1969 book &quot;The Peter Principle&quot; (William Morrow and Company) by Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull. Hull wrote the text, which was based on Peter&#x27;s research. Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire, but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations. The Peter principle has since been the subject of much commentary and research.

==Summary==
The Peter principle states that a person who is competent at their job will earn a promotion to a position that requires different skills. If the promoted person lacks the skills required for the new role, they will be incompetent at the new level, and will not be promoted again. If the person is competent in the new role, they will be promoted again and will continue to be promoted until reaching a level at which they are incompetent. Being incompetent, the individual will not qualify for promotion again, and so will remain stuck at this &quot;final placement&quot; or &quot;Peter&#x27;s plateau&quot;.

This outcome is inevitable, given enough time and enough positions in the hierarchy to which competent employees may be promoted. The Peter principle is therefore expressed as: &quot;In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.&quot; This leads to Peter&#x27;s corollary: &quot;In time, every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties.&quot; Hull calls the study of how hierarchies work &quot;hierarchiology&quot;.

==&quot;The Peter Principle&quot;==
Laurence J. Peter&#x27;s research led to the formulation of the Peter Principle well before publishing his findings.

Eventually, to elucidate his observations about hierarchies, Peter worked with Raymond Hull to develop a book, &quot;The Peter Principle&quot;, which was published by William Morrow and Company in 1969. As such, the principle is named for Peter because, although Hull actually wrote almost all of the book&#x27;s text, it is a summary of Peter&#x27;s research.

===Summary===
In the first two chapters, Peter and Hull give various examples of the Peter principle in action. In each case, the higher position required skills that were not required at the level immediately below. For example, a competent school teacher may make a competent assistant principal, but then go on to be an incompetent principal. The teacher was competent at educating children, and as assistant principal, he was good at dealing with parents and other teachers, but as principal, he was poor at maintaining good relations with the school board and the superintendent.

In chapter 3, Peter and Hull discuss apparent exceptions to this principle and then debunk them. One of these illusory exceptions is when someone who is incompetent is still promoted anyway—they coin the phrase &quot;percussive sublimation&quot; for this phenomenon of being &quot;kicked upstairs&quot; (cf. Dilbert principle). However, it is only a pseudo-promotion: a move from one unproductive position to another. This improves staff morale, as other employees believe that they too can be promoted again. Another pseudo-promotion is the &quot;lateral arabesque&quot;: when a person is moved out of the way and given a longer job title.

While incompetence is merely a barrier to further promotion, &quot;super-&quot;incompetence&quot;&quot; is grounds for dismissal, as is &quot;super-&quot;competence&quot;&quot;. In both cases, &quot;they tend to disrupt the hierarchy.&quot; One specific example of a super-competent employee is a teacher of children with special needs: they were so effective at educating the children that, after a year, they exceeded all expectations at reading and arithmetic, but the teacher was still fired because they had neglected to devote enough time to bead-stringing and finger-painting.

Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the two methods of achieving promotion: &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pull&quot;. &quot;Push&quot; refers to the employee&#x27;s own efforts, such as working hard and taking courses for self-improvement. This is usually not very effective due to the seniority factor: the next level up is often fully occupied, blocking the path to promotion. &quot;Pull&quot;, on the other hand, is far more effective and refers to accelerated promotion brought about by the efforts of an employee&#x27;s mentors or patrons.

Chapter 6 explains why &quot;good followers do not become good leaders.&quot; In chapter 7, Peter and Hull describe the effect of the Peter principle in politics and government. Chapter 8, titled &quot;Hints and Foreshadowings&quot;, discusses the work of earlier writers on the subject of incompetence, such as Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Alexander Pope.

Chapter 9 explains that, once employees have reached their level of incompetence, they always lack insight into their situation. Peter and Hull go on to explain why aptitude tests do not work and are actually counter-productive. Finally, they describe &quot;summit competence&quot;: when someone reaches the highest level in their organization and yet is still competent at that level. This is only because there were not enough ranks in the hierarchy, or because they did not have time to reach a level of incompetence. Such people often seek a level of incompetence in another hierarchy; this is known as &quot;compulsive incompetence&quot;. For example, Socrates was an outstanding teacher but a terrible defence attorney.

Chapter 10 explains why attempts to assist an incompetent employee by promoting another employee to act as their assistant does not work: &quot;Incompetence plus incompetence equals incompetence&quot; (italics in original).

Chapters 11 and 12 describe the various medical and psychological manifestations of stress that may come as result of someone reaching their level of incompetence, as well as other symptoms such as certain characteristic habits of speech or behavior.

Chapter 13 considers whether it is possible for an employee who has reached their level of incompetence to be happy and healthy once they get there: the answer is no if the person realizes their true situation, and yes if the person does not.

Various ways of avoiding promotion to the final level are described in chapter 14. Attempting to refuse an offered promotion is ill-advised and is only practicable if the employee is not married and has no one else to answer to. Generally, it is better to avoid being considered for promotion in the first place, by pretending to be incompetent while one is actually still employed at a level of competence. This is &quot;&quot;Creative Incompetence&quot;,&quot; for which several examples of successful techniques are given. It works best if the chosen field of incompetence does not actually impair one&#x27;s work.

The concluding chapter applies Peter&#x27;s Principle to the entire human species at an evolutionary level and asks whether humanity can survive in the long run, or will it become extinct upon reaching its level of incompetence as technology advances.

==Research and related works==
Other commenters made observations similar to the Peter principle long before Peter&#x27;s research. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s 1763 play &quot;Minna von Barnhelm&quot; features an army sergeant who shuns the opportunity to move up in the ranks, saying &quot;I am a good sergeant; I might easily make a bad captain, and certainly an even worse general. One knows from experience.&quot; Similarly, Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831) wrote that &quot;there is nothing more common than to hear of men losing their energy on being raised to a higher position, to which they do not feel themselves equal.&quot; Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955) virtually enunciated the Peter principle in 1910, &quot;All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level, as they have been promoted until turning incompetent.&quot;

A number of scholars have engaged in research interpreting the Peter principle and its effects. In 2000, Edward Lazear explored two possible explanations for the phenomenon. First is the idea that employees work harder to gain a promotion, and then slack off once it is achieved. The other is that it is a statistical process: workers who are promoted have passed a particular benchmark of productivity based on factors that cannot necessarily be replicated in their new role, leading to a Peter principle situation. Lazear concluded that the former explanation only occurs under particular compensation structures, whereas the latter always holds up.

Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda, and Cesare Garofalo (2010) used an agent-based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true. They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly, or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group, from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly. For this work, they won the 2010 edition of the parody Ig Nobel Prize in management science. Later work has shown that firms that follow the Peter Principle may be disadvantaged, as they may be overtaken by competitors, or may produce smaller revenues and profits; as well why success most often is a result of luck rather than talent—work which earned Pluchino and Rapisarda a second Ig Nobel Prize in 2022.

In 2018, professors Alan Benson, Danielle Li, and Kelly Shue analyzed sales workers&#x27; performance and promotion practices at 214 American businesses to test the veracity of the Peter principle. They found that these companies tended to promote employees to a management position based on their performance in their previous position, rather than based on managerial potential. Consistent with the Peter principle, the researchers found that high performing sales employees were likelier to be promoted, and that they were likelier to perform poorly as managers, leading to considerable costs to the businesses.

The Peter principle inspired Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip &quot;Dilbert&quot;, to develop a similar concept, the Dilbert principle. The Dilbert principle holds that incompetent employees are promoted to management positions to get them out of the workflow. The idea was explained by Adams in his 1996 business book &quot;The Dilbert Principle&quot;, and it has since been analyzed alongside the Peter principle. João Ricardo Faria wrote that the Dilbert principle is &quot;a sub-optimal version of the Peter principle,&quot; and leads to even lower profitability than the Peter principle.

==Response by organizations==
Companies and organizations shaped their policies to contend with the Peter principle. Lazear stated that some companies expect that productivity will &quot;regress to the mean&quot; following promotion in their hiring and promotion practices. Other companies have adopted &quot;up or out&quot; strategies, such as the Cravath System, in which employees who do not advance are periodically fired. The Cravath System was developed at the law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, which made a practice of hiring chiefly recent law graduates, promoting internally and firing employees who do not perform at the required level. Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths have suggested the additive increase/multiplicative decrease algorithm as a solution to the Peter principle less severe than firing employees who fail to advance. They propose a dynamic hierarchy in which employees are regularly either promoted or reassigned to a lower level so that any worker who is promoted to their point of failure is soon moved to an area where they are productive.

==Popular recognition==
&quot;The Peter Principle&quot; is a British television sitcom broadcast by the BBC between 1995 and 2000, featuring Jim Broadbent as an incompetent bank manager named Peter, in an apparent demonstration of the principle.

&quot;The Incompetence Opera&quot; is a 16-minute mini-opera that premiered at the satirical Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2017, described as &quot;a musical encounter with the Peter principle and the Dunning–Kruger effect&quot;.

&quot;Freakonomics Radio&quot; is an American Public Radio program &amp; podcast. In 2022, an episode was produced entitled “Why Are There So Many Bad Bosses?” This episode explains the Peter Principle and its practicality. The episode aired in syndication on National Public Radio in the United States of America.

<text>Psychosis is a condition of the mind or psyche that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not real. Symptoms may include delusions and hallucinations, among other features. Additional symptoms are disorganized thinking and incoherent speech and behavior that is inappropriate for a given situation. There may also be sleep problems, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and difficulties carrying out daily activities. Psychosis can have serious adverse outcomes.
Psychosis can have several different causes. These include mental illness, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, sensory deprivation, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome or cerebral beriberi and in rare cases major depression (psychotic depression). Other causes include: trauma, sleep deprivation, some medical conditions, certain medications, and drugs such as alcohol, cannabis, hallucinogens, and stimulants. One type, known as postpartum psychosis, can occur after giving birth. The neurotransmitter dopamine is believed to play an important role. Acute psychosis is termed primary if it results from a psychiatric condition and secondary if it is caused by another medical condition or drugs. The diagnosis of a mental-health condition requires excluding other potential causes. Testing may be done to check for central nervous system diseases, toxins, or other health problems as a cause.
Treatment may include antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and social support. Early treatment appears to improve outcomes. Medications appear to have a moderate effect. Outcomes depend on the underlying cause. In the United States about 3% of people develop psychosis at some point in their lives. The condition has been described since at least the 4th century BC by Hippocrates and possibly as early as 1500 BC in the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus.
== Signs and symptoms ==

=== Hallucinations ===
A hallucination is defined as sensory perception in the absence of external stimuli. Hallucinations are different from illusions and perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form. They may consist of simple sensations (such as lights, colors, sounds, tastes, or smells) or more detailed experiences (such as seeing and interacting with animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations). Hallucinations are generally characterized as being vivid and uncontrollable. Auditory hallucinations, particularly experiences of hearing voices, are the most common and often prominent feature of psychosis.

Up to 15% of the general population may experience auditory hallucinations (though not all are due to psychosis). The prevalence of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia is generally put around 70%, but may go as high as 98%. Reported prevalence in bipolar disorder ranges between 11% and 68%. During the early 20th century, auditory hallucinations were second to visual hallucinations in frequency, but they are now the most common manifestation of schizophrenia, although rates vary between cultures and regions. Auditory hallucinations are most commonly intelligible voices. When voices are present, the average number has been estimated at three. Content, like frequency, differs significantly, especially across cultures and demographics. People who experience auditory hallucinations can frequently identify the loudness, location of origin, and may settle on identities for voices. Western cultures are associated with auditory experiences concerning religious content, frequently related to sin. Hallucinations may command a person to do something potentially dangerous when combined with delusions.

So-called &quot;minor hallucinations&quot;, such as extracampine hallucinations, or false perceptions of people or movement occurring outside of one&#x27;s visual field, frequently occur in neurocognitive disorders, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Visual hallucinations occur in roughly a third of people with schizophrenia, although rates as high as 55% are reported. The prevalence in bipolar disorder is around 15%. Content commonly involves animate objects, although perceptual abnormalities such as changes in lighting, shading, streaks, or lines may be seen. Visual abnormalities may conflict with proprioceptive information, and visions may include experiences such as the ground tilting. Lilliputian hallucinations are less common in schizophrenia, and are more common in various types of encephalopathy, such as peduncular hallucinosis.

A visceral hallucination, also called a cenesthetic hallucination, is characterized by visceral sensations in the absence of stimuli. Cenesthetic hallucinations may include sensations of burning, or re-arrangement of internal organs.

=== Delusions ===
Psychosis may involve delusional beliefs. A delusion is a &quot;fixed, false idiosyncratic belief&quot;, which does not change even when presented with incontrovertible evidence to the contrary. Delusions are context- and culture-dependent: a belief that inhibits critical functioning and is widely considered delusional in one population may be common (and even adaptive) in another, or in the same population at a later time. Since normative views may contradict available evidence, a belief need not contravene cultural standards in order to be considered delusional.

Prevalence in schizophrenia is generally considered at least 90%, and around 50% in bipolar disorder.

The DSM-5 characterizes certain delusions as &quot;bizarre&quot; if they are clearly implausible, or are incompatible with the surrounding cultural context. The concept of bizarre delusions has many criticisms, the most prominent being judging its presence is not highly reliable even among trained individuals.

A delusion may involve diverse thematic content. The most common type is a persecutory delusion, in which a person believes that an entity seeks to harm them. Others include delusions of reference (the belief that some element of one&#x27;s experience represents a deliberate and specific act by or message from some other entity), delusions of grandeur (the belief that one possesses special power or influence beyond one&#x27;s actual limits), thought broadcasting (the belief that one&#x27;s thoughts are audible) and thought insertion (the belief that one&#x27;s thoughts are not one&#x27;s own). A delusion may also involve misidentification of objects, persons, or environs that the afflicted should reasonably be able to recognize; such examples include Cotard&#x27;s syndrome (the belief that oneself is partly or wholly dead) and clinical lycanthropy (the belief that oneself is or has transformed into an animal).

The subject matter of delusions seems to reflect the current culture in a particular time and location. For example, in the US, during the early 1900s syphilis was a common topic, during the Second World War Germany, during the Cold War Communists, and in recent years, technology. Some psychologists, such as those who practice the Open Dialogue method, believe that the content of psychosis represents an underlying thought process that may, in part, be responsible for psychosis, though the accepted medical position is that psychosis is due to a brain disorder.

Historically, Karl Jaspers classified psychotic delusions into &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person&#x27;s background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity, religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).

=== Disorganization of speech/thought or behavior ===
Disorganization is split into disorganized speech (or thought), and grossly disorganized motor behavior. Disorganized speech or thought, also called formal thought disorder, is disorganization of thinking that is &quot;inferred&quot; from speech. Characteristics of disorganized speech include rapidly switching topics, called derailment or loose association; switching to topics that are unrelated, called tangential thinking; incomprehensible speech, called word salad or incoherence. Disorganized motor behavior includes repetitive, odd, or sometimes purposeless movement. Disorganized motor behavior rarely includes catatonia, and although it was a historically prominent symptom, it is rarely seen today. Whether this is due to historically used treatments or the lack thereof is unknown.

Catatonia describes a profoundly agitated state in which the experience of reality is generally considered impaired. There are two primary manifestations of catatonic behavior. The classic presentation is a person who does not move or interact with the world in any way while awake. This type of catatonia presents with waxy flexibility. Waxy flexibility is when someone physically moves part of a catatonic person&#x27;s body and the person stays in the position even if it is bizarre and otherwise nonfunctional (such as moving a person&#x27;s arm straight up in the air and the arm staying there).

The other type of catatonia is more of an outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above. It involves excessive and purposeless motor behaviour, as well as an extreme mental preoccupation that prevents an intact experience of reality. An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. In both types of catatonia, there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.

=== Negative symptoms ===

Negative symptoms include reduced emotional expression, decreased motivation (avolition), and reduced spontaneous speech (poverty of speech, alogia). Individuals with this condition lack interest and spontaneity, and have the inability to feel pleasure (anhedonia). Altered Behavioral Inhibition System functioning could possibly cause reduced sustained attention in psychosis and overall contribute to more negative reactions.

=== Psychosis in adolescents ===
Psychosis is rare in adolescents. Young people who have psychosis may have trouble connecting with the world around them and may experience hallucinations or delusions. Adolescents with psychosis may also have cognitive deficits that may make it harder for the youth to socialize and work. Potential impairments include reduced speed of mental processing, ability to focus without getting distracted (limited attention span), and deficits in verbal memory. If an adolescent is experiencing psychosis, they most likely have comorbidity, meaning that they could have multiple mental illnesses. Because of this, it may be difficult to determine whether it is psychosis or autism spectrum disorder, social or generalized anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

== Causes ==
The symptoms of psychosis may be caused by serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, a number of medical illnesses, and trauma. Psychosis may also be temporary or transient, and be caused by medications or substance use disorder (substance-induced psychosis).

=== Normal states ===
Brief hallucinations are not uncommon in those without any psychiatric disease, including healthy children. Causes or triggers include:
* Falling asleep and waking: hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations
* Bereavement, in which hallucinations of a deceased loved one are common
* Severe sleep deprivation
* Extreme stress (see below)
* Abnormal brainwaves
* Abnormal brain networks
* TBI

=== Trauma and stress ===
Traumatic life events have been linked with an elevated risk of developing psychotic symptoms. Childhood trauma has specifically been shown to be a predictor of adolescent and adult psychosis. Individuals with psychotic symptoms are three times more likely to have experienced childhood trauma (e.g., physical or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect) than those in the general population. Increased individual vulnerability toward psychosis may interact with traumatic experiences promoting an onset of future psychotic symptoms, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Importantly, the relationship between traumatic life events and psychotic symptoms appears to be dose-dependent in which multiple traumatic life events accumulate, compounding symptom expression and severity. However, acute, stressful events can also trigger brief psychotic episodes. Trauma prevention and early intervention may be an important target for decreasing the incidence of psychotic disorders and ameliorating its effects. A healthy person could become psychotic if he or she is placed in an empty room with no light and sound. After about 15 minutes, psychosis can occur, this is a phenomenon known as sensory deprivation.

Neuroticism, a personality trait associated with vulnerability to stressors, is an independent predictor of the development of psychosis.

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
From a diagnostic standpoint, organic disorders were believed to be caused by physical illness affecting the brain (that is, psychiatric disorders secondary to other conditions) while functional disorders were considered disorders of the functioning of the mind in the absence of physical disorders (that is, primary psychological or psychiatric disorders). Subtle physical abnormalities have been found in illnesses traditionally considered functional, such as schizophrenia. The DSM-IV-TR avoids the functional/organic distinction, and instead lists traditional psychotic illnesses, psychosis due to general medical conditions, and substance-induced psychosis.

Primary psychiatric causes of psychosis include the following:
* schizophrenia
* mood disorders including psychotic depression and bipolar disorder in the manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and depressive episodes of both bipolar I and bipolar II
* schizoaffective disorder
* delusional disorder
* brief psychotic disorder
* schizophreniform disorder
Psychotic symptoms may also be seen in:
* Personality disorders including Schizotypal personality disorder and borderline personality disorder
* Post-traumatic stress disorder
* obsessive–compulsive disorder
* dissociative identity disorder
* paraphrenia

==== Subtypes ====
Subtypes of psychosis include:
* Postpartum psychosis, occurring shortly after giving birth, primarily associated with maternal bipolar disorder
* Monothematic delusions
* Myxedematous psychosis
* Stimulant psychosis
* Tardive psychosis
* Shared psychosis

==== Cycloid psychosis ====
Cycloid psychosis is typically an acute, self-limiting form of psychosis with psychotic and mood symptoms that progress from normal to full-blown, usually between a few hours to days, and not related to drug intake or brain injury. While proposed as a distinct entity, clinically separate from schizophrenia and affective disorders, cycloid psychosis is not formally acknowledged by current ICD or DSM criteria. Its unclear place in psychiatric nosology has likely contributed to the limited scientific investigation and literature on the topic.

==== Postpartum psychosis ====
Postpartum psychosis is a rare yet serious and debilitating form of psychosis. Symptoms range from fluctuating moods and insomnia to mood-incongruent delusions related to the individual or the infant. Women experiencing postpartum psychosis are at increased risk for suicide or infanticide. Many women who experience first-time psychosis from postpartum often have bipolar disorder, meaning they could experience an increase of psychotic episodes even after postpartum.

=== Medical conditions ===
A very large number of medical conditions can cause psychosis, sometimes called &quot;secondary psychosis&quot;. Examples include:
* disorders causing &quot;delirium&quot; (&quot;toxic psychosis&quot;), in which consciousness is disturbed
* neurodevelopmental disorders and chromosomal abnormalities, including velocardiofacial syndrome
* neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* focal neurological disease, such as stroke, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, and some forms of epilepsy
* malignancy (typically via masses in the brain, paraneoplastic syndromes)
* infectious and postinfectious syndromes, including infections causing delirium, viral encephalitis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, syphilis
* endocrine disease, such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism; sex hormones also affect psychotic symptoms and sometimes giving birth can provoke psychosis, termed postpartum psychosis
* inborn errors of metabolism, such as Wilson&#x27;s disease, porphyria, and homocysteinemia.
* nutritional deficiency, such as vitamin B12 deficiency
* other acquired metabolic disorders, including electrolyte disturbances such as hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypermagnesemia, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia, but also hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and failure of the liver or kidneys
* autoimmune and related disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus, SLE), sarcoidosis, Hashimoto&#x27;s encephalopathy, anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity
* poisoning by a range of plants, fungi, metals, organic compounds, and a few animal toxins
* sleep disorders, such as in narcolepsy (in which REM sleep intrudes into wakefulness)
* parasitic diseases, such as neurocysticercosis

=== Psychoactive drugs ===
Various psychoactive substances (both legal and illegal) have been implicated in causing, exacerbating, or precipitating psychotic states or disorders in users, with varying levels of evidence. This may be upon intoxication for a more prolonged period after use, or upon withdrawal. Individuals who experience substance-induced psychosis tend to have a greater awareness of their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to those who have a primary psychotic illness. Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), κ-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as phencyclidine and ketamine). Caffeine may worsen symptoms in those with schizophrenia and cause psychosis at very high doses in people without the condition. Cannabis and other illicit recreational drugs are often associated with psychosis in adolescents and cannabis use before 15 years old may increase the risk of psychosis in adulthood.

==== Alcohol ====

Approximately three percent of people with alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to the long-term effects of alcohol consumption resulting in distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamine deficiency. It is possible that hazardous alcohol use via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments. Delirium tremens, a symptom of chronic alcoholism that can appear in the acute withdrawal phase, shares many symptoms with alcohol-related psychosis suggesting a common mechanism.

==== Cannabis ====

According to current studies, cannabis use is associated with increased risk of psychotic disorders, and the more often cannabis is used the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness. Furthermore, people with a history of cannabis use develop psychotic symptoms earlier than those who have never used cannabis. Some debate exists regarding the causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis with some studies suggesting that cannabis use hastens the onset of psychosis primarily in those with pre-existing vulnerability. Indeed, cannabis use plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and cannabis use in adolescence should be discouraged. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, limited evidence suggests that CBD may have antipsychotic effects.

==== Methamphetamine ====
Methamphetamine induces a psychosis in 26–46 percent of heavy users. Some of these people develop a long-lasting psychosis that can persist for longer than six months. Those who have had a short-lived psychosis from methamphetamine can have a relapse of the methamphetamine psychosis years later after a stressful event such as severe insomnia or a period of hazardous alcohol use despite not relapsing back to methamphetamine. Individuals who have a long history of methamphetamine use and who have experienced psychosis in the past from methamphetamine use are highly likely to re-experience methamphetamine psychosis if drug use is recommenced. Methamphetamine-induced psychosis is likely gated by genetic vulnerability, which can produce long-term changes in brain neurochemistry following repetitive use.

==== Psychedelics ====
A 2024 study found that psychedelic use may potentially reduce, or have no effect on, psychotic symptoms in individuals with a personal or family history of psychotic disorders. A 2023 study found an interaction between lifetime psychedelic use and family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder on psychotic symptoms over the past two weeks. Psychotic symptoms were highest among individuals with both a family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder and lifetime psychedelic use, while they were lowest among those with lifetime psychedelic use but no family history of these disorders.

=== Medication ===
Administration, or sometimes withdrawal, of a large number of medications may provoke psychotic symptoms. Drugs that can induce psychosis experimentally or in a significant proportion of people include:
* stimulants, such as amphetamine and other sympathomimetics,
* dopamine agonists,
* ketamine,
* corticosteroids (often with mood changes in addition),
* and some anticonvulsants such as vigabatrin.

== Pathophysiology ==
=== Neuroimaging ===
The first brain image of an individual with psychosis was completed as far back as 1935 using a technique called pneumoencephalography (a painful and now obsolete procedure where cerebrospinal fluid is drained from around the brain and replaced with air to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X-ray picture).

Both first episode psychosis, and high risk status is associated with reductions in grey matter volume (GMV). First episode psychotic and high risk populations are associated with similar but distinct abnormalities in GMV. Reductions in the right middle temporal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), right parahippocampus, right hippocampus, right middle frontal gyrus, and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are observed in high risk populations. Reductions in first episode psychosis span a region from the right STG to the right insula, left insula, and cerebellum, and are more severe in the right ACC, right STG, insula and cerebellum.

Another meta analysis reported bilateral reductions in insula, operculum, STG, medial frontal cortex, and ACC, but also reported increased GMV in the right lingual gyrus and left precentral gyrus. The Kraepelinian dichotomy is made questionable by grey matter abnormalities in bipolar and schizophrenia; schizophrenia is distinguishable from bipolar in that regions of grey matter reduction are generally larger in magnitude, although adjusting for gender differences reduces the difference to the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

During attentional tasks, first episode psychosis is associated with hypoactivation in the right middle frontal gyrus, a region generally described as encompassing the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).Altered Behavioral Inhibition System functioning could possibly cause reduced sustained attention in psychosis and overall contribute to more negative reactions. In congruence with studies on grey matter volume, hypoactivity in the right insula, and right inferior parietal lobe is also reported. During cognitive tasks, hypoactivities in the right insula, dACC, and the left precuneus, as well as reduced deactivations in the right basal ganglia, right thalamus, right inferior frontal and left precentral gyri are observed. These results are highly consistent and replicable possibly except the abnormalities of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased grey matter volume in conjunction with bilateral hypoactivity is observed in anterior insula, dorsal medial frontal cortex, and dorsal ACC. Decreased grey matter volume and bilateral hyperactivity is reported in posterior insula, ventral medial frontal cortex, and ventral ACC.

=== Hallucinations ===
Studies during acute experiences of hallucinations demonstrate increased activity in primary or secondary sensory cortices. As auditory hallucinations are most common in psychosis, most robust evidence exists for increased activity in the left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus (i.e. Broca&#x27;s area). Activity in the ventral striatum, hippocampus, and ACC are related to the lucidity of hallucinations, and indicate that activation or involvement of emotional circuitry are key to the impact of abnormal activity in sensory cortices. Together, these findings indicate abnormal processing of internally generated sensory experiences, coupled with abnormal emotional processing, results in hallucinations. One proposed model involves a failure of feedforward networks from sensory cortices to the inferior frontal cortex, which normally cancel out sensory cortex activity during internally generated speech. The resulting disruption in expected and perceived speech is thought to produce lucid hallucinatory experiences.

=== Delusions ===
The two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot;, damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.

The aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.

Specific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage, and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.

=== Negative symptoms ===

Psychosis is associated with ventral striatal (VS), which is the part of the brain that is involved with the desire to naturally satisfy the body&#x27;s needs. When high reports of negative symptoms were recorded, there were significant irregularities in the left VS. Anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, is a commonly reported symptom in psychosis; experiences are present in most people with schizophrenia. Anhedonia arises as a result of the inability to feel motivation and drive towards both the desire to engage in as well as to complete tasks and goals. Previous research has indicated that a deficiency in the neural representation in regards to goals and the motivation to achieve them, has demonstrated that when a reward is not present, a strong reaction is noted in the ventral striatum; reinforcement learning is intact when contingencies about stimulus-reward are implicit, but not when they require explicit neural processing; reward prediction errors are what the actual reward is versus what the reward was predicted to be. In most cases positive prediction errors are considered an abnormal occurrence. A positive prediction error response occurs when there is an increased activation in a brain region, typically the striatum, in response to unexpected rewards. A negative prediction error response occurs when there is a decreased activation in a region when predicted rewards do not occur. Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) response, taken as an indicator of effort allocation, does not increase with reward or reward probability increase, and is associated with negative symptoms; deficits in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) activity and failure to improve performance on cognitive tasks when offered monetary incentives are present; and dopamine mediated functions are abnormal.

=== Neurobiology ===
Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the overactivity of the neurotransmitter dopamine. In particular to its effect in the mesolimbic pathway. The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs (i.e., antipsychotics) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms, and that drugs that accentuate dopamine release, or inhibit its reuptake (such as amphetamines and cocaine) can trigger psychosis in some people (see stimulant psychosis). However, there is substantial evidence that dopaminergic overactivity does not fully explain psychosis, and that neurodegerative pathophysiology plays a significant role. This is evidenced by the fact that psychosis commonly occurs in neurodegenerative diseases of the dopaminergic nervous system, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, which involved reduced, rather than increased, dopaminergic activity.

The endocannabinoid system is also implicated in psychosis. This is evidenced by the propensity of CB1 receptor agonists such as THC to induce psychotic symptoms, and the efficacy of CB1 receptor antagonists such as CBD in ameliorating psychosis.

NMDA receptor dysfunction has been proposed as a mechanism in psychosis. This theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine, PCP and dextromethorphan (at large overdoses) induce a psychotic state. The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia, including negative symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonism, in addition to producing symptoms reminiscent of psychosis, mimics the neurophysiological aspects, such as reduction in the amplitude of P50, P300, and MMN evoked potentials. Hierarchical Bayesian neurocomputational models of sensory feedback, in agreement with neuroimaging literature, link NMDA receptor hypofunction to delusional or hallucinatory symptoms via proposing a failure of NMDA mediated top down predictions to adequately cancel out enhanced bottom up AMPA mediated predictions errors. Excessive prediction errors in response to stimuli that would normally not produce such a response is thought to root from conferring excessive salience to otherwise mundane events. Dysfunction higher up in the hierarchy, where representation is more abstract, could result in delusions. The common finding of reduced GAD67 expression in psychotic disorders may explain enhanced AMPA mediated signaling, caused by reduced GABAergic inhibition.

The connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed to be complex. While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity, the D1 receptor increases it. If D2-blocking drugs are administered, the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors. The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell, which takes time. Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis. Moreover, newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors, suggesting the &#x27;dopamine hypothesis&#x27; may be oversimplified. Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and Zoldan et al. reported moderately successful use of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients.

A review found an association between a first-episode of psychosis and prediabetes.

Prolonged or high dose use of psychostimulants can alter normal functioning, making it similar to the manic phase of bipolar disorder. NMDA antagonists replicate some of the so-called &quot;negative&quot; symptoms like thought disorder in subanesthetic doses (doses insufficient to induce anesthesia), and catatonia in high doses. Psychostimulants, especially in one already prone to psychotic thinking, can cause some &quot;positive&quot; symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, particularly those persecutory in nature.

=== Culture ===
Cross-cultural studies into schizophrenia have found that individual experiences of psychosis and &#x27;hearing voices&#x27; vary across cultures. In countries such as the United States where there exists a predominantly biomedical understanding of the body, the mind and in turn, mental health, subjects were found to report their hallucinations as having &#x27;violent content&#x27; and self-describing as &#x27;crazy&#x27;. This lived experience is at odds with the lived experience of subjects in Accra, Ghana, who describe the voices they hear as having &#x27;spiritual meaning&#x27; and are often reported as positive in nature; or subjects in Chennai, India, who describe their hallucinations as kin, family members or close friends, and offering guidance.

These differences are attributed to &#x27;social kindling&#x27; or how one&#x27;s social context shapes how an individual interprets and experiences sensations such as hallucinations. This concept aligns with pre-existing cognitive theory such as reality modelling and is supported by recent research that demonstrates that individuals with psychosis can be taught to attend to their hallucinations differently, which in turn alters the hallucinations themselves. Such research creates pathways for social or community-based treatment, such as reality monitoring, for individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, providing alternatives to, or supplementing traditional pharmacologic management.

Cross-cultural studies explore the way in which psychosis varies in different cultures, countries and religions. The cultural differences are based on the individual or shared illness narratives surrounding cultural meanings of illness experience. In countries such as India, Cambodia and Muslim majority countries, they each share alternative epistemologies. These are known as knowledge systems that focus on the connections between mind, body, culture, nature, and society. Cultural perceptions of mental disorders such as psychosis or schizophrenia are believed to be caused by jinn (spirits) in Muslim majority countries. Furthermore, those in Arab-Muslim societies perceive those who act differently than the social norm as &quot;crazy&quot; or as abnormal behaviour. This differs from the lived experience of individuals in India and how they attain their perspectives on mental health issues through a variety of spiritual and healing traditions. In Cambodia, hallucinations are linked with spirit visitation, a term they call &quot;cultural kindling&quot;. These examples of differences are attributed to culture and the way it shapes conceptions of mental disorders. These cultural differences can be useful in bridging the gap of cultural understanding and psychiatric signs and symptoms.

== Diagnosis ==
To make a diagnosis of a mental illness in someone with psychosis other potential causes must be excluded. An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a health care provider. Tests may be done to exclude substance use, medication, toxins, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. A person with psychosis is referred to as psychotic.

Delirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors, including medical illnesses. Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:
* thyroid-stimulating hormone to exclude hypo- or hyperthyroidism,
* vitamin B12 serum and urinary MMA to role out pernicious anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency,
* basic electrolytes and serum calcium to rule out a metabolic disturbance,
* full blood count including ESR to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and
* serology to exclude syphilis or HIV infection.

Other investigations include:
* EEG to exclude epilepsy, and an
* MRI or CT scan of the head to exclude brain lesions.

Because psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of medications, medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be excluded to a high level of certainty, using toxicology screening.

Because some dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests, a psychotic individual&#x27;s family, partner, or friends should be asked whether the patient is currently taking any dietary supplements.

Common mistakes made when diagnosing people who are psychotic include:
* Not properly excluding delirium,
* Not appreciating medical abnormalities (e.g., vital signs),
* Not obtaining a medical history and family history,
* Indiscriminate screening without an organizing framework,
* Missing a toxic psychosis by not screening for substances &quot;and&quot; medications,
* Not asking their family or others about dietary supplements,
* Premature diagnostic closure, and
* Not revisiting or questioning the initial diagnostic impression of primary psychiatric disorder.

Only after relevant and known causes of psychosis are excluded, a mental health clinician may make a psychiatric differential diagnosis using a person&#x27;s family history, incorporating information from the person with psychosis, and information from family, friends, or significant others.

Types of psychosis in psychiatric disorders may be established by formal rating scales. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs of psychosis such as hostility, suspicion, hallucination, and grandiosity. It is based on the clinician&#x27;s interview with the patient and observations of the patient&#x27;s behavior over the previous 2–3 days. The patient&#x27;s family can also answer questions on the behavior report. During the initial assessment and the follow-up, both positive and negative symptoms of psychosis can be assessed using the 30 item Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS).

The DSM-5 characterizes disorders as psychotic or on the schizophrenia spectrum if they involve hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized motor behavior, or negative symptoms. The DSM-5 does not include psychosis as a definition in the glossary, although it defines &quot;psychotic features&quot;, as well as &quot;psychoticism&quot; with respect to personality disorder. The ICD-10 has no specific definition of psychosis.

The PSQ (Psychosis Screening Questionnaire) is the most common tool in detecting psychotic symptoms and it includes five root questions that assess the presence of PLE (mania, thought insertion, paranoia, strange experiences and perceptual disturbances) The different tools used to assess symptom severity include the Revised Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-R), a 24-item self-report instrument with six scales: psychosis, depression/functioning, interpersonal problems, alcohol/drug use, self-harm, and emotional lability. The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), a 90-item self assessment tool that measures psychoticism and paranoid ideation in addition to seven other symptom scales. Finally, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a 53-item self-administered scale developed from the SCL-90-R. The BSI has good psychometric properties and is an acceptable brief alternative to the SCL-90-R. These seem to be the most accurate tools at the moment, but a research in 2007 that focused on quantifying self-reports of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in persons with psychosis, suggest that The Hamilton Program for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire (HPSVQ) is also potentially a reliable and useful measure for specifically quantifying AVHs in relation to psychosis.

Factor analysis of symptoms generally regarded as psychosis frequently yields a five factor solution, albeit five factors that are distinct from the five domains defined by the DSM-5 to encompass psychotic or schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The five factors are frequently labeled as hallucinations, delusions, disorganization, excitement, and emotional distress. The DSM-5 emphasizes a psychotic spectrum, wherein the low end is characterized by schizoid personality disorder, and the high end is characterized by schizophrenia.

Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. said that the pleasant or emotionally positive experiences that are common in psychosis, particularly in the early stages, are more easily overlooked in clinical practice than the negative experiences. Nev Jones and Mona Shattel wrote that there is less curiosity towards the complications, or towards the richness of the good things as well as the bad things.

== Prevention ==
The evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent psychosis appeared inconclusive. But psychosis caused by drugs can be prevented. Whilst early intervention in those with a psychotic episode might improve short-term outcomes, little benefit was seen from these measures after five years. However, there is evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may reduce the risk of becoming psychotic in those at high risk, and in 2014 the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended preventive CBT for people at risk of psychosis.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of psychosis depends on the specific diagnosis (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or substance intoxication). The first-line treatment for many psychotic disorders is antipsychotic medication,
 which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. For youth or adolescents, treatment options include medications, psychological interventions, and social interventions.

=== Medication ===
The choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. Tentative evidence supports that amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine may be more effective for positive symptoms but result in more side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (&quot;treatment-resistant&quot; or &quot;refractory&quot; schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.

Most people on antipsychotics get side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Psychological treatments such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are possibly useful in the treatment of psychosis, helping people to focus more on what they can do in terms of valued life directions despite challenging symptomology. Metacognitive training (MCT) is associated with reduced delusions, hallucinations and negative symptoms as well as improved self-esteem and functioning in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

There are many psychosocial interventions that seek to treat the symptoms of psychosis: need adapted treatment, Open Dialogue, psychoanalysis/psychodynamic psychotherapy, major role therapy, soteria, psychosocial outpatient and inpatient treatment, milieu therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In relation to the success of CBT for psychosis, a randomized controlled trial for a Web-based CBTp (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis) skills program named Coping With Voices (CWV) suggest that the program has promise for increasing access to CBTp. It also associated benefits in the management of distressing psychotic symptoms and improved social functioning. When CBT and the other psychosocial interventions these are used without antipsychotic medications, they may be somewhat effective for some people, especially for CBT, need-adapted treatment, and soteria.

=== Early intervention ===
Early intervention in psychosis is based on the observation that identifying and treating someone in the early stages of a psychosis can improve their longer term outcome. This approach advocates the use of an intensive multi-disciplinary approach during what is known as the critical period, where intervention is the most effective, and prevents the long-term morbidity associated with chronic psychotic illness.

=== Systematic reform ===
Addressing systematic reform is essential to creating effective prevention as well as supporting treatments and recovery for those with psychosis.

Waghorn et al. suggest that education interventions can be a building block to support those with psychosis to successfully participate in society. In their study they analyse the relationship between successful education attainment and psychosis. Findings suggest proportionately more school aged persons with psychosis discontinued their education, compared to those without psychosis.

Waghorn et al. finds that specialised supported education for those with psychotic disorders can help lead to successful education attainment. Additionally, future employment outcomes are relative to such education attainment. Established approaches to supported education in the US include three basic models, self-contained classrooms, onsite support model and the mobile support model. Each model includes the participation of mental health service staff or educational facility staff in the student&#x27;s education arrangements.

Potential benefits of specialised supported education found from this study include coordination with other service providers (e.g. income support, housing, etc.) to prevent disrupting education, providing specialised career counselling, development of coping skills in the academic environment. These examples provide beneficial ways for people with psychosis to finish studies successfully as well as counter future experiences of psychosis.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;psychosis&quot; was introduced to the psychiatric literature in 1841 by Karl Friedrich Canstatt in his work &quot;Handbuch der Medizinischen Klinik&quot;. He used it as a shorthand for &#x27;psychic neurosis&#x27;. At that time neurosis meant any disease of the nervous system, and Canstatt was thus referring to what was considered a psychological manifestation of brain disease. Ernst von Feuchtersleben is also widely credited as introducing the term in 1845, as an alternative to insanity and mania.

The term stems from Modern Latin &quot;psychosis&quot;, &quot;a giving soul or life to, animating, quickening&quot; and that from Ancient Greek ψυχή (), &quot;soul&quot; and the suffix -ωσις (-&quot;&quot;), in this case &quot;abnormal condition&quot;.

In its adjective form &quot;psychotic&quot;, references to psychosis can be found in both clinical and non-clinical discussions. However, in a &quot;non&quot;-clinical context, &quot;psychotic&quot; is a nonspecific colloquialism used to mean &quot;insane&quot;.

=== Classification ===
The word was also used to distinguish a condition considered a disorder of the mind, as opposed to &quot;neurosis&quot;, which was considered a disorder of the nervous system. The psychoses thus became the modern equivalent of the old notion of madness, and hence there was much debate on whether there was only one (unitary) or many forms of the new disease. One type of broad usage would later be narrowed down by Koch in 1891 to the &#x27;psychopathic inferiorities&#x27;—later renamed abnormal personalities by Schneider.

The division of the major psychoses into manic depressive illness (now called bipolar disorder) and dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) was made by Emil Kraepelin, who attempted to create a synthesis of the various mental disorders identified by 19th-century psychiatrists, by grouping diseases together based on classification of common symptoms. Kraepelin used the term &#x27;manic depressive insanity&#x27; to describe the whole spectrum of mood disorders, in a far wider sense than it is usually used today.

In Kraepelin&#x27;s classification this would include &#x27;unipolar&#x27; clinical depression, as well as bipolar disorder and other mood disorders such as cyclothymia. These are characterised by problems with mood control and the psychotic episodes appear associated with disturbances in mood, and patients often have periods of normal functioning between psychotic episodes even without medication. Schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic episodes that appear unrelated to disturbances in mood, and most non-medicated patients show signs of disturbance between psychotic episodes.

=== Treatment ===
Written record of supernatural causes and resultant treatments can be traced back to the New Testament. Mark 5:8–13 describes a man displaying what would today be described as psychotic symptoms. Christ cured this &quot;demonic madness&quot; by casting out the demons and hurling them into a herd of swine. Exorcism is still utilized in some religious circles as a treatment for psychosis presumed to be demonic possession. A research study of out-patients in psychiatric clinics found that 30 percent of religious patients attributed the cause of their psychotic symptoms to evil spirits. Many of these patients underwent exorcistic healing rituals that, though largely regarded as positive experiences by the patients, had no effect on symptomology. Results did, however, show a significant worsening of psychotic symptoms associated with exclusion of medical treatment for coercive forms of exorcism.

The medical teachings of the fourth-century philosopher and physician Hippocrates of Cos proposed a natural, rather than supernatural, cause of human illness. In Hippocrates&#x27; work, the Hippocratic corpus, a holistic explanation for health and disease was developed to include madness and other &quot;diseases of the mind&quot;. Hippocrates writes:

Hippocrates espoused a theory of humoralism wherein disease is resultant of a shifting balance in bodily fluids including blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. According to humoralism, each fluid or &quot;humour&quot; has temperamental or behavioral correlates. In the case of psychosis, symptoms are thought to be caused by an excess of both blood and yellow bile. Thus, the proposed surgical intervention for psychotic or manic behavior was bloodletting.

18th-century physician, educator, and widely considered &quot;founder of American psychiatry&quot;, Benjamin Rush, also prescribed bloodletting as a first-line treatment for psychosis. Although not a proponent of humoralism, Rush believed that active purging and bloodletting were efficacious corrections for disruptions in the circulatory system, a complication he believed was the primary cause of &quot;insanity&quot;. Although Rush&#x27;s treatment modalities are now considered antiquated and brutish, his contributions to psychiatry, namely the biological underpinnings of psychiatric phenomenon including psychosis, have been invaluable to the field. In honor of such contributions, Benjamin Rush&#x27;s image is in the official seal of the American Psychiatric Association.

Early 20th-century treatments for severe and persisting psychosis were characterized by an emphasis on shocking the nervous system. Such therapies include insulin shock therapy, cardiazol shock therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. Despite considerable risk, shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia. The acceptance of high-risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery.

In 1888, Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised. Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued, one patient died and several developed aphasia or seizure disorders. Burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper. This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored. In the late 1930s, Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy (AKA prefrontal lobotomy) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed. Moniz&#x27;s primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists John Fulton and Carlyle&#x27;s 1935 experiment in which two chimpanzees were given leucotomies and pre- and post-surgical behavior was compared. Prior to the leucotomy, the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting. After the procedure, both chimps were pacified and less violent. During the Q&amp;A, Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects, a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling. Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans with various psychotic disorders, an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949. Between the late 1930s and early 1970s, the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice, often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes. Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s.

The first clinical trial of antipsychotics (also commonly known as neuroleptics) for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952. Chlorpromazine (brand name: Thorazine) passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis. Although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963, the administration of chlorpromazine marked the advent of the dopamine antagonist, or first generation antipsychotic. While clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features, the side effects were particularly harsh, which included high rates of often irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia. With the advent of atypical antipsychotics (also known as second generation antipsychotics) came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different, though still extensive, side-effect profile that included a lower risk of Parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Atypical antipsychotics remain the first-line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, dementia, and some autism spectrum disorders.

Dopamine is now one of the primary neurotransmitters implicated in psychotic symptomology. Blocking dopamine receptors (namely, the dopamine D2 receptors) and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined effect of antipsychotics, which are commonly used to treat psychosis. Recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic delusions or hallucinations, but rather attenuates the reward mechanisms involved in the development of delusional thinking; that is, connecting or finding meaningful relationships between unrelated stimuli or ideas. The author of this research paper acknowledges the importance of future investigation:

Freud&#x27;s former student Wilhelm Reich explored independent insights into the physical effects of neurotic and traumatic upbringing, and published his holistic psychoanalytic treatment with a schizophrenic. With his incorporation of breathwork and insight with the patient, a young woman, she achieved sufficient self-management skills to end the therapy.

Lacan extended Freud&#x27;s ideas to create a psychoanalytic model of psychosis based upon the concept of &quot;foreclosure&quot;, the rejection of the symbolic concept of the father.

Psychiatrist David Healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy of pharmaceutical treatments while ignoring social and developmental factors that are known important influences in the etiology of psychosis.

== Society and culture ==

Symptoms of psychosis can also include visions or quasi-visual experiences, felt presences, alterations of time, alterations of space, or alterations of spatiotemporal qualities of objects and things. While there are many overwhelmingly negative experiences of psychosis, some experiences of psychosis can be overwhelmingly positive and can be experienced as uplifting or as healing or as difficult but meaningful. Jones and Shattell said that mutual dialogue in clinical practice would in theory allow the meaning and complexity of psychotic experiences to emerge.

=== Disability ===
The classification of psychosis as a social disability is a common occurrence.

Psychosis is considered to be among the top 10 causes of social disability among adult men and women in developed countries. The traditional, negative narrative around disability has been shown to adversely influence employment and education for people experiencing psychosis.

Social disability by way of social disconnection is a significant public health concern and is associated with a broad range of negative outcomes, including premature mortality. Social disconnection refers to the ongoing absence of family or social relationships with marginal participation in social activities.

Research on psychosis found that reduced participation in social networks, not only negatively effects the individual on a physical and mental level, it has been shown that failure to be included in social networks influences the individual&#x27;s ability to participate in the wider community through employment and education opportunities.

Equal opportunity to participate in meaningful relationships with friends, family and partners, as well as engaging in social constructs such as employment, can provide significant physical and mental value to people&#x27;s lives. And how breaking the disability mindset around people experiencing psychosis is imperative for their overall, long-term health and well-being as well as the contributions they are able to make to their immediate social connections and the wider community.

== Research ==
Further research in the form of randomized controlled trials is needed to determine the effectiveness of treatment approaches for helping &quot;adolescents&quot; with psychosis. Through 10 randomized clinical trials, studies showed that Early Intervention Services (EIS) for patients with early-phase schizophrenia spectrum disorders have generated promising outcomes. EIS are specifically intended to fulfill the needs of patients with early-phase psychosis. In addition, one meta-analysis that consisted of four randomized clinical trials has examined and discovered the efficacy of EIS to Therapy as Usual (TAU) for early-phase psychosis, revealing that EIS techniques are superior to TAU.

A study suggests that combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with SlowMo, an app that helps notice their &quot;unhelpful quick-thinking&quot;, might be more effective for treating paranoia in people with psychosis than CBT alone.

<text>Paranoia is an instinct or thought process that is believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety, suspicion, or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory beliefs, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g., &quot;Everyone is out to get me&quot;). Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame.

Making false accusations and the general distrust of other people also frequently accompany paranoia. For example, a paranoid person might believe an incident was intentional when most people would view it as an accident or coincidence. Paranoia is a central symptom of psychosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
A common symptom of paranoia is attribution bias. These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality, often exhibiting more hostile beliefs than average. A paranoid person may view someone else&#x27;s accidental behavior as though it is intentional or signifies a threat.

An investigation of a non-clinical paranoid population found that characteristics such as feeling powerless and depressed, isolating oneself, and relinquishing activities, were associated with more frequent paranoia.
Some scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia, including erotic, persecutory, litigious, and exalted.

Most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status, perhaps because paranoia results in difficulty with interpersonal relationships.

Some researchers have arranged types of paranoia by commonality. The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats. Social anxiety is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia.

==Causes==
===Social and environmental===
Social circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs. According to a mental health survey distributed to residents of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua (in Mexico) and El Paso, Texas (in the United States), paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization, enhanced by social situations. Paranoid symptoms were associated with an attitude of mistrust and an external locus of control. Citing research showing that women and those with lower socioeconomic status are more prone to locating locus of control externally, the researchers suggested that women may be especially affected by the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia.

Surveys have revealed that paranoia can develop from difficult parental relationships and untrustworthy environments, for instance those that were highly disciplinary, strict, and unstable, could contribute to paranoia. Some sources have also noted that indulging and pampering the child could contribute to greater paranoia, via disrupting the child&#x27;s understanding of their relationship with the world. Experiences found to enhance or create paranoia included frequent disappointment, stress, and a sense of hopelessness.

Discrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions. Such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients who had experienced greater discrimination throughout their lives. Immigrants are more subject to some forms of psychosis than the general population, which may be related to more frequent experiences of discrimination and humiliation.

===Psychological===
Many more mood-based symptoms, for example grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia.

Colby (1981) defined paranoid cognition as &quot;persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed, threatened, harmed, subjugated, persecuted, accused, mistreated, killed, wronged, tormented, disparaged, vilified, and so on, by malevolent others, either specific individuals or groups&quot; (p. 518).
Three components of paranoid cognition have been identified by Robins &amp; Post: &quot;a) suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them; b) preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty, or trustworthiness, of friends or associates; c) reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them&quot; (1997, p. 3).

Paranoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables. From this point of view, paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intra-psychic conflict or disturbance. For instance, Colby (1981) suggested that the biases of blaming others for one&#x27;s problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated, and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence. This intra-psychic perspective emphasizes that the cause of paranoid cognitions is inside the head of the people (social perceiver), and dismisses the possibility that paranoid cognition may be related to the social context in which such cognitions are embedded. This point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion (two components of paranoid cognition) are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction, particularly when social interaction has gone awry. Even more, a model of trust development pointed out that trust increases or decreases as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons.

Another relevant difference can be discerned among &quot;pathological and non-pathological forms of trust and distrust&quot;. According to Deutsch, the main difference is that non-pathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. Pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them, are reflexively caused errors similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It has been suggested that a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of paranoia exists, extending from mild social evaluative concerns, through ideas of social reference, to persecutory beliefs concerning mild, moderate, and severe threats.

===Physical===
A paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls.

Drug-induced paranoia, associated with cannabis and stimulants like amphetamines or methamphetamine, has much in common with schizophrenic paranoia; the relationship has been under investigation since 2012. Drug-induced paranoia has a better prognosis than schizophrenic paranoia once the drug has been removed. For further information, see stimulant psychosis and substance-induced psychosis.

Based on data obtained by the Dutch NEMESIS project in 2005, there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis, which was based on a five-year follow up. Some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness. This idea however generated much skepticism during its time.

==Diagnosis==
In the DSM-IV-TR, paranoia is diagnosed in the form of:
* Paranoid personality disorder ()
* Paranoid schizophrenia (a subtype of schizophrenia) ()
* The persecutory type of delusional disorder ()

According to clinical psychologist P. J. McKenna, &quot;As a noun, paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence, and whose clinical features, course, boundaries, and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial. Employed as an adjective, paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations, from paranoid schizophrenia, through paranoid depression, to paranoid personality—not to mention a motley collection of paranoid &#x27;psychoses&#x27;, &#x27;reactions&#x27;, and &#x27;states&#x27;—and this is to restrict discussion to functional disorders. Even when abbreviated down to the prefix para-, the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of paraphrenia&quot;.

At least 50% of the diagnosed cases of schizophrenia experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution. Paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses, such as depression and dementia, but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders: paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder (persecutory type), and paranoid personality disorder.

==Treatment==
Paranoid delusions are often treated with antipsychotic medication, which exert a medium effect size. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) lessens paranoid delusions relative to control conditions according to a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 43 studies reported that metacognitive training (MCT) reduces (paranoid) delusions at a medium to large effect size relative to control conditions.

==History==
The word &quot;paranoia&quot; comes from the Greek παράνοια (&quot;paránoia&quot;), &quot;madness&quot;, and that from παρά (&quot;pará&quot;), &quot;beside, by&quot; and νόος (&quot;nóos&quot;), &quot;mind&quot;. The term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature. In this definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia. For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that they are an important religious figure would be classified by Kraepelin as having &quot;pure paranoia&quot;. The word &quot;paranoia&quot; is associated from the Greek word &quot;para-noeo&quot;. Its meaning was &quot;derangement&quot;, or &quot;departure from the normal&quot;. However, the word was used strictly and other words were used such as &quot;insanity&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot;, as these words were introduced by Aurelius Cornelius Celsus. The term &quot;paranoia&quot; first made an appearance during plays of Greek tragedians, and was also used by philosophers such as Plato and Hippocrates. Nevertheless, the word &quot;paranoia&quot; was the equivalent of &quot;delirium&quot; or &quot;high fever&quot;. Eventually, the term made its way out of everyday language for two millennia. &quot;Paranoia&quot; was soon revived as it made an appearance in the writings of the nosologists. It began to take appearance in France, with the writings of Rudolph August Vogel (1772) and François Boissier de Sauvage (1759).

According to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000), paranoia and paraphrenia are debated entities that were detached from dementia praecox by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves.

==Relations to violence==
It has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs. More research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions. Some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions. Wessely et al. (1993) did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions. However, the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants. The authors note that other studies such as one by Taylor (1985), have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals, mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners.

Other researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment. The attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people, although there has been much deliberation about this as well. Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors, persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.

Having resentful emotions towards others and the inability to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of people with paranoid schizophrenia (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theories of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as able to interpret others&#x27; emotions or claims.

==Paranoid social cognition==
Social psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition, &quot;paranoid social cognition&quot;, that has its origins in social determinants more than intra-psychic conflict. This perspective states that in milder forms, paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals. For instance, it is not strange that people may exhibit in their daily life, self-centered thought such as they are being talked about, suspicion about others&#x27; intentions, and assumptions of ill-will or hostility (e.g., people may feel as if everything is going against them). According to Kramer (1998), these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered as an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of a disturbing and threatening social environment.

Paranoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric self-consciousness may be related with the position that people occupy within a social system. This self-consciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoid-like forms of social misperception and misjudgment. This model identifies four components that are essential to understanding paranoid social cognition: situational antecedents, dysphoric self-consciousness, hypervigilance and rumination, and judgmental biases.

===Situational antecedents===
Perceived social distinctiveness, perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing.
*Perceived social distinctiveness: According to the social identity theory, people categorize themselves in terms of characteristics that made them unique or different from others under certain circumstances. Gender, ethnicity, age, or experience may become extremely relevant to explain people&#x27;s behavior when these attributes make them unique in a social group. This distinctive attribute may have influence not only in how people are perceived, but may also affect the way they perceive themselves. 
*Perceived evaluative scrutiny: According to this model, dysphoric self-consciousness may increase when people feel under moderate or intensive evaluative social scrutiny such as when an asymmetric relationship is analyzed. For example, when asked about their relationships, doctoral students remembered events that they interpreted as significant to their degree of trust in their advisors when compared with their advisors. This suggests that students are more willing to pay more attention to their advisor than their advisor is motivated to pay attention to them. Also students spent more time ruminating about the behaviors, events, and their relationship in general.
*Uncertainty about social standing: The knowledge about the social standing is another factor that may induce paranoid social cognition. Many researchers have argued that experiencing uncertainty about a social position in a social system constitutes an adverse psychological state, one which people are highly motivated to reduce.

===Dysphoric self-consciousness===
Refers to an aversive form of heightened &#x27;public self-consciousness&#x27; characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluation or scrutiny. Becoming self-tormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others&#x27; behaviors in a self-referential way.

===Hypervigilance and rumination===
Self-consciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state. According to this model, people experiencing self-consciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it, trying to make sense of what they are experiencing. These attempts promote hypervigilance and rumination in a circular relationship: more hypervigilance generates more rumination, whereupon more rumination generates more hypervigilance. Hypervigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information, but in contrast to adaptive vigilance, hypervigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal, fear, anxiety, and threat perception. Rumination is another possible response to threatening social information. Rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events, and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style.

===Judgmental and cognitive biases===
Three main judgmental consequences have been identified:
*The sinister attribution error: This bias captures the tendency that social perceivers have to overattribute lack of trustworthiness to others.
*The overly personalistic construal of social interaction: Refers to the inclination that paranoid perceiver has to interpret others&#x27; action in a disproportional self-referential way, increasing the belief that they are the target of others&#x27; thoughts and actions. A special kind of bias in the biased punctuation of social interaction, which entail an overperception of causal linking among independent events.
*The exaggerated perception of conspiracy: Refers to the disposition that the paranoid perceiver has to overattribute social coherence and coordination to others&#x27; actions.

Meta-analyses have confirmed that individuals with paranoia tend to jump to conclusions and are incorrigible in their judgements, even for delusion-neutral scenarios.

<text>Polybius (; , ; ) was a Greek historian of the middle Hellenistic period. He is noted for his work , a universal history documenting the rise of Rome in the Mediterranean in the third and second centuries BC. It covered the period of 264–146 BC, recording in detail events in Italy, Iberia, Greece, Macedonia, Syria, Egypt and Africa, and documented the Punic Wars and Macedonian Wars among many others.

Polybius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; is important not only for being the only Hellenistic historical work to survive in any substantial form, but also for its analysis of constitutional change and the mixed constitution. Polybius&#x27;s discussion of the separation of powers in government, of checks and balances to limit power, and his introduction of &quot;the people&quot;, all influenced Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of the Laws&quot;, John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, and the framers of the United States Constitution.

The leading expert on Polybius for nearly a century was F. W. Walbank (1909–2008), who published studies related to him for 50 years, including a long commentary of his &quot;Histories&quot; and a biography.

Polybius was a close friend and mentor to Scipio Aemilianus (also called Scipio Africanus the Younger), and had a lasting influence on his decision-making and life.

==Early life==
Polybius was born around 198 BC in Megalopolis, Arcadia, when it was an active member of the Achaean League. The town was revived, along with other Achaean states, a century before he was born.

Polybius&#x27;s father, Lycortas, was a prominent, land-owning politician and member of the governing class who became &quot;strategos&quot; (commanding general) of the Achaean League. Consequently, Polybius was able to observe first hand during his first 30 years the political and military affairs of Megalopolis, gaining experience as a statesman. In his early years, he accompanied his father while travelling as ambassador. He developed an interest in horse riding and hunting, diversions that later commended him to his Roman captors.

In 182 BC, he was given the honour of carrying the funeral urn of Philopoemen, one of the most eminent Achaean politicians of his generation. In either 170 BC or 169 BC, Polybius was elected &quot;hipparchus&quot; (cavalry officer) and was due to assist Rome militarily during the Third Macedonian War, although this never came about. This office was the second highest position of the Achaean League and often presaged election to the annual &quot;strategia&quot; (chief generalship). Polybius&#x27;s political career was cut short in 168 BC, however; as a consequence of the final defeat of the Antigonid kingdom in the Third Macedonian War, 1,000 Achaeans (including Polybius) with suspect allegiances were interned in Rome and its surrounding area.

==Personal experiences==
Polybius&#x27;s father, Lycortas, was a prominent advocate of neutrality during the Roman war against Perseus of Macedon in 171-168 BC. Lycortas attracted the suspicion of the Romans, and Polybius subsequently was one of the 1,000 Achaean nobles who were transported to Rome as hostages in 167 BC, and was detained there for 17 years. In Rome, by virtue of his high culture, Polybius was admitted to the most distinguished houses, in particular to that of Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, the conqueror in the Third Macedonian War, who entrusted Polybius with the education of his sons, Fabius and Scipio Aemilianus (who had been adopted by the eldest son of Scipio Africanus). Polybius remained on cordial terms with his former pupil Scipio Aemilianus and was among the members of the Scipionic Circle.

When Scipio defeated the Carthaginians in the Third Punic War, Polybius remained his counsellor. The Achaean hostages were released in 150 BC, and Polybius was granted leave to return home, but the next year he went on campaign with Scipio Aemilianus to Africa, and was present at the Sack of Carthage in 146, which he later described. Following the destruction of Carthage, Polybius likely journeyed along the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as Spain.

After the destruction of Corinth in the same year, Polybius returned to Greece, making use of his Roman connections to lighten the conditions there. Polybius was charged with the difficult task of organizing the new form of government in the Greek cities, and in this office he gained great recognition.

==At Rome==
In the succeeding years, Polybius resided in Rome, completing his historical work while occasionally undertaking long journeys through the Mediterranean countries in the furtherance of his history, in particular with the aim of obtaining firsthand knowledge of historical sites. He apparently interviewed veterans to clarify details of the events he was recording and was similarly given access to archival material. Little is known of Polybius&#x27;s later life; he most likely accompanied Scipio to Spain, acting as his military advisor during the Numantine War.

He later wrote about this war in a lost monograph. Polybius probably returned to Greece later in his life, as evidenced by the many existent inscriptions and statues of him there. The last event mentioned in his &quot;Histories&quot; seems to be the construction of the Via Domitia in southern France in 118 BC, which suggests the writings of Pseudo-Lucian may have some grounding in fact when they state, &quot;[Polybius] fell from his horse while riding up from the country, fell ill as a result and died at the age of eighty-two&quot;.

==&quot;The Histories&quot;==
&quot;The Histories&quot; is a universal history which describes and explains the rise of the Roman Republic as a global power in the ancient Mediterranean world. The work documents in detail political and military affairs across the Hellenistic Mediterranean between 264 and 146 BC, and in its later books includes eyewitness accounts of the sack of Carthage and Corinth in 146 BC, and the Roman annexation of mainland Greece after the Achaean War.

While Polybius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; covers the period from 264 BC to 146 BC, it mainly focuses on the years 221 BC to 146 BC, detailing Rome&#x27;s rise to supremacy in the Mediterranean by overcoming their geopolitical rivals: Carthage, Macedonia, and the Seleucid empire. Books I-II are &quot;The Histories&quot;″ introduction, describing events in Italy and Greece before 221/0 BC, including the First Punic War, Rome&#x27;s wars with the Gauls, the rise of the Achaean League (Polybius&#x27;s own constitution), and the re-establishment of Macedonian power in Greece under Antigonus III Doson and Philip V of Macedon. Books III-XXXIX describe in detail political and military affairs in the leading Mediterranean states, including affairs in ancient Rome and ancient Carthage, ancient Greece and ancient Macedonia, and the Seleucid empire and Egypt, explaining their increasing &quot;συμπλοκή&quot; (symplokē) or interconnectedness and how they each contributed to Rome&#x27;s rise to dominance. Only books I-V survive in full; the rest are in varying states of fragmentation.

Three discursive books on politics, historiography and geography break up the historical narrative:

*In Book VI, Polybius outlines his famous theory of the &quot;cycle of constitutions&quot; (the &quot;anacyclosis&quot;) and describes the political, military, and moral institutions that allowed the Romans to defeat their rivals in the Mediterranean. Polybius concludes that the Romans are the pre-eminent power because they currently have customs and institutions which balance and check the negative impulses of their people and promote a deep desire for noble acts, a love of virtue, piety towards parents and elders, and a fear of the gods (&quot;deisidaimonia&quot;). 

*In Book XII, Polybius discusses how to write history and criticises the historical accounts of numerous previous historians, including Timaeus for his account of the same period of history. He asserts Timaeus&#x27; point of view is inaccurate, invalid, and biased in favour of Rome. Christian Habicht considered his criticism of Timaeus to be spiteful and biased, However, Polybius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; is also useful in analyzing the different Hellenistic versions of history and of use as a more credible illustration of events during the Hellenistic period.

*Book XXXIV discussed geographical matters and the importance of geography in a historical account and in a statesman&#x27;s education. Unfortunately, this book has been almost entirely lost.

===Sources===
Polybius held that historians should, if possible, only chronicle events whose participants the historian was able to interview, and was among the first to champion the notion of factual integrity in historical writing. In the twelfth volume of his &quot;Histories&quot;, Polybius defines the historian&#x27;s job as the analysis of documentation, the review of relevant geographical information, and political experience. In Polybius&#x27;s time, the profession of a historian required political experience (which aided in differentiating between fact and fiction) and familiarity with the geography surrounding one&#x27;s subject matter to supply an accurate version of events.

Polybius himself exemplified these principles as he was well travelled and possessed political and military experience. He consulted and used written sources providing essential material for the period between 264 BC to 220 BC, including, for instance, treaty documents between Rome and Carthage in the First Punic War, the history of the Greek historian Phylarchus, and the &quot;Memoirs&quot; of the Achaean politician, Aratus of Sicyon. When addressing events after 220 BC, he continued to examine treaty documents, the writings of Greek and Roman historians and statesmen, eye-witness accounts and Macedonian court informants to acquire credible sources of information, although rarely did he name his sources (see, exceptionally, Theopompus).

==As historian==
Polybius wrote several works, most of which are lost. His earliest work was a biography of the Greek statesman Philopoemen; this work was later used as a source by Plutarch when composing his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;; however, the original Polybian text is lost. In addition, Polybius wrote an extensive treatise entitled &quot;Tactics&quot;, which may have detailed Roman and Greek military tactics. Small parts of this work may survive in his major &quot;Histories&quot;, but the work itself is lost as well. Another missing work was a historical monograph on the events of the Numantine War. The largest Polybian work was, of course, his &quot;Histories&quot;, of which only the first five books survive entirely intact, along with a large portion of the sixth book and fragments of the rest. Along with Cato the Elder (234–149 BC), he can be considered one of the founding fathers of Roman historiography.

Livy made reference to and uses Polybius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; as source material in his own narrative. Polybius was among the first historians to attempt to present history as a sequence of causes and effects, based upon a careful examination and criticism of tradition. He narrated his history based upon first-hand knowledge. &quot;The Histories&quot; capture the varied elements of the story of human behavior: nationalism, xenophobia, duplicitous politics, war, brutality, loyalty, valour, intelligence, reason and resourcefulness.

Aside from the narrative of the historical events, Polybius also included three books of digressions. Book 34 was entirely devoted to questions of geography and included some trenchant criticisms of Eratosthenes, whom he accused of passing on popular preconceptions or &quot;laodogmatika&quot;. Book 12 was a disquisition on the writing of history, citing extensive passages of lost historians, such as Callisthenes and Theopompus. Most influential was Book 6, which describes Roman political, military, and moral institutions, which he considered key to Rome&#x27;s success; it presented Rome as having a mixed constitution in which monarchical, aristocratic and popular elements existed in stable equilibrium. This enabled Rome to escape, for the time being, the cycle of eternal revolutions (&quot;anacyclosis&quot;) faced by those with singular constitutions (i.e. many of the Greeks and the Macedonians). While Polybius was not the first to advance this view, his account provides the most cogent illustration of the ideal for later political theorists.

A key theme of &quot;The Histories&quot; is good leadership, and Polybius dedicates considerable time to outlining how the good statesman should be rational, knowledgeable, virtuous and composed. The character of the Polybian statesman is exemplified in that of Philip II, who Polybius believed exhibited both excellent military prowess and skill, as well as proficient ability in diplomacy and moral leadership. His beliefs about Philip&#x27;s character led Polybius to reject the historian Theopompus&#x27; description of Philip&#x27;s private, drunken debauchery. For Polybius, it was inconceivable that such an able and effective statesman could have had an immoral and unrestrained private life as described by Theopompus. The consequences of bad leadership are also highlighted throughout the &quot;Histories&quot;. Polybius saw, for instance, the character and leadership of the later Philip V of Macedon, one of Rome&#x27;s leading adversaries in the Greek East, as the opposite of his earlier exemplary namesake. Philip V became increasingly tyrannical, irrational and impious following brilliant military and political success in his youth; this resulted, Polybius believed, in his abandonment by his Greek allies and his eventual defeat by Rome in 197 BC.

Other important themes running throughout &quot;The Histories&quot; include the role of Fortune in the affairs of nations, how a leader might weather bravely these changes of fortune with dignity, the educational value of history and how it should demonstrate cause and effect (or &quot;apodeiktike&quot;) to provide lessons for statesmen, and that historians should be &quot;men of action&quot; to gain appropriate experience so as to understand how political and military affairs are likely to pan out (&quot;pragmatikoi&quot;).

Polybius is considered by some to be the successor of Thucydides in terms of objectivity and critical reasoning, and the forefather of scholarly, painstaking historical research in the modern scientific sense. According to this view, his work sets forth the course of history&#x27;s occurrences with clearness, penetration, sound judgment, and, among the circumstances affecting the outcomes, he lays special emphasis on geographical conditions. Modern historians are especially impressed with the manner in which Polybius used his sources, particularly documentary evidence as well as his citation and quotation of sources. Furthermore, there is some admiration of Polybius&#x27;s meditation on the nature of historiography in Book 12. His work belongs, therefore, amongst the greatest productions of ancient historical writing. The writer of the &quot;Oxford Companion to Classical Literature&quot; (1937) praises him for his &quot;earnest devotion to truth&quot; and his systematic pursuit of causation.

It has long been acknowledged that Polybius&#x27;s writings are prone to a certain hagiographic tone when writing of his friends, such as Scipio, and subject to a vindictive tone when detailing the exploits of his enemies, such as Callicrates, the Achaean statesman responsible for his Roman exile.

As a hostage in Rome, then as client to the Scipios, and after 146 BC, a collaborator with Roman rule, Polybius was probably in no position to freely express any negative opinions of Rome. Peter Green advises that Polybius was chronicling Roman history for a Greek audience, to justify what he believed to be the inevitability of Roman rule. Nonetheless, Green considers Polybius&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; the best source for the era they cover. For Ronald Mellor, Polybius was a loyal partisan of Scipio, intent on vilifying his patron&#x27;s opponents. Adrian Goldsworthy, while using Polybius as a source for Scipio&#x27;s generalship, notes Polybius&#x27;s underlying and overt bias in Scipio&#x27;s favour. H. Ormerod considers that Polybius cannot be regarded as an &#x27;altogether unprejudiced witness&#x27; in relation to his &quot;bêtes noires&quot;; the Aetolians, the Carthaginians and the Cretans. Other historians perceive considerable negative bias in Polybius&#x27;s account of Crete; on the other hand, Hansen notes that the same work, along with passages from Strabo and Scylax, proved a reliable guide in the eventual rediscovery of the lost city of Kydonia.

==Cryptography==
Polybius was responsible for a useful tool in telegraphy that allowed letters to be easily signaled using a numerical system, called &quot;the Polybius square,&quot; mentioned in Hist. X.45.6 ff.. This idea also lends itself to cryptographic manipulation and steganography. Modern implementations of the Polybius square, at least in Western European languages such as English, Spanish, French, German and Italian, generally use the Roman alphabet in which those languages are written. However, Polybius himself was writing in Greek, and would have implemented his cipher square in the Greek alphabet. Both versions are shown here.

In the Polybius square, letters of the alphabet were arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 × 5 square. When used with the 26-letter Latin alphabet two letters, usually I and J, are combined. When used with the Greek alphabet, which has exactly one fewer letters than there are spaces (or code points) in the square, the final &quot;5,5&quot; code point encodes the spaces in between words. Alternatively, it can denote the end of a sentence or paragraph when writing in continuous script.

Five numbers are then aligned on the outside top of the square, and five numbers on the left side of the square vertically. Usually these numbers were arranged 1 through 5. By cross-referencing the two numbers along the grid of the square, a letter could be deduced.

In &quot;The Histories&quot;, Polybius specifies how this cypher could be used in fire signals, where long-range messages could be sent by means of torches raised and lowered to signify the column and row of each letter. This was a great leap forward from previous fire signaling, which could send prearranged codes only (such as, &#x27;if we light the fire, it means that the enemy has arrived&#x27;).

Other writings of scientific interest include detailed discussions of the machines Archimedes created for the defense of Syracuse against the Romans, where Polybius praises the &#x27;old man&#x27; and his engineering in the highest terms, and an analysis of the usefulness of astronomy to generals (both in the &quot;Histories&quot;).

==Influence==
Polybius was considered a poor stylist by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, writing of Polybius&#x27;s history that &quot;no one has the endurance to reach [its] end&quot;. Nevertheless, clearly he was widely read by Romans and Greeks alike. He is quoted extensively by Strabo writing in the 1st century BC and Athenaeus in the 3rd century AD.

His emphasis on explaining causes of events, rather than just recounting events, influenced the historian Sempronius Asellio. Polybius is mentioned by Cicero and mined for information by Diodorus, Livy, Plutarch and Arrian. Much of the text that survives today from the later books of &quot;The Histories&quot; was preserved in Byzantine anthologies.
His works reappeared in the West first in Renaissance Florence. Polybius gained a following in Italy, and although poor Latin translations hampered proper scholarship on his works, they contributed to the city&#x27;s historical and political discourse. Niccolò Machiavelli in his &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot; evinces familiarity with Polybius. Vernacular translations in French, German, Italian and English first appeared during the 16th century. Consequently, in the late 16th century, Polybius&#x27;s works found a greater reading audience among the learned public. Study of the correspondence of such men as Isaac Casaubon, Jacques Auguste de Thou, William Camden and Paolo Sarpi reveals a growing interest in Polybius&#x27;s works and thought during the period. Despite the existence of both printed editions in the vernacular and increased scholarly interest, however, Polybius remained an &quot;historian&#x27;s historian&quot;, not much read by the public at large.

Printings of his work in the vernacular remained few in number—seven in French, five in English (John Dryden provided an enthusiastic preface to Sir Henry Sheers&#x27; edition of 1693) and five in Italian.
Polybius&#x27;s political analysis has influenced republican thinkers from Cicero to Charles de Montesquieu to the Founding Fathers of the United States. John Adams, for example, considered him one of the most important teachers of constitutional theory. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Polybius has in general held appeal to those interested in Hellenistic Greece and early Republican Rome, while his political and military writings have lost influence in academia. More recently, thorough work on the Greek text of Polybius, and his historical technique, has increased the academic understanding and appreciation of him as a historian.

According to Edward Tufte, he was also a major source for Charles Joseph Minard&#x27;s figurative map of Hannibal&#x27;s overland journey into Italy during the Second Punic War.

In his &quot;Meditations On Hunting&quot;, Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset calls Polybius &quot;one of the few great minds that the turbid human species has managed to produce&quot;, and says the damage to the &quot;Histories&quot; is &quot;without question one of the gravest losses that we have suffered in our Greco-Roman heritage&quot;.

The Italian version of his name, Polibio, was used as a male first name—for example, the composer Polibio Fumagalli—though it never became very common.

The University of Pennsylvania has an intellectual society, the Polybian Society, which is named in his honor and serves as a non-partisan forum for discussing societal issues and policy.

<text>Plutarch (; , &quot;Ploútarchos&quot;, ; – 120s) was a Greek Middle Platonist philosopher, historian, biographer, essayist, and priest at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. He is known primarily for his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, a series of biographies of illustrious Greeks and Romans, and &quot;Moralia&quot;, a collection of essays and speeches. Upon becoming a Roman citizen, he was possibly named Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus ().

==Life==
Plutarch was born to a prominent family in the small town of Chaeronea, about east of Delphi, in the Greek region of Boeotia. His family was long established in the town; his father was named Autobulus and his grandfather was named Lamprias. His brothers, Timon and Lamprias, are frequently mentioned in his essays and dialogues, which speak of Timon in particular in the most affectionate terms. Plutarch studied mathematics and philosophy in Athens under Ammonius from AD 66 to 67. He attended the games of Delphi where the emperor Nero competed and possibly met prominent Romans, including future emperor Vespasian. At some point, Plutarch received Roman citizenship. His sponsor was Lucius Mestrius Florus, who was an associate of the new emperor Vespasian, as evidenced by his new name, Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus. As a Roman citizen, Plutarch would have been of the equestrian order, he visited Rome some time with Florus, who served also as a historical source for his &quot;Life of Otho&quot;. Plutarch was on familiar terms with a number of Roman nobles, particularly the consulars Quintus Sosius Senecio, Titus Avidius Quietus, and Arulenus Rusticus, all of whom appear in his works. 
Plutarch lived most of his life at Chaeronea, and was initiated into the mysteries of the Greek god Apollo. He probably took part in the Eleusinian Mysteries. During his visit to Rome, he may have been part of a municipal embassy for Delphi: around the same time, Vespasian granted Delphi various municipal rights and privileges. Some time , Plutarch was made one of the two sanctuary priests for the temple of Apollo at Delphi; the site had declined considerably since the classical Greek period. Around the same time in the 90s, Delphi experienced a construction boom, financed by Greek patrons and possible imperial support. There was a portrait bust dedicated to Plutarch for his efforts in helping to revive the Delphic shrines. The portrait of a philosopher exhibited at the exit of the Archaeological Museum of Delphi, dates to the 2nd century; due to its inscription, in the past it had been identified with Plutarch. The man, although bearded, is depicted at a relatively young age: His hair and beard are rendered in coarse volumes and thin incisions. The gaze is deep, due to the heavy eyelids and the incised pupils. A fragmentary hermaic stele &quot;next&quot; to the portrait probably did once bear a portrait of Plutarch, since it is inscribed, &quot;The Delphians, along with the Chaeroneans, dedicated this (image of) Plutarch, following the precepts of the Amphictyony&quot; ( | &quot;).

In addition to his duties as a priest of the Delphic temple, Plutarch was also a magistrate at Chaeronea and he represented his home town on various missions to foreign countries during his early adult years. Plutarch held the office of archon in his native municipality, probably only an annual one which he likely served more than once. Plutarch was epimeletes (manager) of the Amphictyonic League for at least five terms, from 107 to 127, in which role he was responsible for organising the Pythian Games. He mentions this service in his work, &quot;Whether an Old Man Should Engage in Public Affairs&quot; (17 = &quot;Moralia&quot; 792f). The &quot;Suda&quot;, a medieval Greek encyclopedia, states that Trajan made Plutarch procurator of Illyria; most historians consider this unlikely, since Illyria was not a procuratorial province. According to the 8th/9th-century historian George Syncellus, late in Plutarch&#x27;s life, Emperor Hadrian appointed him nominal procurator of Achaea – which entitled him to wear the vestments and ornaments of a consul.

Plutarch and his wife, Timoxena, had at least four sons and one daughter, although two died in childhood. A letter is still extant, addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not to grieve too much at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother, which also mentions the loss of a young son, Chaeron. Two sons, named Autoboulos and Plutarch, appear in a number of Plutarch&#x27;s works; Plutarch&#x27;s treatise on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; is dedicated to them. It is likely that a third son, named Soklaros after Plutarch&#x27;s confidant Soklaros of Tithora, survived to adulthood as well, although he is not mentioned in Plutarch&#x27;s later works; a Lucius Mestrius Soclarus, who shares Plutarch&#x27;s Latin family name, appears in an inscription in Boeotia from the time of Trajan. Traditionally, the surviving catalog of Plutarch&#x27;s works is ascribed to another son, named Lamprias after Plutarch&#x27;s grandfather; most modern scholars believe this tradition is a later interpolation. His family remained in Greece down to at least the fourth century, producing a number of philosophers and authors. Apuleius, author of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, made his fictional protagonist a descendant of Plutarch.

It is not known in which year Plutarch died. Gregory Crane estimates that he died 125, while the 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica estimates that he died 120. As of the 21st century, Encyclopædia Britannica gives Plutarch&#x27;s death year as &quot;after 119&quot;.

==Works==
===&quot;Parallel Lives&quot;===

Plutarch&#x27;s best-known work is the &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, a series of biographies of illustrious Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues and vices, thus it being more of an insight into human nature than a historical account. As is explained in the opening paragraph of his &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;, Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men. Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments. He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw parallels between physical appearance and moral character.

The surviving &quot;Lives&quot; contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek life and one Roman life, as well as four unpaired single lives. Some of the &quot;Lives&quot;, such as those of Heracles, Philip II of Macedon, Epaminondas, Scipio Africanus, Scipio Aemilianus and possibly Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus no longer exist; many of the remaining &quot;Lives&quot; are truncated, contain obvious lacunae or have been tampered with by later writers. 

Extant &quot;Lives&quot; include those on Solon, Themistocles, Aristides, Agesilaus II, Pericles, Alcibiades, Nicias, Demosthenes, Pelopidas, Philopoemen, Timoleon, Dion of Syracuse, Eumenes, Alexander the Great, Pyrrhus of Epirus, Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Coriolanus, Theseus, Aemilius Paullus, Tiberius Gracchus, Gaius Gracchus, Gaius Marius, Sulla, Sertorius, Lucullus, Pompey, Julius Caesar, Cicero, Cato the Elder, Cato the Younger, Mark Antony, and Marcus Junius Brutus.

====&quot;Life of Alexander&quot;====

Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Alexander&quot;, written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great. It includes anecdotes and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarch&#x27;s portrait of Numa Pompilius, the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early Roman calendar. Plutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander&#x27;s drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth. He also draws extensively on the work of Lysippos, Alexander&#x27;s favourite sculptor, to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror&#x27;s physical appearance. When it comes to his character, Plutarch emphasizes his unusual degree of self-control and scorn for luxury: &quot;He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory.&quot; As the narrative progresses, the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury. The murder of Cleitus the Black, which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end.

====&quot;Life of Caesar&quot;====
Together with Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, and Caesar&#x27;s own works &quot;de Bello Gallico&quot; and &quot;de Bello Civili&quot;, the &quot;Life of Caesar&quot; is the main account of Julius Caesar&#x27;s feats by ancient historians. Plutarch starts by telling of the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss Cinna&#x27;s daughter, Cornelia. Other important parts are those containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar&#x27;s capacity of inspiring the soldiers.

Plutarch&#x27;s life shows few differences from Suetonius&#x27; work and Caesar&#x27;s own works (see &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; and &quot;De Bello Civili&quot;). Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works. In the final part of this life, Plutarch recounts details of Caesar&#x27;s assassination. It ends by telling the destiny of his murderers, just after a detailed account of the scene when a phantom appeared to Brutus at night.

====&quot;Life of Pyrrhus&quot;====
Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pyrrhus&quot; is a key text because it is the main historical account on Roman history for the period from 293 to 264 BCE, for which both Dionysius&#x27; and Livy&#x27;s texts are lost.

===&quot;Moralia&quot;===

The remainder of Plutarch&#x27;s surviving work is collected under the title of the &quot;Moralia&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;Customs and Mores&quot;). It is an eclectic collection of seventy-eight essays and transcribed speeches, including &quot;Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon&quot; (a dialogue on the possible causes for such an appearance and a source for Galileo&#x27;s own work), &quot;On Fraternal Affection&quot; (a discourse on honour and affection of siblings toward each other), &quot;On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great&quot; (an important adjunct to his Life of the great king), and &quot;On the Worship of Isis and Osiris&quot; (a crucial source of information on ancient Egyptian religion); more philosophical treatises, such as &quot;On the Decline of the Oracles&quot;, &quot;On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance&quot;, and &quot;On Peace of Mind&quot;; and lighter fare, such as &quot;Odysseus and Gryllus&quot;, a humorous dialogue between Homer&#x27;s Odysseus and one of Circe&#x27;s enchanted pigs.

====Pseudepigrapha====

Some editions of the &quot;Moralia&quot; include several works now known to have been falsely attributed to Plutarch. Among these are the &quot;Lives of the Ten Orators&quot;, a series of biographies of the Attic orators based on Caecilius of Calacte; &quot;On the Opinions of the Philosophers&quot;, &quot;On Fate&quot;, and &quot;On Music&quot;. These works are all attributed to a single, unknown author, referred to as &quot;Pseudo-Plutarch&quot;. Pseudo-Plutarch lived sometime between the third and fourth centuries AD. Despite being falsely attributed, the works are still considered to possess historical value.

===Lives of the Roman emperors===
Plutarch&#x27;s first biographical works were the Lives of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Vitellius. These early emperors&#x27; biographies were probably published under the Flavian dynasty or during the reign of Nerva (AD 96–98). Of these, only the Lives of Galba and Otho survive. The Lives of Tiberius and Nero are extant only as fragments, provided by Damascius as well as Plutarch himself, respectively. There is reason to believe that the two Lives still extant, those of Galba and Otho, &quot;ought to be considered as a single work.&quot; Therefore, they do not form a part of the Plutarchian canon of single biographies – as represented by the Life of Aratus of Sicyon and the Life of Artaxerxes II (the biographies of Hesiod, Pindar, Crates and Daiphantus were lost). &quot;Galba-Otho&quot; can be found in the appendix to Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; as well as in various Moralia manuscripts, most prominently in Maximus Planudes&#x27; edition where Galba and Otho appear as &quot;Opera&quot; XXV and XXVI. Thus it seems reasonable to maintain that &quot;Galba-Otho&quot; was from early on considered as an illustration of a moral-ethical approach.

===Lost works===
The lost works of Plutarch are determined by references in his own texts to them and from other authors&#x27; references over time. Parts of the &quot;Lives&quot; and what would be considered parts of the &quot;Moralia&quot; have been lost. The &#x27;Catalogue of Lamprias&#x27;, an ancient list of works attributed to Plutarch, lists 227 works, of which 78 have come down to us. The Romans loved the &quot;Lives&quot;. Enough copies were written out over the centuries so that a copy of most of the lives has survived to the present day, but there are traces of twelve more Lives that are now lost. Plutarch&#x27;s general procedure for the &quot;Lives&quot; was to write the life of a prominent Greek, then cast about for a suitable Roman parallel, and end with a brief comparison of the Greek and Roman lives. Currently, only 19 of the parallel lives end with a comparison, while possibly they all did at one time. Also missing are many of his &quot;Lives&quot; which appear in a list of his writings: those of Hercules, the first pair of &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, Scipio Africanus and Epaminondas, and the companions to the four solo biographies, as well as biographies of important figures such as Augustus, Claudius and Nero. Lost works that would have been part of the &quot;Moralia&quot; include &quot;Whether One Who Suspends Judgment on Everything Is Condemned to Inaction&quot;, &quot;On Pyrrho&#x27;s Ten Modes&quot;, and &quot;On the Difference between the Pyrrhonians and the Academics&quot;.

==Philosophy==

Plutarch was a Platonist, but was open to the influence of the Peripatetics, and in some details even to Stoicism despite his criticism of their principles. He rejected only Epicureanism absolutely. He attached little importance to theoretical questions and doubted the possibility of ever solving them. He was more interested in moral and religious questions.

In opposition to Stoic materialism and Epicurean atheism he cherished a pure idea of God that was more in accordance with Plato. He adopted a second principle (&quot;Dyad&quot;) in order to explain the phenomenal world. This principle he sought, however, not in any indeterminate matter but in the evil world-soul which has from the beginning been bound up with matter, but in the creation was filled with reason and arranged by it. Thus it was transformed into the divine soul of the world, but continued to operate as the source of all evil. He elevated God above the finite world, and thus daemons became for him agents of God&#x27;s influence on the world. He strongly defends freedom of the will, and the immortality of the soul.

Platonic-Peripatetic ethics were upheld by Plutarch against the opposing theories of the Stoics and Epicureans. The most characteristic feature of Plutarch&#x27;s ethics is its close connection with religion. However pure Plutarch&#x27;s idea of God is, and however vivid his description of the vice and corruption which superstition causes, his warm religious feelings and his distrust of human powers of knowledge led him to believe that God comes to our aid by direct revelations, which we perceive the more clearly the more completely that we refrain in &quot;enthusiasm&quot; from all action; this made it possible for him to justify popular belief in divination in the way which had long been usual among the Stoics.

His attitude to popular religion was similar. The gods of different peoples are merely different names for one and the same divine Being and the powers that serve it. The myths contain philosophical truths which can be interpreted allegorically. Thus, Plutarch sought to combine the philosophical and religious conception of things and to remain as close as possible to tradition. Plutarch was the teacher of Favorinus.

Plutarch was a vegetarian, although how long and how strictly he adhered to this diet is unclear. He wrote about the ethics of meat-eating in two discourses in &quot;Moralia&quot;.

==Influence==
There are multiple translations of &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; into Latin, most notably the one titled &quot;Pour le Dauphin&quot; (French for &quot;for the Prince&quot;) written by a scribe in the court of Louis XV of France and a 1470 Ulrich Han translation. In 1519, Hieronymus Emser translated &quot;De capienda ex inimicis utilitate&quot; (&quot;wie ym eyner seinen veyndt nutz machen kan&quot;, Leipzig). The biographies were translated by Gottlob Benedict von Schirach (1743–1804) and printed in Vienna by Franz Haas (1776–1780). Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; and &quot;Moralia&quot; were translated into German by Johann Friedrich Salomon Kaltwasser.

===France and England===
Plutarch&#x27;s writings had an enormous influence on English and French literature. 

Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; draw extensively on Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; and are consciously modelled on the Greek&#x27;s easygoing and discursive inquiries into science, manners, customs and beliefs. &quot;Essays&quot; contains more than 400 references to Plutarch and his works. 

Jacques Amyot&#x27;s translations brought Plutarch&#x27;s works to French readers. He went to Italy and studied the Vatican text of Plutarch, from which he published a French translation of the &quot;Lives&quot; in 1559 and &quot;Moralia&quot; in 1572, which were widely read by educated Europe. Amyot&#x27;s translations had as deep an impression in England as France, because Sir Thomas North later published his English translation of the &quot;Lives&quot; in 1579 based on Amyot&#x27;s French translation instead of the original Greek. Shakespeare paraphrased parts of Thomas North&#x27;s translation of selected &quot;Lives&quot; in his plays, and occasionally quoted from them verbatim.

The complete &quot;Moralia&quot; was first translated into English from the original Greek by Philemon Holland in 1603. In 1683, John Dryden began a life of Plutarch and oversaw a translation of the &quot;Lives&quot; by several hands and based on the original Greek. This translation has been reworked and revised several times, most recently in the 19th century by the English poet and classicist Arthur Hugh Clough (first published in 1859). One contemporary publisher of this version is Modern Library. Another is &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; in association with the University of Chicago, , 1952, . In 1770, English brothers John and William Langhorne published &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; from the original Greek, with notes critical and historical, and a new life of Plutarch&quot; in 6 volumes and dedicated to Lord Folkestone. Their translation was re-edited by Archdeacon Wrangham in the year 1813.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau quotes from Plutarch in the 1762 &quot;Emile, or On Education&quot;, a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. Rousseau introduces a passage from Plutarch in support of his position against eating meat: You ask me&#x27;, said Plutarch, &#x27;why Pythagoras abstained from eating the flesh of beasts... 

James Boswell quoted Plutarch on writing lives, rather than biographies, in the introduction to his own &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;. 

Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalists were greatly influenced by the &quot;Moralia&quot; and in his glowing introduction to the five-volume, 19th-century edition, he called the &quot;Lives&quot; &quot;a bible for heroes&quot;.

Other admirers included Ben Jonson, Alexander Hamilton, John Milton, Edmund Burke, Joseph De Maistre, Mark Twain, Louis L&#x27;amour, and Francis Bacon, as well as such disparate figures as Cotton Mather and Robert Browning. Plutarch&#x27;s influence declined in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it remains embedded in the popular ideas of Greek and Roman history.
