<text>The [[Afghan Liturgical Quire]], the oldest known siddur in the world. From the 8th century
A siddur ( &quot;sīddūr&quot;, ; plural siddurim ) is a Jewish prayer book containing a set order of daily prayers. The word comes from the Hebrew root , meaning &#x27;order.&#x27;

Other terms for prayer books are &quot;tefillot&quot; () among Sephardi Jews, &quot;tefillah&quot; among German Jews, and &quot;tiklāl&quot; () among Yemenite Jews.

==History==
The earliest parts of Jewish prayer books are the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; (&quot;Hear O Israel&quot;) (Deuteronomy 6:4 &quot;et seq&quot;) and the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which are in the Torah. A set of eighteen (currently nineteen) blessings called the &quot;Shemoneh Esreh&quot; or the &quot;Amidah&quot; (Hebrew, &quot;standing [prayer]&quot;), is traditionally ascribed to the Great Assembly in the time of Ezra, at the end of the biblical period.

The name &quot;Shemoneh Esreh&quot;, literally &quot;eighteen&quot;, is a historical anachronism, since it now contains nineteen blessings. It was only near the end of the Second Temple period that the eighteen prayers of the weekday Amidah became standardized. Even at that time their precise wording and order was not yet fixed, and varied from locale to locale. Many modern scholars believe that parts of the Amidah came from the Hebrew apocryphal work Ben Sira.

According to the Talmud, soon after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem a formal version of the Amidah was adopted at a rabbinical council in Yavne, under the leadership of Gamaliel II and his colleagues. However, the precise wording was still left open. The order, general ideas, opening and closing lines were fixed. Most of the wording was left to the individual reader. It was not until several centuries later that the prayers began to be formally fixed. By the Middle Ages the texts of the prayers were nearly fixed, and in the form in which they are still used today, albeït with significant variations across communities.

The Siddur was printed by Soncino in Italy as early as 1486, though a Siddur was first mass-distributed only in 1865. The Siddur began appearing in the vernacular as early as 1538. The first English translation was published in London in 1738 by an author writing under the pseudonym Gamaliel ben Pedahzur; a different translation was released in the United States in 1837.

===Creation===
Readings from the Torah (five books of Moses) and the Nevi&#x27;im (&quot;Prophets&quot;) form part of the prayer services. To this framework various Jewish sages added, from time to time, various prayers, and, for festivals especially, numerous hymns.

The earliest existing codification of the prayerbook was drawn up by Amram ben Sheshna of Sura Academy in Sawad, the Abbasid Caliphate, an area known as &quot;Babylonia&quot; in Jewish texts, about 850 CE (&quot;Seder Rav ʿAmram&quot;). Half a century later, Saadia Gaon, also of Sura, composed a siddur (see Siddur of Saadia Gaon), in which the rubrical matter is in Judeo-Arabic. These were the basis of Simhah ben Samuel of Vitry&#x27;s 11th century &quot;Machzor Vitry&quot;, which was based on the ideas of his teacher, Rashi. Another formulation of the prayers was that appended by Maimonides to the Book of Love in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;: this forms the basis of the Yemenite liturgy, and has had some influence on other rites. From this point forward all Jewish prayerbooks had the same basic order and contents.

Two authoritative versions of the Ashkenazi siddur were those of Shabbetai Sofer in the 16th century and Seligman Baer in the 19th century; siddurim have also been published reflecting the views of Jacob Emden and the Vilna Gaon.

===Different Jewish rites===
There are differences among, amongst others, the Sephardic (including Spanish and Portuguese and Mizrachim), Teimani (Yemenite), Hasidic, Ashkenazic (divided into German, Polish and other European and eastern-European rites), Bené Roma or Italkim, Romaniote (Greek, once extending to Turkey, Crimea and the southern Italian peninsula) and also Persian, Kurdish, Bukharian, Georgian, Mountain Jewish, Ethiopian and Cochin-Jewish liturgies. Most of these are slight differences in the wording of the prayers; for instance, Oriental Sephardic and some Hasidic prayer books state &quot;חננו מאתך חכמה בינה ודעת&quot;, &quot;Graciously bestow upon us from You wisdom (&quot;ḥochmah&quot;), understanding (&quot;binah&quot;) and knowledge (&quot;daat&quot;)&quot;, in allusion to the Kabbalistic sefirot of those names, while the Nusach Ashkenaz, as well as Western Sephardic and other Hasidic versions retain the older wording &quot;חננו מאתך דעה בינה והשכל&quot;, &quot;Graciously bestow upon us from You knowledge, understanding, and reason&quot;. In some cases, however, the order of the preparation for the Amidah is drastically different, reflecting the different halakhic and kabbalistic formulae that the various scholars relied on in assembling their prayer books, as well as the minhagim, or customs, or their locales.

Some forms of the Sephardic rite are considered to be very overtly kabbalistic, depending on how far they reflect the ritual of Isaac Luria (see Lurianic Kabbalah). This is partly because the Tetragrammaton frequently appears with varying vowel points beneath the letters (unpronounced, but to be meditated upon) and different Names of God appear in small print within the final hei (ה) of the Tetragrammaton. In some editions, there is a Psalm in the preparations for the Amidah that is printed in the outline of a menorah, and the worshipper meditates on this shape as he recites the psalm.

While the Ashkenazic rite does contain some kabbalistic elements, such as acrostics and allusions to the sefirot (&quot;To You, God, is the greatness [gedullah], and the might [gevurah], and the glory [tiferet], longevity [netzach]...&quot; etc.), these are not easily seen unless the reader is already initiated. It is notable that although many other traditions avoid using the poem Anim Zemiroth on the Sabbath, for fear that its holiness would be less appreciated due to the frequency of the Sabbath, the poem is usually sung by Ashkenazi congregations before concluding the Sabbath Musaf service with the daily psalm. The ark is opened for the duration of the song.

Hasidim, though usually ethnically Ashkenazi, usually use liturgies with varying degrees of Sephardic influence, such as Nusach Sefard and Nusach Ari, in order to follow the order of the prayers set by Rabbi Isaac Luria, often called &quot;Ari HaKadosh&quot;, or &quot;The Holy Lion&quot;. Although the Ari himself was born Ashkenazi, he borrowed many elements from Sephardi and other traditions, since he felt that they followed Kabbalah and Halacha more faithfully. The Ari did not publish any siddur, but orally transmitted his particular usages to his students with interpretations and certain meditations. Many siddurim containing some form of the Sephardic rite together with the usages of the Ari were published, both by actual Sephardic communities and for the use of Hasidim and other Ashkenazim interested in Kabbalah. In 1803, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi compiled an authoritative siddur from the sixty siddurim that he checked for compliance with Hebrew grammar, Jewish law, and Kabbalah: some call this siddur &quot;Nusach Ari&quot;, and is used by Lubavitch Hasidim. Those that use Nusach HaAri claim that it is an all-encompassing nusach that is valid for any Jew, no matter what his ancestral tribe or identity, a view attributed to the Maggid of Mezeritch.

The Mahzor of each rite is distinguished by hymns (&quot;piyyutim&quot;). The most important writers are Jose ben Jose, probably in the 4th-5th century CE, chiefly known for his compositions for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; Yannai; Eleazar Kalir, the founder of the payyetanic style, perhaps in the 7th century; Saadia Gaon; the Spanish school, consisting of Joseph ibn Abitur (died in 970), ibn Gabirol, Isaac Gayyath, Moses ibn Ezra, Abraham ibn Ezra and Judah ha-Levi, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides) and Isaac Luria; and the Ashkenazic and French schools including Shimon bar Yitzchak, Meir bar Yitzchak and many others.

The Ari recited only early piyyutim, such as those by Eleazar Kalir, but did not like the Sephardic piyyutim. Therefore, on holidays he would daven (recite the prescribed liturgical prayers) with Ashkenazim -- as opposed to his practice the rest of the year to daven with Sephardim -- in order to recite their piyyutim, which include many more earlier piyyutim. For this reason, many Hasidim (such Belz and Viznitz) recite many piyyutim on Yom Tov and the sabbaths of the four special portions preceding Passover in accordance with the practice of the Ari. However, in Sephardic communities which accepted most of the practices of the Ari, they never accepted the Ashkenazic piyyutim.

==Complete and weekday siddurim==

Some siddurim have only prayers for weekdays; others have prayers for weekdays and Shabbat. Many have prayers for weekdays, Shabbat, and the three Biblical festivals, Sukkot (the feast of Tabernacles), Shavuot (the feast of weeks) and Pesach (Passover). The latter are referred to as a &quot;Siddur Shalem&quot; (&quot;complete siddur&quot;).

==Variations and additions on holidays==

* There are many additional liturgical variations and additions to the siddur for the &quot;Yamim Noraim&quot; (The &quot;Days of Awe&quot;; High Holy Days, i.e. &quot;Rosh HaShanah&quot; and &quot;Yom Kippur&quot;). As such, a special siddur has developed for just this period, known as a &quot;mahzor&quot; (also: &quot;machzor&quot;). The &quot;mahzor&quot; contains not only the basic liturgy, but also many &quot;piyyutim&quot;, Hebrew liturgical poems. Sometimes the term &quot;mahzor&quot; is also used for the prayer books for the Three Pilgrimage Festivals, Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot.
* On &quot;Tisha b&#x27;Av&quot;, a special siddur is used that includes the text of the Book of Lamentations, the Torah and Haftarah readings for that day, and &quot;Kinnot&quot; or special mournful piyyutim for that day. This siddur is usually called &quot;Kinot&quot; as well. Traditionally, every year many Jews hope that the Messiah will come and the Third Temple will be rebuilt, so &quot;Tisha b&#x27;Av&quot; will not happen again. So after the fast ends, many traditions place their &quot;Kinot&quot; siddurim in a &quot;geniza&quot;, or a burial place for sacred texts.

==Popular siddurim==

====Hasidic or Nusach Sefard Siddurim====
* Seder Hatefillah, Zolkeve 1781. This is the siddur of the Kloyze in Brod, and is arguably the first Nusach Sefard siddur.
* &quot;Siddur Tefilah Yesharah,&quot; first published circa 1800, was later reprinted with the early Hasidic commentary &quot;Keser Nehora&quot; by Rabbi Aharon Hakohen (Katz) of Zhelichov. This became known as the &quot;Berditchever Siddur.&quot; (The commentary received approbations from early Hasidic luminaries Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev, the Maggid of Kozhnitz, the Seer of Lublin, and the non-Hasidic Chief Rabbi of Lublin.) The Berditchever Siddur has been reprinted many times, more recently by Rabbi Meir Yechezkel Weiner (Jerusalem 2011) and Pe’er (Kiryas Joel 2015).
* &quot;Beis Aharon V&#x27;Yisrael&quot; is the second published siddur ever produced by Karliner Chassidim. It superseded &quot;Siddur Beis Aharon V&#x27;Yisrael&quot; published by Rebbe Yochanan Perlow (1900–1956).
* &quot;The Breslov Siddur&quot; published in a 2014 hardcover edition (828 pages in length) is one of the few Hasidic siddurim available in an English language translation (and contains the original text). Translated by Avraham Sutton and Chaim Kramer. Y. Hall is the editor. 
* &quot;Siddur Tehillat HaShem&quot; (the version currently used by Chabad), available in a Hebrew-English version. Also available in Hebrew-Russian and Hebrew-German as well as in Hebrew-French, Hebrew-Spanish and Hebrew only.
* &quot;Siddur Torah Or&quot; (a previous edition of the Chabad siddur).
* &quot;Siddur Tefillah La-El Chayi&quot; (Hebrew-English siddur released in 2014 with commentary based on the teachings of Nachman of Breslov)
* Many publishing houses have Nusach Sefard versions of the siddur, including (among others) ArtScroll, Tefillat Kol Peh, Koren-Sacks and Rinat Yisrael. However, a number of Hasidic groups have published their own variations of Nusach Sefard, including the communities of Spinka, Bobov, Munkatch, Slonim, Vizhnitz, Biala and Boston (who use the nusach of the Berditchever Siddur with a few minor variations). Many Hasidim follow a unique version of Nusach Sefard - for example, all of the branches of Chernobyl hasidim recite ויקרב קץ משיחיה in the Kaddish. In Belz and Dushinsky, the Shemoneh Esrei (except for kedusha and a few other minor changes) is recited similarly to the Ashkenazic rite.

These siddurim follow the halakha of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (1920–2013) a Talmudic scholar, and authority on Jewish religious law, and spiritual leader of Israel&#x27;s ultra-orthodox Shas party. Yosef believed that the Sephardic halakhic tradition favoured leniency, and these principles are reflected in his siddurim.

===Yemenite Jews (Teimanim)===
====Baladi====
The Baladi Jews (from Arabic &quot;balad&quot;, country) follow the legal rulings of the &quot;Rambam&quot; (Maimonides) as codified in his work the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. Rabbi Yiḥye Tsalaḥ (Maharits) revised this liturgy to end friction between traditionalists (who followed Rambam&#x27;s rulings and the siddur as it developed in Yemen) and Kabbalists who followed the innovations of the Ari. This prayer book makes very few additions or changes and substantially follows the older Yemenite tradition as it had existed prior to this conflict.

====Shami====
The Shami Jews (from Arabic &quot;ash-Sham&quot;, the north, referring to Palestine or Damascus) represent those who accepted the Sephardic rite, after being exposed to new inexpensive, typeset prayer books brought from Israel and the Sephardic diaspora by envoys and merchants in the late 17th century and 18th century. The &quot;local rabbinic leadership resisted the new versions...Nevertheless, the new prayer books were widely accepted.&quot; As part of that process, the Shami modified their rites to accommodate the usages of the Ari to the maximum extent. The text of the Shami siddur now largely follows the Sephardic tradition, though the pronunciation, chant and customs are still Yemenite in flavour.

===Jewish Renewal===

* &quot;Sh&#x27;ma&#x27;: A Concise Weekday Siddur For Praying in English&quot; by Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2010.

==Feminist siddurim==
* &quot;Siddur Nashim: a Sabbath prayerbook for women&quot; by Naomi Janowitz and Margaret Moers Wenig; 1976. 
* &quot;Siddur Birkat Shalom&quot; by the Havurat Shalom Siddur Project; Havurat Shalom, 1991.

&quot;Siddur Nashim&quot;, by Margaret Wenig and Naomi Janowitz in 1976, was the first Jewish prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery.

Reconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (&quot;Reform Judaism&quot;, Winter 1991) commented:
Following in the footsteps of feminist prayerbooks, liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement&#x27;s &quot;Siddur Lev Chadash&quot; (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement&#x27;s &quot;Forms of Prayer&quot; (2008). In Mishkan T&#x27;filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as &quot;He&quot; have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah).

==Humanistic and atheist siddurim==
* &quot;Celebration: A Ceremonial and Philosophic Guide for Humanists and Humanistic Jews&quot; by Sherwin T. Wine; Prometheus Books, 1988
* &quot;A Humanistic Siddur of Spirituality and Meaning&quot; by David Rabeeya; Xlibris Corporation, 2005
* &quot;Liturgical Experiments: A Siddur for the Sceptical&quot; in Hebrew, by Tzemah Yoreh (2010?)
Yoreh writes about his work: &quot;I think prayer is communal and private expression of hopes, fears, an appreciation of aesthetic beauty, good attributes. But that has nothing to do with God.&quot;

==Other siddurim==
There are also some Karaite, Samaritan and Sabbatean prayer books.

<text>Santorini (, ), officially Thira (, ) or Thera, is a Greek island in the southern Aegean Sea, about southeast from the mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago formed by the Santorini caldera. It is the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately and a 2021 census population of 15,480. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi, Anydros, and Christiana. The total land area is . Santorini is part of the Thira regional unit.

It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The volcanic arc is approximately long and wide. The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri. One of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history struck the island about 3,600 years ago, leaving a large water-filled caldera surrounded by deep volcanic ash deposits.

== Names ==
Santorini was named by the Latin Empire in the thirteenth century, and is a reference to Saint Irene, from the name of the old church in the village of Perissa – the name Santorini is a contraction of the name Santa Irini. Before then, it was known as Kallístē (, &quot;the most beautiful one&quot;), Strongýlē (, &quot;the circular one&quot;), or Thēra. The ancient name &quot;Thera&quot;, for Theras, the leader of the Spartans who colonized and gave his name to the island, was revived in the nineteenth century as the official name of the island and its main city, but the colloquial &quot;Santorini&quot; is still in popular use.

== History ==
=== Minoan Akrotiri ===
The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption, sometimes called the Thera eruption, which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization. The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of metres deep. It has been suggested that the colossal Santorini volcanic eruption is the source of the legend of the lost civilisation of Atlantis. The eruption lasted for weeks and caused massive tsunami waves.

The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri.

Excavations starting in 1967 at the Akrotiri site under Spyridon Marinatos have made Thera (not known by this name at the time) the best-known Minoan site outside Crete, homeland of the culture. Only the southern tip of a large town has been uncovered, yet it has revealed complexes of multi-level buildings, streets, and squares with remains of walls standing as high as eight metres, all entombed in the solidified ash of the famous eruption of Thera. The site was not a palace-complex as found in Crete nor was it a conglomeration of merchant warehousing. Its excellent masonry and fine wall-paintings reveal a complex community. A loom-workshop suggests organized textile weaving for export. This Bronze Age civilization thrived between 3000 and 2000 BC, reaching its peak in the period between 2000 and 1630 BC.

Many of the houses in Akrotiri are major structures, some of them three storeys high. Its streets, squares, and walls, sometimes as tall as eight metres, indicated that this was a major town; much is preserved in the layers of ejecta. The houses contain huge ceramic storage jars (pithoi), mills, and pottery, and many stone staircases are still intact. Noted archaeological remains found in Akrotiri are wall paintings or frescoes that have kept their original colour well, as they were preserved under many metres of volcanic ash. Judging from the fine artwork, its people were sophisticated and relatively wealthy. Among more complete frescoes found in one house are two antelopes painted with a confident calligraphic line, a man holding fish strung by their gills, a flotilla of pleasure boats that are accompanied by leaping dolphins, and a scene of women sitting in the shade of light canopies. Fragmentary wall-paintings found at one site are Minoan frescoes that depict &quot;saffron-gatherers&quot; offering crocus-stamens to a seated woman, perhaps a goddess important to the Akrotiri culture. The themes of the Akrotiri frescoes show no relationship to the typical content of the Classical Greek décor of 510 BC to 323 BC that depicts the Greek pantheon deities.

The town also had a highly developed drainage system. Pipes with running water and water closets found at Akrotiri are the oldest such utilities discovered. The pipes run in twin systems, indicating that Therans used both hot and cold water supplies. The origin of the hot water they circulated in the town probably was geothermal, given the volcano&#x27;s proximity.

The well preserved ruins of the ancient town are often compared to the spectacular ruins at Pompeii in Italy. The canopy covering the ruins collapsed in September 2005, killing one tourist and injuring seven; the site was closed until April 2012 while a new canopy was built.

The oldest signs of human settlement are Late Neolithic (4th millennium BC or earlier), but c. 2000–1650 BC Akrotiri developed into one of the Aegean&#x27;s major Bronze Age ports, with recovered objects that came not just from Crete, but also from Anatolia, Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt, as well as from the Dodecanese and the Greek mainland.

==== Dating of the Bronze Age eruption ====


The Minoan eruption provides a fixed point for the chronology of the second millennium BC in the Aegean, because evidence of the eruption occurs throughout the region and the site itself contains material culture from outside. The eruption occurred during the &quot;Late Minoan IA&quot; period of Minoan chronology at Crete and the &quot;Late Cycladic I&quot; period in the surrounding islands.

Archaeological evidence, based on an established chronology of Bronze Age Mediterranean cultures, dated the eruption to around 1500 BC. These dates, however, conflict with radiocarbon dating which indicated that the eruption occurred between 1645–1600 BC, and tree ring data which yielded a date of 1628 BC. For those, and other reasons, the previous culturally based chronology has generally been questioned.

=== Ancient period ===


Santorini remained unoccupied throughout the rest of the Bronze Age, during which time the Greeks took over Crete. At Knossos, in a LMIIIA context (14th century BC), seven Linear B texts while calling upon &quot;all the deities&quot; make sure to grant primacy to an elsewhere-unattested entity called &quot;qe-ra-si-ja&quot; and, once, &quot;qe-ra-si-jo&quot;. If the endings &quot;&quot; and &quot;-ios&quot; represent an ethnic suffix, then this means &quot;The One From &quot;. If the initial consonant were aspirated, then *Qhera- would have become &quot;Thera-&quot; in later Greek. &quot;Therasia&quot; and its ethnikon &quot;Therasios&quot; are both attested in later Greek; and, since &quot;-sos&quot; was itself a genitive suffix in the Aegean Sprachbund, *Qeras[os] could also shrink to *Qera. If &quot;qe-ra-si-ja&quot; was an ethnikon first, then in following the entity the Cretans also feared whence it came.

Probably after what is called the Bronze Age collapse, Phoenicians founded a site on Thera. Herodotus reports that they called the island Callista and lived on it for eight generations. In the ninth century BC, Dorians founded the main Hellenic city on Mesa Vouno, above sea level. This group later claimed that they had named the city and the island after their leader, Theras. Today, that city is referred to as Ancient Thera.

In his &quot;Argonautica&quot;, written in Hellenistic Egypt in the third century BC, Apollonius Rhodius includes an origin and sovereignty myth of Thera being given by Triton in Libya to the Greek Argonaut Euphemus, son of Poseidon, in the form of a clod of dirt. After carrying the dirt next to his heart for several days, Euphemus dreamt that he nursed the dirt with milk from his breast, and that the dirt turned into a beautiful woman with whom he had sex. The woman then told him that she was a daughter of Triton named Calliste, and that when he threw the dirt into the sea it would grow into an island for his descendants to live on. The poem goes on to claim that the island was named Thera after Euphemus&#x27; descendant Theras, son of Autesion, the leader of a group of refugee settlers from Lemnos.

The Dorians have left a number of inscriptions incised in stone, in the vicinity of the temple of Apollo, attesting to pederastic relations between the authors and their lovers (eromenoi). These inscriptions, found by Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen, have been thought by some archaeologists to be of a ritual, celebratory nature, because of their large size, careful construction and – in some cases – execution by craftsmen other than the authors. According to Herodotus, following a drought of seven years, Thera sent out colonists who founded a number of cities in northern Africa, including Cyrene. In the fifth century BC, Dorian Thera did not join the Delian League with Athens; and during the Peloponnesian War, Thera sided with Dorian Sparta, against Athens. The Athenians took the island during the war, but lost it again after the Battle of Aegospotami. During the Hellenistic period, the island was a major naval base for Ptolemaic Egypt.

=== Medieval and Ottoman period ===

As with other Greek territories, Thera then was ruled by the Romans. When the Roman Empire was divided, the island passed to the eastern side of the Empire which today is known as the Byzantine Empire. According to George Cedrenus, the volcano erupted again in the summer of 727, the tenth year of the reign of Leo III the Isaurian. He writes: &quot;In the same year, in the summer, a vapour like an oven&#x27;s fire boiled up for days out of the middle of the islands of Thera and Therasia from the depths of the sea, and the whole place burned like fire, little by little thickening and turning to stone, and the air seemed to be a fiery torch.&quot; This terrifying explosion was interpreted as a divine omen against the worship of religious icons and gave the emperor Leo III the Isaurian the justification he needed to begin implementing his Iconoclasm policy.

The name &quot;Santorini&quot; first appears in the work of the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi, as &quot;Santurin&quot;, from the island&#x27;s patron saint, Saint Irene of Thessalonica. After the Fourth Crusade, it was occupied by the Duchy of Naxos which held it up to circa 1280 when it was reconquered by Licario (the claims of earlier historians that the island had been held by Jacopo I Barozzi and his son as a fief have been refuted in the second half of the twentieth century); it was again reconquered from the Byzantines circa 1301 by Iacopo II Barozzi, a member of the Cretan branch of the Venetian Barozzi family, whose descendant held it until it was annexed in by Niccolo Sanudo after various legal and military conflicts. In 1318–1331 and 1345–1360 it was raided by the Turkish principalities of Menteshe and Aydın, but did not suffer much damage. Because of the Venetians the island became home to a sizable Catholic community and is still the seat of a Catholic bishopric.

From the 15th century on, the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice over the island was recognized in a series of treaties by the Ottoman Empire, but this did not stop Ottoman raids, until it was captured by the Ottoman admiral Piyale Pasha in 1576, as part of a process of annexation of most remaining Latin possessions in the Aegean. It became part of the semi-autonomous domain of the sultan&#x27;s Jewish favourite, Joseph Nasi. Santorini retained its privileged position in the 17th century, but suffered in turn from Venetian raids during the frequent Ottoman–Venetian wars of the period, even though there were no Muslims on the island.

Santorini was captured briefly by the Russians under Alexey Orlov during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, but returned to Ottoman control after.

=== 19th century ===

In 1807, the islanders were forced by the Sublime Porte to send 50 sailors to Mykonos to serve in the Ottoman navy.

In 1810, Santorini with 32 ships possessed the seventh largest of the Greek fleet after Kefallinia (118), Hydra (120), Psara (60), Ithaca (38) Spetsai (60) and Skopelos (35).

During the last years of Ottoman rule, the majority of residents were farmers and seafarers who exported their abundant produce, while the level of education was improving on the island, with the Monastery of Profitis Ilias being one of the most important monastic centres in the Cyclades.

In 1821, the island was home to 13,235 inhabitants, which within a year had risen to 15,428.

=== Greek War of Independence ===
As part of its plans to foment a revolt against the Ottoman Empire and gain Greek Independence, Alexandros Ypsilantis, the head of the Filiki Eteria in early 1821, dispatched Dimitrios Themelis from Patmos and Evangelis Matzarakis ( –1824), a sea captain from Kefalonia who had Santorini connections to establish a network of supporters in the Cyclades. As his authority, Matzarakis had a letter from Ypsilantis (dated 29 December 1820) addressed to the notables of Santorini and the Orthodox metropolitan bishop Zacharias Kyriakos (served 1814–1842). At the time, the population of Santorini was divided between those who supported independence, and (particularly among the Catholics and non-Orthodox) those who were ambivalent or distrustful of a revolt being directed by Hydra and Spetses or were fearful of the sultan&#x27;s revenge. While the island didn&#x27;t come out in direct support of the revolt, 71 sailors, a priest and the presbyter Nikolaos Dekazas, to serve on the Spetsiote fleet.

Because of the lack of majority support for direct participation in the revolt, it was necessary for Matzarakis to enlist the aid of Kefalonians living in Santorini to, on 5 May 1821 (the feast day of the patron saint of the island), raise the flag of the revolution and then expel the Ottoman officials from the island. The Provisional Administration of Greece organized the Aegean islands into six provinces, one of which was Santorini and appointed Matzarakis its governor in April 1822. While he was able to raise a large amount of money (double that collected on Naxos), he was soon found to lack the diplomatic skills needed to convince the islanders who had enjoyed considerable autonomy to now accept direction from a central authority and contribute tax revenue to it. He claimed to his superiors that the islanders needed &quot;political re-education&quot; as they did not understand why they had to pay higher taxes than those levied under the Ottomans in order to support the struggle for independence. The hostility against the taxes caused many of the tax collectors to resign.

Things were also not helped by the governor&#x27;s authoritarian character, arbitrariness and arrests of prominent islanders losing him the support of Zacharias Kyriakos, who had initially supported Matzarakis. In retaliation Matzarakis accused him of being a &quot;Turkophile&quot; and had the archbishop imprisoned and then exiled him. The abbots of the monasteries, the priests and the prelates, complained to Demetrios Ypsilantis, president of the National Assembly.

Matzarakis soon had to hire bodyguards as the island descended into open revolt against him. Fearful for his life Matzarakis later fled the island, and was dismissed from his governorship by Demetrios Ypsilantis. Mazarakis however later represented Santorini in the National Assembly and following his death was succeeded in that position in November 1824 by Pantoleon Augerino.

Once they heard of massacres of the Greek population of Chios in April 1822, many islanders became fearful of Ottoman reprisals, with two villages stating they were prepared to surrender, though sixteen monks from the Monastery of Profitis Ilias, led by their abbot Gerasimos Mavrommatis declared in writing their support for the revolt. Four commissioners for the Aegean islands (among them, Benjamin of Lesvos and Konstantinos Metaxas) appointed by the Provisional Administration of Greece arrived in July 1822 to investigate the issues on Santorini. The commissioners were uncompromising in their support for Matzarakis. With news from Chios fresh in their minds the island&#x27;s notables eventually arrested Metaxas, with the intention of handing him over to the Ottomans in order to prove their loyalty. He was rescued by his Ionian guards.

Matters became so heated that Antonios Barbarigos ( –1824) who had been serving in the First National Assembly at Epidaurus since 20 January 1820 was seriously wounded in the head by a knife attack on Santorini in October 1822 during a dispute between the factions. In early 1823, the Second National Assembly at Astros, imposed a contribution of 90,000 grosis on Santorini to fund the fight for independence, while in 1836 they also had to contribute in 1826 to the obligatory loan of 190,000 grosis imposed on the Cyclades.

In decree 573 issued by the National Assembly 17 May 1823, Santorini was recognized as one of 15 provinces in the Greek controlled Aegean (nine in the Cyclades and six in the Sporades).

The island became part of the fledgling Greek state under the London Protocol of 3 February 1830, rebelled against the government of Ioannis Kapodistrias in 1831, and became definitively part of the independent Kingdom of Greece in 1832, with the Treaty of Constantinople.

Santorini joined an insurrection that had broken out in Nafplio on 1 February 1862 against the rule of King Otto of Greece. However, the royal authorities was able to quickly restore control and the revolt had been suppressed by 20 March of that year. However, the unrest arose again later in the year which lead to the 23 October 1862 Revolution and the overthrow of King Otto.

=== World War II ===

During the Second World War, Santorini was occupied in 1941 by Italian forces and then by the Germans following the Italian armistice in 1943. In 1944, the German garrison on Santorini was raided by a group of British Special Boat Service Commandos, killing most of its men. Five locals were later shot in reprisal, including the mayor.

=== Post-war ===
In general, the island&#x27;s economy continued to decline following World War II, with a number of factories closing as a lot of industrial activity relocated to Athens. In an attempt to improve the local economy, the Union of Santorini Cooperatives was established 1947 to process, export and promote the islands agriculture products, in particular its wine. In 1952, they constructed near the village of Monolithos what is today the island&#x27;s only remaining tomato processing factory. The island&#x27;s tourism in the early 1950s generally took the form of small numbers of wealthy tourists on yacht cruises though the Aegean. The island&#x27;s children would present arriving passengers with flowers and bid them happy sailing by lighting small lanterns along the steps from Fira down to the port, offering them a beautiful farewell spectacle. Once such visitor was the actress Olivia de Havilland, who visited the island in September 1955 at the invitation of Petros Nomikos.

In the early 1950s, the shipping magnate Evangelos P. Nomikos and his wife Loula decided to support their birthplace and so asked residents to choose whether they wanted the couple to pay for the construction of either a hotel or a hospital, to which local authorities replied that they would prefer a hotel. As a result, in 1952, the Nomikos&#x27; commissioned the architect Venetsanos to undertake the design and paid for the construction of the Hotel Atlantis, which was at the time the most glamorous hotel in the Cyclades.

In 1954, Santorini had approximately 12,000 inhabitants and very few visitors. The only modes of transport on the island were a jeep, a small bus and the island&#x27;s traditional donkeys and mules.

=== 1956 earthquake ===
At 05:11 a.m. local time on 9 July 1956, an earthquake with a magnitude (depending on the particular study) of 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 or 7.8 struck 30 km south of the island of Amorgos. It was the largest earthquake of the 20th century in Greece and had a devastating impact on Santorini. It was followed by aftershocks, the most significant being the first occurring at 03:24, 13 minutes after the main shock, which had a 7.2 magnitude. This aftershock which originated close to the island of Anafi is believed to have been responsible for most of the damage and casualties on Santorini. The earthquake was accompanied by a tsunami which while much higher at other islands is estimated to have reached 3 metres at Perissa and 2 metres at Vlichada on Santorini.

Immediately following the earthquake, the Greek Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis declared Santorini a state of &quot;large-scale local disaster&quot; and visited the island to inspect the situation on 14 July.

Many countries had offered to send relief efforts, though Greece refused to accept the offer of the United Kingdom to send warships to help from Cyprus where they were involved in the Cyprus Emergency.

As there was no airport the Greek military made air drops of food, tents and supplies, while camps for the homeless were established on the outskirts of Fira.

On Santorini, the earthquakes killed 53 people and injured another 100. 35% of the island&#x27;s houses collapsed and 45% suffered major or minor damage. In total, 529 houses were destroyed, 1,482 were severely damaged and 1,750 lightly damaged. Almost all public buildings were completely destroyed. One of the largest buildings that survived unscathed was the newly built Hotel Atlantis, which allowed it to be used as a temporary hospital and to house public services. The greatest damage was experienced on the Western side along the edge of the caldera, especially at Oia, with parts of the ground collapsing into the sea. The damage from the earthquake reduced most of the population to extreme poverty and caused many to leave the island in search of better opportunities with most settling in Athens.

=== 2025 earthquakes ===
Santorini experienced an earthquake swarm in early February 2025. Hundreds of tremors occurred in the Aegean Sea in the vicinity of the island, some measuring up to magnitude 5. They are expected to last for weeks. As a precaution, much of the population of Santorini was evacuated by sea and by air.

During the weekend of 1 and 2 February, more than 200 undersea tremors were detected. The epicenters were primarily in a growing cluster between the islands of Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, Ios and the uninhabited islet of Anydros. Many of the earthquakes registered magnitudes above 4.5 on the Moment magnitude scale. The strongest earthquake of the swarm occurred on 10 February, and measured . While experts determined the earthquakes were tectonic rather than volcanic in nature, the pattern and frequency of seismic activity prompted significant concern among scientists and authorities. Seismologist Manolis Skordylis indicated on public radio that a seismic fault line had been activated with potential to cause an earthquake exceeding magnitude 6.0. Scientists emphasized that the main seismic event might not yet have occurred.

Greek authorities implemented several emergency measures, which included the deployment of emergency crews and a 26-member rescue team with a rescue dog to the region. Schools were closed on Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, and Ios. Access to areas near cliffs was restricted due to increased risk of landslides. In Fira, several gathering points for evacuation were established. Access to shorelines and certain ports, including Santorini&#x27;s old port, was restricted due to tsunami risk, with residents instructed to move inland.

Greece&#x27;s Minister of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Vasilis Kikilias emphasized the precautionary nature of the response. Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who spoke while in Brussels, called for calm while acknowledging the intensity of the earthquake swarm. Hotels were told to drain their swimming pools to minimize potential earthquake damage to structures. Aegean Airlines doubled its flight frequency between Athens and Santorini for a two-day period to carry out evacuations. Ferry companies increased their service frequency in response to surging demand, resulting in long queues forming at evacuation ports. Around 6,000 residents left the island by ferry beginning on 2 February, while up to 2,700 left by air from 3 to 4 February. The South Aegean Regional Fire Department was placed on general alert. A state of emergency was declared in Santorini by the Greek government on 6 February.

In Turkey, the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) and the Mineral Research and Exploration General Directorate (MTA) warned that the earthquakes could lead to volcanic activity around the Kolumbo submarine volcano off Santorini.

=== Tourism ===
The expansion of tourism in recent years has resulted in the growth of the economy and population.&lt;ref name=&quot;FE 2024/07/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Santorini was ranked the world&#x27;s top island by many magazines and travel sites, including the &quot;Travel+Leisure Magazine&quot;, the &quot;BBC&quot;, as well as the &quot;US News&quot;. An estimated 2 million tourists visit annually. Santorini has been emphasising sustainable development and the promotion of special forms of tourism, the organization of major events such as conferences and sport activities.

The island&#x27;s pumice quarries have been closed since 1986, in order to preserve the caldera. In 2007, the cruise ship &quot;MS Sea Diamond&quot; ran aground and sank inside the caldera. As of 2019, Santorini is popular with Asian couples who come to the island to have pre-wedding photos taken against the backdrop of the landscape.
== Geography ==

=== Geological setting ===
The Cyclades are part of a metamorphic complex that is known as the Cycladic Massif. The complex formed during the Miocene and was folded and metamorphosed during the Alpine orogeny around 60 million years ago. Thera is built upon a small non-volcanic basement that represents the former non-volcanic island, which was approximately . The basement rock is primarily composed of metamorphosed limestone and schist, which date from the Alpine Orogeny. These non-volcanic rocks are exposed at Mikros Profititis Ilias, Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, Pyrgos, Monolithos, and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.

The metamorphic grade is a blueschist facies, which results from tectonic deformation by the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. Subduction occurred between the Oligocene and the Miocene, and the metamorphic grade represents the southernmost extent of the Cycladic blueschist belt.

=== Volcanism ===
Volcanism on Santorini is due to the Hellenic subduction zone southwest of Crete. The oceanic crust of the northern margin of the African Plate is being subducted under Greece and the Aegean Sea, which is thinned continental crust. The subduction compels the formation of the Hellenic arc, which includes Santorini and other volcanic centres, such as Methana, Milos, and Kos.

The island is the result of repeated sequences of shield volcano construction followed by caldera collapse. The inner coast around the caldera is a sheer precipice of more than drop at its highest, and exhibits the various layers of solidified lava on top of each other, and the main towns perched on the crest. The ground then slopes outwards and downwards towards the outer perimeter, and the outer beaches are smooth and shallow. Beach sand colour depends on which geological layer is exposed; there are beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colours: such as the Red Beach, the Black Beach and the White Beach. The water at the darker coloured beaches is significantly warmer because the lava acts as a heat absorber.

The area of Santorini incorporates a group of islands created by volcanoes, spanning across Thera, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palea, and Nea Kameni.
Santorini has erupted many times, with varying degrees of explosivity. There have been at least twelve large explosive eruptions, of which at least four were caldera-forming. The most famous eruption is the Minoan eruption, detailed below. Eruptive products range from basalt all the way to rhyolite, and the rhyolitic products are associated with the most explosive eruptions.

The earliest eruptions, many of which were submarine, were on the Akrotiri Peninsula, and active between 650,000 and 550,000 years ago. These are geochemically distinct from the later volcanism, as they contain amphiboles.

Over the past 360,000 years there have been two major cycles, each culminating with two caldera-forming eruptions. The cycles end when the magma evolves to a rhyolitic composition, causing the most explosive eruptions. In between the caldera-forming eruptions are a series of sub-cycles. Lava flows and small explosive eruptions build up cones, which are thought to impede the flow of magma to the surface. This allows the formation of large magma chambers, in which the magma can evolve to more silicic compositions. Once this happens, a large explosive eruption destroys the cone. The Kameni islands in the centre of the lagoon are the most recent example of a cone built by this volcano, with much of them hidden beneath the water.
==== Minoan eruption ====
During the Bronze Age, Santorini was the site of the Minoan eruption, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history. It was centred on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the caldera; the caldera itself was formed several hundred thousand years ago by the collapse of the centre of a circular island, caused by the emptying of the magma chamber during an eruption. It has been filled several times by ignimbrite since then, and the process repeated itself, most recently 21,000 years ago. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcano, then collapsed once more during the Minoan eruption. Before the Minoan eruption, the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring with the only entrance between the islet of Aspronisi and Thera; the eruption destroyed the sections of the ring between Aspronisi and Therasia, and between Therasia and Thera, creating two new channels.

On Santorini, a deposit of white tephra thrown from the eruption is up to thick, overlying the soil marking the ground level before the eruption, and forming a layer divided into three fairly distinct bands indicating different phases of the eruption. Archaeological discoveries in 2006 by a team of international scientists revealed that the Santorini event was much more massive than previously thought; it expelled of magma and rock into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, compared to previous estimates of only in 1991, producing an estimated of tephra. Only the Mount Tambora volcanic eruption of 1815, the 181 AD eruption of the Taupo Volcano, and possibly Baekdu Mountain&#x27;s 946 AD eruption have released more material into the atmosphere during the past 5,000 years.
The Minoan eruption has been considered as possible inspiration for ancient stories including Atlantis and the Exodus. The content of the stories is not supported by current archaeological research, but remain popular in pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology.

==== Post-Minoan volcanism ====
Post-Minoan eruptive activity is concentrated on the Kameni islands, in the centre of the lagoon. They have been formed since the Minoan eruption, and the first of them broke the surface of the sea in 197 BC. Nine subaerial eruptions are recorded in the historical record since that time, with the most recent ending in 1950.

In 1707, an undersea volcano breached the sea surface, forming the current centre of activity at Nea Kameni in the centre of the lagoon, and eruptions centred on it continue – the twentieth century saw three such, the last in 1950. Santorini was also struck by a devastating earthquake in 1956. Although the volcano is dormant at the present time, at the current active crater (there are several former craters on Nea Kameni), steam and carbon dioxide are emitted.

Small tremors and reports of strange gaseous odours over the course of 2011 and 2012 prompted satellite radar technological analyses and these revealed the source of the symptoms; the magma chamber under the volcano was swollen by a rush of molten rock by 10 to 20 million cubic metres between January 2011 and April 2012, which also caused parts of the island&#x27;s surface to rise out of the water by a reported 8 to 14 centimetres. Scientists say that the injection of molten rock was equivalent to 20 years&#x27; worth of regular activity.

At the beginning of February 2025, there were hundreds of minor earthquakes up to magnitude 5 near Santorini, mostly in an area around the tiny islet of Anydros, north-east of Santorini. About 9,000 people left the island out of a population of 15,500 in the face of seismic activity that could last weeks. The tremors were attributed to tectonic plate movements rather than volcanic activity.

== Climate ==
According to the National Observatory of Athens Santorini has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) with Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;) characteristics, such as the dry summers and the relatively wetter winters. It has an average annual precipitation of around and an average annual temperature of around .

== Economy ==
Santorini&#x27;s primary industry is tourism, particularly in the summer months. Agriculture also forms part of its economy, and the island sustains a wine industry. The economic life of Santorini before 1960, when the flow of foreign visitors to the island for tourist purposes gradually began, was based on crops and trade.

=== Agriculture ===

In the middle of the 19th century, Santorini had great commercial activity with foreign countries and especially with Russia, where it exported all of its wine production. Because of its unique ecology and climate – and especially its volcanic ash soil – Santorini is home to unique and prized produce such as the Santorini cherry tomato.
Viticulture, whose history goes back to prehistoric times, could not remain unaffected by the rapid increase in tourism, where there was a gradual decrease. Viticulture is the most important sector of agricultural production in Santorini.

=== Wine industry ===
The island remains the home of a small wine industry, based on the indigenous Assyrtiko grape variety, with auxiliary cultivations of Aegean white varieties such as &quot;Athiri&quot; and &quot;Aidani&quot; and the red varieties such as Mavrotragano and Mandilaria. The vines are extremely old and resistant to phylloxera (attributed by local winemakers to the well-drained volcanic soil and its chemistry), so the vines needed no replacement during the great phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century. In their adaptation to their habitat, such vines are planted far apart, as their principal source of moisture is dew, and they often are trained in the shape of low-spiralling baskets, with the grapes hanging inside to protect them from the winds.

The viticultural pride of the island is the sweet and strong &quot;Vinsanto&quot; (), a dessert wine made from the best sun-dried &quot;Assyrtiko&quot;, &quot;Athiri&quot;, and &quot;Aidani&quot; grapes, and undergoing long barrel aging (up to twenty or twenty-five years for the top &quot;cuvées&quot;). It matures to a sweet, dark, amber-orange unctuous dessert wine that has achieved worldwide fame, possessing the standard Assyrtiko aromas of citrus and minerals, layered with overtones of nuts, raisins, figs, honey, and tea.


White wines from the island are extremely dry with a strong citrus scent and mineral and iodide salt aromas contributed by the ashy volcanic soil, whereas barrel aging gives to some of the white wines a slight frankincense aroma, much like Vinsanto. It is not easy to be a winegrower in Santorini; the hot and dry conditions give the soil a very low productivity. The yield per hectare is only 10 to 20% of the yields that are common in France or California. The island&#x27;s wines are standardised and protected by the &quot;Vinsanto&quot; and &quot;Santorini&quot; OPAP designations of origin.

=== Brewing ===
A brewery, the Santorini Brewing Company, began operating out of Santorini in 2011, based in the island&#x27;s wine region.

== Governance ==
The present municipality of Thera (officially: &quot;Thira&quot;, ), which covers all settlements on the islands of Santorini and Therasia, was formed at the 2011 local government reform, by the merger of the former Oia and Thera municipalities.

Oia is now called a (community), within the municipality of Thera, and it consists of the local subdivisions () of Therasia and Oia.

The municipality of Thera includes an additional 12 local subdivisions on Santorini island: Akrotiri, Emporio, Episkopis Gonia, Exo Gonia, Imerovigli, Karterados, Megalohori, Mesaria, Pyrgos Kallistis, Thera (the seat of the municipality), Vothon, and Vourvoulos.

=== Architecture ===
The traditional architecture of Santorini is similar to that of the other Cyclades, with low-lying cubical houses, made of local stone and whitewashed or limewashed with various volcanic ashes used as colours. These colours, in recent years, tend to replace white in the colour of house façades, according to the traditional architecture of the island as it was developed until the great earthquake of 1956. The unique characteristic is the common use of the &quot;hypóskapha&quot;: extensions of houses dug sideways or downwards into the surrounding pumice. These rooms are prized because of the high insulation provided by the air-filled pumice, and are used as living quarters of unique coolness in the summer and warmth in the winter. These are premium storage space for produce, especially for wine cellaring: the &quot;Kánava&quot; wineries of Santorini.

When strong earthquakes struck the island in 1956, half the buildings were completely destroyed and a large number suffered repairable damage. The underground dwellings along the ridge overlooking the caldera, where the instability of the soil was responsible for the great extent of the damage, needed to be evacuated. Most of the population of Santorini had to emigrate to Piraeus and Athens.

=== Fortifications ===
During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Cyclades were under threat from pirates who plundered the harvests, enslaved men and women and sold them in the slave markets. The small bays of the island were also ideal as hideouts. In response the islanders built their settlements at the highest, most inaccessible points, and very close to, or on top of, each other; while their external walls, devoid of openings, formed a protective perimeter around the village. In addition the following additional types of fortifications were built throughout the island to protect the island&#x27;s inhabitants.
* (castles), also written as kasteli, were large fortified permanent settlements. There were five on the island, Agios Nikolaos (at Oia), Akrotiri, Emborio, Pyrgos, and Skaros. At the entrance to every was a church dedicated to Agia (St.) Theodosia, the Protector-Saint of castles.
* (from the Turkish word which means &#x27;tower&#x27;) were multi-storey, rectangular, and the highest tower of most kastelli. There were four goulas on the island. They were used both as an observatory and as a place of refuge for the islanders. They had thick walls, parapets, an iron gate, murder holes, and embrasures.
* were small coastal watchtowers, which were permanently garrisoned, from where a watch was maintained and an alarm raised when a pirate ship was sighted.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Electricity ===
Electricity for both Santorini and Therasia is principally supplied from the Thira Autonomous Power Station which is located at Monolithos in the eastern part of Santorini. Owned by Public Power Corporation (PPC) it has generators powered by diesel engines and gas turbines. The two islands have a total installed capacity of 75.09 MW of thermal generation and 0.25 MW of renewable generation. There is a programme underway at a cost of €124 million as part of the Cyclades Interconnection Project to connect the island via a submarine cable to Naxos and hence by extension to the mainland system by 2023.

A fire at the power station in Monolithos on 13 August 2018 put it out of service, resulting in a total loss of electricity supply across the two islands. Within four days electricity had been restored to all but 10% of the islands&#x27; consumers. Vessels were dispatched to carry two power generators to assist in supporting the restoration of the electricity supply.

Electricity is distributed around the island by The Hellenic Electricity Distribution System Operator (HEDNO S.A. or DEDDIE S.A.) which is a 100% owned subsidiary of PPC. A cable connects the Thirasia and Santorini electrical distribution systems.

=== Transportation ===
The central bus station is in Fira, the capital of the island, where buses depart very frequently. They cover routes to almost all places around the island and to most tourist spots.

Apart from its connection with other Cyclades islands, Santorini is also connected by ferry with Piraeus on a daily basis all year long, with up to 5 direct crossings during summer.

==== Airport ====
Santorini is one of the few Cyclades Islands with a major airport, which lies about southeast of downtown Thera. The main asphalt runway (16L-34R) is in length, and the parallel taxiway was built to runway specification (16R-34L). It can accommodate Boeing 757, Boeing 737, Airbus A320 series, Avro RJ, Fokker 70, and ATR 72 aircraft. Scheduled airlines include the new Olympic Air, Aegean Airlines, Ryanair, and Sky Express, with flights chartered from other airlines during the summer, and with transport to and from the air terminal available through buses, taxis, hotel car-pickups, and hire cars.

==== Land ====
Bus services link Fira to most parts of the island.

==== Ports ====

Santorini has two ports: Athinios (Ferry Port) and Skala (Old Port). Cruise ships anchor off Skala and passengers are transferred by local boatmen to shore at Skala where Fira is accessed by cable car, on foot or by donkeys and mules. The use of donkeys for tourist transportation has attracted significant criticism from animal rights organisations for animal abuse and neglect, including failure to provide the donkeys with sufficient water or rest. Tour boats depart from Skala for Nea Kameni and other Santorini destinations.

=== Water and sewerage ===
As the island lies in a rain shadow between the mountains of Crete and the Peloponnese water seems to have been scarce at least from post-eruption times. This, combined with the small size of the island, the lack of rivers, and the nature of the soil, which is largely composed of volcanic ash, as well as the high summer temperatures meant that there was very little surface water. With only one spring (Zoodochos Pigi – the Life-giving Spring) this encouraged the practice of diverting any rain that fell on roofs and courtyards to elaborate underground cisterns, supplemented in the 20th century with water imported from other areas of Greece. Owing to the lack of water islanders developed non-irrigated crops such as vines and olives that could survive on only the scant moisture provided by the common early-morning fog condensing on the ground as dew.

Many cisterns ceased to be used following the 1956 earthquake. As tourism increased, the existing rainwater harvesting methods proved incapable of supplying the increased demand. As a result, it has become necessary to construct desalination plants which now provide running but non-potable water to most residents. This has led to many of the historic cisterns falling into disrepair.

The first desalination plant was built at Oia following a donation in 1992 by the Oia-born businessman Aristeidis Alafouzos. By 2003 the plant had expanded to house three desalination units (of which two had been donated by Alafouzos). As of 2020 the plant has six desalination units with a total capacity of per day.

In addition to Oia there are currently desalination plants at Aghia Paraskevi, located on the southwest side of the airport with a capacity of per day which supplies Kamari, Vothonas, Messaria, Exo Gonia, Mesa Gonia, Agia Paraskevi, and Monolithos; Fira with a capacity of per day; Akrotiri (also known as the Cape) which has two units with a total capacity of per day; Exo Gialos which has two units with a total capacity of per day which supplies Fira, Imerovigli, Karteradou, Pyrgos, Megalochori and Vourvoulou; and Therasia which has two TEMAK units with a total capacity of per day.

There are also a number of small autonomous drinking water production units with a capacity of per day located at Kamari, Emporio, Messaria and Thirasia Island.

The provision of water supply and sewage treatment and disposal on both Santorini and Therasia Islands is undertaken by the municipally owned DEYA Thiras. It was founded in May 2011, after the merging of the Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Thera (DEYA Thera) and the Community Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Oia (). Known as DEYATH it is responsible for the planning, construction, management, operation and maintenance of the water supply system (desalination plants and pumping wells), irrigation, drainage, and the wastewater collection networks and treatment plants for the islands of Thira (Santorini) and Therasia. The Loulas and Evangelos Nomikos Foundation has funded a number of projects aimed at improving the water supply and sewage systems on the islands.

<text>Sandler O&#x27;Neill + Partners, L.P., (Sandler O&#x27;Neill) was a full-service investment banking firm and broker-dealer specializing in the financial services sector. It was headquartered in New York City, and had offices in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Atlanta. The firm also operated a mortgage finance company and registered investment adviser based in Memphis.

Sandler O&#x27;Neill provided investment banking services to financial institutions and their investors. Its services include merger and acquisition advisory, capital markets, fixed income sales and trading, and equity sales and trading, equity research, balance sheet management, mortgage finance, and consulting services. The firm publishes research on about 300 financial institutions across the United States. 
Despite shifts in the way similar Wall Street firms are run, Sandler O&#x27;Neill retained its private partnership structure, and was the largest private investment bank dedicated to the financial sector. It ranked among the top advisers on bank and thrift mergers as well as in capital raising.

In 2019, the company was acquired by Piper Jaffray and renamed Piper Sandler Companies. The combined company is headquartered in Minneapolis.

==History==
Sandler O&#x27;Neill + Partners, L.P. was founded in 1988 by Herman S. Sandler, Thomas O’Neill and four other executives from the firm Bear Stearns. Though today it serves companies of all sizes, the firm was founded with an emphasis on community and mid-size banks, as its founders saw that smaller financial institutions were underserved by the existing advisement system.
Six months after the foundation of the firm, Christopher Quackenbush left Merrill Lynch to build Sandler&#x27;s investment banking group. 
Two years after Sandler&#x27;s establishment it formed Sandler O&#x27;Neill Mortgage Finance, an affiliate of Sandler O&#x27;Neill + Partners. The affiliate is currently headquartered in Memphis but maintains an office in New York City separate from the firm&#x27;s headquarters.

In 1993, the company moved to Two World Trade Center (South Tower) from Two Wall Street. The same year, Sandler O&#x27;Neill opened an equity sales and trading division. The following year, the firm began publishing equity research, focusing on community banks and other financial institutions.

Sandler O&#x27;Neill had four satellite offices in addition to its main office in New York City. The first was opened in Boston in 1998. Offices in Atlanta and San Francisco were opened in 2003. A final satellite office was opened in 2004 in Chicago.

The firm ranked among the best performing investment banking firms, advising financial firms on strategic and financial initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions and capital raising. It is one of the last privately held investment banks on Wall Street, after other firms went public, including Goldman Sachs in the early 2000s. In 2010, the firm sold a substantial minority to two private equity firms: the Carlyle Group and Kelso &amp; Company. The firm was led by James J. Dunne III, who left Bear Stearns in 1988 to help found Sandler, and Jonathan Doyle, who joined the firm in 1990. Both served as senior managing principals of the firm. Sandler O&#x27;Neill celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013.

In 2019, the company was acquired by Piper Jaffray, forming Piper Sandler Companies.

On September 11, 2001, the firm, which was headquartered on the 104th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center, lost 68 of its 171 employees, 40 percent of its overall workforce. One third of the firm&#x27;s partners, almost the entire equity desk, the entire syndicate desk, and all of the firm&#x27;s bond traders died during the attack. Among those lost were Herman Sandler and Christopher Quackenbush, two of the three senior executives who managed the firm. Welles Crowther, an equities trader for the firm now known as &quot;The Man in the Red Bandana,&quot; also died during the attack. In addition to personnel, the company lost its entire computer system and nearly all of its records in the destruction.

On September 19, three days after the U.S. financial markets reopened, Dunne said on CNBC that Sandler O&#x27;Neill was open for business, having restarted operations as early as September 12. After the attacks, the firm operated temporarily out of the Solow Building, in space provided by Bank of America. In early 2002, Sandler O&#x27;Neill moved from the Solow Building to 919 Third Avenue. The firm remained in that building until another move in 2012.

<doc id="28380" wikidata="Q8003" url="?curid=28380" title="Sergei Eisenstein">
<text>Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein (11 February 1948) was a Soviet film director, screenwriter, film editor and film theorist. Considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, he was a pioneer in the theory and practice of montage. He is noted in particular for his silent films &quot;Strike&quot; (1925), &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925) and &quot;&quot; (1928), as well as the historical epics &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; (1938) and &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; (1945/1958). In its 2012 decennial poll, the magazine &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; named his &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; the 11th-greatest film of all time.

==Early life==

Sergei Eisenstein was born on in Riga, in the Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire (present-day Latvia), to a middle-class family. His family moved frequently in his early years, as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life. His father, the architect Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein, was born in the Kiev Governorate, to a Jewish merchant father, Osip, and a Swedish mother.

Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s father had converted to the Russian Orthodox Church, while his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, came from a Russian Orthodox family. She was the daughter of a prosperous merchant. Julia left Riga in the year of the 1905 Russian Revolution, taking Sergei with her to Saint Petersburg. Her son would return at times to see his father, who joined them around 1910. Divorce followed, and Julia left the family to live in France. Eisenstein was raised as an Orthodox Christian but later became an atheist. Among the films that influenced Eisenstein as a child was &quot;The Consequences of Feminism&quot; (1906) by the first female filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché.

== Education ==
At the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Eisenstein studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father. In 1918, he left school and joined the Red Army to participate in the Russian Civil War, although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the anti-Bolshevik forces, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success in providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, he was exposed to Kabuki theatre and studied Japanese, learning some 300 kanji characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development.

==Career==
===From theatre to cinema===

Eisenstein moved to Moscow in 1920 and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult, an experimental Soviet artistic institution which aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms and create a revolutionary working-class aesthetic. His productions there were entitled &quot;Gas Masks&quot;, &quot;Listen Moscow&quot;, and &quot;Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man&quot;. He worked as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. Eisenstein began his career as a theorist in 1923 by writing &quot;The Montage of Attractions&quot; for art journal &quot;LEF&quot;. His first film, &quot;Glumov&#x27;s Diary&quot; (for the theatre production &quot;Wise Man&quot;), was also made in that same year with Dziga Vertov hired initially as an instructor.

&quot;Strike&quot; (1925) was Eisenstein&#x27;s first full-length feature film. &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (also 1925) was critically acclaimed worldwide. Mostly owing to this international renown, he was then able to direct &quot;&quot;, as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917, and then &quot;The General Line&quot; (also known as &quot;Old and New&quot;). While critics outside Soviet Russia praised these works, Eisenstein&#x27;s focus in the films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and montage brought him and like-minded others such as Vsevolod Pudovkin and Alexander Dovzhenko under fire from the Soviet film community. This forced him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of socialist realism.

===Travels to western Europe===
In the autumn of 1928, with &quot;October&quot; still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow the three to learn about sound motion pictures and to present themselves as Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zürich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tisse, entitled &quot;Frauennot – Frauenglück&quot;.

===American projects===

In late April 1930, film producer Jesse L. Lasky, on behalf of Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 ($1,500,000 in 2017 dollars) and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930, along with Aleksandrov and Tisse. Eisenstein proposed a biography of arms dealer Basil Zaharoff and a film version of &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, and more fully developed plans for a film of &quot;Sutter&#x27;s Gold&quot; by Blaise Cendrars, but on all accounts failed to impress the studio&#x27;s producers. Paramount proposed a film version of Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;. This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930, but Paramount disliked it and, additionally, they found themselves attacked by Major Pease, president of the Hollywood Technical Director&#x27;s Institute. Pease, a strident anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by &quot;mutual consent&quot;, Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount&#x27;s expense.

Eisenstein was faced with being seen a failure in the USSR. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him; in addition, his films, techniques and theories, such as his formalist film theory, were becoming increasingly attacked as &quot;ideological failures&quot;. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as &quot;Eisenstein on Disney&quot;, have surfaced decades later.

Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with Charlie Chaplin, who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor, the American socialist author Upton Sinclair. Sinclair&#x27;s works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR and were known to Eisenstein. The two admired each other, and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein&#x27;s absences from the USSR and permission for him to travel to Mexico. Eisenstein had long been fascinated by Mexico and had wanted to make a film about the country. As a result of their discussions with Eisenstein and his colleagues, Sinclair, his wife Mary, and three other investors organized as the &quot;Mexican Film Trust&quot; to contract the three Russians to make a film about Mexico of Eisenstein&#x27;s design.

===Mexican odyssey===
On 24 November 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust &quot;upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein&#x27;s artistic integrity.&quot; The contract stipulated that the film would be &quot;non-political&quot;, that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of &quot;not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars&quot;, that the shooting schedule amounted to &quot;a period of from three to four months&quot;, and most importantly that: &quot;Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair...&quot; A codicil to the contract allowed that the &quot;Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.&quot; Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour&#x27;s duration.

By 4 December, Eisenstein was traveling to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse, and also by Mrs. Sinclair&#x27;s brother, Hunter Kimbrough, a banker with no prior experience in motion picture work, who was to serve as production supervisor. At their departure Eisenstein had not yet determined a direction or subject for his film, and only several months later produced a brief outline of a six-part film; this, he promised, would be developed, in one form or another, into a final plan he would settle on for his project. The title for the project, , was decided on some time later still. While in Mexico, he mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera; Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired him to call his films &quot;moving frescoes&quot;. The left-wing U.S. film community eagerly followed his progress within Mexico, as is chronicled within Chris Robe&#x27;s book &quot;Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture&quot;.

Filming was not accomplished in the 3–4 months agreed to in Eisenstein&#x27;s contract, however, and the Trust was running out of money; and his prolonged absence from the USSR led Joseph Stalin to send a telegram to Sinclair expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair&#x27;s younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film&#x27;s problems. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin so that Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. Unable to raise further funds, and under pressure from both the Soviet government and the majority of the Trust, Sinclair shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot; estimates of the extent of this range from 170,000 lineal feet with &quot;Soldadera&quot; unfilmed, to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet. For the unfinished filming of the &quot;novel&quot; of &quot;Soldadera&quot;, without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army.

When Kimbrough arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings by Eisenstein of Jesus caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material, which Eisenstein had added to his luggage without Kimbrough&#x27;s knowledge. His re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair&#x27;s contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month&#x27;s stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, a 30-day &quot;pass&quot; to get from Texas to New York and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.

Eisenstein toured the American South instead of going directly to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of Sol Lesser, who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative — at the Trust&#x27;s expense — and distribute any resulting product. Two short feature films and a short subject—&quot;Thunder Over Mexico,&quot; based on the &quot;Maguey&quot; footage; &quot;Eisenstein in Mexico;&quot; and &quot;Death Day,&quot; respectively—were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called &quot;Time in the Sun&quot;, released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released – with the same name in contravention to the copyright – his own version, which was awarded the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it &quot;Mexican Fantasy&quot;.

===Return to the Soviet Union===

Eisenstein&#x27;s failure in Mexico took a toll on his mental health. He spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933, ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage. He was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the State Institute of Cinematography where he had taught earlier, and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing the curriculum.

In 1935, Eisenstein was assigned another project, &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot;, but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as &quot;¡Que viva México!&quot;. Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines. Boris Shumyatsky, the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Soviet film industry, called a halt to the filming and cancelled further production. What appeared to save Eisenstein&#x27;s career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot; catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein&#x27;s approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of Shumyatsky, who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot.

===Comeback===
Eisenstein was able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for &#x27;one more chance&#x27;, and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; and his victory at the Battle of the Ice, with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to expedite shooting.

The result was a film critically well received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian proverbs, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions. This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented Eisenstein&#x27;s first film in nearly a decade and his first sound film.

Eisenstein returned to teaching, and was assigned to direct Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at the Bolshoi Theatre. After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was re-released with a wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata, where he first considered the idea of making a film about Tsar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma-Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of &quot;War and Peace&quot; that Prokofiev was developing.

===Ivan trilogy===
Eisenstein&#x27;s film &quot;Ivan the Terrible, Part I&quot;, presenting Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, won Stalin&#x27;s approval (and a Stalin Prize), but the sequel, &quot;Ivan the Terrible, Part II&quot;, was criticized by various authorities and went unreleased until 1958. All footage from &quot;Ivan the Terrible, Part III&quot; was confiscated by the Soviet authorities whilst the film was still incomplete, and most of it was destroyed, though several filmed scenes exist.

==Personal life==

There have been debates about Eisenstein&#x27;s sexuality, with a film covering Eisenstein&#x27;s homosexuality running into difficulties in Russia.

Almost all of his contemporaries believed that Eisenstein was gay. During a 1925 interview, Aleksandrov witnessed Eisenstein tell the Polish journalist Waclaw Solski, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in girls&quot; and burst out laughing, then quickly stopped and turned red with embarrassment. Recalling the incident, Solski wrote &quot;Not until later, when I learned what everyone in Moscow knew, did Aleksandrov&#x27;s odd behaviour become understandable.&quot; Upton Sinclair came to the same conclusion after the discovery of Eisenstein&#x27;s pornographic drawings by customs officials. He later told Marie Seton: &quot;All his associates were Trotskyites, and all homos ... Men of that sort stick together.&quot;

Seven months after homosexuality became a criminal offence, Eisenstein married filmmaker and screenwriter Pera Atasheva (born Pearl Moiseyevna Fogelman; 1900 – 24 September 1965). Aleksandrov married Orlova during that same year.

Eisenstein confessed his asexuality to his close friend Marie Seton: &quot;Those who say that I am homosexual are wrong. I have never noticed and do not notice this. If I was homosexual I would say so, directly. But the whole point is that I have never experienced a homosexual attraction, even towards Grisha, despite the fact I have some bisexual tendency in the intellectual dimension like, for example, Balzac or Zola.&quot;

==Death==
Eisenstein suffered a heart attack on 2 February 1946, and spent much of the following year recovering. He died of a second heart attack on 11 February 1948, at the age of 50. His body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers before being cremated on 13 February, and his ashes were buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

==Film theorist==
Eisenstein was among the earliest film theorists. He briefly attended the film school established by Lev Kuleshov and the two were both fascinated with the power of editing to generate meaning and elicit emotion. Their individual writings and films are the foundations upon which Soviet montage theory was built, but they differed markedly in their understanding of its fundamental principles. Eisenstein&#x27;s articles and books—particularly &quot;Film Form&quot; and &quot;The Film Sense&quot;—explain the significance of montage in detail.

His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a &quot;linkage&quot; of related images—as Kuleshov maintained. Eisenstein felt the &quot;collision&quot; of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called &quot;methods of montage&quot;:
# Metric
# Rhythmic
# Tonal
# Overtonal
# Intellectual

With his cross-disciplinary approach, he defined the montage as the constructing act par excellence at the base of every work of art: &quot;the principle of segmentation of the object into different camera cuts&quot;  and the unification in a generalized or complete image is what we can call the peculiarity of montage as constructive process, which &quot;leaves the event intact (the caught reality) and at the same time interprets it differently.&quot;

Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at VGIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors&#x27; course; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭ&#x27;s &quot;Lessons with Eisenstein&quot;. Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;Le Père Goriot.&quot; Another hypothetical was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov&#x27;s &quot;The Black Consul&quot;, influenced as well by John Vandercook&#x27;s &quot;Black Majesty&quot;.

Lessons from this scenario delved into the character of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students&#x27; development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein&#x27;s pedagogy, like his films, was politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin interwoven with his teaching.

In his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used groups as characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting stars. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists, freeing them from the confines of capitalism, leaving them absolutely free to create, but due to the material conditions at the time, budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world.

==Drawings==
Eisenstein kept sketchbooks throughout his life. After his death, his widow, Pera Atasheva, gave most of them to the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI) – but withheld over 500 erotic drawings from the donation. She later passed these drawings to Andrei Moskvin for safekeeping, and after Perestroika, Moskvin&#x27;s heirs sold them abroad. The erotic drawings have been the subject of several exhibitions since the late 1990s. Some are reproduced in Joan Neuberger&#x27;s essay &quot;Strange Circus: Eisenstein&#x27;s Sex Drawings.&quot;

<doc id="28381" wikidata="Q79015" url="?curid=28381" title="Superman">
<text>Superman is a superhero created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in the comic book &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, published in America on April 18, 1938. Superman has been regularly published in American comic books since 1938, and has been adapted to other media including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater, and video games.

Superman was born Kal-El, on the fictional planet Krypton. As a baby, his parents Jor-El and Lara sent him to Earth in a small spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside near the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark began developing superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his powers to benefit humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias &quot;Superman&quot; when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Superman&#x27;s supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, &quot;Daily Planet&quot; photographer Jimmy Olsen, and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include Brainiac, General Zod, and archenemy Lex Luthor.

Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses a codename, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities. Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, it was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up until the 1980s.

==Development==
Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster met in 1932 while attending Glenville High School in Cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction. Siegel aspired to become a writer and Shuster aspired to become an illustrator. Siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories, which he self-published as a magazine called &quot;Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization&quot;. His friend Shuster often provided illustrations for his work. In January 1933, Siegel published a short story in his magazine titled &quot;The Reign of the Superman&quot;. The titular character is a homeless man named Bill Dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug. The drug gives Dunn the powers of mind-reading, mind-control, and clairvoyance. He uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement, but then the drug wears off, leaving him a powerless vagrant again. Shuster provided illustrations, depicting Dunn as a bald man.

Siegel and Shuster shifted to making comic strips, with a focus on adventure and comedy. They wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors, so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors. However, the newspaper editors were not impressed, and told them that if they wanted to make a successful comic strip, it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market. This prompted Siegel to revisit Superman as a comic strip character. Siegel modified Superman&#x27;s powers to make him even more sensational. Like Bill Dunn, the second prototype of Superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist, but instead of psychic abilities, he acquires superhuman strength and bullet-proof skin. Additionally, this new Superman was a crime-fighting hero instead of a villain, because Siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful. In later years, Siegel once recalled that this Superman wore a &quot;bat-like&quot; cape in some panels, but typically he and Shuster agreed there was no costume yet, and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork.

Siegel and Shuster showed this second concept of Superman to Consolidated Book Publishers, based in Chicago. In May 1933, Consolidated had published a comic book titled &quot;Detective Dan: Secret Operative 48&quot;. It contained all-original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips, which was a novelty at the time. Siegel and Shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called &quot;The Superman&quot;. A delegation from Consolidated visited Cleveland that summer on a business trip and Siegel and Shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person. Although Consolidated expressed interest, they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of &quot;Detective Dan&quot; were disappointing.
Siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and Shuster were young and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster. When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover. They continued collaborating on other projects, but for the time being Shuster was through with Superman.

Siegel wrote to numerous artists. The first response came in July 1933 from Leo O&#x27;Mealia, who drew the &quot;Fu Manchu&quot; strip for the Bell Syndicate. In the script that Siegel sent to O&#x27;Mealia, Superman&#x27;s origin story changes: He is a &quot;scientist-adventurer&quot; from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved &quot;superpowers&quot;. Just before the Earth explodes, he escapes in a time-machine to the modern era, whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime. O&#x27;Mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate, but they were rejected. O&#x27;Mealia did not send to Siegel any copies of his strips, and they have been lost.

In June 1934, Siegel found another partner, an artist in Chicago named Russell Keaton. Keaton drew the &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Skyroads&quot; comic strips. In the script that Siegel sent Keaton in June, Superman&#x27;s origin story further evolved: In the distant future, when Earth is on the verge of exploding due to &quot;giant cataclysms&quot;, the last surviving man sends his three-year-old son back in time to the year 1935. The time-machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists Sam and Molly Kent. They leave the boy in an orphanage, but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin. The Kents adopt the boy and name him Clark, and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity. In November, Siegel sent Keaton an extension of his script: an adventure where Superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player. The extended script mentions that Clark puts on a special &quot;uniform&quot; when assuming the identity of Superman, but it is not described. Keaton produced two weeks&#x27; worth of strips based on Siegel&#x27;s script. In November, Keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate, but they too were rejected, and he abandoned the project.

Siegel and Shuster reconciled and resumed developing Superman together. The character became an alien from the planet Krypton. Shuster designed the now-familiar costume: tights with an &quot;S&quot; on the chest, over-shorts, and a cape. They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and conceived his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman but does not realize that he and Kent are the same person.
In June 1935 Siegel and Shuster finally found work with National Allied Publications, a comic magazine publishing company in New York owned by Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson. Wheeler-Nicholson published two of their strips in &quot;New Fun Comics&quot; #6 (1935): &quot;Henri Duval&quot; and &quot;Doctor Occult&quot;. Siegel and Shuster also showed him Superman and asked him to market Superman to the newspapers on their behalf. In October, Wheeler-Nicholson offered to publish Superman in one of his own magazines. Siegel and Shuster refused his offer because Wheeler-Nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman. He had been slow to respond to their letters and had not paid them for their work in &quot;New Fun Comics&quot; #6. They chose to keep marketing Superman to newspaper syndicates themselves. Despite the erratic pay, Siegel and Shuster kept working for Wheeler-Nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work, and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines.

Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s financial difficulties continued to mount. In 1936, he formed a joint corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. in order to release his third magazine, which was titled &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. Siegel and Shuster produced stories for &quot;Detective Comics&quot; too, such as &quot;Slam Bradley&quot;. Wheeler-Nicholson fell into deep debt to Donenfeld and Liebowitz, and in early January 1938, Donenfeld and Liebowitz petitioned Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s company into bankruptcy and seized it.

In early December 1937, Siegel visited Liebowitz in New York, and Liebowitz asked Siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Siegel proposed some new stories, but not Superman. Siegel and Shuster were, at the time, negotiating a deal with the McClure Newspaper Syndicate for Superman. In early January 1938, Siegel had a three-way telephone conversation with Liebowitz and an employee of McClure named Max Gaines. Gaines informed Siegel that McClure had rejected Superman, and asked if he could forward their Superman strips to Liebowitz so that Liebowitz could consider them for &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Siegel agreed. Liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips, and they asked Siegel and Shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Having grown tired of rejections, Siegel and Shuster accepted the offer. At least now they would see Superman published. Siegel and Shuster submitted their work in late February and were paid for their work ($10 per page). In early March they signed a contract at Liebowitz&#x27;s request in which they gave away the copyright for Superman to Detective Comics, Inc. This was normal practice in the business, and Siegel and Shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well.
The duo&#x27;s revised version of Superman appeared in the first issue of &quot;Action Comics&quot;, which was published on April 18, 1938. The issue was a huge success thanks to Superman&#x27;s feature.

===Influences===
Siegel and Shuster read pulp science-fiction and adventure magazines, and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and superhuman strength. One character in particular was John Carter of Mars from the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. John Carter is a human who is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances. Another influence was Philip Wylie&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Gladiator&quot;, featuring a protagonist named Hugo Danner who had similar powers.

Superman&#x27;s stance and devil-may-care attitude were influenced by the characters of Douglas Fairbanks, who starred in adventure films such as &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; and &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. The name of Superman&#x27;s home city, Metropolis, was taken from the 1927 film of the same name. Popeye cartoons were also an influence.
Clark Kent&#x27;s harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as Don Diego de la Vega in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; and Sir Percy Blakeney in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor. Another inspiration was slapstick comedian Harold Lloyd. The archetypal Lloyd character was a mild-mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously.

Kent is a journalist because Siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school. The love triangle between Lois Lane, Clark, and Superman was inspired by Siegel&#x27;s own awkwardness with girls.

The pair collected comic strips in their youth, with a favorite being Winsor McCay&#x27;s fantastical &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. Shuster remarked on the artists who played an important part in the development of his own style: &quot;Alex Raymond and Burne Hogarth were my idols – also Milt Caniff, Hal Foster, and Roy Crane.&quot; Shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected.

As a boy, Shuster was interested in fitness culture and a fan of strongmen such as Siegmund Breitbart and Joseph Greenstein. He collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art.

The visual design of Superman came from multiple influences. The tight-fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers, boxers, and strongmen. In early concept art, Shuster gave Superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes, but these were eventually changed to red boots. The costumes of Douglas Fairbanks were also an influence. The emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests. Many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes. Superman&#x27;s face was based on Johnny Weissmuller with touches derived from the comic-strip character Dick Tracy and from the work of cartoonist Roy Crane.

The word &quot;superman&quot; was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability, most often athletes and politicians. It occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well, such as &quot;The Superman of Dr. Jukes&quot;. It is unclear whether Siegel and Shuster were influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s concept of the &quot;Übermensch&quot;; they never acknowledged as much.

==Comics==
===Comic books===

Since 1938, Superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by DC Comics. The first and oldest of these is &quot;Action Comics&quot;, which began in April 1938. &quot;Action Comics&quot; was initially an anthology magazine, but it eventually became dedicated to Superman stories. The second oldest periodical is &quot;Superman&quot;, which began in June 1939. &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; have been published without interruption (ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme). Several other shorter-lived Superman periodicals have been published over the years. Superman is part of the DC Universe, which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by DC Comics, and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, and others.

More Superman comic books have been sold in publication history than any other American superhero character. Exact sales figures for the early decades of Superman comic books are hard to find because, like most publishers at the time, DC Comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public, but given the general market trends at the time, sales of &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; probably peaked in the mid-1940s and thereafter steadily declined. Sales data first became public in 1960, and showed that Superman was the best-selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s. Sales rose again starting in 1987. &quot;Superman&quot; #75 (Nov 1992) had over 23 million copies sold, making it the best-selling issue of a comic book of all time, due to a media sensation over The Death of Superman in that issue. Sales declined from that point on. In March 2018, &quot;Action Comics&quot; sold just 51,534 copies, although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general (for comparison, &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #797 sold only 128,189 copies). The comic books have become a niche aspect of the &quot;Superman&quot; franchise due to low readership, though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows. Comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply, and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation.

Whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children, since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult. A major reason for this shift was DC Comics&#x27; decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers (supermarkets, newsstands, etc.) — a model called &quot;direct distribution&quot;. This made comic books less accessible to children.

===Newspaper strips===

Beginning in January 1939, a &quot;Superman&quot; daily comic strip appeared in newspapers, syndicated through the McClure Syndicate. A color Sunday version was added that November. Jerry Siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943. The Sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips, possibly because Siegel had to delegate the Sunday strips to ghostwriters. By 1941, the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million. Joe Shuster drew the early strips, then passed the job to Wayne Boring. From 1949 to 1956, the newspaper strips were drawn by Win Mortimer. The strip ended in May 1966, but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by Warner Bros.

===Editors===
Initially, Jerry Siegel was allowed to write Superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise. But soon Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors. Siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories. Editor Whitney Ellsworth, hired in 1940, dictated that Superman not kill. Sexuality was banned, and colorfully outlandish villains such as Ultra-Humanite and Toyman were favored over gangsters as they were thought to be less frightening to young readers.

Mort Weisinger was the editor on Superman comics from 1941 to 1970, his tenure briefly interrupted by military service. Siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology, but as the number of Superman titles and the pool of writers grew, Weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach. Weisinger assigned story ideas, and the logic of Superman&#x27;s powers, his origin, the locales, and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned. Elements such as Bizarro, his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone, the Fortress of Solitude, alternate varieties of kryptonite, robot doppelgangers, and Krypto were introduced during this era. The complicated universe built under Weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals. Weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama, and avoided sensitive subjects such as the Vietnam War and the American civil rights movement because he feared his right-wing views would alienate his left-leaning writers and readers. Weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers.

Weisinger retired in 1970 and Julius Schwartz took over. By his own admission, Weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers. Starting with The Sandman Saga, Schwartz updated Superman by making Clark Kent a television anchor, and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers. Schwartz also scaled Superman&#x27;s powers down to a level closer to Siegel&#x27;s depiction. These changes would eventually be reversed by later writers. Schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot; (&quot;Superman Annual&quot; #11), in which the villain Mongul torments Superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living Krypton.

Schwartz retired from DC Comics in 1986 and was succeeded by Mike Carlin as an editor on Superman comics. His retirement coincided with DC Comics&#x27; decision to reboot the DC Universe with the companywide-crossover storyline &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In The Man of Steel writer John Byrne rewrote the Superman mythos, again reducing Superman&#x27;s powers, which writers had slowly re-strengthened, and revised many supporting characters, such as making Lex Luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist, and making Supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because DC wanted Superman to be the sole surviving Kryptonian.

Carlin was promoted to Executive Editor for the DC Universe books in 1996, a position he held until 2002. K.C. Carlson took his place as editor of the Superman comics.

===Aesthetic style===
In the earlier decades of Superman comics, artists were expected to conform to a certain &quot;house style&quot;. Joe Shuster defined the aesthetic style of Superman in the 1940s. After Shuster left National, Wayne Boring succeeded him as the principal artist on Superman comic books. He redrew Superman taller and more detailed. Around 1955, Curt Swan in turn succeeded Boring. The 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single &quot;house style&quot; in Superman comics.

== In other media ==
===Radio===
The first adaptation of Superman beyond comic books was a radio show, &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, which ran from 1940 to 1951 for 2,088 episodes, most of which were aimed at children. The episodes were initially 15 minutes long, but after 1949 they were lengthened to 30 minutes. Most episodes were done live. Bud Collyer was the voice actor for Superman in most episodes. The show was produced by Robert Maxwell and Allen Ducovny, who were employees of Superman, Inc. and Detective Comics, Inc. respectively.

===Stage===
In 1966 Superman had a Tony-nominated musical play produced on Broadway. &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird... It&#x27;s a Plane... It&#x27;s Superman&quot; featured music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Lee Adams and book by David Newman and Robert Benton. Actor Bob Holiday performed as Clark Kent/Superman and actress Patricia Marand performed as Lois Lane.

===Film===

* Paramount Pictures released a series of Superman theatrical animated shorts between 1941 and 1943. Seventeen episodes in total were made, each 8–10 minutes long. The first nine films were produced by Fleischer Studios and the next films were produced by Famous Studios. Bud Collyer provided the voice of Superman. The first episode had a production budget of $50,000 with the remaining episodes at $30,000 each (), which was exceptionally lavish for the time; $9,000 – $15,000 was more typical for animated shorts. Joe Shuster provided model sheets for the characters, so the visuals resembled the contemporary comic book aesthetic.

* The first live-action adaptation of Superman was a movie serial released in 1948, targeted at children. Kirk Alyn became the first actor to portray the hero onscreen. The production cost up to $325,000 (). It was the most profitable movie serial in movie history. A sequel serial, &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot;, was released in 1950. For flying scenes, Superman was hand-drawn in animated form, composited onto live-action footage.
* The first feature film was &quot;Superman and the Mole Men&quot;, a 58-minute B-movie released in 1951, produced on an estimated budget of $30,000 (). It starred George Reeves as Superman, and was intended to promote the subsequent television series.
* The first big-budget movie was &quot;Superman&quot; in 1978, starring Christopher Reeve and produced by Alexander and Ilya Salkind. It was 143 minutes long and was made on a budget of $55 million (). It is the most successful Superman feature film to date in terms of box office revenue adjusted for inflation. The soundtrack was composed by John Williams and was nominated for an Academy Award. 

The success of the 1978 film arguably paved the way for later big-budget superhero movies like &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002).
* The 1978 film spawned three sequels: &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987).
* In 2006, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was released, designed after the 1978–1987 film series. Superman was portrayed by Brandon Routh, who later reprised his role in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (2019–2020).
* Superman has appeared in a series of direct-to-video animated films produced by Warner Bros. Animation called DC Universe Animated Original Movies, beginning with &quot;&quot; in 2007. Many of these movies are adaptations of popular comic book stories.
* Superman appeared in the theatrical animated feature film &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot; (2018), voiced by Nicolas Cage.
* Superman appeared in the theatrical animated feature film &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot; (2022), voiced by John Krasinski.

==== DC Extended Universe ====
* In 2013, &quot;Man of Steel&quot; was released by Warner Bros. as a reboot of the film series, starring Henry Cavill as Superman.
* A sequel, &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), featured Superman alongside Batman and Wonder Woman, making it the first theatrical film in which Superman appeared alongside other superheroes from the DC Universe. 
* Cavill reprised his role in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017) and its director&#x27;s cut (2021).
* This version of Superman also makes cameos in &quot;Shazam!&quot; (2019) and in the first season finale of the TV series &quot;Peacemaker&quot; (2022) but portrayed by stand-ins for Cavill.
* Cavill makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Superman in the mid-credits scene of the film &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022).
* Nicolas Cage makes a cameo appearance as an alternate version of Superman in the film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023), Cage shooting his scenes through volumetric capture, before he was deaged with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Cavill, George Reeves, and Christopher Reeve also cameo as their respective versions of Superman through the use of CGI representing their likenesses, Cavill having filmed additional scenes as the character for the film which were removed during post-production.

====DC Universe====
*A new reboot of the film series, &quot;Superman&quot;, is in development, to be set in the DC Universe (DCU) franchise. The film was written and directed by James Gunn and produced by DC Studios, and is set to release on July 11, 2025. On June 27, 2023, David Corenswet was cast as Superman in the film.

===Television===

* &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, which aired from 1952 to 1958, was the first television series based on a superhero. It starred George Reeves as Superman. Whereas the radio serial was aimed at children, this television show was aimed at a general audience, although children made up the majority of viewers. Robert Maxwell, who produced the radio serial, was the producer for the first season. For the second season, Maxwell was replaced with Whitney Ellsworth. Ellsworth toned down the violence of the show to make it more suitable for children, though he still aimed for a general audience. This show was extremely popular in Japan, where it achieved an audience share rating of 74.2% in 1958.
* His first animated television series was &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, which aired from 1966 to 1970. The show also feature a seven-minute part focused on Superboy named &quot;The Adventures of Superboy.&quot;
* Starting in 1974, Superman was one of the leading characters in the Hanna-Barbera-produced animated series &quot;Super Friends&quot; and all its sequels until 1986.
* To celebrate his 50th anniversary, Ruby Spears produced an animated series partially based on &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and post-Crisis Superman comics created by John Byrne. The model sheets for &quot;Superman&quot; (1988) were drawn by legendary comics artist Gil Kane and most of the episodes were written by comics writer Marv Wolfman.
* &quot;Superboy&quot; aired from 1988 to 1992. It was produced by Alexander and Ilya Salkind, the same men who had produced the Superman films starring Christopher Reeve.
* &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; aired from 1993 to 1997. This show was aimed at adults and focused on the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane as much as Superman&#x27;s heroics. Dean Cain played Superman, and Teri Hatcher played Lois.
* &quot;Smallville&quot; aired from 2001 to 2011. The show was targeted at young adults. Played by Tom Welling, the series covered Clark Kent&#x27;s life prior to becoming Superman, spanning ten years from his high school years in Smallville to his early life in Metropolis. Although Clark engages in heroics, he does not wear a costume, nor does he call himself Superboy. Rather, he relies on misdirection and his blinding speed to avoid being recognized. Later seasons find him becoming a public hero called the Red-Blue Blur, eventually shortened to the Blur, in a proto-Justice League before taking on the mantle of Superman. 
* &quot;&quot; (with the voice of Tim Daly as the adult character) aired from 1996 to 2000. After the show&#x27;s conclusion, this version of Superman appeared in the sequel shows &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (voiced by Christopher McDonald) aired from 1999 to 2001 and &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (voiced by George Newbern), which ran from 2001 to 2006. All of these shows were produced by Bruce Timm. This was the most successful and longest-running animated version of Superman.
* In the Arrowverse, Earth-38 Superman (played by Tyler Hoechlin), appears as a special guest star in several television series: &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;.
* Hoechlin also played his Arrowverse doppelgänger on &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; that is set outside of Earth-Prime.
* Superman appears as an ensemble character in the animated show &quot;Justice League Action&quot;. He also appears as a guest character in other animated shows such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;.
* The 2023 animated series &quot;My Adventures with Superman&quot; depicts a young Superman (played by Jack Quaid) at the start of his career, through the eyes of a reimagined Lois Lane, with elements of romantic comedy alongside the standard action-adventure and science fiction tropes.

===Video games===

* The first electronic game was simply titled &quot;Superman&quot;, and released in 1979 for the Atari 2600. 
* The last game fully centered on Superman was the adaptation of &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in 2006. 
* From 2006 to present, Superman appeared in a co-starring role, such as the &quot;Injustice&quot; game series (2013–present).

==Merchandising==
DC Comics trademarked the Superman chest logo in August 1938. Jack Liebowitz established Superman, Inc. in October 1939 to develop the franchise beyond the comic books. Superman, Inc. merged with DC Comics in October 1946. After DC Comics merged with Warner Communications in 1967, licensing for Superman was handled by the Licensing Corporation of America.

The Licensing Letter (an American market research firm) estimated that Superman licensed merchandise made $634 million in sales globally in 2018 (43.3% of this revenue came from the North American market). For comparison, in the same year, Spider-Man merchandise made $1.075 billion and Star Wars merchandise made $1.923 billion globally.

The earliest paraphernalia appeared in 1939: a button proclaiming membership in the Supermen of America club. The first toy was a wooden doll in 1939 made by the Ideal Novelty and Toy Company. &quot;Superman&quot; #5 (May 1940) carried an advertisement for a &quot;Krypto-Raygun&quot;, which was a gun-shaped device that could project images on a wall. The majority of Superman merchandise is targeted at children, but since the 1970s, adults have been increasingly targeted because the comic book readership has gotten older.

During World War II, Superman was used to support the war effort. &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; carried messages urging readers to buy war bonds and participate in scrap drives. Other superheroes became patriots who went to fight: Batman, Wonder Woman and Captain America.

==Copyright issues==
===Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster===

In a contract dated March 1, 1938, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster gave away the copyright to Superman to their employer, DC Comics (then known as Detective Comics, Inc.) prior to Superman&#x27;s first publication in April. Contrary to popular perception, the $130 that DC Comics paid them was for their first Superman story, not the copyright to the character — that, they gave away for free. This was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works (Slam Bradley, Doctor Occult, etc.), but Superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away. DC Comics retained Siegel and Shuster, and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers. Between 1938 and 1947, DC Comics paid them together at least $401,194.85 (equivalent to $ in ).

Siegel wrote most of the magazine and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted into the United States Army in 1943, whereupon the task was passed to ghostwriters. While Siegel was serving in Hawaii, DC Comics published a story featuring a child version of Superman called &quot;Superboy&quot;, which was based on a script Siegel had submitted several years before. Siegel was furious because DC Comics did this without having bought the character.

After Siegel&#x27;s discharge from the Army, he and Shuster sued DC Comics in 1947 for the rights to Superman and Superboy. The judge ruled that Superman belonged to DC Comics, but that Superboy was a separate entity that belonged to Siegel. Siegel and Shuster settled out-of-court with DC Comics, which paid the pair $94,013.16 () in exchange for the full rights to both Superman and Superboy. DC Comics then fired Siegel and Shuster.

DC Comics rehired Jerry Siegel as a writer in 1959.

In 1965, Siegel and Shuster attempted to regain rights to Superman using the renewal option in the Copyright Act of 1909, but the court ruled Siegel and Shuster had transferred the renewal rights to DC Comics in 1938. Siegel and Shuster appealed, but the appeals court upheld this decision. DC Comics fired Siegel once again, when he filed this second lawsuit.

In 1975, Siegel and several other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators. Warner Brothers agreed to give Siegel and Shuster a yearly stipend, full medical benefits, and credit their names in all future Superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of Superman. Siegel and Shuster upheld this bargain.

Shuster died in 1992. DC Comics offered Shuster&#x27;s heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of Superman, which they accepted for some years.

Siegel died in 1996. His heirs attempted to take the rights to Superman using the termination provision of the Copyright Act of 1976. DC Comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the Siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of $500,000 in exchange for permanently granting DC the rights to Superman. DC Comics also agreed to insert the line &quot;By Special Arrangement with the Jerry Siegel Family&quot; in all future Superman productions. The Siegels accepted DC&#x27;s offer in an October 2001 letter.

Copyright lawyer and movie producer Marc Toberoff then struck a deal with the heirs of both Siegel and Shuster to help them get the rights to Superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company, Pacific Pictures. Both groups accepted. The Siegel heirs called off their deal with DC Comics and in 2004 sued DC for the rights to Superman and Superboy. In 2008, the judge ruled in favor of the Siegels. DC Comics appealed the decision, and the appeals court ruled in favor of DC, arguing that the October 2001 letter was binding. In 2003, the Shuster heirs served a termination notice for Shuster&#x27;s grant of his half of the copyright to Superman. DC Comics sued the Shuster heirs in 2010, and the court ruled in DC&#x27;s favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the Shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant.

Under current US copyright law, Superman is due to enter the public domain on January 1, 2034. However, this will only apply (at first) to the character as he is depicted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, which was published in 1938. Versions of him with later developments, such as his power of &quot;heat vision&quot;, may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain. Lois Lane, who also debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, is expected to enter public domain in 2034, but supporting characters introduced in later publications, such as Jimmy Olsen and Supergirl, will pass into the public domain at later dates.

===Captain Marvel===

Superman&#x27;s success immediately begat a wave of imitations. The most successful from this period was Captain Marvel, first published by Fawcett Comics in December 1939. Captain Marvel had many similarities to Superman: Herculean strength, invulnerability, the ability to fly, a cape, a secret identity, and a job as a journalist. DC Comics filed a lawsuit against Fawcett Comics for copyright infringement.

The trial began in March 1948 after seven years of discovery. The judge ruled that Fawcett had indeed infringed on Superman. However, the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the Superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the Copyright Act of 1909 and were therefore invalid. Furthermore, since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from &quot;Action Comics&quot;, the judge ruled that DC Comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the &quot;Action Comics&quot; stories and Superman, and therefore forfeited its right to sue Fawcett for copyright infringement.

DC Comics appealed this decision. The appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights. Furthermore, Fawcett knew that DC Comics never intended to abandon the copyrights, and therefore Fawcett&#x27;s infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding, and therefore Fawcett owed damages to DC Comics. The appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much Fawcett owed in damages.

At that point, Fawcett Comics decided to settle out of court with DC Comics. Fawcett paid DC Comics and agreed to stop publishing Captain Marvel. The last Captain Marvel story from Fawcett Comics was published in September 1953.

DC Comics licensed Captain Marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with Superman. By 1991, DC Comics had purchased Fawcett Comics and with it the full rights to Captain Marvel. DC eventually renamed the character &quot;Shazam&quot; to prevent disputes with Marvel Comics, who had created a character of their own named &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; back when the Fawcett character hadbeen out of print.

==Character overview==
Several elements of the &quot;Superman&quot; narrative have remained consistent in the myriad stories published since 1938.

===Superman===
In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (1938), Superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans. Shortly after he is born, his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm, but his scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to Earth in a small spaceship. The ship is too small to carry anyone else, so Superman&#x27;s parents stay behind and die. The earliest newspaper strips name the planet Krypton, the baby Kal-L, and his biological parents Jor-L and Lora; their names were changed to Jor-el, and Lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by George Lowther. The ship lands in the American countryside, where the baby is discovered by the Kents, a farming couple.

The Kents name the boy Clark and raise him in a farming community. A 1947 episode of the radio serial places this yet unnamed community in Iowa. It is named Smallville in &quot;Superboy&quot; #2 (June 1949). The 1978 Superman movie placed it in Kansas, as have most Superman stories since. &quot;New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #22 (Oct. 1981) places it in Maryland.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 and most stories published before 1986, Superman&#x27;s powers begin developing in infancy. From 1944 to 1986, DC Comics regularly published stories of Superman&#x27;s childhood and adolescent adventures, when he called himself &quot;Superboy&quot;. From 1986 on (beginning with &quot;Man of Steel&quot; #1), Superman&#x27;s powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult.

The Kents teach Clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed identity of Superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment&#x27;s notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.

In &quot;Superboy&quot; #78 (1960), Superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to Earth in. In &quot;Man of Steel&quot; #1 (1986), Martha Kent makes the costume from human-manufactured cloth, and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that Superman projects. The &quot;S&quot; on Superman&#x27;s chest at first was simply an initial for &quot;Superman&quot;. When writing the script for the 1978 movie, Tom Mankiewicz made it the crest of Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian family, the House of El. This was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies, such as &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. In the comic story &quot;&quot;, the crest is described as an old Kryptonian symbol for hope.

Clark works as a newspaper journalist. In the earliest stories, he worked for &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. In comics from the early 1970s, Clark worked as a television journalist, which was an attempt to modernize the character. However, for the 1978 movie, the producers chose to make Clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most people outside of comic book readers knew him.

The first story in which Superman dies was published in &quot;Superman&quot; #149 (1961), in which he is murdered by Lex Luthor by means of kryptonite. This story was &quot;imaginary&quot; and therefore was ignored in subsequent books. In &quot;Superman&quot; #188 (April 1966), Superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers. In the 1990s &quot;The Death and Return of Superman&quot; story arc, after a deadly battle with Doomsday, Superman died in &quot;Superman&quot; #75 (Jan. 1993). He was later revived by the Eradicator using Kryptonian technology. In &quot;Superman&quot; #52 (May 2016) Superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning, and this time he is not resurrected, but replaced by the Superman of an alternate timeline.

Superman maintains a secret hideout called the &quot;Fortress of Solitude&quot;, which is located somewhere in the Arctic. Here, Superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments. &quot;Action Comics&quot; #241 (1958) depicts the Fortress of Solitude as a cave in a mountain, sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but Superman to use. In the 1978 movie, the Fortress of Solitude is a structure made of white crystal.

===Clark Kent===

Superman&#x27;s secret identity is Clark Joseph Kent, a reporter for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive Earth parents, everything about Clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity: as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, he receives late-breaking news before the general public, always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes, and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines. He sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his Superman responsibilities—bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy. He believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world, regardless of who is involved. In the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Clark Kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in &quot;The Superman Family&quot;, &quot;The Private Life of Clark Kent&quot; where Superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining Clark.

To deflect suspicion that he is Superman, Clark Kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms, a higher-pitched voice, and a slight slouch. This personality is typically described as &quot;mild-mannered&quot;, as in the opening narration of Max Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; animated theatrical shorts. These traits extended into Clark&#x27;s wardrobe, which typically consists of a bland-colored business suit, a red necktie, black-rimmed glasses, combed-back hair, and occasionally a fedora. Clark wears his Superman costume underneath his street clothes, allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar &quot;S&quot; emblem when called into action. His hair also changes with the clothing change, with Superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead. Superman usually stores his Clark Kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape, though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location (such as the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; storeroom) for later retrieval.

As Superman&#x27;s alter ego, the personality, concept, and name of Clark Kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities. In 1992, Superman co-creator Joe Shuster told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men Clark Gable and Kent Taylor, but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic Harold Lloyd and himself. Clark&#x27;s middle name is given variously as either Joseph, Jerome, or Jonathan, all being allusions to creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

===Personality===
In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman&#x27;s personality is rough and aggressive. He often uses excessive force and terror against criminals, on some occasions even killing them. This came to an end in late 1940 when new editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, banning Superman from ever killing. The character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism. Ellsworth&#x27;s code, however, is not to be confused with &quot;the Comics Code&quot;, which was created in 1954 by the Comics Code Authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century.

In his first appearances, Superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities, being fired upon by the National Guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor. By 1942, however, Superman was working side-by-side with the police. Today, Superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality, and righteousness. He adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents. His commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes, but has stirred resentment and criticism among others, who refer to him as the &quot;big blue boy scout&quot;. Superman can be rather rigid in this trait, causing tensions in the superhero community. This was most notable with Wonder Woman, one of his closest friends, after she killed Maxwell Lord. Booster Gold initially had an icy relationship with the Man of Steel but grew to respect him.

Having lost his home world of Krypton, Superman is very protective of Earth, and especially of Clark Kent&#x27;s family and friends. This same loss, combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly, has caused Superman to feel lonely on Earth, despite having his friends and parents. Previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow Kryptonians, Power Girl and Mon-El, have led to disappointment. The arrival of Supergirl, who has been confirmed to be his cousin from Krypton, relieved this loneliness somewhat. Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair.

===Abilities and weaknesses===

The catalog of Superman&#x27;s abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of Superman fiction released since 1938.

Since &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (1938), Superman has superhuman strength. The cover of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head. Another classic feat of strength on Superman&#x27;s part is breaking steel chains. In some stories, he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets and crush coal into diamond with his hands.

Since &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (1938), Superman has a highly durable body, invulnerable for most practical purposes. At the very least, bullets bounce harmlessly off his body. In some stories, such as &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, not even a nuclear bomb can harm him.

In the earliest stories, Superman&#x27;s costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is, which is why it typically does not tear up when he performs superhuman feats. In later stories, beginning with &quot;Man of Steel&quot; #1 (1986), Superman&#x27;s body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight-fitting clothes he wears, and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, Superman could not fly. He traveled by running and leaping, which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength. Superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940. Superman can fly faster than sound and in some stories, he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies.

Superman can project and perceive X-rays via his eyes, which allows him to see through objects. He first uses this power in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #11 (1939). Certain materials such as lead can block his X-ray vision.

Superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel. He first used this power in &quot;Superman&quot; #59 (1949) by applying his X-ray vision at its highest intensity. In later stories, this ability is simply called &quot;heat vision&quot;.

Superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear, and at frequencies outside the human hearing range. This ability was introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #11 (1939).

Since &quot;Action Comics&quot; #20 (1940), Superman possesses superhuman breath, which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air, as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects. He has a significant focus of his breath&#x27;s intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them. The &quot;freeze breath&quot; was first demonstrated in &quot;Superman&quot; #129 (1959).

&quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (1938) explained that Superman&#x27;s strength was common to all Kryptonians because they were a species &quot;millions of years advanced of our own&quot;. In the first newspaper strips, Jor-El is shown running and leaping like Superman, and his wife survives a building collapsing on her. Later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of Krypton&#x27;s higher gravity. &quot;Superman&quot; #146 (1961) established that Superman&#x27;s abilities other than strength (flight, durability, etc.) are activated by the light of Earth&#x27;s yellow sun. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #300 (1963), all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of Krypton&#x27;s sun.

====Weaknesses====
Exposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman&#x27;s powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. Although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with peculiar effects. Gold kryptonite, for instance, nullifies Superman&#x27;s powers but otherwise does not harm him. Kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial. It first appeared in comics in &quot;Superman&quot; #61 (Dec. 1949).

Superman is also vulnerable to magic. Enchanted weapons and magical spells affect Superman as easily as they would a normal human. This weakness was established in &quot;Superman&quot; #171 (1964).

Like all Kryptonians, Kal-El is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along Telekinesis, Illusion casting, Mind control, etc., as shown in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; Vol 2 # 219 (Sept. 2005). A powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of Superman to induce strokes or mangle his internal organs, as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world, something a young power-amped Gene-Bomb meta showcased in &quot;Superman&quot; #48 (Oct. 1990).

===Occasional equipment===

On occasion, Superman has made use of a special aeroplane called the Supermobile which has the same abilities as him and can protect him from the radiation of a red sun.

===Supporting characters===

Superman&#x27;s first and most famous supporting character is Lois Lane, introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1. She is a fellow journalist at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. As Jerry Siegel conceived her, Lois considers Clark Kent to be a wimp, but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty Superman, not knowing that Kent and Superman are the same person. Siegel objected to any proposal that Lois discover that Clark is Superman because he felt that, as implausible as Clark&#x27;s disguise is, the love triangle was too important to the book&#x27;s appeal. However, Siegel wrote stories in which Lois suspects Clark is Superman and tries to prove it, with Superman always duping her in the end; the first such story was in &quot;Superman&quot; #17 (July–August 1942). This was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s. In a story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #484 (June 1978), Clark Kent admits to Lois that he is Superman, and they marry. This was the first story in which Superman and Lois marry that was not an &quot;imaginary tale&quot;. Many Superman stories since then have depicted Superman and Lois as a married couple, but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle. In modern era comic books, Superman and Lois are a stable married couple, and the &quot;Superman&quot; supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son, Jonathan Kent.

Other supporting characters include Jimmy Olsen, a photographer at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, who is friends with both Superman and Clark Kent, though in most stories he does not know that Clark is Superman. Jimmy is frequently described as &quot;Superman&#x27;s pal&quot;, and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with Superman.

In the earliest comic book stories, Clark Kent&#x27;s employer is George Taylor of &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to Perry White of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

Clark Kent&#x27;s foster parents are Ma and Pa Kent. In many stories, one or both of them have died by the time Clark becomes Superman. Clark&#x27;s parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means, but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life.

===Antagonists===

The villains Superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans, such as gangsters, corrupt politicians, and violent husbands; but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children. The mad scientist Ultra-Humanite, introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #13 (June 1939), was Superman&#x27;s first recurring villain. Superman&#x27;s best-known nemesis, Lex Luthor, was introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23 (April 1940) and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman (sometimes both). In 1944, the magical imp Mister Mxyzptlk, Superman&#x27;s first recurring super-powered adversary, was introduced. Superman&#x27;s first alien villain, Brainiac, debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #242 (July 1958). The monstrous Doomsday, introduced in &quot;&quot; #17–18 (Nov.-Dec. 1992), was the first villain to evidently kill Superman in physical combat without exploiting Superman&#x27;s critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic.

===Alternative depictions===
The details of Superman&#x27;s origin story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938, but most versions conform to the basic template described above. A few stories feature radically altered versions of Superman. An example is the graphic novel &quot;&quot;, which depicts a communist Superman who rules the Soviet Union. DC Comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of Superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes. For instance, in the 1960s, the Superman of &quot;Earth-One&quot; would occasionally feature in stories alongside the Superman of &quot;Earth-Two&quot;, the latter of whom resembled Superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s. DC Comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of Superman.

==Impact and legacy==
===The superhero archetype===
Superman is often considered the first superhero. This point can be debated: Ogon Bat, the Phantom, Zorro, and Mandrake the Magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate Superman. Nevertheless, Superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions: a costume, a codename, extraordinary abilities, and an altruistic mission. Superman&#x27;s success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations, which include Batman, Captain America, and Captain Marvel. This flourishing is today referred to as America&#x27;s Golden Age of Comic Books, which lasted from 1938 to about 1950. The Golden Age ended when American superhero book sales declined, leading to the cancellation of many characters; but Superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline, and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the Silver Age of Comic Books, when characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, and The X-Men were created.

After World War II, American superhero fiction entered Japanese culture. Astro Boy, first published in 1952, was inspired by Mighty Mouse, which in turn was a parody of Superman. The &quot;Superman&quot; animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on Japanese television in 1955, and they were followed in 1956 by the TV show &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; starring George Reeves. These shows were popular with the Japanese and inspired Japan&#x27;s own prolific genre of superheroes. The first Japanese superhero movie, &quot;Super Giant&quot;, was released in 1957. The first Japanese superhero TV show was &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot; in 1958. Other notable Japanese superheroes include Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Sailor Moon.

===Fine art===
Since the Pop Art period and the 1960s, the character of Superman has been &quot;appropriated&quot; by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, most notably by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Dulce Pinzon, Mr. Brainwash, Raymond Pettibon, Peter Saul, Giuseppe Veneziano, F. Lennox Campello, and others.

==Literary analysis==
Superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms, with Umberto Eco noting that &quot;he can be seen as the representative of all his similars&quot;. Writing in &quot;Time&quot; in 1971, Gerald Clarke stated: &quot;Superman&#x27;s enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the Horatio Alger myth of the self-made man.&quot; Clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation. He regarded Superman&#x27;s character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world, which he saw as a place in which &quot;only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper&quot;. Andrew Arnold, writing in the early 21st century, has noted Superman&#x27;s partial role in exploring assimilation, the character&#x27;s alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level.

A.C. Grayling, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, traces Superman&#x27;s stances through the decades, from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of Al Capone, through the 1940s and World War II, a period in which Superman helped sell war bonds, and into the 1950s, where Superman explored the new technological threats. Grayling notes the period after the Cold War as being one where &quot;matters become merely personal: the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of Lex Luthor and Brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions&quot;, and discusses events post 9/11, stating that as a nation &quot;caught between the terrifying George W. Bush and the terrorist Osama bin Laden, America is in earnest need of a Saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe. And here he is, the down-home clean-cut boy in the blue tights and red cape&quot;.

An influence on early Superman stories is the context of the Great Depression. Superman took on the role of social activist, fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run-down tenements. Comics scholar Roger Sabin sees this as a reflection of &quot;the liberal idealism of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal&quot;, with Shuster and Siegel initially portraying Superman as champion to a variety of social causes. In later Superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues, tackling a version of the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 broadcast, as well as combating anti-semitism and veteran discrimination.

Scott Bukatman has discussed Superman, and the superhero in general, noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space, especially in Superman&#x27;s ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of Metropolis. He writes that the character &quot;represented, in 1938, a kind of Corbusierian ideal. Superman has X-ray vision: walls become permeable, transparent. Through his benign, controlled authority, Superman renders the city open, modernist and democratic; he furthers a sense that Le Corbusier described in 1925, namely, that &#x27;Everything is known to us&#x27;.&quot;

Jules Feiffer has argued that Superman&#x27;s real innovation lay in the creation of the Clark Kent persona, noting that what &quot;made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent.&quot; Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman&#x27;s popularity in simple wish fulfillment, a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that &quot;If you&#x27;re interested in what made Superman what it is, here&#x27;s one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. Joe and I had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That&#x27;s where the dual-identity concept came from&quot; and Shuster supporting that as being &quot;why so many people could relate to it&quot;.

Ian Gordon suggests that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. He defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman, he notes was very much part of that effort.

===An allegory for immigrants===
Superman&#x27;s immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal. Aldo Regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in America. The extraterrestrial origin was seen by Regalado as challenging the notion that Anglo-Saxon ancestry was the source of all might. Gary Engle saw the &quot;myth of Superman [asserting] with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in American culture&quot;. He argues that Superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the Western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities. Through the use of a dual identity, Superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures. Clark Kent represents the assimilated individual, allowing Superman to express the immigrants&#x27; cultural heritage for the greater good. David Jenemann has offered a contrasting view. He argues that Superman&#x27;s early stories portray a threat: &quot;the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country&quot;. David Rooney, a theater critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in his evaluation of the play &quot;Year Zero&quot; considers Superman to be the &quot;quintessential immigrant story [...] [b]orn on an alien planet, he grows stronger on Earth, but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm&quot;.

===Religious themes===
It is popularly believed that Superman took inspiration from Judaic mythology. The British rabbi Simcha Weinstein notes that Superman&#x27;s story has some parallels to that of Moses. For example, Moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and was adopted by a foreign culture. Weinstein also posits that Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian name, &quot;Kal-El&quot;, resembles the Hebrew phrase &quot;qōl ʾēl&quot; (קוֹל-אֵל) which can be taken to mean &quot;voice of God&quot;. The historian Larry Tye suggests that this &quot;Voice of God&quot; is an allusion to Moses&#x27; role as a prophet. The suffix &quot;el&quot;, meaning &quot;god&quot;, is also found in the name of angels (e.g. Gabriel, Ariel), who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers. The Nazis also thought Superman was a Jew and in 1940 Joseph Goebbels publicly denounced Superman and his creator Jerry Siegel.

All that said, historians such as Martin Lund and Les Daniels argue that the evidence for Judaic influence in Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s stories is merely circumstantial. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were not practicing Jews and never acknowledged the influence of Judaism in any memoir or interview.

Superman stories have occasionally exhibited Christian themes as well. Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz consciously made Superman an allegory for Jesus Christ in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve: baby Kal-El&#x27;s ship resembles the Star of Bethlehem, and Jor-El gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future.
This messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, wherein Jor-El asks Superman to redeem the Kryptonian race, which corrupted itself through eugenics, by guiding humanity down a wiser path.

<text>A splay tree is a binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. Like self-balancing binary search trees, a splay tree performs basic operations such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log &quot;n&quot;) amortized time. For random access patterns drawn from a non-uniform random distribution, their amortized time can be faster than logarithmic, proportional to the entropy of the access pattern. For many patterns of non-random operations, also, splay trees can take better than logarithmic time, without requiring advance knowledge of the pattern. According to the unproven dynamic optimality conjecture, their performance on all access patterns is within a constant factor of the best possible performance that could be achieved by any other self-adjusting binary search tree, even one selected to fit that pattern. The splay tree was invented by Daniel Sleator and Robert Tarjan in 1985.

All normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation, called &quot;splaying&quot;. Splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree. One way to do this with the basic search operation is to first perform a standard binary tree search for the element in question, and then use tree rotations in a specific fashion to bring the element to the top. Alternatively, a top-down algorithm can combine the search and the tree reorganization into a single phase.

== Advantages ==

Good performance for a splay tree depends on the fact that it is self-optimizing, in that frequently accessed nodes will move nearer to the root where they can be accessed more quickly. The worst-case height—though unlikely—is O(&quot;n&quot;), with the average being O(log &quot;n&quot;).
Having frequently-used nodes near the root is an advantage for many practical applications (also see locality of reference), and is particularly useful for implementing caches and garbage collection algorithms.

Advantages include:
* Comparable performance: Average-case performance is as efficient as other trees.
* Small memory footprint: Splay trees do not need to store any bookkeeping data.

== Disadvantages ==

The most significant disadvantage of splay trees is that the height of a splay tree can be linear. For example, this will be the case after accessing all &quot;n&quot; elements in non-decreasing order. Since the height of a tree corresponds to the worst-case access time, this means that the actual cost of a single operation can be high. However the amortized access cost of this worst case is logarithmic, O(log &quot;n&quot;). Also, the expected access cost can be reduced to O(log &quot;n&quot;) by using a randomized variant.

The representation of splay trees can change even when they are accessed in a &#x27;read-only&#x27; manner (i.e. by &quot;find&quot; operations). This complicates the use of such splay trees in a multi-threaded environment. Specifically, extra management is needed if multiple threads are allowed to perform &quot;find&quot; operations concurrently. This also makes them unsuitable for general use in purely functional programming, although even there they can be used in limited ways to implement priority queues.

Finally, when the access pattern &quot;is&quot; random, the additional splaying overhead adds a significant constant factor to the cost compared to less-dynamic alternatives.

== Operations ==

=== Splaying ===
When a node &quot;x&quot; is accessed, a splay operation is performed on &quot;x&quot; to move it to the root. A splay operation is a sequence of &quot;splay steps&quot;, each of which moves &quot;x&quot; closer to the root. By performing a splay operation on the node of interest after every access, the recently accessed nodes are kept near the root and the tree remains roughly balanced, so it provides the desired amortized time bounds.

Each particular step depends on three factors:
* Whether &quot;x&quot; is the left or right child of its parent node, &quot;p&quot;,
* whether &quot;p&quot; is the root or not, and if not
* whether &quot;p&quot; is the left or right child of &quot;its&quot; parent, &quot;g&quot; (the &quot;grandparent&quot; of &quot;x&quot;).

There are three types of splay steps, each of which has two symmetric variants: left- and right-handed. For the sake of brevity, only one of these two is shown for each type. (In the following diagrams, circles indicate nodes of interest and triangles indicate sub-trees of arbitrary size.) The three types of splay steps are:

Zig step: this step is done when &quot;p&quot; is the root. The tree is rotated on the edge between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot;. Zig steps exist to deal with the parity issue, will be done only as the last step in a splay operation, and only when &quot;x&quot; has odd depth at the beginning of the operation.

Zig-zig step: this step is done when &quot;p&quot; is not the root and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are either both right children or are both left children. The picture below shows the case where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are both left children. The tree is rotated on the edge joining &quot;p&quot; with &quot;its&quot; parent &quot;g&quot;, then rotated on the edge joining &quot;x&quot; with &quot;p&quot;. Zig-zig steps are the only thing that differentiate splay trees from the &quot;rotate to root&quot; method introduced by Allen and Munro prior to the introduction of splay trees.

Zig-zag step: this step is done when &quot;p&quot; is not the root and &quot;x&quot; is a right child and &quot;p&quot; is a left child or vice versa (&quot;x&quot; is left, &quot;p&quot; is right). The tree is rotated on the edge between &quot;p&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, and then rotated on the resulting edge between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.

=== Join ===
Given two trees S and T such that all elements of S are smaller than the elements of T, the following steps can be used to join them to a single tree:
* Splay the largest item in S. Now this item is in the root of S and has a null right child. 
* Set the right child of the new root to T.

=== Split ===
Given a tree and an element &quot;x&quot;, return two new trees: one containing all elements less than or equal to &quot;x&quot; and the other containing all elements greater than &quot;x&quot;. This can be done in the following way:
* Splay &quot;x&quot;. Now it is in the root so the tree to its left contains all elements smaller than &quot;x&quot; and the tree to its right contains all element larger than &quot;x&quot;. 
* Split the right subtree from the rest of the tree.

=== Insertion ===
To insert a value &quot;x&quot; into a splay tree:
* Insert &quot;x&quot; as with a normal binary search tree.
* Perform a splay on &quot;x&quot;.
As a result, the newly inserted node &quot;x&quot; becomes the root of the tree.

Alternatively:
* Use the split operation to split the tree at the value of &quot;x&quot; to two sub-trees: S and T.
* Create a new tree in which &quot;x&quot; is the root, S is its left sub-tree and T its right sub-tree.

=== Deletion ===
To delete a node &quot;x&quot;, use the same method as with a binary search tree:

* If &quot;x&quot; has two children:
** Swap its value with that of either the rightmost node of its left sub tree (its in-order predecessor) or the leftmost node of its right subtree (its in-order successor).
** Remove that node instead.

In this way, deletion is reduced to the problem of removing a node with 0 or 1 children. Unlike a binary search tree, in a splay tree after deletion, we splay the parent of the removed node to the top of the tree.

Alternatively:

* The node to be deleted is first splayed, i.e. brought to the root of the tree and then deleted. leaves the tree with two sub trees. 
* The two sub-trees are then joined using a &quot;join&quot; operation.

== Implementation and variants ==
Splaying, as mentioned above, is performed during a second, bottom-up pass over the access path of a node. It is possible to record the access path during the first pass for use during the second, but that requires extra space during the access operation. Another alternative is to keep a parent pointer in every node, which avoids the need for extra space during access operations but may reduce overall time efficiency because of the need to update those pointers.

Another method which can be used is based on the argument that the tree can be restructured during the way down the access path instead of making a second pass. This top-down splaying routine uses three sets of nodes – left tree, right tree and middle tree. The first two contain all items of original tree known to be less than or greater than current item respectively. The middle tree consists of the sub-tree rooted at the current node. These three sets are updated down the access path while keeping the splay operations in check. Another method, semisplaying, modifies the zig-zig case to reduce the amount of restructuring done in all operations.

Below there is an implementation of splay trees in C++, which uses pointers to represent each node on the tree. This implementation is based on bottom-up splaying version and uses the second method of deletion on a splay tree. Also, unlike the above definition, this C++ version does &quot;not&quot; splay the tree on finds – it only splays on insertions and deletions, and the find operation, therefore, has linear time complexity.

== Analysis ==
A simple amortized analysis of static splay trees can be carried out using the potential method. Define:
* size(&quot;r&quot;) = the number of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at node &quot;r&quot; (including &quot;r&quot;).
* rank(&quot;r&quot;) = log2(size(&quot;r&quot;)).
* Φ = the sum of the ranks of all the nodes in the tree.

Φ will tend to be high for poorly balanced trees and low for well-balanced trees.

To apply the potential method, we first calculate ΔΦ: the change in the potential caused by a splay operation. We check each case separately. Denote by rank&#x27; the rank function after the operation. x, p and g are the nodes affected by the rotation operation (see figures above).

===Zig step===

===Zig-zig step===

===Zig-zag step===
The amortized cost of any operation is ΔΦ plus the actual cost. The actual cost of any zig-zig or zig-zag operation is 2 since there are two rotations to make. Hence:

When summed over the entire splay operation, this telescopes to 1 + 3(rank(root)−rank(&quot;x&quot;)) which is O(log &quot;n&quot;), since we use The Zig operation at most once and the amortized cost of zig is at most 1+3(rank&#x27;(&quot;x&quot;)−rank(&quot;x&quot;)).

So now we know that the total &quot;amortized&quot; time for a sequence of &quot;m&quot; operations is:
:formula_1

To go from the amortized time to the actual time, we must add the decrease in potential from the initial state before any operation is done (Φ&quot;i&quot;) to the final state after all operations are completed (Φ&quot;f&quot;).

:formula_2

where the big O notation can be justified by the fact that for every node &quot;x&quot;, the minimum rank is 0 and the maximum rank is log(&quot;n&quot;).

Now we can finally bound the actual time:

:formula_3

=== Weighted analysis ===
The above analysis can be generalized in the following way.
* Assign to each node &quot;r&quot; a weight &quot;w&quot;(&quot;r&quot;).
* Define size(&quot;r&quot;) = the sum of weights of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at node &quot;r&quot; (including &quot;r&quot;).
* Define rank(&quot;r&quot;) and Φ exactly as above.

The same analysis applies and the amortized cost of a splaying operation is again:
:formula_4
where &quot;W&quot; is the sum of all weights.

The decrease from the initial to the final potential is bounded by:
:formula_5
since the maximum size of any single node is &quot;W&quot; and the minimum is &quot;w(x)&quot;.

Hence the actual time is bounded by:
:formula_6

== Performance theorems ==

There are several theorems and conjectures regarding the worst-case runtime for performing a sequence &quot;S&quot; of &quot;m&quot; accesses in a splay tree containing &quot;n&quot; elements.





== Dynamic optimality conjecture ==

In addition to the proven performance guarantees for splay trees there is an unproven conjecture of great interest from the original Sleator and Tarjan paper. This conjecture is known as the &quot;dynamic optimality conjecture&quot; and it basically claims that splay trees perform as well as any other binary search tree algorithm up to a constant factor.

:Dynamic Optimality Conjecture: Let formula_7 be any binary search tree algorithm that accesses an element formula_8 by traversing the path from the root to formula_8 at a cost of formula_10, and that between accesses can make any rotations in the tree at a cost of 1 per rotation. Let formula_11 be the cost for formula_7 to perform the sequence formula_13 of accesses. Then the cost for a splay tree to perform the same accesses is formula_14.

There are several corollaries of the dynamic optimality conjecture that remain unproven:

:Traversal Conjecture: Let formula_15 and formula_16 be two splay trees containing the same elements. Let formula_13 be the sequence obtained by visiting the elements in formula_16 in preorder (i.e., depth first search order). The total cost of performing the sequence formula_13 of accesses on formula_15 is formula_21.

:Deque Conjecture: Let formula_13 be a sequence of formula_23 double-ended queue operations (push, pop, inject, eject). Then the cost of performing formula_13 on a splay tree is formula_25.

:Split Conjecture: Let formula_13 be any permutation of the elements of the splay tree. Then the cost of deleting the elements in the order formula_13 is formula_21.

== Variants ==

In order to reduce the number of restructuring operations, it is possible to replace the splaying with &quot;semi-splaying&quot;, in which an element is splayed only halfway towards the root.

Another way to reduce restructuring is to do full splaying, but only in some of the access operations – only when the access path is longer than a threshold, or only in the first &quot;m&quot; access operations.

The CBTree augments the splay tree with access counts at each node and uses them to restructure infrequently. A variant of the CBTree called the LazyCBTree does at most one rotation on each lookup. This is used along with an optimistic hand-over-hand validation scheme to make a concurrent self-adjusting tree.

Using pointer-compression techniques, it is possible to construct a succinct splay tree.

<text>The meaning of spirituality has developed and expanded over time, and various meanings can be found alongside each other. Traditionally, spirituality referred to a religious process of re-formation which &quot;aims to recover the original shape of man&quot;, oriented at &quot;the image of God&quot; as exemplified by the founders and sacred texts of the religions of the world. The term was used within early Christianity to refer to a life oriented toward the Holy Spirit and broadened during the Late Middle Ages to include mental aspects of life.

In modern times, the term both spread to other religious traditions and broadened to refer to a wider range of experiences, including a range of esoteric and religious traditions. Modern usages tend to refer to a subjective experience of a sacred dimension, and the &quot;deepest values and meanings by which people live&quot;, often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. This may involve belief in a supernatural realm beyond the ordinarily observable world, personal growth, a quest for an ultimate or sacred meaning, religious experience, or an encounter with one&#x27;s own &quot;inner dimension&quot; or spirit.

==Etymology==
The term spirit means &quot;animating or vital principle in man and animals&quot;. It is derived from the Old French , which comes from the Latin word (soul, ghost, courage, vigor, breath) and is related to &quot;spirare&quot; (to breathe). In the Vulgate, the Latin word is used to translate the Greek &quot;pneuma&quot; and Hebrew &quot;ruach&quot;.

The term &quot;spiritual&quot;, meaning &quot;concerning the spirit&quot;, is derived from Old French (12c.), which is derived from Latin , which comes by or &quot;spirit&quot;.

The term &quot;spirituality&quot; is derived from Middle French &#x27;, from Late Latin (nominative ), which is also derived from Latin &#x27;.

==Definition==
There is no single, widely agreed-upon definition of spirituality. Surveys of the definition of the term, as used in scholarly research, show a broad range of definitions with limited overlap. A survey of reviews by McCarroll, each dealing with the topic of spirituality, gave twenty-seven explicit definitions among which &quot;there was little agreement&quot;. This causes some difficulty in trying to study spirituality systematically; i.e., it impedes both understanding and the capacity to communicate findings in a meaningful fashion.

According to Kees Waaijman, the traditional meaning of spirituality is a process of re-formation that &quot;aims to recover the original shape of man, the image of God. To accomplish this, the re-formation is oriented at a mold, which represents the original shape: in Judaism the Torah, in Christianity there is Christ, for Buddhism, Buddha, and in Islam, Muhammad.&quot; Houtman and Aupers suggest that modern spirituality is a blend of humanistic psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions, and Eastern religions.

In modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience and the &quot;deepest values and meanings by which people live&quot;, incorporating personal growth or transformation, usually in a context separate from organized religious institutions. Spirituality can be defined generally as an individual&#x27;s search for ultimate or sacred meaning, and purpose in life. Additionally it can mean to seek out or search for personal growth, religious experience, belief in a supernatural realm or afterlife, or to make sense of one&#x27;s own &quot;inner dimension&quot;.

==Development of the meaning of spirituality==

===Classical, medieval, and early modern periods===
Bergomi detects &quot;an enlightened form of non-religious spirituality&quot; in late antiquity.

In ancient Rome, the concept of spirituality consisted mainly of the pax deorum (the peace of the gods), this was achieved through rituals and festivals that ensured divine favour and cosmic order. While Roman spirituality was communal, it also involved personal engagement with the divine through the study of mythology and philosophy. Myths served as allegories for moral lessons and models for personal conduct, guiding individuals in their relationship with the gods. The influence of Pythagorean philosophy, especially the Golden Verses, encouraged introspection, self-discipline, and ethical living. This blend of myth, philosophy, and ritual shaped a spirituality focused on both societal harmony and personal connection with the divine.

Words translatable as &quot;spirituality&quot; first began to arise in the 5th century and only entered common use toward the end of the Middle Ages. In a Biblical context the term means being animated by God. The New Testament offers the concept of being driven by the Holy Spirit, as opposed to living a life in which one rejects this influence.

In the 11th century, this meaning of &quot;Spirituality&quot; changed. Instead, the word began to denote the mental aspect of life, as opposed to the material and sensual aspects of life, &quot;the ecclesiastical sphere of light against the dark world of matter&quot;. In the 13th century &quot;spirituality&quot; acquired a social and psychological meaning. Socially it denoted the territory of the clergy: &quot;the ecclesiastical against the temporary possessions, the ecclesiastical against the secular authority, the clerical class against the secular class&quot;. Psychologically, it denoted the realm of the inner life: &quot;the purity of motives, affections, intentions, inner dispositions, the psychology of the spiritual life, the analysis of the feelings&quot;.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, a distinction was made between higher and lower forms of spirituality: &quot;A spiritual man is one who is Christian &#x27;more abundantly and deeper than others&#x27;.&quot; The word was also associated with mysticism and quietism, and acquired a negative meaning.

===Modern spirituality===
Modern notions of spirituality developed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, mixing Christian ideas with Western esoteric traditions and elements of Asian, especially Indian, religions. Spirituality became increasingly disconnected from traditional religious organizations and institutions. It is sometimes associated today with philosophical, social, or political movements such as liberalism, feminist theology, and green politics.

====Modern Roman religion====

In modern Roman neopagan spirituality, initiation is a central element that facilitates deeper spiritual development and access to sacred knowledge. It is viewed as a transformative process, guiding the initiate through stages of spiritual growth. Initiation introduces the individual to the esoteric meanings of Roman myths, deities, and the concept of pax deorum (peace of the gods), aligning the individual with cosmic order. This process not only prepares the initiate for participation in rituals but also emphasizes personal alignment with the divine will. As such, initiation is both a rite of passage and a means to engage meaningfully with divine forces, ensuring the individual&#x27;s spiritual preparedness to uphold the traditions of Roman religious practice.

====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====
Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field. He was one of the major figures in Transcendentalism, an early 19th-century liberal Protestant movement, which was rooted in English and German Romanticism, the Biblical criticism of Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher, the skepticism of Hume, and Neoplatonism.
The Transcendentalists emphasized an intuitive, experiential approach to religion. Following Schleiermacher, an individual&#x27;s intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth. In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking. They also endorsed universalist and Unitarianist ideas, leading to Unitarian Universalism, the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.

====Theosophy, anthroposophy, and the perennial philosophy====
A major influence on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for &#x27;secret teachings&#x27; in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, the revival of Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. A second, related influence was Anthroposophy, whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and in the ways that such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine. More independently, the spiritual science of Martinus was an influence, especially in Scandinavia.

The influence of Asian traditions on Western modern spirituality was also furthered by the perennial philosophy, whose main proponent Aldous Huxley was deeply influenced by Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s Neo-Vedanta and universalism, and the spread of social welfare, education and mass travel after World War II.

====Neo-Vedanta====
An important influence on western spirituality was Neo-Vedanta, also called &quot;neo-Hinduism&quot; and &quot;Hindu Universalism&quot;, a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism. It aims to present Hinduism as a &quot;homogenized ideal of Hinduism&quot; with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine. Due to the colonisation of Asia by the western world, since the 19th century an exchange of ideas has been taking place between the western world and Asia, which also influenced western religiosity. Unitarianism, and the idea of Universalism, was brought to India by missionaries, and had a major influence on neo-Hinduism via Ram Mohan Roy&#x27;s Brahmo Samaj and Brahmoism. Roy attempted to modernise and reform Hinduism, from the idea of Universalism. This universalism was further popularised, and brought back to the west as neo-Vedanta, by Swami Vivekananda.

====&quot;Spiritual but not religious&quot;====

After the Second World War, spirituality and theistic religion became increasingly disconnected, and spirituality became more oriented on subjective experience, instead of &quot;attempts to place the self within a broader ontological context&quot;. A new discourse developed, in which (humanistic) psychology, mystical and esoteric traditions and eastern religions are being blended, to reach the true self by self-disclosure, free expression, and meditation.

The distinction between the spiritual and the religious became more common in the popular mind during the late 20th century with the rise of secularism and the advent of the New Age movement. Authors such as Chris Griscom and Shirley MacLaine explored it in numerous ways in their books. Paul Heelas noted the development within New Age circles of what he called &quot;seminar spirituality&quot;: structured offerings complementing consumer choice with spiritual options.

Among other factors, declining membership of organized religions and the growth of secularism in the western world have given rise to this broader view of spirituality. The term &quot;spiritual&quot; is now frequently used in contexts in which the term &quot;religious&quot; was formerly employed. Both theists and atheists have criticized this development.

==Traditional spirituality==

===Abrahamic faiths===

====Judaism====
Spirituality in Judaism () may involve practices of Jewish ethics, Jewish prayer, Jewish meditation, Shabbat and holiday observance, Torah study, dietary laws, teshuvah, and other practices. It may involve practices ordained by halakhah or other practices.

Kabbalah (literally &quot;receiving&quot;) is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought of Judaism. Kabbalah is a set of esoteric teachings meant to explain the relationship between an unchanging, eternal and mysterious Ein Sof (no end) and the mortal and finite universe (his creation). Interpretations of Kabbalistic spirituality are found within Hasidic Judaism, a branch of Orthodox Judaism founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov. Hasidism often emphasizes the Immanent Divine presence and focuses on emotion, fervour, and the figure of the Tzadik. This movement included an elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism.

The Musar movement is a Jewish spiritual movement that has focused on developing character traits such as faith, humility, and love. The Musar movement, first founded in the 19th century by Israel Salanter and developed in the 21st century by Alan Morinis and Ira F. Stone, has encouraged spiritual practices of Jewish meditation, Jewish prayer, Jewish ethics, tzedakah, teshuvah, and the study of musar (ethical) literature.

Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have often emphasized the spirituality of Jewish ethics and tikkun olam, feminist spirituality, Jewish prayer, Torah study, ritual, and musar.

====Christianity====

Christian spirituality is the spiritual practice of living out a personal faith. Pope Francis offers several ways in which the calling of Christian spirituality can be considered:
*&quot;Christian spirituality proposes an alternative understanding of the quality of life, and encourages a prophetic and contemplative lifestyle, one capable of deep enjoyment free of the obsession with consumption&quot;;
*&quot;Christian spirituality proposes a growth marked by moderation and the capacity to be happy with little.&quot;
*Work, with an understanding of its meaning, and relaxation are both important dimensions of Christian spirituality.

The terminology of the Catholic Church refers to an act of faith (&quot;fides qua creditur&quot;) following the acceptance of faith (&quot;fides quae creditur&quot;). Although all Catholics are expected to pray together at Mass, there are many different forms of spirituality and private prayer which have developed over the centuries. Each of the major religious orders of the Catholic Church and other lay groupings have their own unique spirituality – its own way of approaching God in prayer and in living out the Gospel.

Christian mysticism refers to the development of mystical practices and theory within Christianity. It has often been connected to mystical theology, especially in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied and range from ecstatic visions of the soul&#x27;s mystical union with God to simple prayerful contemplation of Holy Scripture (i.e., &quot;Lectio Divina&quot;).

Progressive Christianity is a contemporary movement which seeks to remove the supernatural claims of the faith and replace them with a post-critical understanding of biblical spirituality based on historical and scientific research. It focuses on the lived experience of spirituality over historical dogmatic claims, and accepts that the faith is both true and a human construction, and that spiritual experiences are psychologically and neurally real and useful.

====Islam====
An inner spiritual struggle and an outer physical struggle are two commonly accepted meanings of the Arabic word &quot;jihad&quot;: The &quot;greater jihad&quot; is the inner struggle by a believer to fulfill his religious duties and fight against one&#x27;s ego. This non-violent meaning is stressed by both Muslim and non-Muslim authors.

Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, an 11th-century Islamic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of Muhammad, Jabir ibn Abd-Allah:
=====Sufism=====

The best known form of Islamic mystic spirituality is the Sufi tradition (famous through Rumi and Hafiz) in which a Sheikh or &quot;pir&quot; transmits spiritual discipline to students.

Sufism or () is defined by its adherents as the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. A practitioner of this tradition is generally known as a &quot;&quot; (). Sufis believe they are practicing ihsan (perfection of worship) as revealed by Gabriel to Muhammad,
Sufis consider themselves as the original true proponents of this pure original form of Islam. They are strong adherents to the principal of tolerance, peace and against any form of violence. The Sufi have suffered severe persecution by more rigid and fundamentalist groups such as the Wahhabi and Salafi movement. In 1843 the Senussi Sufi were forced to flee Mecca and Medina and head to Sudan and Libya.

Classical Sufi scholars have defined Sufism as &quot;a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God&quot;. Alternatively, in the words of the Darqawi Sufi teacher Ahmad ibn Ajiba, &quot;a science through which one can know how to travel into the presence of the Divine, purify one&#x27;s inner self from filth, and beautify it with a variety of praiseworthy traits&quot;.

===Indian religions===

==== Jainism ====
Jainism, traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahiṃsā (non-violence), anekāntavāda (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (non-attachment). Jains take five main vows: ahiṃsā (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (not stealing), brahmacharya (sexual continence), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly vegetarian lifestyle. Parasparopagraho jīvānām (the function of souls is to help one another) is the faith&#x27;s motto and the Ṇamōkāra mantra is its most common and basic prayer.

Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through a succession of twenty-four leaders or Tirthankaras, with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago; the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, whom historians date to 9th century BCE; and the twenty-fourth tirthankara, Mahavira around 600 BCE. Jainism is considered to be an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology.

====Buddhism====

Buddhist practices are known as Bhavana, which literally means &quot;development&quot; or &quot;cultivating&quot; or &quot;producing&quot; in the sense of &quot;calling into existence&quot;. It is an important concept in Buddhist praxis (&quot;Patipatti&quot;). The word &quot;bhavana&quot; normally appears in conjunction with another word forming a compound phrase such as &quot;citta-bhavana&quot; (the development or cultivation of the heart/mind) or &quot;metta-bhavana&quot; (the development/cultivation of loving kindness). When used on its own &quot;bhavana&quot; signifies &#x27;spiritual cultivation&#x27; generally.

Various Buddhist paths to liberation developed throughout the ages. Best-known is the Noble Eightfold Path, but others include the Bodhisattva Path and Lamrim.

====Hinduism====
Hinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophets nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, henotheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, or atheistic. Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitrajña (). It defines spiritual practice as one&#x27;s journey towards moksha, awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, Ultimate reality, and a consciousness that is liberated and content.

=====Four paths=====
Traditionally, Hinduism identifies three &quot;mārga&quot; (ways) of spiritual practice, namely Jñāna (ज्ञान), the way of knowledge; Bhakti, the way of devotion; and Karma yoga, the way of selfless action. In the 19th century Vivekananda, in his neo-Vedanta synthesis of Hinduism, added Rāja yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation, as a fourth way, calling all of them &quot;yoga&quot;.

Jñāna marga is a path often assisted by a &quot;guru&quot; (teacher) in one&#x27;s spiritual practice. Bhakti marga is a path of faith and devotion to deity or deities; the spiritual practice often includes chanting, singing and music – such as in &quot;kirtans&quot; – in front of idols, or images of one or more deity, or a devotional symbol of the holy. Karma marga is the path of one&#x27;s work, where diligent practical work or &quot;vartta&quot; (, profession) becomes in itself a spiritual practice, and work in daily life is perfected as a form of spiritual liberation and not for its material rewards. Rāja marga is the path of cultivating necessary virtues, self-discipline, &quot;tapas&quot; (meditation), contemplation and self-reflection sometimes with isolation and renunciation of the world, to a pinnacle state called &quot;samādhi&quot;. This state of &quot;samādhi&quot; has been compared to peak experience.

There is a rigorous debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in &quot;tapas&quot; will succeed; Shvetashvatara Upanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires a longing for truth, but warns of becoming &#x27;false ascetic&#x27; who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating on the nature of Self and universal Truths. In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda, the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person&#x27;s proclivities. Other scholars suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism, where it is called &quot;Chatur Marga&quot; (literally: four paths).

=====Schools and spirituality=====
Different schools of Hinduism encourage different spiritual practices. In Tantric school for example, the spiritual practice has been referred to as &quot;sādhanā&quot;. It involves initiation into the school, undergoing rituals, and achieving moksha liberation by experiencing union of cosmic polarities. The Hare Krishna school emphasizes bhakti yoga as spiritual practice. In Advaita Vedanta school, the spiritual practice emphasizes jñāna yoga in stages: samnyasa (cultivate virtues), sravana (hear, study), manana (reflect) and dhyana (nididhyasana, contemplate).

====Sikhism====

Sikhism considers spiritual life and secular life to be intertwined: &quot;In the Sikh Weltanschauung ... the temporal world is part of the Infinite Reality and partakes of its characteristics.&quot; Guru Nanak described living an &quot;active, creative, and practical life&quot; of &quot;truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity&quot; as being higher than a purely contemplative life.

The 6th Sikh Guru Guru Hargobind re-affirmed that the political/temporal (Miri) and spiritual (Piri) realms are mutually coexistent. According to the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadhur, the ideal Sikh should have both Shakti (power that resides in the temporal), and Bhakti (spiritual meditative qualities). This was developed into the concept of the Saint Soldier by the 10th Sikh Guru, Gobind Singh.

According to Guru Nanak, the goal is to attain the &quot;attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life&quot;, the polar opposite to a self-centered existence. Nanak talks further about the one God or akal (timelessness) that permeates all life). and which must be seen with &#x27;the inward eye&#x27;, or the &#x27;heart&#x27;, of a human being.

In Sikhism there is no dogma, priests, monastics or yogis.

===African spirituality===

In some African contexts, spirituality is considered a belief system that guides the welfare of society and the people therein, and eradicates sources of unhappiness occasioned by evil.
In traditional society prior to colonization and extensive introduction to Christianity or Islam, religion was the strongest element in society influencing the thinking and actions of the people. Hence spirituality was a sub-domain of religion. Despite the rapid social, economic and political changes of the last century, traditional religion remains the essential background for many African people. And that religion is a communal given, not an individual choice. Religion gives all of life its meaning and provides ground for action. Each person is &quot;a living creed of his religion&quot;. There is no concern for spiritual matters apart from ones physical and communal life. Life continues after death but remains focused on pragmatic family and community matters.

==Contemporary spirituality==
The term &quot;spiritual&quot; has frequently become used in contexts in which the term &quot;religious&quot; was formerly employed. Contemporary spirituality is also called &quot;post-traditional spirituality&quot; and &quot;New Age spirituality&quot;. Hanegraaf makes a distinction between two &quot;New Age&quot; movements: New Age in a restricted sense, which originated primarily in mid-twentieth century England and had its roots in Theosophy and Anthroposophy, and &quot;New Age&quot; in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s:
Those who speak of spirituality outside of religion often define themselves as &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, and generally believe in the existence of different &quot;spiritual paths&quot;, emphasizing the importance of finding one&#x27;s own individual path to spirituality. According to one 2005 poll, about 24% of the United States population identifies itself as &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;.

Lockwood draws attention to the variety of spiritual experience in the contemporary West:
The new Western spiritual landscape, characterised by consumerism and choice abundance, is scattered with novel religious manifestations based in psychology and the Human Potential Movement, each offering participants a pathway to the Self.
Those who speak of spirituality within religion also recognise the need for spirituality to take on a contemporary form: thus, for example, Pope Francis refers to and reflects on &quot;contemporary devotion&quot; in his encyclical letter &quot;Dilexit nos&quot; issued in 2024.

===Characteristics===
Modern spirituality centers on the &quot;deepest values and meanings by which people live&quot;. It often embraces the idea of an ultimate or an alleged immaterial reality. It envisions an inner path enabling a person to discover the essence of his or her being.

Not all modern notions of spirituality embrace transcendental ideas. Secular spirituality emphasizes humanistic ideas on moral character (qualities such as love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, responsibility, harmony, and a concern for others). These are aspects of life and human experience which go beyond a purely materialist view of the world without necessarily accepting belief in a supernatural reality or any divine being. Nevertheless, many humanists (e.g. Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre) who clearly value the non-material, communal, and virtuous aspects of life reject this usage of the term &quot;spirituality&quot; as being overly-broad (i.e. it effectively amounts to saying &quot;everything and anything that is good and virtuous is &quot;necessarily&quot; spiritual&quot;). In 1930 Russell, a self-described agnostic renowned as an atheist, wrote &quot;... one&#x27;s ego is no very large part of the world. The man who can centre his thoughts and hopes upon something transcending self can find a certain peace in the ordinary troubles of life which is impossible to the pure egoist.&quot;
Similarly, Aristotle – one of the first known Western thinkers to demonstrate that morality, virtue and goodness can be derived without appealing to supernatural forces – argued that &quot;men create Gods in their own image&quot; (not the other way around). Moreover, theistic and atheistic critics alike dismiss the need for the &quot;secular spirituality&quot; label on the basis that it appears to be nothing more than obscurantism in that:
* the term &quot;spirit&quot; is commonly taken as denoting the existence of unseen / otherworldly / life-giving forces; and
* words such as &quot;morality&quot;, &quot;philanthropy&quot; and &quot;humanism&quot; already efficiently and succinctly describe the prosocial-orientation and civility that the phrase &quot;secular spirituality&quot; is meant to convey but without risking confusion that one is referring to something supernatural.

Although personal well-being, both physical and psychological, is said to be an important aspect of modern spirituality, this does not imply that spirituality is &quot;essential&quot; to achieving happiness (e.g. see ). Free-thinkers who reject notions that the numinous or non-material is important to living well can be just as happy as more spiritually-oriented individuals (see)

Contemporary proponents of spirituality may suggest that spirituality develops inner peace and forms a foundation for happiness. For example, meditation and similar practices are suggested to help the practitioner cultivate a personal inner life and character. Ellison and Fan (2008) assert that spirituality &quot;causes&quot; a wide array of positive health outcomes, including &quot;morale, happiness, and life satisfaction&quot;. However, Schuurmans-Stekhoven (2013) actively attempted to replicate this research and found more &quot;mixed&quot; results. Nevertheless, spirituality has played a central role in some self-help movements such as Alcoholics Anonymous:

Such spiritually-informed treatment approaches have been challenged as pseudoscience.

===Spiritual experience===

Spiritual experiences play a central role in modern spirituality. Both western and Asian authors have popularised this notion. Important early-20th century Western writers who studied the phenomenon of spirituality, and their works, include William James, &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902) and Rudolph Otto, especially &quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot; (1917)

James&#x27; notions of &quot;spiritual experience&quot; had a further influence on the modernist streams in Asian traditions, making them even further recognisable for a western audience.

William James popularized the use of the term &quot;religious experience&quot; in his &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. He has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which allegedly grants knowledge.

Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a &quot;feeling&quot; of the infinite. Schleiermacher used the idea of &quot;religious experience&quot; to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. Many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential, adopted the concept.

Major Asian influences on contemporary spirituality have included Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) and D. T. Suzuki. (1870–1966) Vivekananda popularised a modern syncretic Hinduism, in which an emphasis on personal experience replaced the authority of scriptures. Suzuki had a major influence on the popularisation of Zen in the west and popularized the idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality. Other influences came through Paul Brunton&#x27;s &quot;A Search in Secret India&quot; (1934), which introduced Ramana Maharshi (1879–1950) and Meher Baba (1894–1969) to a western audience.

Spiritual experiences can include being connected to a larger reality, yielding a more comprehensive self; joining with other individuals or the human community; with nature or the cosmos; or with the divine realm.

===Spiritual practices===

Kees Waaijman discerns four forms of spiritual practices:
# Somatic practices, especially deprivation and diminishment. Deprivation aims to purify the body. Diminishment concerns the repulsement of ego-oriented impulses. Examples include fasting and poverty.
# Psychological practices, for example meditation.
# Social practices. Examples include the practice of obedience and communal ownership, reforming ego-orientedness into other-orientedness.
# Spiritual. All practices aim at purifying ego-centeredness, and direct the abilities at the divine reality.

Spiritual practices may include meditation, mindfulness, prayer, the contemplation of sacred texts, ethical development,
and spiritual retreats in a convent. Love and/or compassion are often described as the mainstay of spiritual development.

Within spirituality is also found &quot;a common emphasis on the value of thoughtfulness, tolerance for breadth and practices and beliefs, and appreciation for the insights of other religious communities, as well as other sources of authority within the social sciences.&quot;

==Scientific research==

===Health and well-being===
Various studies (most originating from North America) have reported a positive correlation between spirituality and mental well-being in both healthy people and those encountering a range of physical illnesses or psychological disorders. Although spiritual individuals tend to be optimistic, report greater social support, and experience higher intrinsic meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, whether the correlation represents a causal link remains contentious. Both supporters and opponents of this claim agree that past statistical findings are difficult to interpret, in large part because of the ongoing disagreement over how spirituality should be defined and measured. There is also evidence that an agreeable/positive temperament and/or a tendency toward sociability (which all correlate with spirituality) might actually be the key psychological features that predispose people to subsequently adopt a spiritual orientation and that these characteristics, not spiritually &quot;per se&quot;, add to well-being. There is also some suggestion that the benefits associated with spirituality and religiosity might arise from being a member of a close-knit community. Social bonds available via secular sources (i.e., not unique to spirituality or faith-based groups) might just as effectively raise well-being. In sum, spirituality may not be the &quot;active ingredient&quot; (i.e., past association with psychological well-being measures might reflect a reverse causation or effects from other variables that correlate with spirituality), and that the effects of agreeableness, conscientiousness, or virtue – personality traits common in many non-spiritual people yet known to be slightly more common among the spiritual – may better account for spirituality&#x27;s apparent correlation with mental health and social support.

===Intercessionary prayer===
Masters and Spielmans conducted a meta-analysis of all the available and reputable research examining the effects of distant intercessory prayer. They found no discernible health effects from being prayed for by others. In fact, one large and scientifically rigorous study by Herbert Benson and colleagues revealed that intercessory prayer had no effect on recovery from cardiac arrest, but patients told people were praying for them actually had an &quot;increased risk&quot; of medical complications.

====Spiritual care in health care professions====
In the health-care professions there is growing interest in &quot;spiritual care&quot;, to complement the medical-technical approaches and to improve the outcomes of medical treatments. Puchalski et al. argue for &quot;compassionate systems of care&quot; in a spiritual context.

===Spiritual experiences===
Neuroscientists have examined brain functioning during reported spiritual experiences finding that certain neurotransmitters and specific areas of the brain are involved. Moreover, experimenters have also successfully induced spiritual experiences in individuals by administering psychoactive agents known to elicit euphoria and perceptual distortions. Conversely, religiosity and spirituality can also be &quot;dampened&quot; by electromagnetic stimulation of the brain. These results have motivated some leading theorists to speculate that spirituality may be a benign subtype of psychosis – benign in the sense that the same aberrant sensory perceptions that those suffering clinical psychoses evaluate as distressingly incongruent and inexplicable are instead interpreted by spiritual individuals as positive (personal and meaningful transcendent experiences).

===Measurement===
Considerable debate persists about – among other factors – spirituality&#x27;s relation to religion, the number and content of its dimensions, its relation to concepts of well-being, and its universality. A number of research groups have developed instruments which attempt to measure spirituality quantitatively, including unidimensional (e.g. the Character Strength Inventory—Spirituality and the Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale) and multi-dimensional (e.g. Spiritual Transcendence Scale (STS) and the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS)) scales. MacDonald et al. gave an &quot;Expressions of Spirituality Inventory&quot; (ESI-R) measuring five dimensions of spirituality to over 4000 persons across eight countries. The study results and interpretation highlighted the complexity and challenges of measurement of spirituality cross-culturally.

<doc id="28388" wikidata="Q1412179" url="?curid=28388" title="List of The Sandman characters">
<text>This is a list of characters appearing in &quot;[[The Sandman (comic book)|The Sandman]]&quot; comic book, published by DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint. This page discusses not only events which occur in &quot;The Sandman&quot; (1989–1994), but also some occurring in spinoffs of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, such as &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1996–2001) and &quot;Lucifer&quot; (1999–2007), as well as characters from earlier stories which &quot;The Sandman&quot; was based on. These stories occur in the DC Universe, but are generally tangential to the mainstream DC stories.

==The Endless==

The Endless are a family of seven anthropomorphic personifications of universal concepts, around whom much of the series revolves. They are the children of Mother Night and Father Time. From eldest to youngest, they are:

* Destiny
* Death
* Dream (formerly Morpheus, succeeded by Daniel)
* Destruction (&quot;The Prodigal&quot;)
* Desire
* Despair
* Delirium (formerly &quot;Delight&quot;)

All debuted in the &quot;Sandman&quot; series, except Destiny, who was created by Marv Wolfman and Berni Wrightson in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #1 (1972).

==Dreams and nightmares==
These inhabitants of the Dreaming are often gods, myths, and even ordinary human beings who later became either dreams or nightmares.

===Cain and Abel===
Cain and Abel are based on the Biblical Cain and Abel, adapted by editor Joe Orlando with Bob Haney (writer) and Jack Sparling (artist) (Cain), and Mark Hannerfeld (writer) and Bill Draut (artist) (Abel). They were depicted together in Abel&#x27;s first appearance, and parted to their respective Houses at the end of the story. Although Cain would abuse Abel, he was not shown killing him until &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; vol. 2 #33. In &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot; #11, Cain expresses shock at having killed his brother in recent times. In the same issue, a contest-winning letter establishes that Cain and the House exist both in the dream world and the real world, and that only in the dream world does Cain continue to harm Abel. In &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Cain is shown to kill Abel quite often. In issue #2, Lucien calls this unusual and recent.

Originally, they were the respective &quot;hosts&quot; of the EC-style horror comic anthologies &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and &quot;House of Secrets&quot; which ran from the 1950s through 1983—Cain debuting in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #175 (1968) and Abel in &quot;DC Special&quot; #4 and &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #81 (both 1969). During the 1970s, they also co-hosted the horror/humor anthology &quot;Plop!&quot;. They were also both recurring characters in DC&#x27;s &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot; (1986–1988).

In 1985, the characters were revived by writer Alan Moore, who introduced them into his &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series in issue #33, retelling the Swamp Thing&#x27;s original origin story from a 1971 issue of &quot;House of Secrets&quot;. Gary Cohn and Dan Mishkin included them in the pages of &quot;Blue Devil&quot; in 1986. Jamie Delano also occasionally used them in a cameo role in his title &quot;Hellblazer&quot;.

In Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; universe, the biblical Cain and Abel live in the Dreaming at Dream&#x27;s invitation. This is based on the verse in the Bible which says that Cain was sent to live in the Land of Nod. They live as neighbors in two houses near a graveyard: Cain in the broad House of Mystery and Abel in the tall House of Secrets. According to their appearance in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, the difference is that &#x27;a mystery may be shared, but a secret must be forgotten if one tries to tell it&#x27;.

Gaiman&#x27;s Cain is an aggressive, overbearing character. He is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. He has been described by other characters as sounding &quot;just like Vincent Price&quot;.

Gaiman&#x27;s Abel is a nervous but kind-hearted man. He also has a stammer. He is somewhat similar in appearance to Cain, with a tufty beard and hair that comes to points above his ears, though his hair is black rather than brown. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. It is eventually learned that the only time he does not stutter is when he is telling a story or when he is dead.

Cain kills Abel frequently and in many brutal ways, whereupon Abel later returns to life. He often expresses hope for a more harmonious relationship with his brother.

Cain and Abel own a large green draconic gargoyle named Gregory, who also made his debut in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #175. In the first appearance of the characters in &quot;Sandman&quot;, issue #2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel names the gargoyle &quot;Irving&quot;. but Cain insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a &quot;G.&quot;, and Abel (after another death and resurrection) renames the gargoyle &quot;Goldie&quot;, after an invisible/imaginary friend to whom Abel told his early &quot;House of Secrets&quot; stories. A letter in issue #91 was attributed to Goldie, who claimed that it was herself depicted on the cover of issue #88.

They shelter Dream until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth story arc, &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, Cain is sent to Hell to give a message to Lucifer because Cain is protected by a curse that would deter Lucifer from harming him. Cain and Abel also aid The Corinthian with the child Daniel during &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, the penultimate story arc of the series. Abel is one of the victims of the Furies in this series and is brought back to life by the new Dream at Cain&#x27;s request.

In the podcast, Cain and Abel are voiced by Michael Roberts and Kerry Shale.

In the Netflix series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Cain and Abel are portrayed by Sanjeev Bhaskar and Asim Chaudhry respectively.

===The Corinthian===

The Corinthian is a nightmare created by Dream, of human appearance but with two small additional mouths in place of his eyes. He enjoys eating the eyeballs of people he kills.

The first version of the Corinthian is destroyed by Dream while speaking at a &quot;Cereal Convention&quot; for spending several unsupervised decades on Earth as a serial killer (in Dream&#x27;s view, a waste of his potential), and it is shown in &quot;The Sandman: Overture&quot; (2013) that Dream intended to do this before his imprisonment.

Near the end of the series, Dream creates a second Corinthian, altering his personality to be obedient and useful rather than homicidal. In a later story in &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, the second Corinthian is haunted by the actions of the first.

In the podcast, the Corinthian is voiced by Riz Ahmed.

The Corinthian is portrayed by Boyd Holbrook in the Netflix series, having a more expanded role before the Doll&#x27;s House arc. He is shown to manipulate circumstances regarding Ethel Cripps&#x27; death and behaves in a much less hostile way to Jed Walker, appearing to not desire to harm him. He is also shown as gay or pansexual in the series, often having sex with his male victims before killing them.

===Eve===

Eve is a special character who has been seen in the &quot;Lucifer&quot; series and is depicted as living in a cave in The Dreaming.

===Fiddler&#x27;s Green===
Fiddler&#x27;s Green is the personification of a place in the Dreaming which all travelers (specifically sailors) dream of someday finding. It sometimes assumes human form and goes wandering under the alias Gilbert, a kindly, portly man who resembles G. K. Chesterton (the G stood for Gilbert) in appearance and behavior. As &quot;Gilbert&quot;, Fiddler&#x27;s Green accompanied Rose Walker to find her brother Jed and gave her the means by which to summon Dream to rescue her from danger at the Cereal Convention that the Corinthian was speaking at. Afterwards, Fiddler&#x27;s Green thereafter returned to the Dreaming and resumed his true form before Rose. He was killed by the Three in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; and refused to be resurrected by the new Dream as his death will have no meaning. Here, it is implied that he was &quot;in love, a little&quot; with Rose. Dream allows Fiddler&#x27;s Green to return to the dead.

In the podcast, Fiddler&#x27;s Green is voiced by Ray Porter.

In the Netflix series, Fiddler&#x27;s Green is portrayed by Stephen Fry. This version of Gilbert has a slightly smaller role than in the comics, but still accompanies Rose to the Cereal Convention (under the name of &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot;, the name of an unseen serial killer in that issue whose name was seen on a piece of paper). Following Corinthian&#x27;s defeat, Fiddlers&#x27; Green returns to his true form upon returning to the Dreaming.

===Gate Keepers===
A wyvern, a griffin and a hippogriff are the gate keepers of Dream&#x27;s castle and are also referred to as the Guardians of the Gate. The wyvern was more land dragon-like and had no dragon wings until later appearances, the griffin also had a lion mane, and the hippogriff was depicted with a winged horse-like appearance. The gate keepers often intercept anyone from entering Dream&#x27;s Ghost Castle. They derive all their power and authority from Dream so when Dream was captured and lost his power, they could no longer guard or protect the Dreaming.

Their first comic book appearance was in &quot;Dream of a Thousand Cats&quot; where the Siamese Cat had to get past them in order to see the Cat of Dreams.

In issue #24, the Guardians of the Gate see a lot of envoys showing up at the Ghost Castle in light of Lucifer&#x27;s abdication. The Griffin sends a message through his statue in the throne room to inform Dream about it and that the Guardians of the Gate can&#x27;t keep them all back. Dream instructs the Griffin to tell his fellow Guardians of the Gate to let them in.

After the Griffin was destroyed by the Three in their Furies aspect, the new Dream did not recreate him. Instead, he asked the Gryphons of Greek myth to send one of their own. The Queen of Gryphons dispatches a Gryphon of Arimapsa to replace the Dreaming&#x27;s Griffin. When Matthew meets this Gryphon (who is depicted with cattle-like hooves for back legs) and informs him of being the only Griffin of his land to meet the new Dream&#x27;s requirements, he informs Matthew that his land of Arimapsa is somewhere far from the Dreaming. The Guardians of the Gate state to Matthew that they have been sent by the new Dream to attend Dream&#x27;s wake, but opted not to leave their post. (&quot;The Sandman&quot; Vol. 2 #71)

In the podcast, the Wyvern, the Griffin, and the Hippogriff are voiced by Harry Myers, Ray Porter, and Tom Alexander.

In the Netflix series, the Wyvern, the Griffin, and the Hippogriff are shown on the castle where the Wyvern resembled his mythological depiction. The animated episode &quot;Dream of a Thousand Cats&quot; features the three characters in the Siamese cat prophet&#x27;s dream where they are voiced by Nonso Anozie, Diane Morgan, and Tom Wu respectively.

===Gregory===

Gregory is the pet gargoyle of Cain.

Gregory appears in the Netflix series. He was willingly absorbed by Dream in order to help restore the Dreaming prior to Dream&#x27;s quest to reclaim his stolen items.

===Goldie===
Goldie is a fictional character in &quot;The Sandman&quot; comic book series by Neil Gaiman.

Goldie is a pet baby gargoyle, given to Abel by his brother Cain in &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;. Abel originally intends to name him Irving, but Cain insists that gargoyle names must all begin with a &quot;G&quot;. Cain then proceeded to murder Abel over this. Abel soon returns as he is murdered by Cain all the time. He then agrees to name the gargoyle Goldie, after &quot;an old friend&quot;, though he tells Goldie in private that he will continue to think of him as Irving.

Goldie appears for a short scene in &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in which he is sitting upon Abel&#x27;s shoulder as Lucien asks Abel about the inhabitants of the house. He later appears throughout the &quot;Parliament of Rooks&quot; story in &quot;Fables and Reflections&quot;, and briefly at the beginning of &quot;Brief Lives&quot;. He also accompanies Abel in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; and is with him when he gets murdered by the Furies, crying when his master is killed. He is later seen playing with Daniel Hall.

Goldie later takes on a pivotal role as the guardian of the tree of life in the &quot;Sandman&quot; spin-off series &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. On his/her quest to the tree, a search party forms. He was retconned into a female gargoyle for the new series.

Goldie is named after the imaginary&#x27; friend&quot; to whom Abel would tell his early stories in the pages of &quot;House of Secrets&quot;.

In issue 39 of the 2008 reboot of the &quot;House of Mystery&quot; comic series, it is revealed that Goldie is &quot;Gigi&quot;, a waitress at the House of Mystery and a bit player in the series. Goldie was transformed by Lotus Blossom, another character in the series, at Goldie&#x27;s request in exchange for a book of magic spells. Goldie was not enthralled with the idea of growing up to be a gargoyle, and instead wanted to be a human girl. The newly reborn Gigi joined Lotus Blossom on her exploits in the series, often serving as an enforcer for her. It is revealed that Abel knows Gigi&#x27;s true history, but if his brother Cain knew, it was not shown.

In the podcast, Goldie&#x27;s vocal effects were provided by Karen Batke.

Goldie appears in the Netflix series.

===Lucien===
Lucien is the chief librarian in the Dreaming, and is a tall thin, bookish man. He first appeared in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #18 (May 1975) and was apparently killed in &quot;Secrets of Haunted House&quot; #44 (January 1982).

Like Cain and Abel, Lucien, created by Paul Levitz, Nestor Redondo, and Joe Orlando, was originally the host of a 1970s &quot;weird tales&quot; comic, specifically the three-issue &quot;Tales of Ghost Castle&quot; (May/June–October 1975). In that series, he is portrayed as the guardian of a castle in Transylvania abandoned by both sides during World War II, watching over its forgotten library with his companion, a werewolf named Rover. In his first appearance in &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; (issue #2) this is retroactively revealed to be Dream&#x27;s castle.

Lucien is the effective keeper of the Dreaming in Dream&#x27;s absence, and becomes one of Dream&#x27;s most faithful and trusted servants after proving his loyalty by never abandoning his post during that period. His primary function is to protect the Library, wherein are contained all the books that have ever been dreamed of, including the ones that have never been written. The titles of some of these books, many of which are sequels to real works, are visible. He is, despite his frail appearance, apparently quite capable in combat, &quot;[dealing] with&quot; several unpleasant creatures who escape imprisonment during the events of &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;.

In issue #68, it is revealed that Lucien&#x27;s existence in the Dreaming began as serving the role of Dream&#x27;s first raven. When writing &quot;The Sandman Companion&quot;, author Hy Bender interpreted this as meaning that Lucien was also the first man. An allusion to &quot;Mr. Raven&quot;, the ghostly librarian in George MacDonald&#x27;s novel &quot;Lilith&quot;, may be intended.

In the podcast, Lucien is voiced by Simon Vance.

In January 2021, Vivienne Acheampong was announced to star in &quot;The Sandman&quot; TV series from Netflix portraying Lucienne, a genderbent version of Lucien.

===Matthew===

Matthew is the raven companion of Dream.

Matthew was originally Matthew Cable, a long-time supporting character in the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series, but because he died while asleep in the Dreaming, he was offered the chance to become a dream raven and serve Dream if he wished, and he accepted.

Matthew is not the first of Morpheus&#x27; ravens. Former ravens include Aristeas of Marmora, who returned to his life as a man for one year at one point, and Lucien, the first of the ravens. Morpheus seems to keep the ravens around out of some sort of unspoken need for companionship, though he also sends them on occasional missions.

Matthew&#x27;s word balloons and font style are scratchy and uneven, probably to represent a hoarse, cawing voice, and perhaps as an indicator of his crude, smart-aleck personality. Underneath his frequently irreverent manner, Matthew is actually very loyal to Dream, and he is one of the characters who takes it the hardest when Dream perishes, initially seeking release from his service, but eventually coming to terms with his loss and choosing to remain as Daniel Hall&#x27;s raven after speaking to different characters.

In the podcast, Matthew is voiced by Andy Serkis.

In the Netflix series, Matthew is voiced by Patton Oswalt.

===Mervyn Pumpkinhead===
Mervyn &quot;Merv&quot; Pumpkinhead is Dream&#x27;s cantankerous, cigar-smoking janitor: an animated scarecrow whose head is a jack-o&#x27;-lantern. He resembles Jack Pumpkinhead of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz books.

Mervyn is first seen in &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;, driving a bus on which Dream travels. Thereafter, Merv is in charge of the construction, maintenance, and demolition work in the Dreaming, though he sometimes complains that his job is superfluous because Dream can change any of the Dreaming at will. One issue of the &quot;Dreaming&quot; spin-off comic focuses on a dreamer who enjoys working under Merv&#x27;s supervision. Later issues have him assisted by Abudah.

Mervyn was one of the few who took arms against the Furies in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, but was easily killed. He is returned to life by the new Dream in &quot;The Wake&quot; who rebuilds his body and grows a new pumpkin to serve as his head.

In a past incarnation shown in &quot;The Wake&quot;, Mervyn was seen to have had a turnip for a head instead of a pumpkin as pumpkins were not then known in Europe.

Kevin Smith voices Mervyn in the podcast adaptation.

In the Netflix series, Mervyn is performed by Nicholas Anscombe and voiced by Mark Hamill.

===Martin Tenbones===
Martin Tenbones is a large dog-like dream who is Barbie&#x27;s companion.

In the podcast, Martin Tenbones is voiced by Ray Porter.

In the Netflix series, Martin Tenbones is voiced by Lenny Henry.

===Dora===
Dora is a dream that has the form of a young girl in her 20s. She can also assume a monstrous form.

===Minor dreams===
====Brute and Glob====
Brute and Glob are two trouble-making nightmares who try to gain power during Dream&#x27;s absence. They originally appeared in Jack Kirby&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Sandman&quot; series, as sidekicks to the title character, and continued as such when Hector Hall became the Sandman in &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot; In the original comics, Brute was similar to Thing where he shouted &quot;It&#x27;s clobberin&#x27; time!&quot; and often referred to his Uncle Harry.

In &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, it is revealed that they controlled the Sandmen in secret whereupon Dream exiled them to &quot;the darkness&quot; (a place of imprisonment and, presumably, torture, within the Dreaming).

Near the end of &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, the Furies tell Dream that they have released his prisoners from the darkness, but Brute and Glob are neither mentioned nor seen in this volume or in &quot;The Wake&quot;.

They next appear in &quot;The Dreaming&quot; #57–60, &quot;The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Dreams ... But Were Afraid to Ask&quot;, and &quot;Lucifer&quot; #15, where they attempt to kidnap Elaine Belloc.

They subsequently reappear in &quot;JSA&quot; #64, again trying to manipulate a human connected to the Dreaming (Sandy Hawkins) into their own &quot;Sandman&quot;; but Daniel Hall returns them to the darkness. The two entities claim this area of darkness is filled with pleasing childhood dreams, which they despise. First appearance: &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 1 #1.

In the podcast, Brute and Glob are voiced by Kerry Shale and Harry Myers.

In the Netflix series, their role as the manipulator of Jed Walker is replaced by Gault. 

====Abudah====
Abudah is a hulking monstrous dream who often works as Mervyn Pumpkinhead&#x27;s assistant. Though he was killed by the Three in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, the new Dream revives him.

====The Cuckoo====
The Cuckoo is a parasitic dream who has conquered Barbie&#x27;s dreamworld in &quot;A Game of You&quot;. She assumes the form of a childhood version of Barbie and uses her self proclaimed &quot;adorableness&quot; to escape from Barbie&#x27;s dream world, at which point she transforms into a bird.

In the podcast, the Cuckoo is voiced by Sarah Pitard.

====The Fashion Thing====
The Fashion Thing is a minor character whose form changes based on popular fads. She is based on The Mad Mod Witch, created by Dave Wood and Jack Sparling as the host of &quot;The Unexpected&quot;, another DC horror title. At the time of her first appearance in &quot;Sandman&quot;, she is a &quot;Mad Yuppie Witch&quot;. First appearance: &quot;The Unexpected&quot; #108. Most of her appearances are relegated to a few panels. She is shown flying on her broom as a Yuppie briefly in issue #2, shown riding her broom in a top hat and tails with bare legs and feet in issue #22, and shown topless serving a meal to Delirium and Dream in issue #42. She also appears in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;.

====Judge Gallows====
Judge Gallows appears in several issues of &quot;The Dreaming&quot; including the Special, &quot;Trial and Error&quot;. Introduced in &quot;The Unexpected&quot; #113 (June–July 1969), he is one of the few DC &quot;mystery&quot; hosts not used by Gaiman.

====The Smiling Man====
The Smiling Man is a rogue dream entity that is central to the mystery of the &quot;Sandman Nightmare Country&quot; storyline. It has the appearance of a large obese creature with a serpentine tongue, wide grin and mouths in place of eyes. It silently stalks several characters over the course of the story; passively watching their daily lives and is indirectly responsible for several deaths of those who have seen it (victims being assassinated by a pair of assassins under the employ of Desire).

====Daniel Nod====
Daniel Nod is the assistant librarian to Lucien.

====Balco====
Balco is a chimpanzee mechanic in the Dreaming who tends to the cars that anyone dreams about.

====Buffo====
Buffo is a humanoid toad and magician.

====Cartographer of Dreams====
The Cartographer of Dreams is a human-like character that maps out the different dreams.

====Gault====
Gault is a nightmare exclusive to the Netflix series who fled the Dreaming in the wake of Morpheus&#x27;s imprisonment and hides away in the mind of Jed Walker. She created a fantasy world for the boy where he is a superhero known as the &quot;Sandman&quot; as an escape from his uncle Barnaby&#x27;s abuse in the waking world while posing as his mother Miranda Walker. Gault is eventually tracked down. When confronted reveals her desire to be a dream, Gault wishes to inspire rather than frighten. Before being sent into the Darkness by Dream, Gault states that even nightmares can dream. After Unity Kinkaid&#x27;s sacrifice, Dream restored Gault as a dream where she now sports butterfly-like wings.

She is analogous to Brute and Glob in the show&#x27;s version of the story.

Gault is voiced and motion-captured by Ann Ogbomo in her true form and portrayed by Andi Osho when posing as Miranda Walker in Jed&#x27;s dreams.

==Gods, demigods, and major personifications==
The following characters are either gods, demigods, or major personifications:

===Bast===
Bast, in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, is the DC Universe version of the goddess Bast of Egyptian mythology. She was once a major goddess, but the loss of her believers over time has significantly reduced her powers. She is often coquettish toward Dream, who sometimes goes to her for advice or companionship; but she has often claimed never to have been his lover. Bast has also appeared in issues of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and &quot;Hawkgirl&quot;, wherein she is one of the chief goddesses worshiped by the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall. She appears in &quot;Sandman Presents: Bast: Eternity Game&quot; (2003), where she attempts to regain her lost power.

In the podcast, Bast is voiced by Bebe Neuwirth.

===The Presence/The Creator===

The Presence is the &quot;Sandman&quot; universe&#x27;s equivalent of a Supreme Being and he shares many characteristics with the standard Abrahamic God, such as almost never taking a physical form, being a Creator deity, and having unmatched power. Nevertheless, Gaiman has on several occasions stated that he never intended the Creator to be any specific religion&#x27;s god, just as he makes it clear in the first appearance of the abode of the angels, the Silver City, that it &quot;is not Paradise. It is not Heaven. It is the Silver City, that is not part of the order of created things&quot;, although the Silver City is often identified as &quot;Heaven&quot; in the &quot;Lucifer&quot; comic book series.

In that series, one of the critical turning points is the Presence&#x27;s abandonment of his Creation, which leads to a large number of problems, including struggles to claim the power that the Creator has abandoned, to make the destruction of the universe inevitable and to the slow unraveling of the universe due to the disappearance of the Name of the Creator written on every atom in existence. This is an ongoing storyline in &quot;Lucifer&quot;.

===Loki===
Loki is a trickster god seen in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;; based on the Norse god Loki. In his own form, Loki is a tall, thin man with yellow eyes and long red hair that resembles flames; but he is capable of assuming any appearance at will. He is sometimes nicknamed &#x27;Lie-Smith&#x27; and &#x27;Sky-walker&#x27; by other characters.

He is temporarily freed from his punishment by Odin to accompany his negotiations for the rulership of Hell; whereafter he deceives Odin and Thor into imprisoning another god in his place, but fails to fool Dream, who frees the other god and sends a simulacrum of Loki to take his punishment, in exchange for Loki&#x27;s debt to himself.

Loki returns in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, wherein he works with Puck to kidnap Daniel, a child under Dream&#x27;s protection. The Corinthian and Matthew eventually find Daniel, and Loki attempts to fool them by taking the form of Dream; but the Corinthian strangles Loki and consumes his eyes. Loki, now blind, is taken by Odin and Thor back to his punishment.

Loki reappears in &quot;Lucifer&quot; wherein Lucifer comes to Loki to take his ship for his own universe and destroys the snake that tortures Loki, who therefore allows him the ship.

In the podcast, Loki is voiced by David Tennant.

===Odin===
Odin, as based on the Norse God Odin, appears as an old man wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a cloak, and carrying a staff. He is usually depicted as a dark, mysterious figure, missing one eye and accompanied by two ravens named Huginn and Muninn (&quot;thought&quot; and &quot;memory&quot;), and two wolves named Geri and Freki.

Odin appeared in &quot;Season of Mist&quot; where he, Thor, and Loki partake in the negotiations for the ruler of Hell.

In &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Odin and Thor take Loki back to his punishment for kidnapping Daniel Hall and causing the Three to kill Dream.

In the podcast, Odin is voiced by Bill Nighy.

===The Three===
The Three appear in the form of any group of three women; usually the Mother, the Maiden and the Crone, the three aspects of the Triple Goddess in many mythologies. Sometimes, they appear in the form of the three witches from DC&#x27;s horror anthology &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;: Mildred, Mordred, and Cynthia. As these witches, they also appeared in a prestige format limited series of the same title, and two standard limited series, &quot;Witchcraft&quot; and &quot;Witchcraft: Le Terreur&quot;.

The Three repeatedly appear throughout &quot;The Sandman&quot;, fulfilling different functions at different points in the story. Their first appearance is in &quot;The Sandman&quot; #2, where they appear as the three witches, Mildred (mother), Mordred (crone), and Cynthia (maiden) from the DC horror anthology &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;. They later take many different forms over the course of the series, and the &quot;three women&quot; symbol remains an extremely common one, often blurring the lines between when characters are supposed to be merely themselves and when they are supposed to be representations of the Three. The Three represent the female principle, prophecy, and mystery, and they are often a vaguely menacing and enigmatic presence in the series. Incarnations of the Three include the Erinyes (Furies) in their vengeful aspect and the Moirai (Fates) or Weird Sisters in their divinatory aspect. They also sometimes subtly appear in the form of other characters (such as Eve) or groups of characters. Their Furies form were responsible for massacring Dream, Abel, Mervyn Pumpkinhead, Fiddler&#x27;s Green, and the Griffin Gate Keeper.

The Three later appeared in a graphic novel named &quot;WitchCraft&quot;, in which one of their priestesses in ancient Rome, Ursula, is raped by barbarians. She is then reincarnated three times, followed by the witches, and wronged again by reincarnations of the barbarian leader until the modern age, when she comes back as his elderly mother-in-law and manages to defeat him.

The Three then assure the barbarian that he would be reincarnated as each of the priestesses he had raped, in order, with the exception of Ursula. He would never know what was happening until the moment of death, at which point it would start all over again.

The Three are satisfied, and in the end decide that Ursula will live another twenty years and become an accomplished and respected witch in her twilight years, and her grandchild will be beautiful.

In the podcast, the Mother is voiced by Ellen Thomas, the Crone is voiced by Cathy Tyson, and the Maiden is voiced by Sandra Dickinson.

In the Netflix series, the Mother is portrayed by Nina Wadia, the Crone is portrayed by Souad Faress, and the Maiden is portrayed by Dinita Gohil.

===Calliope===
Calliope is one of the Muses. She has had a history with Dream&#x27;s Morpheus alias where they fathered Orpheus.

In 1927, Calliope became a prisoner of Erasmus Fry after he found her bathing in a stream on Mount Helicon. He raped her for inspiration. By 1986, Fry gave Calliope to struggling author Richard Madoc and he used her inspiration to write his stories. By the time Dream was freed from his imprisonment, he helped to free her by flooding Richard&#x27;s mind with too many inspirations. When Richard declared Calliope free, Calliope left to ensure that none of her fellow Muses would get trapped like she did.

In the podcast, Calliope is voiced by Samantha Béart.

In the Netflix series, Calliope is portrayed by Melissanthi Mahut.

===Other gods===
====Ishtar====
The goddess Ishtar, disguised as an exotic dancer; a former lover of Destruction.

====Pharamond====
Pharamond is a former god, last of his pantheon, and a friend of Dream. At Dream&#x27;s suggestion that he change with the times or fade like many other gods, Pharamond now runs a travel agency in Dublin, under the alias &#x27;Mr Farrell&#x27;. He helps Dream and Delirium find the missing Destruction, and later provides assistance to Lucifer in his own series. In the podcast, Pharamond is voiced by Colin McFarland.

====Thor====
The Norse God Thor first appeared in DC Comics in &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; #16 (August 1957), &quot;The Magic Hammer,&quot; illustrated by Jack Kirby.

In another story attributed to Kirby and George Papp, &quot;The Magic Stick&quot; in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #68 (November 1957), he looked like a traditional Viking with red hair, and his hammer looked identical to the way Kirby would draw it for Marvel Comics. That story was reprinted in &quot;DC Special&quot; #4 (July 1969), which also contains Abel&#x27;s debut. Kirby also pitted Wesley Dodds against someone claiming to be Thor in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #75 (June 1942).

Later, a museum worker named Henry Meke handled Thor&#x27;s hammer and briefly became Thor during thunderstorms in &quot;Batman&quot; #127 (October 1959).

In &quot;Season of Mist&quot;, Thor accompanied Odin and Loki to the Dreaming in order to get the Key to Hell from him. At one point, Thor had difficulty with the gate keepers upon his arrival.

In &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Odin and Thor take Loki back to his punishment for kidnapping Daniel Hall and causing the Three to kill Dream.

Thor also appears in &quot;War of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; (The Thor seen in &quot;The Sandman&quot; does not resemble the one seen in the other DC comics).

In the podcast, Thor is voiced by Mitch Benn.

====Anubis====
Anubis is the Egyptian God of the Underworld who is among the angels, deities, and demons that meet in the Dreaming to discuss the future of Hell following Lucifer&#x27;s abdication. In the podcast, Anubis is voiced by Doug Devaney.

====Bes====
Bes is an Egyptian house deity who is among the angels, deities, and demons that meet in the Dreaming to discuss the future of Hell following Lucifer&#x27;s abdication.

====Susano-o-no-Mikoto====

In the podcast, Susano-o-no-Mikoto is voiced by Dai Tabuchi.

====Kilderkin====
Kilderkin is a member of the Lords of Order who was dispatched by his fellow Lords of Order to attend a meeting in the Dreaming with the other angels, deities, and demons to discuss the future of Hell following Lucifer&#x27;s abdication.

Shivering Jemmy is a child-like member of the Lords of Chaos who was dispatched by her fellow Lords of Chaos to attend a meeting in the Dreaming with the other angels, deities, and demons to discuss the future of Hell following Lucifer&#x27;s abdication.

In the podcast, Shivering Jemmy is voiced by Lizzie Waterworth-Santo.

====Hades====
Hades is the God of the Greek underworld. His history with Orpheus remains intact.

In the podcast, Hades is voiced by Toby Longworth.

====Persephone====
Persephone is the Queen of the Greek underworld. Her history with Orpheus remains intact.

==Angels, fallen angels, and demons==
The following characters are either angels, fallen angels, or demons:

===Azazel===
Azazel is a demon and a former ruler of Hell, reigning for a time alongside Lucifer and Beelzebub. Based on a statement from Agony and Ecstasy in &quot;Hellblazer&quot; #12, he may have usurped his position from Belial (described at the time was the third member of the triumvirate). He appears as a ragged opening into darkness, full of disembodied eyes and mouths. He was cast out after Lucifer abandoned Hell and later imprisoned by Dream in a glass jar. He reappears, still in Dream&#x27;s glass jar, in &quot;Lucifer Volume 2&quot; (2015).

He is based on the demon Azazel.

Azazel first appeared in DC Comics battling Madame Xanadu in the story intended for &quot;Doorway to Nightmare&quot; #6 (it was cancelled after #5) that was eventually published in &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot; #2 and &quot;The Unexpected&quot; #190. As with Lucifer&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, he looked more like a traditional devil, but was identified as an incubus: here, a creature who steals people&#x27;s dreams and imprints them upon tapestries that give him power, and cannot be destroyed without killing the victims.

In the podcast, Azazel is voiced by Kerry Shale.

In the Netflix series, Azazel is voiced by Roger Allam.

===Beelzebub===
Along with Lucifer and Azazel, Beelzebub is a demon who was the third King of Hell. He often appears as either a gigantic green fly or a fly&#x27;s head on two short human legs. Sometimes, a human face can be seen between the fly&#x27;s eyes. His constant buzzing slurs his speech (for example, &#x27;Bbbbut nooo. Itzzz a Triummmvirate.&#x27;).

He is based on the demon Beelzebub.

In the podcast, Beezlebug is voiced by Ray Porter.

===Choronzon===
Choronzon is a demon and a former duke of Hell who served under Beelzebub. He has pink skin and two mouths, one under the other.

Chronozon had possession of Dream&#x27;s helm, but lost it in a challenge where he had Lucifer fight Dream on his behalf. He later reappeared briefly as one of Azazel&#x27;s tactics to gain ownership of Hell.

Chronozon is based on the demon Choronzon.

Choronzon appears in &quot;52&quot; #25 (Late October 2006).

In the podcast, Chorozon is voiced by Paterson Joseph.

In the Netflix series, Choronzon is portrayed by Munya Chawawa.

===Duma===
Duma is a fallen angel from the DC Vertigo series &quot;The Sandman&quot;. Duma&#x27;s name means &quot;silence&quot;, and he is based on the angel Duma from Jewish mythology.

In &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, Lucifer abdicates Hell and gives the key to Dream until God assigns Duma and Remiel to take control of Hell.

Remiel and Duma lose ownership of Hell in the &quot;Lucifer&quot; spin-off series. Duma eventually allies with Lucifer and Elaine Belloc to save creation, and persuades Hell&#x27;s new ruler Christopher Rudd to bring his army to Heaven&#x27;s aid at the Battle of Armageddon.

===Lucifer===
Lucifer is the sometime ruler of Hell and a fallen angel. He is based on the fallen angel Lucifer, whose story was created by John Milton in his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Neil Gaiman also used the character Lucifer in his short story &#x27;Murder Mysteries&#x27;, wherein he was a captain in the Silver City, with Azazel as his protégé.

In the book &quot;Hanging out with the Dream King&quot; (a book consisting of interviews with Gaiman&#x27;s collaborators), one of Gaiman&#x27;s artists, Kelley Jones, states that Lucifer&#x27;s appearance is based on that of David Bowie:

Lucifer made at least three previous appearances in DC Comics (&quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #65, &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #4, and &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #8, a.k.a. &quot;The Brave and the Bold Special&quot;), but his appearance was more traditional. Lucifer as he appeared in &quot;The Sandman&quot; also appeared in issues of the series &quot;The Demon&quot; (vol. 3) and &quot;The Spectre&quot; (vol. 2) and in the miniseries &quot;Stanley and His Monster&quot; (vol. 2).

In the podcast, Lucifer is voiced by Michael Sheen.

In the Netflix series, Lucifer is genderbent (but still physically accurate to her comic variant) and portrayed by Gwendoline Christie.

===Mazikeen===
Mazikeen is a fictional character from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; mythos. The name &quot;Mazikeen&quot; comes from that of a shapeshifting demon of Jewish mythology.

Mazikeen first appeared in &quot;The Sandman&quot;, where she was Lucifer&#x27;s consort while he reigned in Hell. At the time, half of her face was normal, but the other half was horribly misshapen and skeletal, causing her speech to be nearly unintelligible. (Gaiman wrote Mazikeen&#x27;s dialogue by trying to speak using only half of his mouth, and writing down phonetically what came out.)

When Lucifer resigned, Mazikeen left Hell and ended up following her master, becoming part of the staff at the &quot;Lux&quot; (Latin for &quot;light&quot;, and the first root word in &quot;Lucifer&quot;), an elite Los Angeles bar that Lucifer had opened and played piano at. To conceal her demonic nature, she covered the deformed half of her face with a white mask and rarely spoke.

In the ongoing comic book series &quot;Lucifer&quot;, Mazikeen is a devoted ally of Lucifer Morningstar and the war leader of the Lilin, a race descended from Lilith. A fearsome warrior and a respected leader, Mazikeen is a prominent character in the Lucifer comics. She has the appearance of a human female with long black hair.

In &quot;Lucifer&quot;, Mazikeen&#x27;s face was turned fully human when she was resuscitated by the Basanos following the destruction of the Lux in a fire. This was because the vessel of the Basanos, Jill Presto, did not realize that Mazikeen&#x27;s face was naturally deformed, and assumed that it was burned in the fire.

When Lucifer refused to assist her in restoring her face to its former state, she defected to her family, the Lilim-in-Exile. As their war leader, she led their army against Lucifer&#x27;s cosmos, allying herself briefly with the Basanos. However, this was a ruse; after a desperate gamble, she bought Lucifer enough time to destroy the Basanos and regain control of his creation. Lucifer then accepted her into his service once more and made the Lilim-in-Exile the standing army of his universe.

Lucifer ultimately restores Mazikeen&#x27;s half-skeletal face shortly before departing the known universes.

In the podcast, Mazikeen is voiced by Karen Batke.

In the Netflix series, Mazikeen is portrayed by Cassie Clare. She has a few lines of dialogue and serves as Lucifer&#x27;s servant and bodyguard.

===Remiel===
Remiel is an angel in the comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;; based on the angel Remiel. He first appears in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;. In Biblical and Judaic traditions, Remiel is an Archangel and a &quot;Grigori&quot;; a Choir/Hierarchy of angels, whose role is to observe humanity, lending a helping hand when necessary but not interfere.

Remiel, along with Duma, is sent to observe when Dream is given the key to Hell. Dream finally gives the key to Remiel and Duma, and the two angels descend to Hell to rule over the countless sinners and demons there.

Following the end of the &quot;Sandman&quot; series, Remiel and Duma lose ownership of Hell in the &quot;Lucifer&quot; spin-off series. At the end of the series, Remiel tries to rebel against Elaine Belloc, refusing to accept her as God&#x27;s successor. When he tries to kill Gaudium and Spera, friends of Elaine&#x27;s, she puts him in his own Hell until he reforms.

In the podcast, Remiel is voiced by Adrian Lester.

===Minor angels and demons===
====Squatterbloat====
Squatterbloat is a rhyme-speaking demon who serves as the Gatekeeper of Hell.

In the Netflix series, Squatterbloat is performed by Martyn Ford.

====Ketele====
Ketele is a demon in Hell who doubted that Lucifer was originally from Heaven during Dream&#x27;s second visit to Hell and prior to Lucifer&#x27;s abdication.

====Rimmon-My-Petal====
Rimmon-My-Petal is a demon in Hell who doubted that Lucifer was originally from Heaven during Dream&#x27;s second visit to Hell and prior to Lucifer&#x27;s abdication.

====Merkin, Mother of Spiders====
First appeared in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, Merkin, Mother of Spider is an envoy with Azazel. A lumpen, hideous, vaguely feminine figure, whose womb produces spiders. The Merkin&#x27;s facial form was almost certainly based upon a photograph by the artist Joel-Peter Witkin entitled &quot;Amour, New Mexico, 1987&quot;, showing a naked female figure wearing a spider-like horned mask.

In the podcast, Merkin is voiced by Clare Corbett.

==Fair Folk==
The following are inhabitants of Faerie:

===Cluracan===
The Cluracan is a courtier of the Queen of Faerie and the brother to Nuala, the Dream King&#x27;s fairy servant. An amoral, merry, capricious, homosexual rogue, Cluracan features in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, &quot;Worlds&#x27; End&quot;, &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, and &quot;The Wake&quot;. He is strongly reminiscent of the &quot;trickster&quot; archetype also associated with Loki. Following the events of &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Cluracan offends his queen so badly that she sends him to the court of Llinor, where tradition demands that he marry a lady of the royal house; whereupon Cluracan&#x27;s nemesis – identical to him in every way except his sexual orientation – takes Cluracan&#x27;s place.

The Cluracan is named after a drunken leprechaun of Irish mythology, the Cluricaun.

In the podcast, Cluracan is voiced by Aidan Turner.

===Nuala===
Nuala is a faerie given to Dream at the end of &quot;Season of Mists&quot; who takes on the housekeeping duties of the Dreaming only stopping when her brother Cluracan takes her back to Faerie in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;. When she leaves, Dream grants her permission to summon him at need. When she asks to become his paramour, he refuses.

She subsequently appears in the &quot;Sandman&quot; spinoff series &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.

In the podcast, Nuala is voiced by Niamh Walsh.

===Auberon===
Auberon is a character in the comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot; and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;. He is seen for the first time in &quot;Sandman&quot; #19 as Auberon of Dom-Daniel where he and Titania accompanied Dream in seeing the production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Auberon appears again in several issues of &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; and in the &quot;Books of Faerie&quot; miniseries.

The character was inspired by Oberon of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In the podcast, Auberon is voiced by Toby Longworth.

===Titania===

Titania is a character in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

Titania is the queen of the fay; she first appears in issue #19. The character was inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s Titania (Fairy Queen) in the play &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. There is implication that she in the past was a lover of Dream&#x27;s, although this is never confirmed. Auberon and Titania accompanied Dream in seeing the production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; where Titania was accompanied by her court of boggarts, elves, fairies, goblins, nixies, and trolls.

Titania is also a major character in the comic book &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, of which the first four issues were written by Gaiman, and its spin-off series &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot;. In the latter series, it is revealed that she was a human girl who crossed over into the fay realm and was then adopted by the previous queen of the fay, and received her faerie powers from a circlet seized by her from that queen. Despite this power, it was revealed that she is illiterate, and so regularly uses Dream&#x27;s library because its special properties allow its users to read books in any language, including those they cannot speak. There are suggestions that she may be the mother of the series&#x27; protagonist, Timothy Hunter.

In the podcast, Titania is voiced by Felicity Duncan.

===Puck===
Puck is a brown-furred trickster and hobgoblin, who appears several times in &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

In &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Puck aids the Norse God Loki in kidnapping Daniel, playing a small role in the death of Dream and Daniel&#x27;s subsequent assuming of the title by assisting Loki in capturing Daniel.

Puck later appeared in an issue of &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, hiding as a gangster called Mr. Robbins in Brighton whose true nature is discovered—but not exposed—by Timothy Hunter. The character was inspired by Puck of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Immortals, witches, and long-lived humans==
The following characters are either immortals, witches, or long-lived humans:

===Hob Gadling===
Robert &quot;Hob&quot; Gadling is a human granted immortality, who meets with Dream once every hundred years.

Hob was granted immortality in a pub named the White Horse in 1389 when he simply declared that he &quot;had decided never to die&quot;; whereupon Death agrees, at Dream&#x27;s request, to forgo him. Hob thereupon takes to a variety of occupations over the centuries, including slaving, and periodically reinvents himself as a descendant of his previous persona. Gradually, he acquires a conscience and by the 20th Century, he has become full of remorse at his past deeds. Dream converses with Gadling once per century, of Gadling&#x27;s latest occupations. At their 20th Century meeting, Dream admits that the purpose of the exercise was simply for him to have a friend.

In &quot;The Wake&quot;, Death offers to end his six-hundred-year life. Gadling declines.

In the podcast, Hob Gadling is voiced by Matthew Horne.

In the Netflix series, Hob is portrayed by Ferdinand Kingsley.

===Orpheus===
Orpheus is the son of Dream and the muse Calliope. He is based on Orpheus of Greek mythology.

In &quot;The Song of Orpheus&quot;, the Endless attend Orpheus&#x27;s wedding to Eurydice. Eurydice dies on the same night and Orpheus asks his father to retrieve her from the Greek underworld. Dream refuses, but Orpheus gets help from Destruction and Death. As in the legend, Orpheus travels to Hades, plays his sad music to Hades and Persephonie, loses Eurydice again when he looks at her spirit during departure, and gets torn apart by the Bacchanae (the beloved madwomen of Dionysus). Because of his immortality, Orpheus survives as a disembodied head. Dream establishes a priesthood to take care of his son, saying that they will never meet again.

In &quot;Thermidor&quot;, Johanna Constantine is asked by Dream to rescue Orpheus from Revolutionary France. Orpheus&#x27;s singing stuns Maximilien Robespierre and Louis de Saint-Just, leading to the Thermidorian Reaction. Orpheus misses his father who still has not visited him.

In &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, Dream has to talk to Orpheus in order to find Destruction. In return, Orpheus is granted his wish of death enabling him to pass on and reunite with Eurydice in the afterlife.

In the podcast, Orpheus is voiced by Regé-Jean Page.

===Thessaly===
Thessaly is the last of the millennia-old witches of Thessaly. She makes her first appearance in &quot;A Game of You&quot;. She has a bookish appearance with straight hair and thick glasses that belie her personality: amoral, cold-blooded, proud, and ruthless, though not malicious. She will kill people who are potential threats with no hesitation or remorse.

Neil Gaiman named this character after the land of witches, Thessaly, in Greece. In one of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, the Gorgias, Socrates states &quot;I would not have us risk that which is dearest on the acquisition of this power, like the Thessalian enchantresses, who, as they say, bring down the moon from heaven at the risk of their own perdition.&quot; In the series, Thessaly does exactly that, with deadly consequences, just as Socrates predicts. Later in the series, Thessaly changes her name to Larissa, which is the capital of Thessaly. Larissa was actually the local fountain nymph, after whom the town was named. It is suggested however that Thessaly is even older than this civilization and may date from Neolithic times. In a later series, Thessaly tells someone her name is Lamia. “Lamia” refers to several types of monster, and to other magical and supernatural characters, in Greek mythology, as well as to the Thessalian witches Meroe and Panthia in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius.

Thessaly returns in the later volumes, where she is Dream&#x27;s lover for a time, but this relationship ends unhappily for both and is never actually shown in the series. When it is alluded to in &quot;Brief Lives&quot; Thessaly is never mentioned by name, so only in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; is this romance revealed. Also in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, Thessaly provides Lyta Hall with protection and sanctuary from Dream while he is being targeted for death by the Furies, who are using Hall as a vessel.

In &quot;The Wake&quot; she attends Dream&#x27;s wake and funeral. Thessaly speaks with two of Dream&#x27;s lovers and recalls her relationship with Dream. She remarks that part of his attraction to her was that she was not intimidated by him. To her surprise she later would dream of Morpheus, and the two kindled a romance, with Dream madly in love with Thessaly (though this affection was not mutual). When Morpheus ended his courtship and resumed working Thessaly realized she did not love Morpheus and left the Dreaming.

When Lyta wakes up after Dream&#x27;s death, Thessaly calmly advises her to leave. Thessaly suggests that many people, including herself, would be more than happy to murder Lyta for her part in Morpheus&#x27; destruction.

Thessaly also is the star of two spin-off comic series, &quot;The Thessaliad&quot; and &quot;Thessaly, Witch for Hire&quot; written by Bill Willingham. In the spin-offs, Thessaly (under that name) and her companion, a ghost named Fetch, first set out to tackle various gods of the underworld who want her dead. Later she is unwillingly pressured into a monster-killing contract.

She is alluded to in the &quot;Faction Paradox&quot; series, in the character Thessalia and her protégé Larissa.

In the podcast, Thessaly is voiced by Emma Corrin.

===Mad Hettie===
Mad Hettie is a London tramp born in 1741. At the time of &quot;Sandman&quot; #3, she was 247 years old. Mad Hettie appears frequently in other DC comics such as &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, first appearing in #9. She also had a large role in &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot;, where she is shown to be rude, miserly and constantly complains about the lack of knowledge that present day youths have. She has been accused of being a witch and also appears to have abilities as a haruspex. However, she merely states that &quot;you don&#x27;t get to your two hundred and fiftieth without learning a few tricks&quot;.

Later, Hettie worked in the series &quot;The Dreaming,&quot; in which it was discovered that she had dealings with Destiny, Johanna Constantine and President Thomas Jefferson.

In &quot;The Sandman: Overture&quot;, it is revealed that she had stolen a magical timepiece in her youth, which remained hidden in her memories until Daniel retrieved it.

In the podcast, Mad Hettie is voiced by Josie Lawrence.

In the Netflix series, Mad Hettie is portrayed by Clare Higgins.

===The Silk Man===
Appearing for the first time in &quot;&quot;, the Silk Man is an immortal sorcerer, described by Lucifer as &quot;a fossil remnant from an earlier, cruder creation. His body is a weaving that has to be renewed constantly. Silk Man&#x27;s spirit too, come to that. A messy form of immortality, but it seems to do the job.&quot; In earlier days, Silk Man was the leader of the Arao Jinn. He appears as a mercenary, hired by the angel Perdissa to kill Lucifer. Silk Man seems to need to consume living things to stay alive, weaving them into himself. He is severely damaged by Perdissa and eventually killed by Lucifer.

===Vassily===
In The Hunt, Vassily appears as an old man telling his teen-aged granddaughter a tale from &quot;the old country&quot;, Russia. A youth raised in a remote forest has a series of adventures, including meeting with Lucien (to whom he gives a book) and Baba Yaga, and marrying a fellow shape-changing wolf. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the grandfather is the youth in his own story.

==Mortals==
The following are known mortals:

===Roderick Burgess===
Roderick Burgess (1863–1947), born Morris Burgess Brocklesby and known also as The Daemon King, was the Lord Magus of The Order of the Ancient Mysteries. His magical fraternity was based in &quot;Fawney Rig&quot; in Sussex, and was initially funded by his inherited industrial wealth. Burgess is a magician rather in the vein of the real Aleister Crowley, and within the DC world is Crowley&#x27;s rival.

The series begins with Burgess&#x27; attempt to capture and bind Death, which fails, capturing Dream instead. Burgess keeps Dream trapped in a glass globe for the rest of his (Burgess&#x27;) life, attempting to bargain with Dream, but Dream remains silent. Burgess dies from a heart attack still attempting to get a response out of Dream. His order passes the globe and Dream to his son Alex.

Burgess is a bald-headed, slightly pot-bellied man with a large hook nose. He is ultimately self-centred; his sole purpose for the Order is to bring money and power to himself, and he is consumed by his desire to achieve immortality. His relationship with his son is only briefly touched on, though it is implied that it is unhealthy, with Burgess pushing his son to spend his life pursuing his father&#x27;s dreams.

In the podcast, Roderick Burgess is voiced by Stephen Critchlow.

Charles Dance portrays the character in the television series &quot;The Sandman&quot; on Netflix. This version of the character dies of a brain hemorrhage instead of a heart attack.

===Alex Burgess===
Alex Burgess is the son of Roderick Burgess, mother unknown (but probably Ethel Cripps, and therefore half-brother of Doctor Destiny). He is taught by his father, and takes part in his rituals. Upon Roderick Burgess&#x27; death, Alex inherits his estate, including his magical order. He keeps Dream imprisoned, as his father did, trying to bargain for power and immortality in exchange for Dream&#x27;s release.

The Order of the Ancient Mysteries enjoys a resurgence in popularity in the 1960s, but by the 1970s it is in decline again. Alex passes ownership of the Order on to his boyfriend, Paul McGuire, and becomes obsessed with his prisoner and with his father. Finally, in 1988, Dream escapes and puts Alex into a nightmare of &quot;eternal waking&quot;, in which he is forever dreaming he is waking up, and each waking degenerates into another horrible nightmare. This nightmare lasts for years, ending only with Dream&#x27;s death in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;.

Alex is quite tall and near-sighted. He has brown hair which he wears in a variety of styles throughout his life, but by old age he is bald and has come to resemble his father very closely. His relationship with McGuire is deep and heartfelt, but his obsessions with his father and with Dream eventually come to rule his life. In &quot;The Wake&quot;, he appears again as the child that we see in his first appearance.

Alex is in many ways a tragic figure, perhaps the first statement of the theme that Desire explores in &quot;The Wake&quot;: &quot;The bonds of family bind both ways&quot;. Had Alex not been born the son of his father, inheriting the imprisoned Dream, his life might have been much happier. However, he is finally able to find some measure of fulfillment in his old age, following Dream&#x27;s death.

His name almost certainly derives from Anthony Burgess&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, the protagonist of which is named Alex, but could also be a nod to Aleister Crowley, whose original middle name was Alexander and who was mentioned in the first issue.

In the podcast, Alex Burgess is voiced by Blake Ritson.

Alex appears in &quot;The Sandman&quot; episode &quot;Sleep of the Just&quot;, portrayed by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as a young man, Laurie Kynaston as an adult, and by Benedick Blythe as an elderly man.

===Ruthven Sykes===
Ruthven Sykes is a bespectacled Afro-Caribbean man with short hair.

He is Roderick Burgess&#x27; second-in-command of the Order of the Ancient Mysteries until November 1930, when he steals a number of treasures (including Dream&#x27;s helmet, ruby and pouch of sand) and £200,000 in cash from the order and flees to San Francisco with Roderick&#x27;s mistress, Ethel Cripps. In December 1930, he trades the helmet to the demon Choronzon for an amulet that looks like an eyeball on a chain. This amulet protects him from the magics of Burgess until 1936, when Ethel Cripps leaves him, taking the amulet with her. He is then killed.

In the podcast, Ruthven Sykes is voiced by Oris Erhuero.

In the Netflix series, Ruthven Sykes is portrayed by Ansu Kabia.

===Ethel Cripps===
Ethel Cripps, also known as Ethel Dee, is the mother of John Dee. She was the mistress of Roderick Burgess until she fled with Ruthven Sykes.

Her last joy was her son, John Dee, whom she sought for 10 years. She discovered that he had become a living corpse, which happened because of his use of the Sandman&#x27;s Ruby.

At this time, she was 90 years old, and it was alluded that she had been kept alive by an amulet in the shape of an eye which granted its user protection, the amulet that Ruthven Sykes had been given by the demon Choronzon in exchange for Dream&#x27;s helmet. Sykes, who had been second in command in The Order of Ancient Mysteries, needed protection from Roderick Burgess who was seeking retribution for Sykes&#x27; treachery of the theft of the £200,000 and Dream&#x27;s magical items, which were in possession of the Order at the time he fled with Ethel Cripps to San Francisco in 1930. &quot;Magical War&quot; was declared upon them, and Ruthven knew he would need a way to protect himself from the hexes Burgess sought to put upon him.

In 1936, Ethel walked out on Ruthven, taking with her the amulet of protection and Dream&#x27;s Ruby. While in his possession, the amulet protected Sykes from Burgess&#x27; hexes, but without it, he died a messy and painful death, with his insides exploding out of him. The amulet continued to protect Ethel while Choronzon was still in possession of Dream&#x27;s helmet.

After Dream escaped and sought to regain his items, he descended to Hell to find his helmet. He had to battle Choronzon to regain it. After his victory, the compact was withdrawn and the power of protection the amulet possessed ended which also ended the life of Ethel Dee.

In the podcast, Ethel Cripps is voiced by Karen Bartke.

In the Netflix series, Ethel Cripps is portrayed by Joely Richardson as an older woman and by Niamh Walsh as a younger woman.

===Wesley Dodds===
Wesley Dodds, also known as Sandman, is the original costumed crimefighter who used the name. According to Gaiman, he was merely filling a hole in the universe in a similar way to a process of evolution, in which animals fill up a niche—for instance, what should fly. He is first seen in &quot;The Sandman&quot; series in a two-panel cameo in issue #1, and another cameo in issue #26. Dream occasionally appeared in dream sequences in Dodds&#x27;s own series, &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;. The two finally met for real in Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Sandman Midnight Theatre&quot;. Dodds appeared out of costume during &quot;The Sandman: The Wake&quot; (#72). The reason for his prophetic visions is explained as him being embodied with a small portion of Dream&#x27;s essence. His reasoning for assuming his role as The Sandman is given as nightmares of Dream in his helmet that plague him &quot;until&quot; he begins his career as a crimefighter, after which &quot;Wesley Dodds sleeps the sleep of the Just.&quot;

In the podcast, Wesley Dodds is voiced by Ray Porter.

===Johanna Constantine===
Lady Johanna Constantine is an 18th-century supernatural adventuress. Dream encounters her several times, once to ask her to recover the head of his son, Orpheus – a mission she performed so successfully that part of its aftereffects was the ending of the French Revolution&#x27;s Reign of Terror.

In the &quot;Hellblazer Special: Lady Constantine&quot; graphic novel, an ancient evil refers to Johanna Constantine as &#x27;the Constantine&#x27;, the &#x27;laughing magician&#x27;, and the &#x27;constant one&#x27;, all titles that have been used (usually by other ancient evils) to describe John Constantine. The evil taunts her, saying &quot;did you think to trick us with a new form?&quot; There is the implication that throughout all times there have been recurring incarnations of Constantine who contain the spark of magic. In the story Johanna Constantine learns that &quot;the Devil and the Wandering Jew&quot; meet once every hundred years in a London pub; this meeting is actually between Dream and Hob Gadling, as she discovers when she interrupts the meeting. The story&#x27;s conclusion shows Johanna Constantine inheriting a property she calls &quot;Fawney Rig&quot;, after the con job wherein a gilded ring is sold as though it were solid gold, the implication being that she attained the property through trickery. This property was later owned by Roderick Burgess, the mage who captures Dream in the beginning of &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

In her middle age, Johanna Constantine is charged by persons unknown with the key to a box containing the sigil of America, allegedly created by Destiny. This is stolen and hidden in the future by the wanderer, Mad Hettie. Hettie both blackmails (&quot;I knows about you and the little Corsican&quot;) and bribes Johanna for her silence, promising her that she would live to age 99. This promise proves true, with Johanna dying at age 99 while getting out of her wheelchair when she hears the song of her old companion Orpheus.

Johanna is an ancestor of John Constantine, as revealed in the miniseries &quot;The Sandman Presents: Love Street&quot;.

She is also mentioned in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;The Man in the Velvet Mask&quot;, set in an alternate post-Revolutionary France.

In the podcast, Johanna Constantine is voiced by Joanna Lumley.

Jenna Coleman was cast as two versions of Johanna in the TV adaptation of &quot;The Sandman&quot;: one in the eighteenth-century that encountered Dream and Hob Gadling and another in the present day where she is an occult detective just like John. In this show, Johanna serves the exact same role as John in the comics. Dream once saw into her nightmare regarding a previously botched exorcism that dragged her friend Astra Logue to Hell.

===John Constantine===
John Constantine is a con man and magician. He is a descendant of Johanna Constantine who accompanies Dream on a quest to find his pouch of sand.

John Constantine has his own series, &quot;John Constantine: Hellblazer&quot;, which occasionally has guest appearances by Cain and Abel. He is also prominently featured in another series, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, from which he originated.

In the podcast, John Constantine is voiced by Taron Egerton.

===John Dee===
John Dee, also known as Doctor Destiny, is a DC Comics villain whose powers were derived from his use of Dream&#x27;s Ruby. His name is almost certainly a reference to the real-life John Dee. He was incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, with other Batman villains such as The Scarecrow and The Joker, until freed by the amulet given to him by his mother, Ethel Dee, former mistress to Roderick Burgess. He had previously fought the Sandman (Garrett Sanford) alongside the Justice League.

John originally named himself &#x27;Doctor Destiny&#x27; to protect his mother&#x27;s surname, but after her death changed it back. The Ruby had drained away his mental and physical state until he was no longer able to sleep or dream without it. This had the unpleasant effect of turning him into a browned, living corpse.

Being able to control dreams, he used the ruby to bring out the &#x27;darkness&#x27; and &#x27;bestiality&#x27; of many people across the world. He originally sought power, money and mostly the restoration of his human body, but the madness brought about by overuse of the relic drove him to savage, monstrous acts of depravity using the ruby. To quote: &quot;I think I&#x27;ll dismember the world and then I&#x27;ll dance in the wreckage.&quot;

While doing this, over a period of 24 hours he focused the energy of the ruby on several people in a cafe, one of them a friend of Rose Walker and an ex-lover of Foxglove. He used them as puppets, horribly having them murder and degrade each other as if they were toys, until all were dead.

Dream double-bluffed him into destroying the ruby, which Dee believed to be Dream&#x27;s life. It actually only stored some of his energy, and with it released Dream instead became even more powerful than before. Easily overpowering Dee, Dream decided not to destroy him, and instead returned him to Arkham. Dee was finally able to sleep and his sadism and depravity faded as he now could again dream.

He has since appeared in &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice Society&quot; stories, having retained some residual power from the ruby. Even worse, since he has managed to replicate its power perfectly, the second ruby is now out of his grasp. However, since the new ruby is attuned to him, he has since not regressed to his previous vicious persona, mostly seeking the dominion of dreams or the waking world through dreams.

In the podcast, John Dee is voiced by William Hope.

John Dee appears in the Netflix series, portrayed by David Thewlis. This variant has a more expanded, different role. He does not kill Rosemary when they drive together but is implied to drive her to suicide, and does not possess his comic variant&#x27;s shriveled appearance, simply looking like a weak middle aged man. Additionally, his use of the ruby is different: he still kills the people in the diner but the ruby’s power is more specific: he uses it to remove people’s ability to lie. Dream later defeated him. Taking pity, Dream places him in a dreamless state and dropped his body back at the institution that he escaped from.

===Unity Kinkaid===
Unity Kinkaid first appears as one of the victims of the sleepy sickness that follows Dream&#x27;s capture in the first collection of issues in the series, &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;. Following his capture, she sleeps until he escapes. While asleep, she gives birth to a daughter named Miranda Walker. It is later shown that the father of Miranda was Desire. Unity is later identified as a &quot;vortex of Dream&quot;: a rare entity with the ability to telepathically combine the dreams of other beings and who can thus cause the destruction of the Dreaming. The only time Dream is allowed to take a human life is to kill a vortex. Desire&#x27;s intervention transfers the vortex to Unity&#x27;s granddaughter Rose Walker in the hope that Dream will kill one of their relatives and thus incur the vengeance of the Furies. Before Dream can kill Rose, Unity reclaims the vortex and dies in her stead.

Unity is of medium height, with reddish-brown hair that she wears long and loose, in the final dream-meeting between herself, Rose, and Dream; as the old woman of waking life, she has grey hair and wears a curiously old-fashioned dress.

In the podcast, Unity Kinkaid is voiced by Sue Johnston as an old woman and by Tracy Wiles as a young woman.

In the Netflix series, Unity is portrayed by Sandra James-Young. This version is a Black British woman.

===Siamese Cat===

The Siamese cat later found itself in the Dreaming while it slept where a dead crow directed it to a cave where the &quot;Cat of Dreams&quot; resided.

===Barnabas===
Barnabas is a sarcastic talking dog who belonged to Destruction and was assigned to guard Delirium. His origins are unknown.

In the podcast, Barnabas is voiced by Harry Myers.

===Basanos===
The Basanos was a living Tarot deck created by the seraph Meleos to duplicate the divining power of Destiny&#x27;s book. They are incredibly powerful due to the fact that they control probability, making whatever outcome they desire not only likely, but inevitable.

After escaping from Meleos, the Basanos took possession of Jill Presto, a cabaret worker. Lucifer Morningstar sought them out for a tarot reading, which they granted.

When Lucifer created his new universe, the Basanos moved to take control of it so that they could breed (something that is impossible in God&#x27;s cosmos). Though initially successful in their plan, forming an alliance with Lucifer&#x27;s enemies, their ability to control randomness was severely limited by Lucifer&#x27;s creation, and Lucifer was able to outmaneuver them. Lucifer finally gave them an ultimatum: destroy themselves or risk letting the egg they laid in Jill Presto die. The Basanos chose death and extinguished themselves.

&quot;Basanos&quot; is Greek for touchstone. Such a touchstone may be a piece of slate used to test gold, or it may be a metaphor for torture or torment to test truthfulness. Why Meleos chose this name for his creation is unknown.

===Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine===
Charles Rowland was the only boy left at his boarding school during the holidays when Lucifer closed Hell, sending its former inhabitants back to Earth. While the adults of the school are preoccupied with the dead spirits who came back into their own lives, Charles is tortured and killed by three dead boys who used to go to the same school.

Edwin Paine is a previous victim of the trio, his body still trapped on the grounds. He befriends Charles, but is unable to keep him from dying. When Death shows up, Charles refuses to go with her and she lets him go, preferring to focus on all the other trouble Hell&#x27;s closure has brought her.

As ghosts, they later appeared in other books as the Dead Boy Detectives where they investigate supernatural crimes.

In the podcast, Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine are voiced by Mack Keith Roach and Harry Tuffin.

===Chiron===
Chiron is a centaur who appeared as a patron of the &quot;World&#x27;s End Inn&quot;.

Chiron later appeared at the funeral of Dream in &quot;The Sandman: The Wake&quot;.

He reappears in the Vertigo story &quot;The Girl Who Would Be Death&quot; (1999).

===Alianora===
Alianora was first introduced in &quot;A Game of You&quot; as the original inhabitant of The Land, an island region of the Dreaming that Barbie has visited since childhood and is being threatened by the Cuckoo. After the Hierogram is broken and The Land is dissolved, Alianora appears and speaks to Dream. Her history is expanded in &quot;The Sandman: Overture,&quot; where it is revealed that she was created by Desire to be Dream&#x27;s lover and to help him escape imprisonment after the Dreaming is invaded by two unspecified gods. Together, they vanquish the Gods, but Dream is unable to make her happy so he creates The Land as a place in which she can be free and contented.

<text>The Seattle Seahawksare a professional American football team based in Seattle. The Seahawks compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The club entered the NFL as an expansion team in 1976 in the NFC. From 1977 to 2001, Seattle was assigned to the American Football Conference (AFC) West; the team rejoined the NFC in 2002. They have played their home games at Lumen Field in Seattle&#x27;s SoDo neighborhood since 2002, having previously played home games in the Kingdome (1976–1999) and Husky Stadium (1994 and 2000–2001).

Seahawks fans have been referred to collectively as the &quot;12s&quot; (formerly the &quot;12th Man&quot;), or the &quot;12th Fan&quot;. The team&#x27;s fans twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event within the span of a few months, first registering 136.6 decibels during a game against the San Francisco 49ers in September 2013, and later registering 137.6 dB during a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the New Orleans Saints that December. As the only NFL team based in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, the Seahawks attract support from a wide geographical area that includes parts of the U.S. states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Utah, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia.

The Seahawks have won 11 division titles and three conference championships, and are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have reached three Super Bowls, losing 21–10 to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Super Bowl XL, defeating the Denver Broncos 43–8 for their first championship at Super Bowl XLVIII, and losing 28–24 to the New England Patriots at Super Bowl XLIX. Players Kenny Easley, Walter Jones, Steve Hutchinson, Cortez Kennedy, and Steve Largent have been voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame primarily or wholly for their accomplishments as Seahawks. In addition, players Dave Brown, Jacob Green, Dave Krieg, Curt Warner, Jim Zorn, Matt Hasselbeck and Shaun Alexander have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with head coaches Chuck Knox and Mike Holmgren, radio announcer Pete Gross, and franchise owner Paul Allen.

==History==

===Nordstrom / Sarkowsky era (1976–1988)===
As per one of the agreed parts of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the NFL began planning to expand from 26 to 28 teams. In June 1972, Seattle Professional Football Inc., a group of Seattle business and community leaders, announced their intention to acquire an NFL franchise for the city of Seattle. In June 1974, the NFL gave the city an expansion franchise. That December, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle announced the official signing of the franchise agreement by Lloyd W. Nordstrom, representing the Nordstrom family as majority partners for the consortium.

In March 1975, John Thompson, former executive director of the NFL Management Council and a former Washington Huskies executive, was hired as the general manager of the new team. The name &quot;Seattle Seahawks&quot; (&quot;seahawk&quot; is another name for osprey) was selected on June 17, 1975, after a public naming contest which drew more than 20,000 entries and over 1,700 names. These include skippers, pioneers, and lumberjacks.

Thompson recruited and hired Jack Patera, a Minnesota Vikings assistant coach, to be the first head coach of the Seahawks; the hiring was announced on January 3, 1976. The expansion draft was held March 30–31, 1976, with Seattle and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers alternating picks for rounds selecting unprotected players from the other 26 teams in the league. The Seahawks were awarded the 2nd overall pick in the 1976 draft, a pick they used on defensive tackle Steve Niehaus. The team took the field for the first time on August 1, 1976, in a pre-season game against the San Francisco 49ers in the then newly opened Kingdome.
The Seahawks are the only NFL team to switch conferences twice in the post-merger era. The franchise began play in 1976 in the aforementioned NFC West but switched conferences with the Buccaneers after one season and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both expansion teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once (the ones in their conference at the time) during their first two seasons. The Seahawks won both matchups against the Buccaneers in their first two seasons, the former of which was the Seahawks&#x27; first regular season victory.

In 1983, the Seahawks hired Chuck Knox as head coach. Finishing with a 9–7 record, the Seahawks made their first post-season appearance, defeating the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round, and then the Miami Dolphins, before losing in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Raiders. The following season, the Seahawks had their best season to that point, finishing 12–4; it would remain the best win–loss record in franchise history until their 2005 season. Knox won the NFL Coach of the Year Award.

=== Behring / Hofmann era (1988–1996) ===
In 1988, Ken Behring and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the team for a reported $80 million. The Seahawks won their first division title in 1988, but would miss the playoffs for the following three seasons, after which Knox left the team. For most of the 1990s, the Seahawks continued to struggle. They saw three consecutive losing seasons (1992–1994) under head coach Tom Flores, including a franchise worst 2–14 season in 1992. Following the 1994 season, Flores was fired from the team and Dennis Erickson was brought in as head coach.

===Paul Allen era (1997–present)===
In 1996, Behring and Hoffman transferred the team&#x27;s operations to Anaheim, California–a widely criticized move, although the team continued to play in Seattle. The team almost relocated, and was in bankruptcy for a short period. The NFL threatened Behring with fining him $500,000 a day if he did not move the team&#x27;s operations back to Seattle; with this, Behring and Hoffman sold the team to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 1997 for $200 million.

Erickson&#x27;s tenure as head coach ended after the 1998 season; the Seahawks missed the playoffs for all four of his seasons with the team, extending their &quot;playoff drought&quot; to ten consecutive seasons.

==== Mike Holmgren years (1999–2008) ====

In 1999, Mike Holmgren was hired as head coach. He would coach for 10 seasons. The Seahawks won their second division title, as well as a wild card berth in the playoffs, losing to the Miami Dolphins 20–17.

In 2002, the Seahawks returned to the NFC West as part of an NFL realignment plan that gave each conference four balanced divisions of four teams each. This realignment restored the AFC West to its initial post-merger roster of original AFL teams Denver, San Diego, Kansas City, and Oakland. That same year, the team opened its new home stadium, Seahawks Stadium, after spending the last two seasons at Husky Stadium after the Kingdome&#x27;s implosion in 2000.

In the 2005 season, the Seahawks had their best season in franchise history (a feat that would later be matched in 2013) with a record of 13–3, which included a 42–0 rout of the Philadelphia Eagles in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game. The 13–3 record earned them the number one seed in the NFC. They defeated the Washington Redskins in the Divisional Round and won the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers, but lost in Super Bowl XL against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The loss was controversial; NFL Films has Super Bowl XL at number 8 on its top ten list of games with controversial referee calls. Referee Bill Leavy later admitted that he missed calls that altered the game. Before 2005, the Seahawks had not won a playoff game since the 1984 season, a streak of 21 years (five teams had ever had a drought of twenty years at the time, with their six straight losses being tied for third-most in history). That drought was ended with a 20–10 win over the Washington Redskins in the 2005 playoffs.

In the 2006 season, the Seahawks finished 9–7 and won the NFC West. The defeated the Dallas Cowboys 21–20 in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Chicago Bears 27–24 in the Divisional Round. In the 2007 season, the Seahawks finished 10–6 and won the NFC West. The team defeated Washington in the Wild Card Round 35–14 before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round 42–20. The 2008 season saw the team go 4–12 and finish third in the NFC West. Holmgren departed from the team after the 2008 season, following the end of his contract. Defensive backs coach Jim L. Mora was named as Holmgren&#x27;s successor. In 2009, the Seahawks finished 3rd in the NFC West with a 5–11 record. Shortly after, Mora was fired on January 8, 2010 and Pete Carroll was hired.

==== Pete Carroll years (2010–2023) ====
===== Pre-Super Bowl (2010–2012) =====
In the 2010 NFL season, the Seahawks made history by making it into the playoffs despite having a 7–9 record. They had the best record in a division full of teams with losing seasons (Seahawks 7–9, Rams 7–9, 49ers 6–10, Cardinals 5–11) and won the decisive season finale against the Rams (not only by overall record, but by division record, as both teams coming into the game had a 3–2 division record). In the playoffs, the Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl XLIV champs, the New Orleans Saints, 41–36. The Seahawks made even more history during the game with Marshawn Lynch&#x27;s 67-yard run, breaking 9 tackles, to clinch the victory. After the run, the fans reacted so loudly that a small earthquake (a bit above 2 on the Richter Scale) was recorded by seismic equipment around Seattle. Lynch&#x27;s run would be nicknamed the &quot;Beast Quake&quot;. The Seahawks lost to the Bears in their second game, 35–24. The 2011 season saw the team go 7–9 once again, but they were not able to get into the postseason with a third-place finish in the NFC West.

The 2012 NFL season started with doubt, as the Seahawks lost their season opener against the Arizona Cardinals. The highly touted Seattle defense gave up a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter, and rookie quarterback Russell Wilson failed to throw the game-winning touchdown after multiple attempts in the red-zone. However, Russell Wilson and the Seahawks went 4–1 in their next five games en route to an 11–5 overall record (their first winning record since 2007). Their 2012 campaign included big wins over the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, and San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks went into the playoffs as the No. 5 seed and the only team that season to go undefeated at home. In the Wild Card Round, the Seahawks overcame a 14-point deficit to defeat the Washington Redskins. This was the first time since the 1983 Divisional Round that the Seahawks won a playoff game on the road. However, in the 2012 Divisional Round, overcoming a 20-point, fourth-quarter deficit would not be enough to defeat the #1 seed Atlanta Falcons. An ill-advised timeout and a defensive breakdown late in the game cost the Seahawks their season, as they lost, 30–28. Quarterback Russell Wilson won the 2012 Pepsi MAX Rookie of the Year award.

===== Super Bowl XLVIII champions (2013) =====
In the 2013 NFL season, the Seahawks continued their momentum from the previous season, finishing tied with the Denver Broncos for an NFL-best regular season record of 13–3, while earning the NFC&#x27;s #1 playoff seed. Their 2013 campaign included big wins over the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and the San Francisco 49ers. Six Seahawks players were named to the Pro Bowl: Quarterback Russell Wilson, center Max Unger, running back Marshawn Lynch, cornerback Richard Sherman, free safety Earl Thomas, and strong safety Kam Chancellor. However, none of them were able to play in the Pro Bowl, as the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints 23–15 and the San Francisco 49ers 23–17, in the playoffs to advance to Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos. On February 2, 2014, the Seahawks won the franchise&#x27;s only Super Bowl Championship, defeating Denver 43–8. The Seahawks&#x27; defense performance in 2013 was acclaimed as one of the best in the Super Bowl era.

===== Post-championship years (2014–2023) =====

The 2014 campaign saw the team lose some key pieces, including wide receiver Golden Tate to free agency and wide receiver Sidney Rice and defensive end Chris Clemons to retirement. Percy Harvin was also let go mid-season after several underachieving weeks and clashes with the rest of the locker room. Despite starting 3–3, they rallied to a 12–4 record, good enough once again for the #1 seed in the NFC Playoffs. After dispatching the Carolina Panthers handily in the Divisional Round 31–17, they faced the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game. Despite five turnovers and trailing 19–7 late in the contest, the Seahawks prevailed in overtime to reach Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots, but an ill-fated interception at the 1-yard line late in the championship game stymied a comeback attempt and thwarted the Seahawks&#x27; bid to be the first repeat Super Bowl champions since the Patriots had won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX.

The Seahawks returned to the playoffs in both 2015 and 2016, but despite winning the Wild Card game in both years they failed to win either Divisional round game on the road. The 2017 iteration of the team missed the playoffs for the first time in six years, as injuries to their core players coupled with disappointing acquisitions of running back Eddie Lacy and kicker Blair Walsh failed them in a competitive NFC. The team cut ties with most of the remaining players that had been part of their meteoric rise and turnover both their Offensive and Defensive coaching staff in 2018, and an influx of young talent helped propel the team to a 10–6 record and another playoff berth that ultimately ended in a loss in the Wild Card game to the Dallas Cowboys. In October 2018, owner Paul Allen died after a prolonged fight with cancer. In 2019, the Seahawks put up their best record since their last trip to the Super Bowl at 11–5, but they still lost 3 out of their last 4 games and lost their chance to win the NFC West. A likely explanation for their sloppy finish is because many of their players were injured late in the season. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 17–9 in the Wild Card game, they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional round, failing another attempt at a second Super Bowl.

The 2020 season saw the Seahawks win their first five games, a franchise-best for a start to a season. Despite the Seahawks losing three of their next four games, the Seahawks finished strong, earning twelve victories for the first time since their Super Bowl season in 2014, and winning the division for the first time in four years. However, despite the 12–4 record and the division title, the Seahawks&#x27; season ended the following week against the Los Angeles Rams, who never trailed in a 30–20 victory. The Seahawks struggled and started the 2021 season 3–8. Russell Wilson had an injured finger missing 3 games and the Seahawks were shut out the first time in the Wilson era in Week 10 against the Green Bay Packers. This was their worst first half of a season since 2009, under then-head coach Jim Mora. The Seahawks were eliminated from playoff contention on December 26 in a loss to the Chicago Bears, and they finished last in their division for the first time since 1996. With wins over the Detroit Lions and the Arizona Cardinals they finished 7–10.

Following the 2021 season was an offseason of continuing change, punctuated with the trade of quarterback Russell Wilson to the team he and the Seahawks beat in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Denver Broncos, on March 6, 2022. The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive end Shelby Harris, two first round picks (for that year&#x27;s draft, No. 9 overall, and 2023&#x27;s), two second round picks (that year&#x27;s, No. 40 overall, and 2023&#x27;s) and a 2022 fifth round selection to the Seahawks for Wilson and a 2022 fourth round pick. Another hallmark franchise player from the Super Bowl-winning Seahawks, former All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner, was also cut by the team that same day, a move that saves them $16.6 million in cap space. The Seahawks also took on $26 million in dead money by trading Wilson; ESPN Stats &amp; Information research revealed it to be the second-most dead money a team has ever incurred, trailing the $33.8 million the Philadelphia Eagles ate in their trade of Carson Wentz the previous year.

In the 2022 season, the Seahawks finished with a 9–8 record and made the playoffs. The team&#x27;s season ended in the Wild Card round with a 41–23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The 2023 season saw the Seahawks finish 9–8 and miss the postseason. Carroll was fired from his head coaching position after the 2023 season. Carroll remained with the team in an unspecified advisory role.

==== Mike Macdonald years (2024–present) ====
Mike Macdonald, formerly defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens, was hired as the new head coach. In the 2024 season, the Seahawks went 10–7 but missed the postseason.

==Logos and uniforms==

When the Seahawks debuted in , the team&#x27;s logo was a stylized royal blue and forest green osprey&#x27;s head based on Kwakwakaʼwakw art masks. The helmet and pants were silver while the home jerseys were royal blue with white and green sleeve stripes and white numerals and names. The road jersey was white, with white, blue and green sleeve stripes and had blue numerals and names. The socks were blue and had the same green and white striping pattern seen on the blue jerseys. Black shoes were worn for the first four seasons, one of the few NFL teams that did so in the late 1970s, at a time when most teams were wearing white shoes. They would switch to white shoes in 1980.

In , coinciding with the arrival of Chuck Knox as head coach, the uniforms were updated slightly. The striping on the arms now incorporated the Seahawks logo, and the &quot;TV numbers&quot;, previously located on the sleeves, moved onto the shoulders. The helmet facemasks changed from gray to blue. Also, the socks went solid blue at the top, and white on bottom. In the 1985 season, the team wore 10th Anniversary patches on the left side of their pants. It had the Seahawks logo streaking through the number 10. In 1994, the year of the NFL&#x27;s 75th Anniversary, the Seahawks changed the style of their numbering to something more suitable for the team; Pro Block from then until 2001. That same year, the Seahawks wore a vintage jersey for select games resembling the 1976–82 uniforms. However, the helmet facemasks remained blue. The logos also became sewn on instead of being screen-printed. In 2000, Shaun Alexander&#x27;s rookie year and Cortez Kennedy&#x27;s last, the Seattle Seahawks celebrated their 25th Anniversary; the logo was worn on the upper left chest of the jersey. In 2001, the Seahawks switched to the new Reebok uniform system still in their then-current uniforms after that company signed a 10-year deal to be the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL, but it would be their last in this uniform after the season ended. Prior to this, various companies made the team&#x27;s uniforms.
On March 1, , to coincide with the team moving to the NFC as well as the opening of Seahawks Stadium, both the logo and the uniforms were heavily redesigned. The Wordmark was designed by Mark Verlander and the logo was designed by NFL Properties in-house design team. The colors were modified to a lighter &quot;Seahawks Blue&quot;, a darker &quot;Seahawks Navy&quot; and lime green piping. The helmets also were changed from silver to the lighter &quot;Seahawks Blue&quot; color after a fan poll was conducted. Silver would not be seen again until 2012. The logo artwork was also subtly altered, with an arched eyebrow and a forward-facing pupil suggesting a more aggressive-looking bird. At first, the team had planned to wear silver helmets at home and blue helmets on the road, but since NFL rules forbid the use of multiple helmets, the team held the fan poll to decide which color helmet would be worn. The team had usually worn all blue at home and all white on the road since 2003, but late in the 2009 season, the Seahawks wore the white jersey-blue pants combo. The blue jersey and white pants combo has been worn for only one regular-season game, the 2005 season opener at the Jacksonville Jaguars, while the white jersey and blue pants combination has not been worn regularly since late in the 2002 season, with the exception of late in the 2009 season. In 2009, the Seahawks once again wore the white jersey and blue pants combination for road games against Minnesota (November 22), St. Louis (November 29), Houston (December 13), and Green Bay (December 27).

The Seahawks wore their home blue jerseys during Super Bowl XL despite being designated as the visitor, since the Pittsburgh Steelers, the designated home team, elected to wear their white jerseys.
On September 27, 2009, the Seahawks wore lime green jerseys for the first time, paired with new dark navy blue pants in a game against the Chicago Bears. The jerseys matched their new sister team, the expansion Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer who wear green jerseys with blue pants. On December 6, 2009, the Seahawks wore their Seahawks blue jersey with the new dark navy blue pants for the first time, in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks broke out the same combo two weeks later against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and two weeks after that in the 2009 regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans. In December 2009, then-coach Jim Mora announced that the new lime green jerseys were being retired because the team did not win in them, because he liked the standard blue home jerseys better, and added that the home jersey is a better match for the navy pants. In the same press conference, he stated that the new navy pants &quot;felt better&quot; on players as opposed to the Seahawks blue pants. For the 2010 season, Seattle returned to the traditional all &quot;Seahawks Blue&quot; at home and all white on the road.
On April 3, 2012, Nike, which took over as the official uniform supplier for the league from Reebok, unveiled new uniform and logo designs for the Seahawks for the 2012 season. The new designs incorporate a new accent color, &quot;Wolf Grey&quot;, and the main colors are &quot;College Navy&quot; and &quot;Action Green&quot;. The uniforms incorporate &quot;feather trims&quot;, multiple feathers on the crown of the helmet, twelve feathers printed on the neckline and down each pant leg to represent the &quot;12th Man&quot;, referring to the team&#x27;s fans. The Seahawks have three different jersey colors: navy blue, white, and an alternate grey jersey. The Seahawks will have three different pants: navy blue with green feathers, gray with navy blue feathers, and white with navy blue feathers. Their new logo replaces the Seahawk blue with wolf grey. Altogether, there are nine different uniform combinations possible.

The Seahawks wore their Nike home blue jerseys for the first regular-season game on September 16, 2012, against the Dallas Cowboys. The uniform Marshawn Lynch wore in that game is preserved at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. On September 9, 2012, the Seahawks wore their Nike white away jerseys for the first regular-season game against the Arizona Cardinals; on October 14, 2012, with the Carolina Panthers wearing white at home, they wore their blue jerseys with gray pants (and would do so again against the Miami Dolphins seven weeks later); and on December 16, 2012, they wore their Alternate Wolf Grey jerseys for the first time against the Buffalo Bills.

The all-navy ensemble is the Seahawks&#x27; current primary uniform option for home games. Initially, the Seahawks paired their navy uniforms with gray pants on select road games in which the home team wore white jerseys, but on December 5, 2021, the Seahawks wore this combination at home for the first time in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. On the road, the Seahawks primarily pair their white uniforms with the navy pants (that combination was used during their Super Bowl XLVIII win), although they also pair the white uniforms with either white or gray pants on occasion. The all-gray uniforms were worn occasionally on the road, mainly against the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2016, the Seahawks unveiled their NFL Color Rush uniform, an all-Action Green ensemble. They first wore the uniform on December 16 against the Los Angeles Rams at home, marking the first time they wore green uniforms since 2009. The Seahawks continue to wear the Color Rush set as an alternate uniform alongside the all-gray combination.

During a home matchup with the Vikings on December 3, 2019, the Seahawks wore their Color Rush green tops and regular navy pants. The combination was used again on October 11, 2020, also against the Vikings, and then again on November 19, against the Arizona Cardinals. It was used once in 2021, on Thursday Night Football vs. the Rams.

In July 2023, the Seahawks introduced a throwback uniform set inspired by the team&#x27;s 1983–2001 design. These uniforms were worn in Week 8 against the Cleveland Browns. Consequently, the gray alternate tops were retired due to NFL regulations restricting teams to two alternate jerseys.

Prior to 2023, the Seahawks were the only NFL team to have never worn white jerseys in a home game. However, on September 24, 2023, the Seahawks wore their white jerseys at home for the first time, doing so against the Carolina Panthers. The game served as the 10th anniversary of the Seahawks&#x27; first Super Bowl victory, as the current team wore the same white jersey/navy pants combination from Super Bowl XLVIII.

==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
==== Los Angeles Rams ====
The rivalry between the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams came into existence in 2002 following the Seahawks&#x27; relocation to the NFC West. The first notable matchup between the two clubs occurred in the 2004 NFC Wild card round when the Rams managed to defeat the Seahawks in Seattle 27–20 and currently hold the streak for the only two wins against the Seahawks at home during the postseason. Much of the intensity waned as the Rams declined in competition throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, but several notable matchups between the two clubs would still occur. The rivalry saw new life as the Rams&#x27; Mob Squad-era teams regularly clashed with Seattle&#x27;s Legion of Boom era teams, often escalating into bitter grudge matches for control of the division. Following the Rams&#x27; return to Los Angeles in 2016, and subsequent playoff success (most recently with a Super Bowl victory in 2022); the rivalry has increased in intensity; especially as Seattle&#x27;s Legion of Boom era teams waned in competition. Due to the recent dominance by the Rams under Sean McVay and former defensive tackle Aaron Donald, Seahawks fans have recently viewed the Rams as their divisional arch rival. Tensions especially ran high during the 2021 Wild Card game following a widely publicized taunt from Safety Jamal Adams during a postgame conference after a tough win over the Rams during week 16. The Rams would go onto decimate the Seahawks in the wild card game, with cornerback Jalen Ramsey and quarterback Jared Goff expressing their satisfaction to get retribution following Adams&#x27; comments and cigar gesture.

As of the 2024 season, the Seahawks lead the series 28–27, but the Rams have won both playoff meetings.

==== San Francisco 49ers ====
From 2011 to 2014, the Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers emerged as two of the best teams in the NFC, and developed a rivalry as a result. The 49ers head coach at the time, Jim Harbaugh, had a contentious history with Seahawks coach Pete Carroll due to Harbaugh&#x27;s previous job as coach at Stanford against Carroll&#x27;s USC Trojans. Harbaugh&#x27;s 49ers won the first three head-to-head contests but lost Week 16 of 2012. Both teams reached the playoffs that year, however the 49ers reached Super Bowl XLVII, which they lost. In 2013, the Seahawks won in a Week 2 contest, but the 49ers would triumph in Week 14. The Seahawks would beat the 49ers in the 2013 season NFC Championship Game 23–17 in a controversial win. The Seahawks went on to win the next 10 matchups, sweeping the regular season series against the 49ers from 2014 to 2018. After splitting games in 2018 and 2019, the 49ers won 6 straight against the Seahawks, including the 2022 wild card game. The Seahawks won the second matchup of 2024 to end the streak.

As of the end of the 2024 season, the Seahawks lead the series 31–23.

==== Arizona Cardinals ====
The Arizona Cardinals and Seahawks became divisional rivals after both were relocated to the NFC West as a result of the league&#x27;s realignment in 2002. This rivalry has become one of the NFL&#x27;s more bitter in recent years, as the mid-to-late 2010s often saw the Seahawks and Cardinals squaring off for NFC West supremacy. The rivalry hit its peak as the Cardinals frequently clashed with the Legion Of Boom-era Seahawks led by Russell Wilson and head coach Pete Carroll, although Seattle shares more intense rivalries with the Rams and 49ers. Seattle leads the series 27–22–1, and the two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.

===Conference===
==== Green Bay Packers ====

Since moving to the NFC, the Seahawks have faced the Green Bay Packers several times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs&#x27; first playoff meeting in in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive, the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX. As of the 2024 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 16–9.

=== Historic ===
==== Denver Broncos ====
From the 1980s to the 2002 league realignment, the Denver Broncos were a major rival for the Seahawks. As of the 2023 season, the Broncos lead 35–23 against the Seahawks with Seattle having won both postseason meetings. Since 2002, Denver has won three of five interconference meetings, and the teams met in Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014, where the Seahawks won 43–8. On March 8, 2022, the Seattle Seahawks agreed to trade Russell Wilson and a 2022 fourth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks (2022—No. 9 overall—and 2023), two second-round picks (2022—No. 40 overall—and 2023) and a 2022 fifth-round selection. Russell Wilson&#x27;s first game against the Seattle Seahawks as a member of the Denver Broncos was played September 12, 2022, on Monday Night Football, where the Seahawks won 17–16.

====Oakland Raiders====
The Raiders and Seahawks played many times being old members of the AFC West. Seattle&#x27;s move to the NFC has made the matchup occur much less frequently, playing only five times since the end of the 2002 season. The Raiders lead the all-time series 30–26.

==Headquarters and training camps==
During the Seahawks&#x27; first ten seasons (1976–85), the team&#x27;s headquarters was in Kirkland at the southern end of the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point), on the shores of Lake Washington. The summer training camps were held across the state at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, southwest of Spokane.

When the team&#x27;s new headquarters across town in Kirkland was completed in 1986, the Seahawks held training camp at home for the next eleven seasons (1986–96), staying in the dormitories of the adjacent Northwest College. In 1997, Dennis Erickson&#x27;s third season as head coach, the team returned to the hotter and more isolated Cheney for training camp, which continued through 2006. In 2007, training camp returned to the Seahawk&#x27;s Kirkland facility because of the scheduled China Bowl (NFL) game, which was later canceled. In 2008, the Seahawks held the first three weeks of camp in Kirkland, then moved to the new Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) on August 18 for the final week of training camp, where the team has held their training camps since. The new facility, adjacent to Lake Washington in Renton, has four full-size practice fields: three natural grass outdoors and one FieldTurf indoors.

==Seasons and overall records==

As of the end of the 2023 season, the Seattle Seahawks have competed in 48 NFL seasons, dating back to their expansion year of 1976. The team has compiled a () regular-season record and a () record in the playoffs, for an overall record of and a winning percentage. Seattle has reached the playoffs in 20 separate seasons, including in the 2005 season when they lost Super Bowl XL to the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2013 season when they defeated the Denver Broncos to win Super Bowl XLVIII, and the 2014 season when they lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots. In the 2010 season, the Seahawks became the first team in NFL history to earn a spot in the playoffs with a losing record (7–9, .438) in a full season; this was by winning the division. The Seahawks would go on to defeat the reigning Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the Wild Card round, becoming the first team ever to win a playoff game with a losing record. Until Week 7 of the 2016 season against the Arizona Cardinals, the Seahawks had never recorded a tied game in their history.

==Team culture==
===12th Man===


The 12s (formerly the 12th man) refers to the fan support of the Seahawks. The team&#x27;s first home stadium, the Kingdome, was one of the loudest and most disruptive environments in the NFL. Opponents were known to practice with rock music blaring at full blast to prepare for the often painfully high decibel levels generated at games in the Kingdome.

In 2002, the Seahawks began playing at what is now Lumen Field. Every regular season and playoff game at Lumen Field since the second week of the 2003 season has been played before a sellout crowd. Like the Kingdome before it, Lumen Field is one of the loudest stadiums in the league. The stadium&#x27;s partial roof and seating decks trap and amplify the noise and reflect it back down to the field. This noise has caused problems for opposing teams, causing them to commit numerous false-start penalties. From 2002 through 2012, there have been 143 false-start penalties on visiting teams in Seattle, second only to the Minnesota Vikings.

The Seahawks&#x27; fans have twice set the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event, first on September 15, 2013, registering 136.6 dB during a game against the San Francisco 49ers and again on December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints, with a roar of 137.6 dB. As of September 29, 2014, the record of 142.2 dB is held in Arrowhead Stadium by fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.

Prior to kickoff of each home game, the Seahawks salute their fans by raising a giant #12 flag at the south end of the stadium. Current and former players, coaches, local celebrities, prominent fans including Patti Hammond, Seattle-area athletes, and former owner Paul Allen have raised the flag. Earlier, the Seahawks retired the #12 jersey on December 15, 1984, as a tribute to their fans. Before their Super Bowl win, the Seahawks ran onto the field under a giant 12th Man flag.

In September 1990, Texas A&amp;M University filed, and was later granted, a trademark application for the &quot;12th Man&quot; term, based on their continual usage of the term since the 1920s. In January 2006, Texas A&amp;M filed suit against the Seattle Seahawks to protect the trademark and in May 2006, the dispute was settled out of court. In the agreement, which expired in 2016, Texas A&amp;M licensed the Seahawks to continue using the phrase, in exchange for a licensing fee, public acknowledgement of A&amp;M&#x27;s trademark when using the term, a restriction in usage of the term to seven states in the Northwest United States, and a prohibition from selling any &quot;12th Man&quot; merchandise. Once the agreement expired, the Seahawks were allowed to continue using the number &quot;12&quot; but were no longer permitted to use the &quot;12th Man&quot; phrase. In August 2015, the Seahawks decided to drop their signage of the &quot;12th Man&quot; term and shifted towards referring to their fans as the &quot;12s&quot; instead.

===Mascots===

Starting in the 1998 season, Blitz has been the Seahawks&#x27; official mascot. Prior to the 2014 NFL season, Blitz was given a new look and a sidekick; a secondary mascot named Boom was introduced to appeal to and interact with younger children.

In the 2003 and 2004 seasons, a hawk named Faith would fly around the stadium just before the team came out of the tunnel. However, because of her relatively small size and an inability to be trained to lead the team out of the tunnel, Faith was replaced by an augur hawk named Taima before the start of the 2005 NFL season. Taima started leading the team out of the tunnel in September 2006.

===Cheerleaders===
A group of female and male cheerleaders known as the Seahawks Dancers rallies the crowd from the sidelines and performs a halftime routine during home games at Lumen Field. The group was an all-female squad called the Sea Gals prior to admitting male members and re-branding ahead of the 2019 NFL season. During the off-season, a select performing group from the Dancers travels to parades and other events, as well as with other NFL Cheerleaders on the road.

===Band===
Beginning in 2004, the Seahawks introduced their drum line, the Blue Thunder. The group plays at every home game as well as over 100 events in the Seattle community.

==Radio and television==
The Seahawks&#x27; flagship station is KIRO – KIRO-FM . Games are heard on 47 stations in five western states and Canada. Microsoft holds naming rights for the broadcasts for their web search engine under the moniker of the &quot;Bing Radio Network&quot;. The current announcers are former Seahawks players Steve Raible (who was the team&#x27;s color commentator from ) and Dave Wyman. The Raible-Wyman regular season pairing has been together since the final four games of 2017 but became full time starting in 2018. On local television broadcast preseason games are split between former Seahawks Paul Moyer, Sam Adkins, and Brock Huard. Pete Gross, who called the games from until just days before his death from cancer in , is a member of the team&#x27;s Ring of Honor. Other past announcers include Steve Thomas from , Lee Hamilton (also known as &quot;Hacksaw&quot;) from , Brian Davis from , and former Seahawk Warren Moon from .

Preseason games not shown on national networks were produced in-house by Seahawks Broadcasting and televised by KING-TV, channel 5 (and, in 2008, also on sister station KONG-TV since KING, an NBC affiliate, was committed to the Summer Olympics in China). Kate Scott became the announcer for Seahawks TV preseason games in 2023, replacing Curt Menefee (the host of &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot;) who had been the Seahawks TV voice since the 2009 preseason. KCPQ-TV, which airs most of the Seahawks&#x27; regular-season games (as the Seattle-Tacoma area&#x27;s Fox affiliate), became the television partner for the team in 2012 and replaced KING-TV as broadcaster for preseason games, but KING-TV regained the partnership in 2022; simulcasts of any Seahawks games on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; air (as of the 2018 season) on CBS affiliate KIRO-TV. In addition, any Saturday or Sunday afternoon games broadcast by CBS (usually—but not always—with the Seahawks hosting an AFC opponent) will air on KIRO-TV.

<text>The Saint is the nickname of the fictional character Simon Templar, featured in a series of novels and short stories by Leslie Charteris published between 1928 and 1963. After that date other authors collaborated with Charteris on books until 1983; two additional works produced without Charteris&#x27;s participation were published in 1997. The character has also been portrayed in the franchise &quot;The Saint&quot;, which includes motion pictures, radio dramas, comic strips, comic books, and three television series.

==Overview==
===Simon Templar===
Simon Templar is a Robin Hood-like figure known as the Saint—from his initials, per &quot;The Saint Meets the Tiger&quot;, and the reader is told that he was given the nickname at the age of nineteen. In addition, per &quot;Knight Templar&quot;:

Templar has aliases, often using the initials S.T. such as &quot;Sebastian Tombs&quot; or &quot;Sugarman Treacle&quot;. Blessed with boyish humour, he makes humorous remarks and leaves a &quot;calling card&quot; at his &quot;crimes,&quot; a stick figure of a man with a halo over his head. This is used as the logo of the books, the films, and the three TV series. Supposedly, the stick figure was created by Charteris when he was a boy, &quot;...drawing cartoons for his own four-page magazine at 10...&quot;

He is described as &quot;a buccaneer in the suits of Savile Row, amused, cool, debonair, with hell-for-leather blue eyes and a saintly smile&quot;.

His origin remains a mystery; he is explicitly British, but in early books (e.g. &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot;) there are references which suggest that he had spent some time in the United States battling Prohibition villains. Presumably, his acquaintance with Bronx sidekick Hoppy Uniatz dates from this period. In the books, his income is derived from the pockets of the &quot;ungodly&quot; (as he terms those who live by a lesser moral code than his own), whom he is given to &quot;socking on the boko.&quot; There are references to a &quot;ten percent collection fee&quot; to cover expenses when he extracts large sums from victims, the remainder being returned to the owners, given to charity, shared among Templar&#x27;s colleagues, or some combination of those possibilities.

Templar&#x27;s targets include corrupt politicians, warmongers, and other low life. &quot;He claims he&#x27;s a Robin Hood,&quot; says one victim, &quot;but to me he&#x27;s just a robber and a hood.&quot; Robin Hood appears to be one inspiration for the character; Templar stories were often promoted as featuring &quot;The Robin Hood of modern crime,&quot; and this phrase to describe Templar appears in several stories. A term used by Templar to describe his acquisitions is &quot;boodle,&quot; a term also applied to the short story collection.

The Saint has a dark side, as he is willing to ruin the lives of the &quot;ungodly,&quot; and even kill them, if he feels that more innocent lives can be saved. In the early books, Templar refers to this as murder, although he considers his actions justified and righteous, a view usually shared by partners and colleagues. Several adventures centre on his intention to kill. (For example, &quot;Arizona&quot; in &quot;The Saint Goes West&quot; has Templar planning to kill a Nazi scientist.)

During the 1920s and early 1930s, the Saint is fighting European arms dealers, drug runners, and white slavers while based in his London home. His battles with Rayt Marius mirror the &#x27;four rounds with Carl Petersen&#x27; of Bulldog Drummond. During the first half of the 1940s, Charteris cast Templar as a willing operative of the American government, fighting Nazi interests in the United States during World War II.

Beginning with the &quot;Arizona&quot; novella, Templar is fighting his own war against Germany. &quot;The Saint Steps In&quot; reveals that Templar is operating on behalf of a mysterious American government official known as Hamilton who appears again in the next WWII-era Saint book, &quot;The Saint on Guard,&quot; and Templar is shown continuing to act as a secret agent for Hamilton in the first post-war novel, &quot;The Saint Sees it Through.&quot; The later books move from confidence games, murder mysteries, and wartime espionage, and place Templar as a global adventurer.

According to &quot;Saint&quot; historian Burl Barer, Charteris made the decision to remove Templar from his usual confidence-game trappings, not to mention his usual co-stars Uniatz, girlfriend Patricia Holm, valet Orace, and police foil Claud Eustace Teal, as they were all inappropriate for the post-war stories he was writing.

Although the Saint functions as an ordinary detective in some stories, others depict ingenious plots to get even with vanity publishers and other rip-off artists, greedy bosses who exploit their workers, con men, etc.

Charteris gave Templar interests and quirks as the series went on. Early talents as an amateur poet and songwriter were displayed, often to taunt villains, though the novella &quot;The Inland Revenue&quot; established that poetry was also a hobby. That story revealed that Templar had written an adventure novel featuring a South American hero not far removed from The Saint himself.

Templar also on occasion would break the fourth wall in an almost metafictional sense, making references to being part of a story and mentioning in one early story how he cannot be killed so early on; the 1960s television series would also have Templar address viewers. Charteris in his narrative also frequently breaks the fourth wall by making references to the &quot;chronicler&quot; of the Saint&#x27;s adventures and directly addressing the reader. In the story &quot;The Sizzling Saboteur&quot; in &quot;The Saint on Guard&quot; Charteris inserts his own name. In the story &quot;Judith&quot; in &quot;Saint Errant&quot; is the line, &quot;&#x27;This,&#x27; the Saint said to nobody in particular, &#x27;sounds like one of those stories that fellow Charteris might write.&#x27;&quot; Furthermore, in the 1955 story &quot;The Unkind Philanthropist,&quot; published in the collection &quot;The Saint on the Spanish Main,&quot; Templar states outright that (in his fictional universe) his adventures are indeed written about by a man named Leslie Charteris.

===Other recurring characters===
The Saint has many partners, though none last throughout the series. For the first half until the late 1940s, the most recurrent is Patricia Holm, his girlfriend, who was introduced in the first story, the 1928 novel &quot;Meet the Tiger,&quot; in which she shows herself a capable adventurer. Holm appeared erratically throughout the series, sometimes disappearing for books at a time. Templar and Holm lived together in a time when common-law relationships were uncommon and, in some areas, illegal.

They have an easy, non-binding relationship, as Templar is shown flirting with other women from time to time. However, his heart remains true to Holm in the early books, culminating in his considering marriage in the novella &quot;The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal,&quot; only to have Holm say that she had no interest in marrying. Holm disappeared in the late 1940s, and according to Barer&#x27;s history of &quot;The Saint,&quot; Charteris refused to allow Templar a steady girlfriend, or Holm to return. (However, according to the Saintly Bible website, Charteris did write a film story that would have seen Templar encountering a son he had had with Holm.) Holm&#x27;s final appearance as a character was in the short stories &quot;Iris,&quot; &quot;Lida,&quot; and &quot;Luella,&quot; contained within the 1948 collection &quot;Saint Errant;&quot; the next direct reference to her does not appear in print until the 1983 novel &quot;Salvage for the Saint.&quot;

Another recurring character, Scotland Yard Inspector Claud Eustace Teal, could be found attempting to put the Saint behind bars, although in some books they work in partnership. In &quot;The Saint in New York,&quot; Teal&#x27;s American counterpart, NYPD Inspector John Henry Fernack, was introduced, and he would become, like Teal, an Inspector Lestrade-like foil and pseudo-nemesis in a number of books, notably the American-based World War II novels of the 1940s.
The Saint had a band of compatriots, including Roger Conway, Norman Kent, Archie Sheridan, Richard &quot;Dicky&quot; Tremayne (a name that appeared in the 1990s TV series, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;), Peter Quentin, Monty Hayward, and his ex-military valet, Orace.

In later stories, the dim-witted and constantly soused but reliable American thug Hoppy Uniatz was at Templar&#x27;s side. Of the Saint&#x27;s companions, only Norman Kent was killed during an adventure (he sacrifices himself to save Templar in the novel &quot;The Last Hero&quot;); the other males are presumed to have settled down and married (two to former female criminals: Dicky Tremayne to &quot;Straight Audrey&quot; Perowne and Peter Quentin to Kathleen &quot;The Mug&quot; Allfield; Archie Sheridan is mentioned to have married in &quot;The Lawless Lady&quot; in &quot;Enter the Saint,&quot; presumably to Lilla McAndrew after the events of the story &quot;The Wonderful War&quot; in &quot;Featuring the Saint).&quot;

===The Hirondel===
The Hirondel (sometimes misspelled as Hirondelle) is a fictional car driven by Simon Templar. The Hirondel is an opulent, eight-cylinder, cream and red vehicle costing £5,000 and is a recurring element in many of The Saint books. The Hirondel is also used by Storm (Captain Arden) in the non-Saint novel &quot;Daredevil.&quot; &quot;Daredevil&quot; also features inspector Teal. The Hirondel was featured in a 1972 issue of &quot;Automobile Quarterly&quot; (Vol. 10 No. 1).

==Publishing history==

The origins of the Saint can be found in early works by Charteris, some of which predated the first Saint novel, 1928&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot;, or were written after it but before Charteris committed to writing a Saint series. Burl Barer reveals that an obscure early work, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, not only featured a heroic lead who shared &quot;Saintly&quot; traits (down to driving the same make of car) but also shared his adventures with Inspector Claud Eustace Teal—a character later a regular in Saint books. Barer writes that several early Saint stories were rewritten from non-Saint stories, including the novel &quot;She Was a Lady&quot;, which appeared in magazine form featuring a different lead character.

Charteris utilized three formats for delivering his stories. Besides full-length novels, he wrote novellas for the most part published in magazines, notably developing the character in the pages of the British story-paper &quot;The Thriller&quot; under the tutelage of Monty Hayden, who was developing the ″Desperado″ character type for the magazine, and these were later collected in hardback books collecting two or three stories per volume. He also wrote short stories featuring the character, again mostly for magazines and later compiled into omnibus editions. In later years these short stories carried a common theme, such as the women Templar meets or exotic places he visits. With the exception of &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot;, chapter titles of Templar novels usually contain a descriptive phrase describing the events of the chapter; for example, Chapter Four of &quot;Knight Templar&quot; is titled &quot;How Simon Templar dozed in the Green Park and discovered a new use for toothpaste&quot;.

Although Charteris&#x27;s novels and novellas had more conventional thriller plots than his confidence game short stories, both novels and stories are admired. As in the past, the appeal lies in the vitality of the character, a hero who can go into a brawl and come out with his hair combed and who, faced with death, lights a cigarette and taunts his enemy with the signature phrase &quot;As the actress said to the bishop ...&quot;

The period of the books begins in the 1920s and moves to the 1970s as the 50 books progress (the character being seemingly ageless). In early books most activities are illegal, although directed at villains. In later books, this becomes less so. In books written during World War II, the Saint was recruited by the government to help track spies and similar undercover work. Later he became a cold warrior fighting Communism. The quality of writing also changes; early books have a freshness which becomes replaced by cynicism in later works. A few Saint stories crossed into science fiction and fantasy, &quot;The Man Who Liked Ants&quot; and the early novel &quot;The Last Hero&quot; being examples; one Saint short story, &quot;The Darker Drink&quot; (also published as &quot;Dawn&quot;), was even published in the October 1952 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. When early Saint books were republished in the 1960s to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to see freshly written introductions by Charteris apologizing for the out-of-date tone; according to a Charteris &quot;apology&quot; in a 1969 paperback of &quot;Featuring the Saint&quot;, he attempted to update some earlier stories when they were reprinted but gave up and let them sit as period pieces. The 1963 edition of the short story collection &quot;The Happy Highwayman&quot; contains examples of abandoned revisions; in one story published in the 1930s (&quot;The Star Producers&quot;), references to actors of the 1930s were replaced for 1963 with names of current movie stars; another 1930s-era story, &quot;The Man Who Was Lucky&quot;, added references to atomic power. Although Templar is depicted as ageless, Charteris occasionally acknowledged the passing of time for those around him, such as in the 1956 short story collection &quot;The Saint Around the World&quot; which features the retirement of Inspector Teal in one story.

Charteris started retiring from writing books following 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Saint in the Sun&quot;. The next book to carry Charteris&#x27;s name, 1964&#x27;s &quot;Vendetta for the Saint&quot;, was written by science fiction author Harry Harrison, who had worked on the &quot;Saint&quot; comic strip, after which Charteris edited and revised the manuscript. Between 1964 and 1983, another 14 &quot;Saint&quot; books would be published, credited to Charteris but written by others. In his introduction to the first, &quot;The Saint on TV&quot;, Charteris called these volumes a team effort in which he oversaw selection of stories, initially adaptations of scripts written for the 1962–1969 TV series &quot;The Saint&quot;, and with Fleming Lee writing the adaptations (other authors took over from Lee). Charteris and Lee collaborated on two Saint novels in the 1970s, &quot;The Saint in Pursuit&quot; (based on a story by Charteris for the &quot;Saint&quot; comic strip) and &quot;The Saint and the People Importers&quot;. The &quot;team&quot; writers were usually credited on the title page, if not the cover. One later volume, &quot;Catch the Saint&quot;, was an experiment in returning The Saint to his period, prior to World War II (as opposed to recent Saint books set in the present day). Several later volumes also adapted scripts from the 1970s revival TV series &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;.

The last &quot;Saint&quot; volume in the line of books starting with &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot; in 1928 was &quot;Salvage for the Saint&quot;, published in 1983. According to the Saintly Bible website, every Saint book published between 1928 and 1983 saw the first edition issued by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in the United Kingdom (a company that originally published only religious books) and The Crime Club (an imprint of Doubleday that specialized in mystery and detective fiction) in the United States. For the first 20 years, the books were first published in Britain, with the United States edition following up to a year later. By the late 1940s to early 1950s, this situation had been reversed. In one case—&quot;The Saint to the Rescue&quot;—a British edition did not appear until nearly two years after the American one.

French language books published over 30 years included translated volumes of Charteris originals as well as novelisations of radio scripts from the English-language radio series and comic strip adaptations. Many of these books credited to Charteris were written by others, including Madeleine Michel-Tyl.

Charteris died in 1993. Two additional Saint novels appeared around the time of the 1997 film starring Val Kilmer: a novelisation of the film (which had little connection to the Charteris stories) and &quot;Capture the Saint&quot;, a more faithful work published by The Saint Club and originated by Charteris in 1936. Both books were written by Burl Barer, who in the early 1990s published a history of the character in books, radio, and television.

Charteris wrote 14 novels between 1928 and 1971 (the last two co-written), 34 novellas, and 95 short stories featuring Simon Templar. Between 1963 and 1997, an additional seven novels and fourteen novellas were written by others.
In 2014, all the Saint books from &quot;Enter the Saint&quot; to &quot;Salvage for the Saint&quot; (but not &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot; nor Burl Barer&#x27;s &quot;Capture the Saint&quot;) were republished in both the United Kingdom and United States.

==On radio==
Several radio drama series were produced in North America, Ireland, and Britain. The earliest was for Radio Éireann&#x27;s Radio Athlone in 1940 and starred Terence De Marney. Radio Times dated 11 October 1940 refers to &quot;&#x27;The Saint&#x27; Terence de Marney as the Charteris hero.&quot; Both NBC and CBS produced &quot;Saint&quot; series during 1945, starring Edgar Barrier and Brian Aherne. Many early shows were adaptations of published stories, although Charteris wrote several storylines for the series which were novelised as short stories and novellas.

The longest-running radio incarnation was Vincent Price, who played the character in a series between 1947 and 1951 on three networks: CBS, Mutual and NBC. Like &quot;The Whistler&quot;, the program had an opening whistle theme with footsteps. Price left in May 1951, to be replaced by Tom Conway, who played the role for several more months; his brother, George Sanders, had played Templar on film. For more about the Saint on American radio, see &quot;The Saint (radio program)&quot;.

The next English-language radio series aired on Springbok Radio in South Africa between 1953 and 1957. These were fresh adaptations of the original stories and starred Tom Meehan. Around 1965 to 1966 the South African version of Lux Radio Theatre produced a single dramatization of &quot;The Saint&quot;. The English service of South Africa produced another series radio adventures for six months in 1970–1971. The most recent English-language incarnation was a series of three one-hour-long radio plays on BBC Radio 4 in 1995, all adapted from Charteris novels: &quot;Saint Overboard&quot;, &quot;The Saint Closes The Case&quot; and &quot;The Saint Plays With Fire&quot;, starring Paul Rhys as Templar.

==In film==
Not long after creating The Saint, Charteris began a long association with Hollywood as a screenwriter. He was successful in getting a major studio, RKO Radio Pictures, interested in a film based on one of his works. The first, &quot;The Saint in New York&quot; in 1938, based on the 1935 novel of the same name, starred Louis Hayward as Templar and Jonathan Hale as Inspector Henry Fernack, the American counterpart of Mr Teal.

The film was a success and RKO began a Saint series. Some of the films were based on Charteris&#x27;s original novels or novellas; others were original stories based upon outlines by Charteris. Louis Hayward was no longer available, as he was now under contract to independent producer Edward Small. The role of Simon Templar went to George Sanders. Sanders&#x27;s suave, offhand manner captured the urbane yet daring qualities of the Saint character. 

After five films RKO discontinued American production but made two more films in England, using funds that had been frozen by recent British legislation. Actor Hugh Sinclair played Simon Templar in both films, produced in 1941: &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Vacation&quot; and &quot;The Saint Meets the Tiger&quot;. The second film was shelved until 1943, when it was released by Republic Pictures.

In 1943 RKO launched a new series featuring &quot;The Falcon&quot;. George Sanders again played a debonair adventurer, and &quot;Saint&quot; leading lady Wendy Barrie was on hand as well. The new Falcon pictures followed the &quot;Saint&quot; pattern so closely that author Charteris sued RKO, charging unfair competition. Charteris told author David Zinman in 1971, &quot;RKO switched to The Falcon, a flagrant carbon copy of their version of The Saint, in my opinion with the single mercenary motive of saving the payments they had to make to me for the film rights.&quot; Charteris actually makes fun of The Falcon in his 1943 novel &quot;The Saint Steps In&quot;, with a character referring to the Falcon as &quot;a bargain-basement imitation&quot; of The Saint.

In 1953, British Hammer Film Productions produced &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Return&quot; (known as &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Girl Friday&quot; in the United States), for which Louis Hayward returned to the role. This was followed by an unsuccessful French production in 1960.

In the mid-1980s, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; and other newspapers reported that Roger Moore was planning to produce a movie based on &quot;The Saint&quot; with Pierce Brosnan as Templar, but it was never made. In 1989, six movies were made by Taffner starring Simon Dutton. These were syndicated in the United States as part of a series of films titled &quot;Mystery Wheel of Adventure,&quot; while in the United Kingdom they were shown as a series on ITV.

In 1991, as detailed by Burl Barer in his 1992 history of &quot;The Saint,&quot; plans were announced for a series of motion pictures. Ultimately, however, no such franchise appeared. A feature film &quot;The Saint&quot; starring Val Kilmer was released in 1997, but it diverged in style from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar&#x27;s use of aliases. Kilmer&#x27;s Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; this would have been unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer&#x27;s character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even his main enemies live to stand trial, whereas Charteris&#x27;s version had no qualms about taking another life. Kilmer&#x27;s Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris&#x27;s version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris&#x27;s own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar&#x27;s Volvo.

In July 2021, Paramount Pictures announced a reboot film, with Regé-Jean Page set to play Templar.

==On television==
The actor Roger Moore brought Simon Templar to the new medium of television in the series &quot;The Saint&quot;, which ran from 1962 to 1969, and Moore remains the actor most closely identified with the character. (According to the book &quot;Spy Television&quot; by Wesley Britton, the first actor offered the role was Patrick McGoohan of &quot;Danger Man&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner.&quot;)

Other actors played Templar in later series, notably &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; (1978–1979) starring Ian Ogilvy; the series ran for one season on CBS and ITV. A television pilot for a series to be called &quot;The Saint in Manhattan&quot;, starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke, was shown on CBS in 1987 as part of the &quot;CBS Summer Playhouse;&quot; this pilot was produced by Donald L. Taffner, but it never progressed beyond the pilot stage. 
Inspector John Fernack of the NYPD, played by Kevin Tighe, made his first film appearance since the 1940s in that production, while Templar (sporting a moustache) got about in a black Lamborghini bearing the ST1 licence plate.

Since the 1997 Val Kilmer film &quot;The Saint&quot;, there have been several failed attempts at producing pilots for potential new &quot;Saint&quot; television series. On 13 March 2007, TNT said it was developing a one-hour series to be executive produced by William J. MacDonald and produced by Jorge Zamacona. James Purefoy was announced as the new Simon Templar. Production of the pilot, which was to have been directed by Barry Levinson, did not go ahead. Another attempt at production was planned for 2009 with Scottish actor Dougray Scott starring as Simon Templar. Roger Moore announced on his website that he would be appearing in the new production, which was being produced by his son, Geoffrey Moore, in a small role.

It was announced in December 2012 that a third attempt would be made to produce a pilot for a potential TV series. This time, English actor Adam Rayner was cast as Simon Templar and American actress Eliza Dushku as Patricia Holm (a character from the novels never before portrayed on television and only once in the films), with Roger Moore producing. Unlike the prior attempts, production of the Rayner pilot did commence in December 2012 and continued into early 2013, with Moore and Ogilvy making cameo appearances, according to a cast list posted on the official Leslie Charteris website and subsequently confirmed in the trailer that was released. The pilot was not picked up for a series, but a large amount of additional footage was shot to complete it as the television film &quot;The Saint&quot;, released on 11 July 2017.

===Films===
Since 1938, numerous films have been produced in the United States, France and Australia based to varying degrees upon the Saint. A few were based, usually loosely, upon Charteris&#x27;s stories, but most were original.

This is a list of the films featuring Simon Templar and of the actors who played the Saint:

* &quot;The Saint in New York&quot; (1938 – Louis Hayward)
* &quot;The Saint Strikes Back&quot; (1939 – George Sanders)
* &quot;The Saint in London&quot; (1939 – Sanders; produced in the UK by RKO&#x27;s British unit)
* &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Double Trouble&quot; (1940 – Sanders)
* &quot;The Saint Takes Over&quot; (1940 – Sanders)
* &quot;The Saint in Palm Springs&quot; (1941 – Sanders)
* &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1941 – Hugh Sinclair; produced in the UK by RKO)
* &quot;The Saint Meets the Tiger&quot; (produced in the UK by RKO in 1941, released in 1943 by Republic – Sinclair)
* &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Return&quot; (1953 – Hayward) – aka &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Girl Friday&quot;
* &quot;Le Saint mène la danse&quot; (1960 – Félix Marten)
* &quot;Le Saint prend l&#x27;affût&quot; (1966 – Jean Marais)
* &quot;The Fiction Makers&quot; (1968 – Roger Moore) – edited from episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot;
* &quot;Vendetta for the Saint&quot; (1969 – Moore) – edited from episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot;
* &quot;The Saint&quot; (1997 – Val Kilmer)

In the 1930s, RKO purchased the rights to produce a film adaptation of &quot;Saint Overboard,&quot; but no such movie was ever produced.

===Television films===
* &quot;The Saint and the Brave Goose&quot; (1979 made for TV – Ian Ogilvy) – edited from episodes of &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;
* &quot;The Saint in Manhattan&quot; (1987 made for TV – Andrew Clarke)
* &quot;The Saint&quot; – six 100-minute TV films, all starring Simon Dutton. Made for London Weekend Television (LWT) in the United Kingdom, it was postponed due to poor ratings, but went out as part of &quot;The Mystery Wheel of Adventure&quot; in the United States:
** &quot;The Saint: Wrong Number&quot; (21 July 1990, postponed from 14 July 1990 – Simon Dutton)
** &quot;The Saint: The Software Murders&quot; (4 August 1990 – Dutton)

** &quot;The Saint: The Big Bang&quot; (28 July 1990 – Dutton)
** &quot;Fear in Fun Park&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Saint in Australia&quot; (14 July 1990, postponed from 16 September 1989 &amp; 7 July 1990 – Dutton)
* &quot;The Saint&quot; (2017 made for TV – Adam Rayner)

===Television series===
:&quot;This list includes only productions that became TV series, and does not include pilots.&quot;
* &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–1969 – Roger Moore)
* &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; (1978–1979 – Ian Ogilvy)

===Note===
Three of the actors to play Templar—Roger Moore, Ian Ogilvy, and Simon Dutton—have been appointed vice presidents of &quot;The Saint Club&quot; that was founded by Leslie Charteris in 1936.

==On the stage==
In the late 1940s Charteris and sometime Sherlock Holmes scriptwriter Denis Green wrote a stage play titled &quot;The Saint Misbehaves&quot;.
It was never publicly performed, as soon after writing it Charteris decided to focus on non-Saint work. For many years it was thought to be lost; however, two copies are known to exist in private hands, and correspondence relating to the play can be found in the Leslie Charteris Collection at Boston University.

==In comics==
The Saint appeared in a long-running series starting as a daily comic strip 27 September 1948 with a Sunday added on 20 March the following year. The early strips were written by Leslie Charteris, who had previous experience writing comic strips, having replaced Dashiell Hammett as the writer of the &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; strip. The original artist was Mike Roy. In 1951, when John Spranger replaced Roy as the artist, he altered the Saint&#x27;s appearance by depicting him with a beard. Bob Lubbers illustrated &quot;The Saint&quot; in 1959 and 1960. The final two years of the strip were drawn by Doug Wildey before it came to an end on 16 September 1961.

Concurrent with the comic strip, Avon Comics published 12 issues of a &quot;The Saint&quot; comic book between 1947 and 1952 (some of these stories were reprinted in the 1980s). Some issues included uncredited short text stories; one of these, &quot;Danger No. 5&quot;, also appeared as filler in issue 2 of the 1952 war comic &quot;Captain Steve Savage&quot;.

The 1960s TV series is unusual in that it is one of the few major programs of its genre that was not adapted as a comic book in the United States. It was, however, adapted as a comic strip in the British weekly comic &quot;TV Tornado (later merging with TV21)&quot;, where it ran from 1967 to 1970, drawn by Vicente Alcazar. The strip was titled &quot;Meet the Saint&quot; in later issues.

In Sweden, a long-running Saint comic book was published from 1966 to 1985 under the title &quot;Helgonet&quot;. It originally reprinted the newspaper strip, but already in 1969 original stories were commissioned for &quot;Helgonet&quot;. These stories were also later reprinted in other European countries. About 170 stories were produced from 1969 to 1991 (after 1985, the stories were published in the Swedish &quot;James Bond&quot; comic book). Two of the main writers were Norman Worker and Donne Avenell; the latter also co-wrote the novels &quot;The Saint and the Templar Treasure&quot; and the novella collection &quot;Count on the Saint&quot;, while Worker contributed to the novella collection &quot;Catch the Saint&quot;.

A new American comic book series was launched by Moonstone in the summer of 2012, but it never went beyond a single promotional issue &quot;zero&quot;.

==In magazines==
The original Saint novellas first appeared in &quot;The Thriller&quot; (1929–1940), edited by Monty Hayden, a friend of the author, who was sometimes given a thinly disguised role in the early stories. Charteris also edited or oversaw several magazines that tied in with the Saint. The first of these were anthologies titled &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Choice&quot; that ran for seven issues in 1945–46. A few years later Charteris launched &quot;The Saint Detective Magazine&quot; (later titled &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Saint Magazine&quot;), which ran for 141 issues between 1953 and 1967, with a separate British edition that ran just as long but published different material. In most issues of &quot;Saint&#x27;s Choice&quot; and the later magazines Charteris included at least one Saint story, usually previously published in one of his books but occasionally original. In several mid-1960s issues, however, he substituted &quot;Instead of the Saint&quot;, a series of essays on topics of interest to him. The rest of the material in the magazines consisted of novellas and short stories by other mystery writers of the day. An Australian edition was also published for a few years in the 1950s. In 1984 Charteris attempted to revive the &quot;Saint&quot; magazine, but it ran for only three issues.

Leslie Charteris himself portrayed The Saint in &quot;The Saint Goes West&quot;, a photo play in an issue of &quot;Life magazine&quot; published in 19 May 1941. Other performers in the piece were Morgan Conway, Lucia Carroll and Marjorie Woodworth.

==Book series==
Most Saint books were collections of novellas or short stories, some of which were published individually either in magazines or in smaller paperback form. Many of the books have also been published under different titles over the years; the titles used here are the more common ones for each book.

From 1964 to 1983, the Saint books were collaborative works; Charteris acted in an editorial capacity and received front cover author credit, while other authors wrote these stories and were credited inside the book. These collaborative authors are noted. (Sources: Barer and the editions themselves.)

===Omnibus editions===
In addition to the above, numerous paperback omnibuses compiling short stories and novellas have been published. Examples include &quot;Arrest the Saint&quot; (Avon, 1951), &quot;Concerning the Saint&quot; (Avon, 1958) and &quot;The Saint Cleans Up&quot; (Avon, 1959). In 1983, Avenel Books published the hardcover omnibus &quot;The Saint: Five Complete Novels&quot;, though this was actually three novellas and two full-length novels, combining the books &quot;Enter the Saint&quot;, &quot;The Holy Terror&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Saint vs. Scotland Yard&quot;), &quot;The Last Hero&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Saint Closes the Case&quot;) and &quot;Knight Templar&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Avenging Saint&quot;).

===French adventures===
A number of &quot;Saint&quot; adventures were published in French over a 30-year period, most of which have yet to be published in English. Many of these stories were ghostwritten by Madeleine Michel-Tyl and credited to Charteris (who exercised some editorial control). The French books were generally novelisations of scripts from the radio series, or novels adapted from stories in the American &quot;Saint&quot; comic strip. One of the writers who worked on the French series, Fleming Lee, later wrote for the English-language books.

===Unpublished works===
Burl Barer&#x27;s history of the Saint identifies two manuscripts that to date have not been published. The first is a collaboration between Charteris and Fleming Lee called &quot;Bet on the Saint&quot; that was rejected by Doubleday, the American publishers of the Saint series. Charteris, Barer writes, chose not to submit it to his United Kingdom publishers, Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The rejection of the manuscript by Doubleday meant that The Crime Club&#x27;s long-standing right of first refusal on any new Saint works was now ended and the manuscript was then submitted to other United States publishers, without success. Barer also tells of a 1979 novel titled &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Lady&quot; by a Scottish fan, Joy Martin, which had been written as a present for and as a tribute to Charteris. Charteris was impressed by the manuscript and attempted to get it published, but it too was ultimately rejected. The manuscript, which according to Barer is in the archives of Boston University, features the return of Patricia Holm.

According to the Saintly Bible website, at one time Leslie Charteris biographer Ian Dickerson was working on a manuscript (based upon a film story idea by Charteris) for a new novel titled &quot;Son of the Saint&quot; in which Templar shares an adventure with his son by Patricia Holm. The book has, to date, not been published.

A fourth unpublished manuscript, this time written by Charteris himself, titled &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Second Front&quot; was written during the Second World War but was rejected at the time; believed lost for decades, it emerged at an auction in 2017.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2003 BBC documentary series &quot;Heroes and Weapons of World War II&quot; episode titled &quot;The Man Who Designed the Spitfire&quot; (Episode 2) at approximately 18 minutes in the film an RAF pilot is seen at rest in his dispersal hut with a large Saint stick-man logo on his flying gear (see image at right). He is perhaps showing some personal identification with Simon Templar&#x27;s own war against Germany in the novella &quot;Arizona&quot;.

In 1980 English punk band Splodgenessabounds released a single &quot;Simon Templer&quot; (misspelling intentional). It reached number 7 in the UK charts. The song appears mocking of the TV character, concluding &quot;I think Simon&#x27;s a bit of a bore/Ian Ogilvy and Podgy Moore.&quot;

In 1962 students from James Cook University, Townsville, Australia abseiled down the pink granite monolith, Castle Hill and painted the character on its side as an act of patriotism, as the university had adopted the character as their mascot. At first, the local council (and some of the public) considered this vandalism and removed it, only for the students to keep repainting it. The council eventually gave up, and The Saint has been a permanent fixture since the 1970s. The irony now is that Queensland State Legislation states that objects older than 30 years old are eligible for cultural heritage status. This means that The Saint, originally a piece of graffiti, is now a Townsville Cultural Heritage icon.

<text>Stuttering, also known as stammering, is a speech disorder characterized externally by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words, or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses called blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. Almost 80 million people worldwide stutter, about 1% of the world&#x27;s population, with a prevalence among males at least twice that of females. Persistent stuttering into adulthood often leads to outcomes detrimental to overall mental health, such as social isolation and suicidal thoughts.

Stuttering is not connected to the physical ability to produce phonemes (i.e. it is unrelated to the structure or function of the vocal cords). It is also unconnected to the structuring of thoughts into coherent sentences inside sufferers&#x27; brains, meaning that people with a stutter know precisely what they are trying to say (contrast with alternative disorders like aphasia). Stuttering is purely a neurological disconnect between intent and outcome during the task of expressing each individual sound. While there are rarer neurogenic (e.g. acquired during physical insult) and psychogenic (e.g. acquired after adult-onset mental illness or trauma) variants, the typical etiology, development, and presentation is that of idiopathic stuttering in childhood that then becomes persistent into adulthood.

Acute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering but may trigger increased stuttering in people who have the disorder. There is a significant correlation between anxiety, particularly social anxiety, and stuttering, but stuttering is an distinct, engrained neurobiological phenomenon and thus only exacerbated, not caused, by anxiety. Anxiety consistently worsens stuttering symptoms in acute settings in those with comorbid anxiety disorders.

Living with a stigmatized speech disability like a stutter can result in high allostatic load (i.e. adverse pathophysiological sequelae of high and/or highly variable nervous system stress). Despite the negative physiological outcomes associated with stuttering and its concomitant stress levels, the link is not bidirectional: neither acute nor chronic stress has been shown to cause a predisposition to stuttering.

==Characteristics==

===Audible disfluencies===
Common stuttering behaviors are observable signs of speech disfluencies, for example: repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. 
*Repeated movements
** Syllable repetition—a single syllable word is repeated (for example: &quot;on-on-on a chair&quot;) or a part of a word which is still a full syllable such as &quot;un-un-under the ...&quot; and &quot;o-o-open&quot;.
** Incomplete syllable repetition—an incomplete syllable is repeated, such as a consonant without a vowel, for example, &quot;c-c-c-cold&quot;.
** Multi-syllable repetition—more than one syllable such as a whole word, or more than one word is repeated, such as &quot;I know-I know-I know a lot of information.&quot;
* Prolongations
** With audible airflow—prolongation of a sound occurs such as &quot;mmmmmmmmmom&quot;.
** Without audible airflow—such as a block of speech or a tense pause where no airflow occurs and no phonation occurs.
The disorder is &quot;variable&quot;, which means that in certain situations the stuttering might be more or less noticeable, such as speaking on the phone or in large groups. People who stutter often find that their stuttering fluctuates, sometimes at random.

The moment of stuttering often begins before the disfluency is produced, described as a moment of &quot;anticipation&quot;—where the person who stutters knows which word they are going to stutter on. The sensation of losing control and anticipation of a stutter can lead people who stutter to react in different ways including behavioral and cognitive reactions. Some behavioral reactions can manifest outwardly and be observed as physical tension or struggle anywhere in the body.

=== Outward physical behaviors ===
People who stutter may have reactions, avoidance behaviors, or secondary behaviors related to their stuttering that may look like struggle and tension in the body. These could range anywhere from tension in the head and neck, behaviors such as snapping or tapping, or facial grimacing.

=== Behavioral reactions ===
These behavioral reactions are those that might not be apparent to listeners and only be perceptible to people who stutter. Some people who stutter exhibit covert behaviors such as avoiding speaking situations, substituting words or phrases when they know they are going to stutter, or use other methods to hide their stutter.

===Feelings and attitudes===
Stuttering could have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. Joseph Sheehan described this in terms of an analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may increase tension and effort. With time, continued negative experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. People who stutter may project their own attitudes onto others, believing that the others think them nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.

The impact of discrimination against stuttering can be severe. This may result in fears of stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying or discrimination, or feeling pressured to hide stuttering. In popular media, stuttering is sometimes seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is no direct correlation in that direction.

Alternatively, there are those who embrace stuttering pride and encourage other stutterers to take pride in their stutter and to find how it has been beneficial for them.

According to adults who stutter, however, stuttering is defined as a &quot;constellation of experiences&quot; expanding beyond the external disfluencies that are apparent to the listener. Much of the experience of stuttering is internal and encompasses experiences beyond the external speech disfluencies, which are not observable by the listener.

=== Associated conditions ===
Stuttering can co-occur with other disabilities. These associated disabilities include:

*attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); the prevalence of ADHD in school-aged children who stutter is .
*dyslexia; the prevalence rate of childhood stuttering in dyslexia is around 30–40%, while in adults the prevalence of dyslexia in adults who stutter is around 30–50%.
*autism 
* intellectual disability
* language or learning disability
* seizure disorders
* social anxiety disorder 
* speech sound disorders
* other developmental disorders
==Causes==
The cause of developmental stuttering is complex. It is thought to be neurological with a genetic factor.

Various hypotheses suggest multiple factors contributing to stuttering. There is strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis. Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter. In a 2010 article, three genes were found by Dennis Drayna and team to correlate with stuttering: GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of those who have a family history of stuttering.

There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties. For some people who stutter, congenital factors may play a role. In others, there could be added impact due to stressful situations. However there is no evidence to suggest this as a cause.

Less common causes of stuttering include neurogenic stuttering (stuttering that occurs secondary to brain damage, such as after a stroke) and psychogenic stuttering (stuttering related to a psychological condition).

===History of causes===

Auditory processing deficits were proposed as a cause of stuttering due to differences in stuttering for deaf or Hard of Hearing individuals, as well as the impact of auditory feedback machines on some stuttering cases.

Some possibilities of linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not has been proposed. Brain scans of adult stutterers have found greater activation of the right hemisphere, than of the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.

The &#x27;capacities and demands model&#x27; has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. Speech performance varies depending on the &#x27;capacity&#x27; that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the &#x27;demands&#x27; placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Demands may be increased by internal factors or inadequate language skills or external factors. In stuttering, severity often increases when demands placed on the person&#x27;s speech and language system increase. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated. Stress, or demands, can impact many disorders without being a cause.

Another theory has been that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. 

It was once thought that forcing a left-handed student to write with their right-hand caused stuttering due to bias against left-handed people, but this myth died out.

== Diagnosis ==
Some characteristics of stuttered speech are not as easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a licensed speech–language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual&#x27;s background, through a case history. The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child&#x27;s parents. The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.

During direct observation of the client, the SLP will observe various aspects of the individual&#x27;s speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (&quot;Riley&#x27;s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)&quot;). They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child&#x27;s case history, and stuttering frequency in order to determine the severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.

Stuttering is a multifaceted, complex disorder that can impact an individual&#x27;s life in a variety of ways. Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker&#x27;s experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).

Clinical psychologists with adequate expertise can also diagnose stuttering per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes. The DSM-5 describes &quot;Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)&quot; for developmental stuttering, and &quot;Adult-onset Fluency Disorder&quot;. However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA&#x27;s published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms &quot;fluency&quot; and &quot;disfluency&quot;.

===Other disfluencies===
Preschool aged children often have difficulties with speech concerning motor planning and execution; this often manifests as disfluencies related to speech development (referred to as normal dysfluency or &quot;other disfluencies&quot;). This type of disfluency is a normal part of speech development and temporarily present in preschool-aged children who are learning to speak.

=== Classification ===
&quot;Developmental stuttering&quot; is stuttering that has its onset in early childhood when a child is learning to speak. &quot;Neurogenic stuttering&quot; (stuttering that occurs secondary to brain damage, such as after a stroke) and &quot;psychogenic stuttering&quot; (stuttering related to a psychological condition) are less common and classified separately from developmental.

====Developmental (and persistent)====
&quot;Developmental stuttering&quot; is a sometimes transient period of stuttering that has its onset in early childhood, i.e. when a child is learning to speak. About 5-7% of children are said to stutter during this period. Despite its name, the onset itself is often sudden. This type of stutter may persist after the age of 7, which is then classified as &quot;persistent stuttering&quot;, which is the typical aetiology, pathogenesis, and presentation of adult stuttering.

====Neurogenic (or &quot;acquired&quot;)====
&quot;Neurogenic stuttering&quot;, which may also be called &quot;acquired stuttering&quot;, typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including the cortical and subcortical regions, cerebellum, and even the neural pathway regions (i.e. the deepest clusters - tracts - of nerves and nerve cells). It may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. This stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback are not effective with the acquired type.

====Psychogenic====
&quot;Psychogenic stuttering&quot;, which accounts for less than 1% of all stuttering cases, may arise after a traumatic experience such as a death, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering, or associated disorders include autism, cluttering, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, essential tremor, palilalia, spasmodic dysphonia, selective mutism, and apraxia of speech.

==Treatment==

While there is no cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist and the best option is dependent on the individual. Therapy should be individualized and tailored to the specific and unique needs of the client. The speech–language pathologist and the client typically work together to create achievable and realistic goals that target communication confidence, autonomy, managing emotions and stress related to their stutter, and working on disclosure.

; Fluency shaping therapy 
: Fluency shaping therapy trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on operant conditioning techniques. This type of therapy is not considered best practice in the field of speech and language pathology and is potentially harmful and traumatic for clients.

; Stuttering modification therapy
: The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful. The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. Stuttering modification therapy should not be used to promote fluent speech or presented as a cure for stuttering. 
: Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering (ARTS) is an effective form of modification therapy. It is a framework based on theories developed by professor Joseph Sheehan and his wife Vivian Sheehan. This framework focuses on self-acceptance as someone who stutters, and efficient, spontaneous and joyful communication, essentially, minimizing quality-of-life impact due to stuttering.

; Electronic fluency device

: Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the voice of the person who stutters while they are talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results.

; Medications
: No medication is FDA-approved for stuttering. Some research suggests dopamine antagonists ecopipam and deutetrabenazine have the potential to treat stuttering.

=== Support ===
Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering.

===Prognosis===
Among ages 3–5, the prognosis for spontaneously recovery is about 65% to 87.5%. By 7 years of age or within the first two years of stuttering, and about 74% recover by their early teens. In particular, girls are shown to recover more often.

Prognosis is guarded with later age of onset: children who start stuttering at age 3½ years or later, and/or duration of greater than 6–12 months since onset, that is, once stuttering has become established, about 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously. Stuttering that persists after the age of seven is classified as persistent stuttering, and is associated with a much lower chance of recovery.

==Epidemiology==
The lifetime prevalence, or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5–6%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.

===Cross cultural===
Cross-cultural studies of stuttering prevalence were very active in early and mid-20th century, particularly under the influence of the works of Wendell Johnson, who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents, which has since been debunked. Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races at similar rates, about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children.

Different regions of the world are researched unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population. African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all.

=== Bilingual stuttering ===

==== Identification ====
Bilingualism is the ability to speak two languages. Many bilingual people have been exposed to more than one language since birth and throughout childhood. Since language and culture are relatively fluid factors in a person&#x27;s understanding and production of language, bilingualism may be a feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.

* The child is mixing vocabulary (code-mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase their skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.
* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.
* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age. Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes. Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.

It was once believed that being bilingual would &#x27;confuse&#x27; a child and cause stuttering, but research has debunked this myth.

Stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less depending on the individual case.

==History==

Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule. People who stutter can be traced back centuries to Demosthenes, who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth. The Talmud interprets Bible passages to indicate that Moses also stuttered, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be &quot;slow and hesitant of speech&quot; (Exodus 4, v.10).

Galen&#x27;s humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering was attributed to an imbalance of the four bodily humors—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. Hieronymus Mercurialis, writing in the sixteenth century, proposed to redress the imbalance by changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and purging. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.

In and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, and cutting nerves, or neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the uvula or removing the tonsils. All were abandoned due to the danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, Jean Marc Gaspard Itard placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support &quot;weak&quot; muscles.
Italian pathologist Giovanni Morgagni attributed stuttering to deviations in the hyoid bone, a conclusion he came to via autopsy. Blessed Notker of St. Gall ( – 912), called Balbulus (&quot;The Stutterer&quot;) and described by his biographer as being &quot;delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine,&quot; was invoked against stammering.

A royal Briton who stammered was King George VI. He went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue, for his stammer. The Academy Award-winning film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010) in which Colin Firth plays George VI, tells his story. The film is based on an original screenplay by David Seidler, who also stuttered until age 16.

Another British case was that of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that &quot;[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience ...&quot; However, those who knew Churchill and commented on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that &quot;Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter&quot; in her 1941 book &quot;I was Winston Churchill&#x27;s Private Secretary&quot;. She related one example, &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s s-s-simply s-s-splendid,&#x27; he stuttered—as he always did when excited.&quot; Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of &quot;The American Mercury&quot; (1942) that &quot;Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple&quot; and that &quot;born with a stutter and a lisp, both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man&#x27;s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time.&quot;

For centuries &quot;cures&quot; such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one&#x27;s life, &quot;hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy&quot;, strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various herbal remedies were tried. Similarly, in the past people subscribed to odd theories about the causes of stuttering, such as tickling an infant too much, eating improperly during breastfeeding, allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child&#x27;s hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the &quot;work of the devil&quot;.

==Society and Culture==

===In popular culture===
===Stuttering community===
Many countries have regular events and activities to bring people who stutter together for mutual support. These events take place at regional, national, and international levels. At a regional level, there may be stuttering support or chapter groups that look to provide a place for people who stutter in the local area to meet, discuss and learn from each other.

At a national level, stuttering organizations host conferences. Conferences vary in their focus and scope; some focus on the latest research developments, some focus on stuttering and the arts, and others simply look to provide a space for stutterers to come together.

There are two international meetings of stutterers. The International Stuttering Association World Congress primarily focuses on individuals who stutter. Meanwhile, the Joint World Congress on Stuttering and Cluttering brings together academics, researchers, speech-language pathologists, as well as people who stutter or clutter, with a focus on research and treatments for stuttering.

=== Historic advocacy and self-help ===
Self-help and advocacy organisations for people who stammer have reportedly been in existence since the 1920s. In 1921, a Philadelphia-based attorney who stammered, J. Stanley Smith, established the Kingsley Club.  Designed to support people with a stammer in the Philadelphia area, the club took inspiration for its name from Charles Kingsley. Kingsley, a nineteenth-century English social reformer and author of &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; and &quot;The Water Babies&quot;, had a stammer himself.

Whilst Kingsley himself did not appear to recommend self-help or advocacy groups for people who stammer, the Kingsley Club promoted a positive mental attitude to support its members in becoming confident speakers, in a similar way discussed by Charles Kingsley in &quot;Irrationale of Speech&quot;.

Other support groups for people who stammer began to emerge in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1935 a Stammerer&#x27;s Club was established in Melbourne, Australia, by a Mr H. Collin of Thornbury. At the time of its formation it had 68 members. The club was formed in response to the tragic case of a man from Sydney who &quot;sought relief from the effects of stammering in suicide&quot;. As well as providing self-help, this club adopted an advocacy role with the intention of appealing to the Government to provide special education and to fund research into the causes of stammering.

=== Disability rights movement ===

Some people who stutter, and are part of the disability rights movement, have begun to embrace their stuttering voices as an important part of their identity. In July 2015 the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) announced the launch of the Defence Stammering Network to support and champion the interests of British military personnel and MOD civil servants who stammer and to raise awareness of the condition.

Although the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to cover speech disabilities, it was not explicitly named and lawsuits increasingly did not cover stuttering as a disability. In 2009, additional amendments were made to the ADA, and it now specifically covers speech disorders.

=== Stuttering pride ===

Stuttering pride (or stuttering advocacy) is a social movement repositioning stuttering as a valuable and respectable way of speaking. The movement seeks to counter the societal narratives in which temporal and societal expectations dictate how communication takes place. In this sense, the stuttering pride movement challenges the pervasive societal narrative of stuttering as a defect and instead positions stuttering as a valuable and respectable way of speaking in its own right. The movement encourages stutterers to take pride in their unique speech patterns and in what stuttering can tell us about the world. It also advocates for societal adjustments to allow stutterers equal access to education and employment opportunities, and addresses how this may impact stuttering therapy.

<text>Saxony, officially the Free State of Saxony, is a landlocked state of Germany, bordering the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig. Saxony is the tenth largest of Germany&#x27;s sixteen states, with an area of , and the sixth most populous, with more than 4 million inhabitants. 

The term Saxony has been in use for more than a millennium. It was used for the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the Electorate of Saxony of the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Saxony, and twice for a republic. The first Free State of Saxony was established in 1918 as a constituent state of the Weimar Republic. After World War II, it was under Soviet occupation before it became part of communist East Germany and was abolished by the government in 1952. Following German reunification, the Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with enlarged borders in 1990 and became one of the five new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The area of the modern state of Saxony should not be confused with Old Saxony, the area inhabited by Saxons. Old Saxony corresponds roughly to the modern German states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and the Westphalian portion of North Rhine-Westphalia. Historically the region of Saxony has sometimes been referred to as Upper Saxony or Obersachsen in German to distinguish it from Lower Saxony.

The state is also home to a minority of Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic group native to the area, numbering an estimated 80,000 people.

== History ==

Saxony has a long history as a duchy, an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire (the Electorate of Saxony), and finally as a kingdom (the Kingdom of Saxony). In 1918, after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, its monarchy was overthrown and a republican form of government was established under the current name. The state was broken up into smaller units during communist rule (1949–1989), but was re-established on 3 October 1990 on the reunification of East and West Germany.

=== Prehistory ===
In prehistoric times, the territory of present-day Saxony was the site of some of the largest of the ancient central European monumental temples, dating from the fifth century BC. Notable archaeological sites have been discovered in Dresden and the villages of Eythra and Zwenkau near Leipzig. The Germanic presence in the territory of today&#x27;s Saxony is thought to have begun in the first century BC.

Parts of Saxony were possibly under the control of the Germanic King Marobod during the Roman era. By the late Roman period, several tribes known as the Saxons emerged, from which the subsequent state(s) draw their name. 

===Stem Duchy of Saxony===
Since the late 6th century, the territory of modern-day Saxony and parts of Thuringia was populated by Polabian Slavs, most prominently the Sorbs. It was conquered by Francia and subsequently organized as the Sorbian March. A legacy of this period is the modern ethnic group of Sorbs in Saxony. Eastern and western parts of present Saxony were ruled by Bohemia at various times between 1075 and 1635 (with some intermissions), and Schirgiswalde (; ) remained a Bohemian exclave until 1809. Eastern parts were also ruled by Poland between 1002 and 1032, by the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, from 1319 to 1346, and by Hungary from 1469 to 1490, and Pechern () was part of the Duchy of Żagań, one of the Lower Silesian duchies formed in the course of the medieval fragmentation of Poland, remaining under the Piast dynasty until 1472.
The first medieval Duchy of Saxony was a late Early Middle Ages &quot;Carolingian stem duchy&quot;, which emerged around the start of the 8th century AD and grew to include the greater part of Northern Germany, what are now the modern German states of Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony-Anhalt. Saxons converted to Christianity during this period, with Charlemagne outlawing pagan practices. This geographical region is unrelated to present-day Saxony but the name moved southwards due to certain historical events (see below).

===Holy Roman Empire===

The territory of the Free State of Saxony became part of the Holy Roman Empire by the 10th century, when the dukes of Saxony were also kings (or emperors) of the Holy Roman Empire, comprising the Ottonian, or Saxon, dynasty. The Margravate of Meissen was founded in 985 as a frontier march, that soon extended to the Kwisa (Queis) river to the east and as far as the Ore Mountains. In the process of , settlement of German farmers in the sparsely populated area was promoted. Around this time, the Billungs, a Saxon noble family, received extensive lands in Saxony. The emperor eventually gave them the title of dukes of Saxony. After Duke Magnus died in 1106, causing the extinction of the male line of Billungs, oversight of the duchy was given to Lothar of Supplinburg, who also became emperor for a short time.

In 1137, control of Saxony passed to the Guelph dynasty, descendants of Wulfhild Billung, eldest daughter of the last Billung duke, and the daughter of Lothar of Supplinburg. In 1180 large portions west of the Weser were ceded to the Bishops of Cologne, while some central parts between the Weser and the Elbe remained with the Guelphs, becoming later the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The remaining eastern lands, together with the title of Duke of Saxony, passed to an Ascanian dynasty (descended from Eilika Billung, Wulfhild&#x27;s younger sister) and were divided in 1260 into the two small states of Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. The former state was also named &quot;Lower Saxony&quot;, the latter &quot;Upper Saxony&quot;, thence the later names of the two Imperial Circles Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. Both claimed the Saxon electoral privilege for themselves, but the Golden Bull of 1356 accepted only Wittenberg&#x27;s claim, with Lauenburg nevertheless continuing to maintain its claim. In 1422, when the Saxon electoral line of the Ascanians became extinct, the Ascanian Eric V of Saxe-Lauenburg tried to reunite the Saxon duchies.

However, Sigismund, King of the Romans, had already granted Margrave Frederick IV the Warlike of Meissen (House of Wettin) an expectancy of the Saxon electorate in order to remunerate his military support. On 1 August 1425 Sigismund enfeoffed the Wettinian Frederick as Prince-Elector of Saxony, despite the protests of Eric V. Thus the Saxon territories remained permanently separated.

The Electorate of Saxony was then merged with the much larger Wettinian Margraviate of Meissen; however, it used the higher-ranking title Electorate of Saxony and even the Ascanian coat-of-arms for the entire monarchy. Thus Saxony came to include Dresden and Meissen. Hence, the territory of the modern Free State of Saxony shares the name with the old Saxon stem duchy for historical and dynastic reasons rather than any significant ethnic, linguistic or cultural connection. In the 18th and 19th centuries Saxe-Lauenburg was colloquially called the Duchy of Lauenburg, which was held in a personal union by the Electorate of Hanover from the 18th century to the Napoleonic wars, and in a personal union with Denmark (along with neighbouring Holstein and Schleswig) for much the 19th century. In 1876 it was absorbed into Prussia as the Duchy of Lauenburg district of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein).

=== Foundation of the second Saxon state ===

Saxe-Wittenberg, mostly in modern Saxony-Anhalt, became subject to the margravate of Meissen, ruled by the Wettin dynasty in 1423. This established a new and powerful state, occupying large portions of the present Free State of Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Bavaria (Coburg and its environs). Although the centre of this state was far to the southeast of the former Saxony, it came to be referred to as Upper Saxony and then simply Saxony, while the former Saxon territories in the north were now known as Lower Saxony (the modern term Niedersachsen deriving from this).

In 1485, Saxony was split in the Treaty of Leipzig. A collateral line of the Wettin princes received what later became Thuringia and founded several small states there (see &quot;Ernestine duchies&quot;). Since these princes were allowed to use the Saxon coat of arms, in many towns of Thuringia, the coat of arms can still be found in historical buildings.

The remaining Saxon state became still more powerful, receiving Upper and Lower Lusatia in the Peace of Prague (1635). It also became known in the 18th century for its cultural achievements, although it was politically weaker than Prussia and Austria, states which oppressed Saxony from the north and south, respectively.

Between 1697 and 1763, two successive Electors of Saxony were also elected Kings of Poland in personal union. Many landmarks in Saxony date from this period and contain remnants of the former close Polish-Saxon relation, such as the coat of arms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on the facades and in the interiors of palaces, churches, edifices, etc. (e.g. Zwinger, Dresden Cathedral, Moritzburg Castle), and on numerous mileposts, and the close political and cultural relationship persisted well into the 19th century, with Saxony being the place of preparations for the Polish Kościuszko Uprising against the partitioning powers, and one of the chief destinations for Polish refugees from partitioned Poland, including the artistic and political elite, such as composer Frédéric Chopin, war hero Józef Bem and writer Adam Mickiewicz.

In 1756, Saxony joined a coalition of Austria, France and Russia against Prussia. Frederick II of Prussia chose to attack preemptively and invaded Saxony in August 1756, precipitating the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War). The Prussians quickly defeated Saxony and incorporated the Saxon army into the Prussian Army. At the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Saxony recovered its independence in the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg.

===19th century===
In 1806, French Emperor Napoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire and established the Electorate of Saxony as a kingdom in exchange for military support. The Elector Frederick Augustus III accordingly became King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. Frederick Augustus remained loyal to Napoleon during the wars that swept Europe in the following years; he was taken prisoner and his territories were declared forfeit by the allies in 1813, after the defeat of Napoleon. Prussia intended the annexation of Saxony but the opposition of Austria, France, and the United Kingdom to this plan resulted in the restoration of Frederick Augustus to his throne at the Congress of Vienna although he was forced to cede the northern part of the kingdom to Prussia, which led to the loss of nearly 60% of the Saxon territory, and 40% of its population. Most of these lands were merged with the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Altmark and some smaller territories to become the Prussian Province of Saxony, a predecessor of the modern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Lower Lusatia and part of the former Saxe-Wittenberg territory became part of the Province of Brandenburg and the northeastern part of Upper Lusatia became part of the Province of Silesia. The rump Kingdom of Saxony had roughly the same extent as the present state, albeit slightly smaller.
Meanwhile, in 1815, the Kingdom of Saxony joined the German Confederation. In the politics of the Confederation, Saxony was overshadowed by Prussia and Austria. King Anthony of Saxony came to the throne of Saxony in 1827. Shortly thereafter, liberal pressures in Saxony mounted and broke out in revolt during 1830—a year of revolution in Europe. The revolution in Saxony resulted in a constitution for the Kingdom of Saxony that served as the basis for its government until 1918.

During the 1848–49 constitutionalist revolutions in Germany, Saxony became a hotbed of revolutionaries, with anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin and democrats including Richard Wagner and Gottfried Semper taking part in the May Uprising in Dresden in 1849. (Scenes of Richard Wagner&#x27;s participation in the May 1849 uprising in Dresden are depicted in the 1983 movie &quot;Wagner&quot; starring Richard Burton as Richard Wagner.) The May uprising in Dresden forced King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony to concede further reforms to the Saxon government.

In 1854 Frederick Augustus II&#x27;s brother, King John of Saxony, succeeded to the throne. A scholar, King John translated Dante. King John followed a federalistic and pro-Austrian policy throughout the early 1860s until the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War. During that war, Prussian troops overran Saxony without resistance and then invaded Austrian Bohemia. After the war, Saxony was forced to pay an indemnity and to join the North German Confederation in 1867. Under the terms of the North German Confederation, Prussia took over control of the Saxon postal system, railroads, military and foreign affairs. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Saxon troops fought together with Prussian and other German troops against France. In 1871, Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire.

===20th century===

After King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony abdicated on 13 November 1918, Saxony, remaining a constituent state of Germany (Weimar Republic), became the Free State of Saxony under a new constitution enacted on 1 November 1920. In October 1923, when the Communist Party of Germany entered the Social Democratic-led government in Dresden with hidden revolutionary intentions, the Reich government under Chancellor Gustav Stresemann used a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; to send troops into Saxony to remove the Communists from the government. The state retained its name and borders during the Nazi era as a (Gau Saxony), but lost its quasi-autonomous status and its parliamentary democracy.

During World War II, under the secret Nazi programme &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, an estimated 15,000 people suffering from mental and physical disabilities, as well as a number of concentration camp inmates, were murdered at Sonnenstein killing centre near Pirna. Numerous subcamps of the Buchenwald, Flossenburg and Gross-Rosen concentration camps were operated in Saxony.

As the war drew to its end, U.S. troops under General George Patton occupied the western part of Saxony in April 1945, while Soviet troops occupied the eastern part. That summer, the entire state was handed over to Soviet forces as agreed in the London Protocol of September 1944. Britain, the US, and the USSR then negotiated Germany&#x27;s future at the Potsdam Conference. Under the Potsdam Agreement, all German territory East of the Oder-Neisse line was annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union, and, unlike in the aftermath of World War I, the annexing powers were allowed to expel the inhabitants. During the following three years, Poland and Czechoslovakia expelled German-speaking people from their territories, and some of these expellees came to Saxony. Only a small area of Saxony lying east of the Neisse River and centred around the town of Reichenau (Bogatynia) was annexed by Poland. Traditional close relations of Saxony with neighbouring German-speaking Egerland were thus completely destroyed, making the border of Saxony along the Ore Mountains a linguistic border.

Part of the former Prussian province of Lower Silesia lay west of the Oder-Neisse line and therefore was separated from the bulk of its former province; the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG) merged this territory into Saxony. This former Silesian territory broadly corresponded with the Upper Lusatian territory annexed by Prussia in 1815.

On 20 October 1946, SVAG organised elections for the Saxon state parliament (), but many people were arbitrarily excluded from candidacy and suffrage, and the Soviet Union openly supported the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The new minister-president Rudolf Friedrichs (SED), had been a member of the SPD until April 1946. He met his Bavarian counterparts in the U.S. zone of occupation in October 1946 and May 1947, but died suddenly in mysterious circumstances the following month. He was succeeded by Max Seydewitz, a loyal follower of Joseph Stalin.

The German Democratic Republic (East Germany), including Saxony, was established in 1949 out of the Soviet zone of Occupied Germany, becoming a constitutionally socialist state, part of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact, under the leadership of the SED. In 1952 the government abolished the Free State of Saxony, and divided its territory into three : Leipzig, Dresden, and Karl-Marx-Stadt (formerly and currently Chemnitz). Areas around Hoyerswerda were also part of the Cottbus Bezirk.

The Free State of Saxony was reconstituted with slightly altered borders in 1990, following German reunification. Besides the formerly Silesian area of Saxony, which was mostly included in the territory of the new Saxony, the free state gained further areas north of Leipzig that had belonged to Saxony-Anhalt until 1952.

== Geography ==
===Topography===
The highest mountain in Saxony is the Fichtelberg (1,215 m) in the Western Ore Mountains.

===Rivers===
There are numerous rivers in Saxony. The Elbe is the most dominant one. The Neisse defines the border between Saxony and Poland. Other rivers include the Mulde and the White Elster.

===Largest cities and towns===

The largest cities and towns in Saxony according to the 31 July 2022 estimate are listed below. Leipzig forms a conurbation with Halle, known as &quot;Ballungsraum Leipzig/Halle&quot;. The latter city is located just across the border of Saxony-Anhalt. Leipzig shares, for instance, an S-train system (known as &quot;S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland&quot;) and an airport with Halle.

== Politics ==
Saxony is a parliamentary democracy. A Minister President heads the government of Saxony. Michael Kretschmer has been Minister President since 13 December 2017.

=== 2024 state election ===


=== Members of the state government ===

=== 2024 European Parliament Election ===
In the 2024 European Parliament election, AfD received the highest percentage of votes in Saxony, winning 31.8% of the ballots. The other states where AfD has become the strongest party are Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Brandenburg. These four states were part of East Germany like Saxony. Compared to the last election, AfD increased their votes in Saxony which was 25.3% in the 2019 European Parliament election.

CDU/CSU received 21.8% of the votes in Saxony and became the second strongest party in the 2024 EP election. BSW was in the third place by receiving 12.6% of the votes. The Left lost a significant proportion of their votes compared to the 2019 election. Their votes regressed from 11.7% to 4.9%.

==== Federal politics ====
Saxony has 16 constituencies for the Bundestag.
=== Administration ===
Saxony is divided into 10 districts:
  1. Bautzen (BZ)
  2. Erzgebirgskreis (ERZ)
  3. Görlitz (GR)
  4. Leipzig (L)
  5. Meissen (MEI) (Meissen)
  6. Mittelsachsen (FG)
  7. Nordsachsen (TDO)
  8. Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge (PIR)
  9. Vogtlandkreis (V)
10. Zwickau (Z)

In addition, three cities have the status of an urban district ():
# Chemnitz (C)
# Dresden (DD)
# Leipzig (L)

Between 1990 and 2008, Saxony was divided into the three regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;) of Chemnitz, Dresden, and Leipzig. After the 2008 Saxony district reform, these regions – with some alterations of their respective areas – were called &quot;Direktionsbezirke&quot;. In 2012, the authorities of these regions were merged into one central authority, the &quot;&quot;.

== Demographics ==

=== Population change ===
Saxony is a densely populated state if compared with more rural German states such as Bavaria or Lower Saxony. However, the population has declined over time. The population of Saxony began declining in the 1950s due to emigration, a process which accelerated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After bottoming out in 2013, the population has stabilized due to increased immigration and higher fertility rates. The cities of Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz, and the towns of Radebeul and Markkleeberg in their vicinity, have seen their populations increase since 2000. The following tables illustrate the foreign resident populations and the population of Saxony from 1816 to 2022:

=== Birthrate ===

The average number of children per woman in Saxony was 1.60 in 2018, the fourth-highest rate of all German states. Within Saxony, the highest is the Bautzen district with 1.77, while Leipzig is the lowest with 1.49. Dresden&#x27;s fertility rate of 1.58 is the highest of all German cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants.

=== Sorbian population ===

Saxony is home to the Sorbs. There are currently between 45,000 and 60,000 Sorbs living in Saxony (Upper Lusatia region). Today&#x27;s Sorb minority is the remainder of the Slavic population that settled throughout Saxony in the early Middle Ages and over time slowly assimilated into the German speaking society. Many geographic names in Saxony are of Sorbic origin (including the three largest cities Chemnitz, Dresden and Leipzig). The Sorbic language and culture are protected by special laws and cities and villages in eastern Saxony that are inhabited by a significant number of Sorbian inhabitants have bilingual street signs and administrative offices provide service in both, German and Sorbian. The Sorbs enjoy cultural self-administration which is exercised through the Domowina. Former Minister President Stanislaw Tillich is of Sorbian ancestry and has been the first leader of a German state from a national minority.

=== Religion ===

As of 2011, 72.6% of people are not affiliated with any religion. The Protestant Church in Germany represents the largest Christian denomination in the state, adhered to by 21.4% of the population. Members of the Roman Catholic Church formed a minority of 3.8%. About 0.9% of the Saxons belonged to an Evangelical free church (&quot;Evangelische Freikirche&quot;, i.e. various Protestants outside the EKD), 0.3% to Orthodox churches and 1% to other religious communities. The Moravian Church (see above) still maintains its religious centre in Herrnhut and it is there where &#x27;The Daily Watchwords&#x27; (Losungen) are selected each year which are in use in many churches worldwide. In particular in the larger cities, there are numerous smaller religious communities. 

The international Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a presence in the Freiberg Germany Temple which was the first of its kind in Germany, opened in 1985 even before its counterpart in Western Germany. It now also serves as a religious center for the church members in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. In Leipzig, there is a significant Buddhist community, which mainly caters to the population of Vietnamese origin, with one Buddhist temple built in 2008 and another one currently under construction. The Sikh faith also maintains a presence in Saxony&#x27;s three largest cities with three (though small) Gurdwara.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 124.6 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 3.7% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 28,100 euros or 93% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 85% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the highest of the states of the former GDR. Saxony has a &quot;very high&quot; Human Development Index value of 0.930 (2018), which is at the same level as Denmark. Within Germany Saxony is ranked 9th.

Saxony has, after Saxony-Anhalt, the most vibrant economy of the states of the former East Germany (GDR). Its economy grew by 1.9% in 2010. Nonetheless, unemployment remains above the German average. The eastern part of Germany, excluding Berlin, qualifies as an &quot;Objective 1&quot; development-region within the European Union, and was eligible to receive investment subsidies up to 30% until 2013. FutureSAX, a business plan competition and entrepreneurial support organisation, has been in operation since 2002.

Microchip-makers near Dresden have given the region the nickname &quot;Silicon Saxony&quot;. The publishing and porcelain industries of the region are well known, although their contributions to the regional economy are no longer significant. Today, the automobile industry, machinery production, and services mainly contribute to the economic development of the region.

Saxony reported an average unemployment of 5.5% in 2019.

The Leipzig area, which until recently was among the regions with the highest unemployment rate, could benefit greatly from investments by Porsche and BMW. With the VW Phaeton factory in Dresden, and many parts suppliers, the automobile industry has again become one of the pillars of Saxon industry, as it was in the early 20th century. Zwickau is another major Volkswagen location. Freiberg, a former mining town, has emerged as a foremost location for solar technology. Dresden and some other regions of Saxony play a leading role in some areas of international biotechnology, such as electronic bioengineering. While these high-technology sectors do not yet offer a large number of jobs, they have stopped or even reversed the brain drain that was occurring until the early 2000s in many parts of Saxony. Regional universities have strengthened their positions by partnering with local industries. Glashütte is the birthplace of the German watchmaking industry and home to highly regarded watch manufacturers such as A. Lange &amp; Söhne and Glashütte Original.

=== International trade ===
Saxony is a strongly export-oriented economy. In 2018, exports amounted to 40.48 billion euros while imports stood at 24.41 billion euros. The largest export partner of Saxony is China with an amount of 6.72 billion euros, while the second largest export market are the United States with 3.59 billion. The largest exporting sectors are the automobile industry and mechanical engineering.

In April 2022, Saxony received about 84% of its imported oil and gas from Russia while nationally Germany only imported about one third from Russia. This is mainly due to the pipeline network, which since the time of the GDR has been strongly integrated with the Soviet Union, similar to other states of Eastern Europe.

=== Tourism ===
Saxony is a renowned tourist destination in Germany. The cities of Dresden and Leipzig are two of Germany&#x27;s most visited cities. Areas along the border with the Czech Republic, such as the Lusatian Mountains, Ore Mountains, Saxon Switzerland, and Vogtland, attract significant numbers of visitors. In addition, Saxony has well-preserved historic towns such as Görlitz, Bautzen, Freiberg, Pirna, Meissen and Stolpen as well as numerous castles and palaces. New tourist destinations are developing, notably in the Lusatian Lake District.
== Education ==
Saxony&#x27;s school system belongs to the most excelling ones in Germany. It has been ranked first in the German school assessment (Bildungsmonitor) for several years.

Saxony has four large universities, six (Universities of Applied Sciences) and six art schools.
The Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden), founded in 1828, is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest universities. With 36,066 students as of 2010, it is the largest university in Saxony and one of the ten largest universities in Germany. It is a member of TU9, a consortium of nine leading German Institutes of Technology.

Leipzig University is one of the oldest universities in the world and the second-oldest university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany, founded in 1409. Famous alumni include Leibniz, Goethe, Ranke, Nietzsche, Wagner, Cai Yuanpei, Angela Merkel, Raila Odinga, Tycho Brahe, and nine Nobel laureates are associated with this university.

With over 11,000 students, the Chemnitz University of Technology is the third largest university in Saxony.

Established in 1765, the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology, located in the former mining town of Freiberg, is the oldest university of mining and metallurgy in the world.

Saxony is home to several Max Planck Institutes and research institutions of the Fraunhofer Society.

One of the two main campuses of the German National Library is located in Leipzig.

== Culture ==

Saxony is part of Central Germany as a cultural area. As such, throughout German history it played an important role in shaping German culture.

=== Languages ===
The most common patois spoken in Saxony are combined in the group of &quot;Thuringian and Upper Saxon dialects&quot;. Due to the inexact use of the term &quot;Saxon dialects&quot; in colloquial language, the Upper Saxon attribute has been added to distinguish it from Old Saxon and Low Saxon. Other German dialects spoken in Saxony are the dialects of the Ore Mountains, which have been affected by Upper Saxon dialects, and the dialects of the Vogtland, which are more affected by the East Franconian languages.

Upper Sorbian (a West Slavic language) is spoken in the parts of Upper Lusatia that are inhabited by the Sorbian minority. The Germans in Upper Lusatia speak distinct dialects of their own (Lusatian dialects).

=== Motherland of the Reformation ===
Saxony is often seen as the &quot;motherland of the Reformation&quot;. It was predominantly Lutheran Protestant from the Reformation until the late 20th century.

The Electoral Saxony, a predecessor of today&#x27;s Saxony, was the original birthplace of the Reformation. The elector was Lutheran starting in 1525. The Lutheran church was organized through the late 1510s and the early 1520s. It was officially established in 1527 by John the Steadfast. Although some of the sites associated with Martin Luther also lie in the current state of Saxony-Anhalt (including Wittenberg, Eisleben and Mansfeld), today&#x27;s Saxony is usually viewed as the formal successor to what used to be Luther&#x27;s country back in the 16th century (i.e. the Electoral Saxony).

Martin Luther personally oversaw the Lutheran church in Saxony and shaped it consistently with his own views and ideas. The 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were heavily dominated by Lutheran orthodoxy. In addition, the Reformed faith made inroads with the so-called crypto Calvinists, but was strongly persecuted in an overwhelmingly Lutheran state. In the 17th century, Pietism became an important influence. In the 18th century, the Moravian Church was set up on Count von Zinzendorf&#x27;s property at Herrnhut. From 1525, the rulers were traditionally Lutheran and widely acknowledged as defenders of the Protestant faith, although – beginning with Augustus II the Strong, who was required to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1697 in order to become King of Poland – its monarchs were exclusively Roman Catholic. That meant Augustus and the subsequent Electors of Saxony, who were Roman Catholic, ruled over a state with an almost entirely Protestant population.

In 1925, 90.3% of the Saxon population was Protestant, 3.6% was Roman Catholic, 0.4% was Jewish and 5.7% was placed in other religious categories.

After World War II, Saxony was incorporated into East Germany which pursued a policy of state atheism. After 45 years of Communist rule, the majority of the population has become unaffiliated. Nonetheless, even during this time Saxony remained an important place of religious dialogue and it was at Meissen where the agreement on mutual recognition between the German Evangelical Church and the Church of England was signed in 1988.

===Sports===

In 2020, there were 4,447 registered sports clubs of various disciplines with over 600,000 members in Saxony. The most popular sport in Saxony is football. With RB Leipzig there is one Saxon team playing in the Bundesliga as well as the European Champions League. Leipzig is notable for a longstanding football tradition, a Leipzig team having been the first national football champion in German history. Another popular sport is handball with SC DHfK Leipzig playing in the Bundesliga. On a local level sports such as table tennis, cycling, mountaineering and volleyball are popular.

====Rock climbing====

Saxony prides itself to have been one of the first places in the world where modern recreational rock climbing was developed. Falkenstein rock in the area of Bad Schandau is considered to be the place were the German rock climbing tradition started in 1864.

====Winter sports====
The Ore Mountains in southern Saxony are traditionally a region of winter sports. The ski ressort of Oberwiesenthal is the highest town of Germany, at an altitude of 900 m, though the surrounding mountains do not reach the same height as in the alpine areas of Southern Germany. Thus, climate change is posing a certain threat to the development of winter sports business. There are a number of training facilities for the German Winter Olympics&#x27; team in the region.

===Art===

The two major cultural centers of Saxony are Dresden and Leipzig. The two cities have each a unique character which is reflecting the role they played throughout Saxon and German history, Dresden being a political center while Leipzig has been a major trading city. Thus, Dresden is well known for the art collections of the former Saxon kings (Dresden State Art Collections with the Green Vault and Zwinger as the most well-known parts).

Leipzig on the other hand never had a royal court, so its culture is borne largely by its citizens. The city is famous for its relationship with classical music and names like Johann Sebastian Bach, Mendelssohn or Wagner are linked to it. Over the past decades the city became famous for its modern art scene, most notably the Neue Leipziger Schule (New Leipzig School) with artists such as Neo Rauch.

===Porcelain===
Saxony was the first place in Europe to develop and produce white porcelain, a luxury good until then imported only from China. The Meissen Porcelain manufactory has been producing porcelain since 1710. It is one of the world&#x27;s leading porcelain manufacturers and one of the oldest and most internationally known German luxury brands.

===Cuisine===

Saxon cuisine encompasses regional cooking traditions of Saxony. In general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of Mid-Germany such as a great variety of sauces which accompany the main dish and the fashion to serve potato dumplings (Klöße/Knödel) as a side dish instead of potatoes, pasta or rice. Also much freshwater fish is used in Saxon cuisine. The area around Dresden is home to the easternmost wine region in Germany (see: Saxony (wine region)).

===Anthem===
Saxony (as other German states) has its own anthem, dating back to the monarchy of the 19th century. &#x27;Gott segne Sachsenland&#x27; (God save Saxony) is based on the melody of God save the King.

<text>Scottish Gaelic (, ; endonym: ), also known as Scots Gaelic or simply Gaelic, is a Goidelic language (in the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family) native to the Gaels of Scotland. As a Goidelic language, Scottish Gaelic, as well as both Irish and Manx, developed out of Old Irish. It became a distinct spoken language sometime in the 13th century in the Middle Irish period, although a common literary language was shared by the Gaels of both Ireland and Scotland until well into the 17th century. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language place names.

In the 2011 census of Scotland, 57,375 people (1.1% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) reported being able to speak Gaelic, 1,275 fewer than in 2001. The highest percentages of Gaelic speakers were in the Outer Hebrides. Nevertheless, there is a language revival, and the number of speakers of the language under age 20 did not decrease between the 2001 and 2011 censuses. In the 2022 census of Scotland, it was found that 2.5% of the Scottish population had some skills in Gaelic, or 130,161 persons. Of these, 69,701 people reported speaking the language, with a further 46,404 people reporting that they understood the language, but did not speak, read, or write in it.

Outside of Scotland, a dialect known as Canadian Gaelic has been spoken in Canada since the 18th century. In the 2021 census, 2,170 Canadian residents claimed knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, a decline from 3,980 speakers in the 2016 census. There exists a particular concentration of speakers in Nova Scotia, with historic communities in other parts of North America, including North Carolina and Glengarry County, Ontario having largely disappeared.

Scottish Gaelic is classed as an indigenous language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the UK Government has ratified, and the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 established a language-development body, . The Scottish Parliament is considering a Scottish Languages Bill which proposes to give the Gaelic and Scots languages official status in Scotland.
==Name==
Aside from &quot;Scottish Gaelic&quot;, the language may also be referred to simply as &quot;Gaelic&quot;, pronounced in English. However, &quot;Gaelic&quot; also refers to the Irish language () and the Manx language ().

Scottish Gaelic is distinct from Scots, the Middle English-derived language which had come to be spoken in most of the Lowlands of Scotland by the early modern era. Prior to the 15th century, this language was known as (&quot;English&quot;) by its own speakers, with Gaelic being called (&quot;Scottish&quot;). Beginning in the late 15th century, it became increasingly common for such speakers to refer to Scottish Gaelic as (&quot;Irish&quot;) and the Lowland vernacular as . Today, Scottish Gaelic is recognised as a separate language from Irish, so the word in reference to Scottish Gaelic is no longer used.

==History==
===Origins===


Based on medieval traditional accounts and the apparent evidence from linguistic geography, Gaelic has been commonly believed to have been brought to Scotland, in the 4th–5th centuries CE, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of on Scotland&#x27;s west coast in present-day Argyll. An alternative view has been voiced by archaeologist Ewan Campbell, who has argued that the putative migration or takeover is not reflected in archaeological or placename data (as pointed out earlier by Leslie Alcock). Campbell has also questioned the age and reliability of the medieval historical sources speaking of a conquest. Instead, he has inferred that Argyll formed part of a common Q-Celtic-speaking area with Ireland, connected rather than divided by the sea, since the Iron Age. These arguments have been opposed by some scholars defending the early dating of the traditional accounts and arguing for other interpretations of the archaeological evidence.

Regardless of how it came to be spoken in the region, Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to until the eighth century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. During the reign of Caustantín mac Áeda (Constantine II, 900–943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten. Bilingualism in Pictish and Gaelic, prior to the former&#x27;s extinction, led to the presence of Pictish loanwords in Scottish Gaelic and syntactic influence which could be considered to constitute a Pictish substrate.

In 1018, after the conquest of Lothian (theretofore part of England and inhabited predominantly by speakers of Northumbrian Old English) by the Kingdom of Scotland, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith. Colloquial speech in Scotland had been developing independently of that in Ireland since the eighth century. For the first time, the entire region of modern-day Scotland was called in Latin, and Gaelic was the . In southern Scotland, Gaelic was strong in Galloway, adjoining areas to the north and west, West Lothian, and parts of western Midlothian. It was spoken to a lesser degree in north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken.

===Decline===
Many historians mark the reign of King Malcolm Canmore (Malcolm III) between 1058 and 1093 as the beginning of Gaelic&#x27;s eclipse in Scotland. His wife Margaret of Wessex spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland.During the reigns of Malcolm Canmore&#x27;s sons, Edgar, Alexander I and David I (their successive reigns lasting 1097–1153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth–Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking Old English. This was the beginning of Gaelic&#x27;s status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.

Clan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language&#x27;s recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century.

By the mid-14th century what eventually came to be called Scots (at that time termed Inglis) emerged as the official language of government and law. Scotland&#x27;s emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized using Scots as well. For example, the nation&#x27;s great patriotic literature including John Barbour&#x27;s &quot;The Brus&quot; (1375) and Blind Harry&#x27;s &quot;The Wallace&quot; (before 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. By the end of the 15th century, English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as &#x27;Yrisch&#x27; or &#x27;Erse&#x27;, i.e. Irish and their own language as &#x27;Scottis&#x27;.

===Modern era===

A steady shift away from Scottish Gaelic continued into and through the modern era. Some of this was driven by policy decisions by government or other organisations, while some originated from social changes. In the last quarter of the 20th century, efforts began to encourage use of the language.

The Statutes of Iona, enacted by James VI in 1609, was one piece of legislation that addressed, among other things, the Gaelic language. It required the heirs of clan chiefs to be educated in lowland, Protestant, English-speaking schools. James VI took several such measures to impose his rule on the Highland and Island region. In 1616, the Privy Council proclaimed that schools teaching in English should be established. Gaelic was seen, at this time, as one of the causes of the instability of the region. It was also associated with Catholicism.

The Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded in 1709. They met in 1716, immediately after the failed Jacobite rising of 1715, to consider the reform and civilisation of the Highlands, which they sought to achieve by teaching English and the Protestant religion. Initially, their teaching was entirely in English, but soon the impracticality of educating Gaelic-speaking children in this way gave rise to a modest concession: in 1723, teachers were allowed to translate English words in the Bible into Gaelic to aid comprehension, but there was no further permitted use. Other less prominent schools worked in the Highlands at the same time, also teaching in English. This process of anglicisation paused when evangelical preachers arrived in the Highlands, convinced that people should be able to read religious texts in their own language. The first well known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767, when James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. In 1798, four tracts in Gaelic were published by the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home, with 5,000 copies of each printed. Other publications followed, with a full Gaelic Bible in 1801. The influential and effective Gaelic Schools Society was founded in 1811. Their purpose was to teach Gaels to read the Bible in their own language. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the SSPCK (despite their anti-Gaelic attitude in prior years) and the British and Foreign Bible Society distributed 60,000 Gaelic Bibles and 80,000 New Testaments. It is estimated that this overall schooling and publishing effort gave about 300,000 people in the Highlands some basic literacy. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible; the lack of a well known translation may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic.
Counterintuitively, access to schooling in Gaelic increased knowledge of English. In 1829, the Gaelic Schools Society reported that parents were unconcerned about their children learning Gaelic, but were anxious to have them taught English. The SSPCK also found Highlanders to have significant prejudice against Gaelic. T. M. Devine attributes this to an association between English and the prosperity of employment: the Highland economy relied greatly on seasonal migrant workers travelling outside the . In 1863, an observer sympathetic to Gaelic stated that &quot;knowledge of English is indispensable to any poor islander who wishes to learn a trade or to earn his bread beyond the limits of his native Isle&quot;. Generally, rather than Gaelic speakers, it was Celtic societies in the cities and professors of Celtic from universities who sought to preserve the language.

The Education (Scotland) Act 1872 provided universal education in Scotland, but completely ignored Gaelic in its plans. The mechanism for supporting Gaelic through the Education Codes issued by the Scottish Education Department were steadily used to overcome this omission, with many concessions in place by 1918. However, the members of Highland school boards tended to have anti-Gaelic attitudes and served as an obstacle to Gaelic education in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Loss of life due to World War I and the 1919 sinking of the HMY, combined with emigration, resulted in the 1910s seeing unprecedented damage to the use of Scottish Gaelic, with a 46% fall in monolingual speakers and a 19% fall in bilingual speakers between the 1911 and 1921 Censuses. Michelle MacLeod of Aberdeen University has said that there was no other period with such a high fall in the number of monolingual Gaelic speakers: &quot;Gaelic speakers became increasingly the exception from that point forward with bilingualism replacing monolingualism as the norm for Gaelic speakers.&quot;

The Linguistic Survey of Scotland (1949–1997) surveyed both the dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, and also mixed use of English and Gaelic across the Highlands and Islands.

===Defunct dialects===
Dialects of Lowland Gaelic have been defunct since the 18th century. Gaelic in the Eastern and Southern Scottish Highlands, although alive until the mid-20th century, is now largely defunct. Although modern Scottish Gaelic is dominated by the dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye, there remain some speakers of the Inner Hebridean dialects of Tiree and Islay, and even a few native speakers from Western Highland areas including Wester Ross, northwest Sutherland, Lochaber and Argyll. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, on Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary. Some features of moribund dialects have been preserved in Nova Scotia, including the pronunciation of the broad or velarised l () as , as in the Lochaber dialect.

==Status==
The Endangered Languages Project lists Gaelic&#x27;s status as &quot;threatened&quot;, with &quot;20,000 to 30,000 active users&quot;. UNESCO classifies Gaelic as &quot;definitely endangered&quot;.

===Number of speakers===
The 1755–2001 figures are census data quoted by MacAulay. The 2011 Gaelic speakers figures come from table KS206SC of the 2011 Census. The 2011 total population figure comes from table KS101SC. The numbers of Gaelic speakers relate to the numbers aged 3 and over, and the percentages are calculated using those and the number of the total population aged 3 and over.

Across the whole of Scotland, the 2011 census showed that 25,000 people (0.49% of the population) used Gaelic at home. Of these, 63.3% said that they had a full range of language skills: speaking, understanding, reading and writing Gaelic. 40.2% of Scotland&#x27;s Gaelic speakers said that they used Gaelic at home. To put this in context, the most common language spoken at home in Scotland after English and Scots is Polish, with about 1.1% of the population, or 54,000 people.

===Distribution in Scotland===


The 2011 UK Census showed a total of 57,375 Gaelic speakers in Scotland (1.1% of population over three years old), of whom only 32,400 could also read and write the language. Compared with the 2001 Census, there has been a diminution of about 1300 people. This is the smallest drop between censuses since the Gaelic-language question was first asked in 1881. The Scottish government&#x27;s language minister and took this as evidence that Gaelic&#x27;s long decline has slowed.

The main stronghold of the language continues to be the Outer Hebrides (), where the overall proportion of speakers is 52.2%. Important pockets of the language also exist in the Highlands (5.4%) and in Argyll and Bute (4.0%) and Inverness (4.9%). The locality with the largest absolute number is Glasgow with 5,878 such persons, who make up over 10% of all of Scotland&#x27;s Gaelic speakers.

Gaelic continues to decline in its traditional heartland. Between 2001 and 2011, the absolute number of Gaelic speakers fell sharply in the Western Isles (−1,745), Argyll &amp; Bute (−694), and Highland (−634). The drop in Stornoway, the largest parish in the Western Isles by population, was especially acute, from 57.5% of the population in 1991 to 43.4% in 2011. The only parish outside the Western Isles over 40% Gaelic-speaking is Kilmuir in Northern Skye at 46%. The islands in the Inner Hebrides with significant percentages of Gaelic speakers are Tiree (38.3%), Raasay (30.4%), Skye (29.4%), Lismore (26.9%), Colonsay (20.2%), and Islay (19.0%).

Today, no civil parish in Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 65% (the highest value is in Barvas, Lewis, with 64.1%). In addition, no civil parish on mainland Scotland has a proportion of Gaelic speakers greater than 20% (the highest is in Ardnamurchan, Highland, with 19.3%). Out of a total of 871 civil parishes in Scotland, the proportion of Gaelic speakers exceeds 50% in seven parishes, 25% in 14 parishes, and 10% in 35 parishes.

Decline in traditional areas has recently been balanced by growth in the Scottish Lowlands. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, the number of Gaelic speakers rose in nineteen of the country&#x27;s 32 council areas. The largest absolute gains were in Aberdeenshire (+526), North Lanarkshire (+305), the Aberdeen City council area (+216), and East Ayrshire (+208). The largest relative gains were in Aberdeenshire (+0.19%), East Ayrshire (+0.18%), Moray (+0.16%), and Orkney (+0.13%).

In 2018, the census of pupils in Scotland showed 520 students in publicly funded schools had Gaelic as the main language at home, an increase of 5% from 497 in 2014. During the same period, Gaelic medium education in Scotland has grown, with 4,343 pupils (6.3 per 1000) being educated in a Gaelic-immersion environment in 2018, up from 3,583 pupils (5.3 per 1000) in 2014. Data collected in 2007–2008 indicated that even among pupils enrolled in Gaelic medium schools, 81% of primary students and 74% of secondary students report using English more often than Gaelic when speaking with their mothers at home. The effect on this of the significant increase in pupils in Gaelic-medium education since that time is unknown.

=== Preservation and revitalization ===
Gaelic Medium Education is one of the primary ways that the Scottish Government is addressing Gaelic language shift. Along with the Bòrd na Gàidhlig policies, preschool and daycare environments are also being used to create more opportunities for intergenerational language transmission in the Outer Hebrides.  However, revitalization efforts are not unified within Scotland or Nova Scotia, Canada. One can attend Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a national centre for Gaelic Language and Culture, based in Sleat, on the Isle of Skye. This institution is the only source for higher education which is conducted entirely in Scottish Gaelic. They offer courses for Gaelic learners from beginners into fluency. They also offer regular bachelors and graduate programs delivered entirely in Gaelic. Concerns have been raised around the fluency achieved by learners within these language programs because they are disconnected from vernacular speech communities. In regard to language revitalization planning efforts, many feel that the initiatives must come from within Gaelic speaking communities, be led by Gaelic speakers, and be designed to serve and increase fluency within the vernacular communities as the first and most viable resistance to total language shift from Gaelic to English. Currently, language policies are focused on creating new language speakers through education, instead of focused on how to strengthen intergenerational transmission within existing Gaelic speaking communities.

=== Challenges to preservation and revitalization ===
In the Outer Hebrides, accommodation ethics exist amongst native or local Gaelic speakers when engaging with new learners or non-locals. Accommodation ethics, or ethics of accommodation, is a social practice where local or native speakers of Gaelic shift to speaking English when in the presence of non-Gaelic speakers out of a sense of courtesy or politeness. This accommodation ethic persists even in situations where new learners attempt to speak Gaelic with native speakers. This creates a situation where new learners struggle to find opportunities to speak Gaelic with fluent speakers. Affect is the way people feel about something, or the emotional response to a particular situation or experience. For Gaelic speakers, there is a conditioned and socialized negative affect through a long history of negative Scottish media portrayal and public disrespect, state mandated restrictions on Gaelic usage, and highland clearances. This negative affect towards speaking openly with non-native Gaelic speakers has led to a language ideology at odds with revitalization efforts on behalf of new speakers, state policies (such as the Gaelic Language Act), and family members reclaiming their lost mother tongue. New learners of Gaelic often have a positive affective stance to their language learning, and connect this learning journey towards Gaelic language revitalization. The mismatch of these language ideologies, and differences in affective stance, has led to fewer speaking opportunities for adult language learners and therefore a challenge to revitalization efforts which occur outside the home. Positive engagements between language learners and native speakers of Gaelic through mentorship has proven to be productive in socializing new learners into fluency.

==Usage==
===Official===
====Scotland====
In the 2022 census, 3,551 people claimed Gaelic as their &#x27;main language.&#x27; Of these, 1,761 (49.6%) were in Na h-Eileanan Siar, 682 (19.2%) were in Highland, 369 were in Glasgow City and 120 were in City of Edinburgh; no other council area had as many as 80 such respondents.

=====Scottish Parliament=====
Gaelic has long suffered from its lack of use in educational and administrative contexts and was long suppressed.

The UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Gaelic. Gaelic, along with Irish and Welsh, is designated under Part III of the Charter, which requires the UK Government to take a range of concrete measures in the fields of education, justice, public administration, broadcasting and culture. It has not received the same degree of official recognition from the UK Government as Welsh. With the advent of devolution, however, Scottish matters have begun to receive greater attention, and it achieved a degree of official recognition when the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament on 21 April 2005.

The key provisions of the Act are:
* Establishing the Gaelic development body, (BnG), on a statutory basis with a view to securing the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language and to promote the use and understanding of Gaelic.
* Requiring BnG to prepare a National Gaelic Language Plan every five years for approval by Scottish Ministers.
* Requiring BnG to produce guidance on Gaelic medium education and Gaelic as a subject for education authorities.
* Requiring public bodies in Scotland, both Scottish public bodies and cross-border public bodies insofar as they carry out devolved functions, to develop Gaelic language plans in relation to the services they offer, if requested to do so by BnG.

After its creation, Bòrd na Gàidhlig required a Gaelic Language Plan from the Scottish Government. This plan was accepted in 2008, and some of its main commitments were: identity (signs, corporate identity); communications (reception, telephone, mailings, public meetings, complaint procedures); publications (PR and media, websites); staffing (language learning, training, recruitment).

Following a consultation period, in which the government received many submissions, the majority of which asked that the bill be strengthened, a revised bill was published; the main alteration was that the guidance of the is now statutory (rather than advisory). In the committee stages in the Scottish Parliament, there was much debate over whether Gaelic should be given &#x27;equal validity&#x27; with English. Due to executive concerns about resourcing implications if this wording was used, the Education Committee settled on the concept of &#x27;equal respect&#x27;. It is not clear what the legal force of this wording is.

The Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament unanimously, with support from all sectors of the Scottish political spectrum, on 21 April 2005. Under the provisions of the Act, it will ultimately fall to BnG to secure the status of the Gaelic language as an official language of Scotland.

Some commentators, such as (2006) argue that the Gaelic Act falls so far short of the status accorded to Welsh that one would be foolish or naïve to believe that any substantial change will occur in the fortunes of the language as a result of &#x27;s efforts.

On 10 December 2008, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Scottish Human Rights Commission had the UDHR translated into Gaelic for the first time.

However, given there are no longer any monolingual Gaelic speakers, following an appeal in the court case of &quot;Taylor v Haughney&quot; (1982), involving the status of Gaelic in judicial proceedings, the High Court ruled against a general right to use Gaelic in court proceedings.

While the goal of the Gaelic Language Act was to aid in revitalization efforts through government mandated official language status, the outcome of the act is distanced from the actual minority language communities. It helps to create visibility of the minority language in civil structures, but does not impact or address the lived experiences of the Gaelic speaker communities wherein the revitalization efforts may have a higher return of new Gaelic speakers. Efforts are being made to concentrate resources, language planning, and revitalization efforts towards vernacular communities in the Western Isles.

=====Qualifications in the language=====
The Scottish Qualifications Authority offer two streams of Gaelic examination across all levels of the syllabus: Gaelic for learners (equivalent to the modern foreign languages syllabus) and Gaelic for native speakers (equivalent to the English syllabus).

 performs assessment of spoken Gaelic, resulting in the issue of a Bronze Card, Silver Card or Gold Card. Syllabus details are available on An Comunn&#x27;s website. These are not widely recognised as qualifications, but are required for those taking part in certain competitions at the annual .

=====European Union=====

In October 2009, a new agreement allowed Scottish Gaelic to be formally used between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain&#x27;s representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. This did not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU but gave it the right to be a means of formal communications in the EU&#x27;s institutions. The Scottish government had to pay for the translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government&#x27;s support for Gaelic. He said; &quot;Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed&quot;. Culture Minister Mike Russell said; &quot;this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad and I look forward to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon. Seeing Gaelic spoken in such a forum raises the profile of the language as we drive forward our commitment to creating a new generation of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.&quot;

=====Signage=====


Bilingual road signs, street names, business and advertisement signage (in both Gaelic and English) are gradually being introduced throughout Gaelic-speaking regions in the Highlands and Islands, including Argyll. In many cases, this has simply meant re-adopting the traditional spelling of a name (such as or rather than the anglicised forms &quot;Ratagan&quot; or &quot;Lochailort&quot; respectively).

Some monolingual Gaelic road signs, particularly direction signs, are used on the Outer Hebrides, where a majority of the population can have a working knowledge of the language. These omit the English translation entirely.

Bilingual railway station signs are now more frequent than they used to be. Practically all the stations in the Highland area use both English and Gaelic, and the use of bilingual station signs has become more frequent in the Lowlands of Scotland, including areas where Gaelic has not been spoken for a long time.

This has been welcomed by many supporters of the language as a means of raising its profile as well as securing its future as a &#x27;living language&#x27; (i.e. allowing people to use it to navigate from A to B in place of English) and creating a sense of place. However, in some places, such as Caithness, the Highland Council&#x27;s intention to introduce bilingual signage has incited controversy.

The Ordnance Survey has acted in recent years to correct many of the mistakes that appear on maps. They announced in 2004 that they intended to correct them and set up a committee to determine the correct forms of Gaelic place names for their maps. Ainmean-Àite na h-Alba (&quot;Place names in Scotland&quot;) is the national advisory partnership for Gaelic place names in Scotland.

====Canada====
In the nineteenth century, Canadian Gaelic was the third-most widely spoken European language in British North America and Gaelic-speaking immigrant communities could be found throughout what is modern-day Canada. Gaelic poets in Canada produced a significant literary tradition. The number of Gaelic-speaking individuals and communities declined sharply, however, after the First World War.

===== Nova Scotia =====

At the start of the 21st century, it was estimated that no more than 500 people in Nova Scotia still spoke Scottish Gaelic as a first language. In the 2011 census, 300 people claimed to have Gaelic as their first language (a figure that may include Irish Gaelic). In the same 2011 census, 1,275 people claimed to speak Gaelic, a figure that not only included all Gaelic languages but also those people who are not first language speakers, of whom 300 claim to have Gaelic as their &quot;mother tongue.&quot;

The Nova Scotia government maintains the Office of Gaelic Affairs (), which is dedicated to the development of Scottish Gaelic language, culture and tourism in Nova Scotia, and which estimates about 2,000 total Gaelic speakers to be in the province. As in Scotland, areas of North-Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton have bilingual street signs. Nova Scotia also has (The Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia), a non-profit society dedicated to the maintenance and promotion of the Gaelic language and culture in Maritime Canada. In 2018, the Nova Scotia government launched a new Gaelic vehicle licence plate to raise awareness of the language and help fund Gaelic language and culture initiatives.

In September 2021, the first Gaelic-medium primary school outside of Scotland, named , opened in Mabou, Nova Scotia.

===== Outside Nova Scotia =====
Maxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly.

In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes. This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.

The province of British Columbia is host to the (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival &quot;Vancouver&quot;. The city of Vancouver&#x27;s Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.

===Media===

The BBC operates a Gaelic-language radio station as well as a television channel, . Launched on 19 September 2008, BBC Alba is widely available in the UK (on Freeview, Freesat, Sky and Virgin Media). It also broadcasts across Europe on the Astra 2 satellites. The channel is being operated in partnership between BBC Scotland and – an organisation funded by the Scottish Government, which works to promote the Gaelic language in broadcasting. The ITV franchise in central Scotland, STV Central, has, in the past, produced a number of Scottish Gaelic programmes for both BBC Alba and its own main channel.

Until BBC Alba was broadcast on Freeview, viewers were able to receive the channel , which broadcast for an hour every evening. Upon BBC Alba&#x27;s launch on Freeview, it took the channel number that was previously assigned to TeleG.

There are also television programmes in the language on other BBC channels and on the independent commercial channels, usually subtitled in English. The ITV franchise in the north of Scotland, STV North (formerly &quot;Grampian Television&quot;) produces some non-news programming in Scottish Gaelic.

===Education===
====Scotland====


The Education (Scotland) Act 1872, which completely ignored Gaelic and led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. People still living in 2001 could recall being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school. Even later, when these attitudes had changed, little provision was made for Gaelic medium education in Scottish schools. As late as 1958, even in Highland schools, only 20% of primary students were taught Gaelic as a subject, and only 5% were taught other subjects through the Gaelic language.

Gaelic-medium playgroups for young children began to appear in Scotland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Parent enthusiasm may have been a factor in the &quot;establishment of the first Gaelic medium primary school units in Glasgow and Inverness in 1985&quot;.

The first modern solely Gaelic-medium secondary school, (&quot;Glasgow Gaelic School&quot;), was opened at Woodside in Glasgow in 2006 (61 partially Gaelic-medium primary schools and approximately a dozen Gaelic-medium secondary schools also exist). According to , a total of 2,092 primary pupils were enrolled in Gaelic-medium primary education in 2008–09, as opposed to 24 in 1985.

The Columba Initiative, also known as (formerly ), is a body that seeks to promote links between speakers of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.

In November 2019, the language-learning app Duolingo opened a beta course in Gaelic.

Starting from summer 2020, children starting school in the Western Isles will be enrolled in GME (Gaelic-medium education) unless parents request differently. Children will be taught Scottish Gaelic from P1 to P4 and then English will be introduced to give them a bilingual education.

====Canada====
In May 2004, the Nova Scotia government announced the funding of an initiative to support the language and its culture within the province. Several public schools in Northeastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton offer Gaelic classes as part of the high-school curriculum.

Maxville Public School in Maxville, Glengarry, Ontario, offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly. In Prince Edward Island, the Colonel Gray High School offer an introductory and an advanced course in Scottish Gaelic.

====Higher and further education====
A number of Scottish and some Irish universities offer full-time degrees including a Gaelic language element, usually graduating as Celtic Studies.

In Nova Scotia, Canada, St. Francis Xavier University, the Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts and Cape Breton University (formerly known as the &quot;University College of Cape Breton&quot;) offer Celtic Studies degrees and/or Gaelic language programs. The government&#x27;s Office of Gaelic Affairs offers lunch-time lessons to public servants in Halifax.

In Russia the Moscow State University offers Gaelic language, history and culture courses.

The University of the Highlands and Islands offers a range of Gaelic language, history and culture courses at the National Certificate, Higher National Diploma, Bachelor of Arts (ordinary), Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Science levels. It offers opportunities for postgraduate research through the medium of Gaelic. Residential courses at on the Isle of Skye offer adults the chance to become fluent in Gaelic in one year. Many continue to complete degrees, or to follow up as distance learners. A number of other colleges offer a one-year certificate course, which is also available online (pending accreditation).

Lews Castle College&#x27;s Benbecula campus offers an independent 1-year course in Gaelic and Traditional Music (FE, SQF level 5/6).

===Church===

In the Western Isles, the isles of Lewis, Harris and North Uist have a Presbyterian majority (largely Church of Scotland – in Gaelic, Free Church of Scotland and Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland). The isles of South Uist and Barra have a Catholic majority. All these churches have Gaelic-speaking congregations throughout the Western Isles. Notable city congregations with regular services in Gaelic are St Columba&#x27;s Church, Glasgow and Greyfriars Tolbooth &amp; Highland Kirk, Edinburgh. —a shorter Gaelic version of the English-language Book of Common Order—was published in 1996 by the Church of Scotland.

The widespread use of English in worship has often been suggested as one of the historic reasons for the decline of Gaelic. The Church of Scotland is supportive today, but has a shortage of Gaelic-speaking ministers. The Free Church also recently announced plans to abolish Gaelic-language communion services, citing both a lack of ministers and a desire to have their congregations united at communion time.

===Literature===

From the sixth century to the present day, Scottish Gaelic has been used as a literary language. Two prominent writers of the twentieth century are Anne Frater and Sorley MacLean.

===Names===
====Personal names====
Gaelic has its own version of European-wide names which also have English forms, for example: (John), (Alexander), (William), (Catherine), (Robert), (Christina), (Ann), (Mary), (James), (Patrick) and (Thomas).
Not all traditional Gaelic names have direct equivalents in English: , which is normally rendered as &quot;Euphemia&quot; (Effie) or &quot;Henrietta&quot; (Etta) (formerly also as Henny or even as Harriet), or, , which is &quot;matched&quot; with &quot;Dorothy&quot;, simply on the basis of a certain similarity in spelling. Many of these traditional Gaelic-only names are now regarded as old-fashioned, and hence are rarely or never used.

Some names have come into Gaelic from Old Norse; for example, ( &lt; ), (&lt; ), or (&lt; ), (&lt; ), (). These are conventionally rendered in English as &quot;Sorley&quot; (or, historically, &quot;Somerled&quot;), &quot;Norman&quot;, &quot;Ronald&quot; or &quot;Ranald&quot;, &quot;Torquil&quot; and &quot;Iver&quot; (or &quot;Evander&quot;).

Some Scottish names are Anglicized forms of Gaelic names: → (Angus), → (Donald), for instance. , and the recently established (pronounced ) come from the Gaelic for, respectively, James, and Mary, but derive from the form of the names as they appear in the vocative case: (James) (nom.) → (voc.) and (Mary) (nom.) → (voc.).

====Surnames====
The most common class of Gaelic surnames are those beginning with (Gaelic for &quot;son&quot;), such as  /  (MacLean). The female form is (Gaelic for &quot;daughter&quot;), so Catherine MacPhee is properly called in Gaelic, (strictly, is a contraction of the Gaelic phrase , meaning &quot;daughter of the son&quot;, thus really means &quot;daughter of MacDonald&quot; rather than &quot;daughter of Donald&quot;). The &quot;of&quot; part actually comes from the genitive form of the patronymic that follows the prefix; in the case of , (&quot;of Donald&quot;) is the genitive form of (&quot;Donald&quot;).

Several colours give rise to common Scottish surnames: (Bain – white), (Roy – red), (Dow, Duff – black), (Dunn – brown), (Bowie – yellow) although in Gaelic these occur as part of a fuller form such as &#x27;son of the servant of&#x27;, i.e. .

==Phonology==
Most varieties of Gaelic show either eight or nine vowel qualities () in their inventory of vowel phonemes, which can be either long or short. There are also two reduced vowels () which occur only in their short versions. Although some vowels are strongly nasal, instances of distinctive nasality are rare. There are about nine diphthongs and a few triphthongs.

Most consonants have both palatal and non-palatal counterparts, including a very rich system of liquids, nasals and trills (i.e. three contrasting &quot;l&quot; sounds, three contrasting &quot;n&quot; sounds and three contrasting &quot;r&quot; sounds). The historically voiced stops have lost their voicing, so the phonemic contrast today is between unaspirated and aspirated . In many dialects, these stops may however gain voicing through secondary articulation through a preceding nasal, for examples &quot;door&quot; but &quot;the door&quot; as or .

In some fixed phrases, these changes are shown permanently, as the link with the base words has been lost, as in &quot;now&quot;, from &quot;this time/period&quot;.

In medial and final position, the aspirated stops are preaspirated rather than postaspirated.

==Grammar==
Scottish Gaelic is an Indo-European language with an inflecting morphology, verb–subject–object word order and two grammatical genders.

===Noun inflection===
Gaelic nouns inflect for four cases (nominative/accusative, vocative, genitive and dative) and three numbers (singular, dual and plural).

They are also normally classed as either masculine or feminine. A small number of words that used to belong to the neuter class show some degree of gender confusion. For example, in some dialects &quot;the sea&quot; behaves as a masculine noun in the nominative case, but as a feminine noun in the genitive ().

Nouns are marked for case in a number of ways, most commonly involving various combinations of lenition, palatalisation and suffixation.

===Verb inflection===
There are 12 irregular verbs. Most other verbs follow a fully predictable paradigm, although polysyllabic verbs ending in laterals can deviate from this paradigm as they show syncopation.

There are:
* Three persons: 1st, 2nd and 3rd
* Two numbers: singular and plural
* Two voices: traditionally called active and passive, but actually personal and impersonal
* Three non-composed combined TAM forms expressing tense, aspect and mood, i.e. non-past (future-habitual), conditional (future of the past), and past (preterite); several composed TAM forms, such as pluperfect, future perfect, present perfect, present continuous, past continuous, conditional perfect, etc. Two verbs, , used to attribute a notionally temporary state, action, or quality to the subject, and (a defective verb that has only two forms), used to show a notional permanent identity or quality, have non-composed present and non-past tense forms: () [perfective present], / [imperfective non-past] and all other expected verb forms, though the verb adjective (&quot;past participle&quot;) is lacking; () , past and conditional.
* Four moods: independent (used in affirmative main clause verbs), relative (used in verbs in affirmative relative clauses), dependent (used in subordinate clauses, anti-affirmative relative clauses, and anti-affirmative main clauses), and subjunctive.

===Word order===
Word order is strictly verb–subject–object, including questions, negative questions and negatives. Only a restricted set of preverb particles may occur before the verb.

==Lexicon==
The majority of the vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic is of Celtic origin. However, Gaelic contains substantially more words of non-Goidelic extraction than Irish. The main sources of loanwords into Gaelic are the Germanic languages English, Scots and Norse. Other sources include Latin, French and the Brittonic languages.

Many direct Latin loanwords in Scottish Gaelic were adopted during the Old and Middle Irish (600 AD-1200 AD) stages of the language and are often terms related to Christianity. Latin is also the source of the days of the week (&quot;Monday&quot;), (Tuesday), (&quot;Saturday&quot;) and (&quot;Sunday&quot;).

=== Brittonic ===
The Brittonic languages Cumbric and Pictish were spoken in Scotland during the Early to High Middle Ages, and Scottish Gaelic has many Brittonic influences. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but it is not always possible to disentangle P and Q Celtic words. However, some common words such as (&quot;legacy&quot;), (; &quot;mountain&quot;) and (; &quot;bush&quot;) are transparently Brittonic in origin.

Scottish Gaelic contains a number of words, principally toponymic elements, that are sometimes more closely aligned in their usage and sense with their Brittonic cognates than with their Irish. This is indicative of the operation of a Brittonic substrate influence. Such items include:
=== Neologisms ===
In common with other Indo-European languages, the neologisms coined for modern concepts are typically based on Greek or Latin, although often coming through English; &quot;television&quot;, for instance, becomes and &quot;computer&quot; becomes . Some speakers use an English word even if there is a Gaelic equivalent, applying the rules of Gaelic grammar. With verbs, for instance, they will simply add the verbal suffix (, or, in Lewis, , as in, &quot; watch (Lewis, &quot;watch &quot;) telly&quot; (I am watching the television), instead of &quot;&quot;. This phenomenon was described over 170 years ago, by the minister who compiled the account covering the parish of Stornoway in the &quot;New Statistical Account of Scotland&quot;, and examples can be found dating to the eighteenth century. However, as Gaelic medium education grows in popularity, a newer generation of literate Gaels has become more familiar with modern Gaelic vocabulary.

===Loanwords into other languages===
Scottish Gaelic has also influenced the Scots language and English, particularly Scottish Standard English. Loanwords include: whisky, slogan, brogue, jilt, clan, galore, trousers, gob, as well as familiar elements of Scottish geography like ben (), glen () and . Irish has also influenced Lowland Scots and English in Scotland, but it is not always easy to distinguish its influence from that of Scottish Gaelic.

==Orthography==

Scottish Gaelic orthography is fairly regular; its standard was set by the 1767 New Testament. The 1981 Scottish Examination Board recommendations for Scottish Gaelic, the Gaelic Orthographic Conventions, were adopted by most publishers and agencies, although they remain controversial among some academics, most notably Ronald Black.

The quality of consonants (broad or slender) is indicated by the vowels surrounding them. Slender (palatalised) consonants are surrounded by slender vowels (), while broad (neutral or velarised) consonants are surrounded by broad vowels (). The spelling rule known as (&quot;slender to slender and broad to broad&quot;) requires that a word-medial consonant or consonant group followed by is preceded by and similarly, if followed by is preceded by .

This rule sometimes leads to the insertion of a silent written vowel. For example, plurals in Gaelic are often formed with the suffix , for example, (&quot;shoe&quot;) / (&quot;shoes&quot;). But because of the spelling rule, the suffix is spelled - (but pronounced the same, ) after a slender consonant, as in (&quot;[a] people&quot;) / (&quot;peoples&quot;) where is purely a graphic vowel inserted to conform with the spelling rule because precedes the .

Unstressed vowels omitted in speech can be omitted in informal writing, e.g. (&quot;I hope.&quot;) &gt; 

Scots English orthographic rules have also been used at various times in Gaelic writing. Notable examples of Gaelic verse composed in this manner are the Book of the Dean of Lismore and the manuscript.

===Alphabet===

====Ogham====
The Ogham writing system was used in Ireland to write Primitive Irish and Old Irish until it was supplanted by the Latin script in the 5th century CE in Ireland. In Scotland, the majority of Ogham inscriptions are in Pictish but a number of Goidelic Ogham inscriptions also exist, such as the Giogha Stone which bears the inscription VICULA MAQ CUGINI &#x27;Viqula, son of Comginus&#x27;, with Goidelic MAQ (modern &quot;mac&quot; &#x27;son&#x27;) rather than Brythonic MAB (cf. modern Welsh &quot;mab&quot; &#x27;son&#x27;).

====Insular script====

The Insular script was used both in Ireland and Scotland but had largely disappeared in Scotland by the 16th century. It consisted of the same 18 letters still in modern use . and generally did not contain .

In addition to the base letters, vowels in the Insular script could be accented with an acute accent ( to indicate length. The overdot was used to indicate lenition of , while the following was used for . The lenition of other letters was not generally indicated initially but eventually the two methods were used in parallel to represent the lenition of any consonant and competed with each other until the standard practice became to use the overdot in the Insular Script and the following in Roman type, i.e. are equivalent to . The use of Gaelic type and the overdot today is restricted to decorative usages.

Letters with an overdot have been available since Unicode 5.0 .

====Latin script====

The modern Scottish Gaelic alphabet has 18 letters: . is mostly used to indicate lenition of a consonant. The letters of the alphabet were traditionally named after trees, but this custom has fallen out of use.

Long vowels are marked with a grave accent (), indicated through digraphs (e.g. for ) or conditioned by certain consonant environments (e.g. preceding a non-intervocalic is ). Traditionally the acute accent was used on to represent long close-mid vowels, but the spelling reforms replaced it with the grave accent.

Certain 18th century sources used only an acute accent along the lines of Irish, such as in the writings of Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (1741–51) and the earliest editions (1768–90) of Duncan Ban MacIntyre.

==Example text==
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Scottish Gaelic:
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in English:
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

<text>The Seleucid Empire ( ) was a Greek state in West Asia during the Hellenistic period. It was founded in 312 BC by the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator, following the division of the Macedonian Empire founded by Alexander the Great, and ruled by the Seleucid dynasty until its annexation by the Roman Republic under Pompey in 63 BC.

After receiving the Mesopotamian regions of Babylonia and Assyria in 321 BC, Seleucus I began expanding his dominions to include the Near Eastern territories that encompass modern-day Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, and Lebanon, all of which had been under Macedonian control after the fall of the former Achaemenid Empire. At the Seleucid Empire&#x27;s height, it had consisted of territory that covered Anatolia, Persia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, and what are now modern Kuwait, Afghanistan, and parts of Turkmenistan.

The Seleucid Empire was a major center of Hellenistic culture. Greek customs and language were privileged; the wide variety of local traditions had been generally tolerated, while an urban Greek elite had formed the dominant political class and was reinforced by steady immigration from Greece. The empire&#x27;s western territories were repeatedly contested with Ptolemaic Egypt—a rival Hellenistic state. To the east, conflict with the Indian ruler Chandragupta of the Maurya Empire in 305 BC led to the cession of vast territory west of the Indus and a political alliance.

In the early second century BC, Antiochus III the Great attempted to project Seleucid power and authority into Hellenistic Greece, but his attempts were thwarted by the Roman Republic and its Greek allies. The Seleucids were forced to pay costly war reparations and had to relinquish territorial claims west of the Taurus Mountains in southern Anatolia, marking the gradual decline of their empire. Mithridates I of Parthia conquered much of the remaining eastern lands of the Seleucid Empire in the mid-second century BC, including Assyria and what had been Babylonia, while the independent Greco-Bactrian Kingdom continued to flourish in the northeast. The Seleucid kings were thereafter reduced to a rump state in Syria after a civil war, until their conquest by Tigranes the Great of Armenia in 83 BC, and ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey in 63 BC.

==Name==
Contemporary sources, such as a loyalist decree honoring Antiochus I from Ilium, in Greek language define the Seleucid state both as an empire (, ) and as a kingdom (, ). Similarly, Seleucid rulers were described as kings in Babylonia.

The rulers did not describe themselves as being of any particular territory or people, but starting from the 2nd century BC, ancient writers referred to them as the Syrian kings, the kings of Syria or of the Syrians, the kings descended from Seleucus Nicator, the kings of Asia, and other designations.

==History==
===Partition of Alexander&#x27;s empire===
Alexander, who quickly conquered the Persian Empire under its last Achaemenid dynast, Darius III, died young in 323 BC, leaving an expansive empire of partly Hellenised culture without an adult heir. The empire was put under the authority of a regent, Perdiccas, and the vast territories were divided among Alexander&#x27;s generals, who thereby became satraps at the Partition of Babylon, all in that same year.

===Rise of Seleucus===

Alexander&#x27;s generals, known as , jostled for supremacy over parts of his empire following his death. Ptolemy I Soter, a former general and then current satrap of Egypt, was the first to challenge the new system, which eventually led to the demise of Perdiccas. Ptolemy&#x27;s revolt created a new subdivision of the empire with the Partition of Triparadisus in 320 BC. Seleucus, who had been &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Companion cavalry&quot; () and appointed first or court chiliarch (which made him the senior officer in the Royal Army after the regent and commander-in-chief Perdiccas since 323 BC, though he helped to assassinate him later) received Babylonia and, from that point, continued to expand his dominions ruthlessly. Seleucus established himself in Babylon in 312 BC, the year later used as the foundation date of the Seleucid Empire.

=== Babylonian War (311–309 BC) ===

The rise of Seleucus in Babylon threatened the eastern extent of the territory of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in Asia. Antigonus, along with his son Demetrius I Poliorcetes, unsuccessfully led a campaign to annex Babylon. The victory of Seleucus ensured his claim of Babylon and legitimacy. He ruled not only Babylonia, but the entire enormous eastern part of Alexander&#x27;s empire, as described by the historian Appian:

===Seleucid–Mauryan War (305–303 BC)===

Chandragupta Maurya (Sandrokottos) founded the Maurya Empire in 321 BC after the conquest of the Nanda Empire and their capital Pataliputra in Magadha. Chandragupta then redirected his attention to the Indus River region, and by 317 BC, he conquered the remaining Greek satraps left by Alexander. Expecting a confrontation, Seleucus gathered his army and marched to the Indus. It is said that Chandragupta could have fielded a conscript army of 600,000 men and 9,000 war elephants.

Chandragupta received, formalized through a treaty, territory west of the Indus, including the Hindu Kush, modern day Afghanistan, and the eastern part Balochistan province of Pakistan, bordering on the Indus. Archaeologically, concrete indications of Mauryan rule, such as the inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka, are known as far as Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. According to Appian:

It is generally thought that Chandragupta married Seleucus&#x27;s daughter, or a Macedonian princess, a gift from Seleucus to formalize an alliance. In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent 500 war elephants, a military asset which would play a decisive role at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to Chandragupta, and later Deimakos to his son Bindusara, at the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar state). Megasthenes wrote detailed descriptions of India and Chandragupta&#x27;s reign, which have been partly preserved to us through Diodorus Siculus. Later Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt and contemporary of Ashoka the Great, is also recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court.

Other territories ceded before Seleucus&#x27; death were Gedrosia in the south-east of the Iranian plateau, and, to the north of this, Arachosia on the west bank of the Indus River.

=== Westward expansion ===

Following his and Lysimachus&#x27; decisive victory over Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC, Seleucus took control over eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.

In the latter area, he founded a new capital at Antioch on the Orontes, a city he named after his father. An alternative capital was established at Seleucia on the Tigris, north of Babylon. Seleucus&#x27;s empire reached its greatest extent following his defeat of his erstwhile ally, Lysimachus, at Corupedion in 281 BC, after which Seleucus expanded his control to encompass western Anatolia. He hoped further to take control of Lysimachus&#x27;s lands in Europe – primarily Thrace and even Macedonia itself, but was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus on landing in Europe.

His son and successor, Antiochus I Soter, was left with an enormous realm consisting of nearly all of the Asian portions of the Empire, but faced with Antigonus II Gonatas in Macedonia and Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Egypt, he proved unable to pick up where his father had left off in conquering the European portions of Alexander&#x27;s empire.

===Breakup of Central Asian territories===
Antiochus I (reigned 281–261 BC) and his son and successor Antiochus II Theos (reigned 261–246 BC) were faced with challenges in the west, including repeated wars with Ptolemy II and a Celtic invasion of Asia Minor—distracting attention from holding the eastern portions of the Empire together. Towards the end of Antiochus II&#x27;s reign, various provinces simultaneously asserted their independence, such as Bactria and Sogdiana under Diodotus, Cappadocia under Ariarathes III, and Parthia under Andragoras. A few years later, the last was defeated and killed by the invading Parni of Arsaces—the region would then become the core of the Parthian Empire.

Diodotus, the Seleucid governor for the Bactrian territory, asserted independence in around 245 BC, although the exact date is far from certain, to form the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. This kingdom was characterized by a rich Hellenistic culture and was to continue its domination of Bactria until around 125 BC when it was overrun by the invasion of northern nomads. One of the Greco-Bactrian kings, Demetrius I of Bactria, invaded India around 180 BC to form the Indo-Greek Kingdoms.

The rulers of Persis, called Fratarakas, also seem to have established some level of independence from the Seleucids during the 3rd century BC, especially from the time of Vahbarz. They would later overtly take the title of Kings of Persis, before becoming vassals to the newly formed Parthian Empire.

The Seleucid satrap of Parthia, named Andragoras, first claimed independence, in a parallel to the secession of his Bactrian neighbour. Soon after, however, a Parthian tribal chief called Arsaces invaded the Parthian territory around 238 BC to form the Arsacid dynasty, from which the Parthian Empire originated.

Antiochus II&#x27;s son Seleucus II Callinicus came to the throne around 246 BC. Seleucus II was soon dramatically defeated in the Third Syrian War against Ptolemy III of Egypt and then had to fight a civil war against his own brother Antiochus Hierax. Taking advantage of this distraction, Bactria and Parthia seceded from the empire. In Asia Minor too, the Seleucid dynasty seemed to be losing control: the Gauls had fully established themselves in Galatia, semi-independent semi-Hellenized kingdoms had sprung up in Bithynia, Pontus, and Cappadocia, and the city of Pergamum in the west was asserting its independence under the Attalid dynasty. The Seleucid economy started to show the first signs of weakness, as Galatians gained independence and Pergamum took control of coastal cities in Anatolia. Consequently, they managed to partially block contact with the West.

===Revival (223–191 BC)===

A revival would begin when Seleucus II&#x27;s younger son, Antiochus III the Great, took the throne in 223 BC. Although initially unsuccessful in the Fourth Syrian War against Egypt, which led to a defeat at the Battle of Raphia (217 BC), Antiochus would prove himself to be the greatest of the Seleucid rulers after Seleucus I himself. He spent the next ten years on his (journey) through the eastern parts of his domain and restoring rebellious vassals like Parthia and Greco-Bactria to at least nominal obedience. He gained many victories such as the Battle of Mount Labus and Battle of the Arius and besieged the Bactrian capital. He even emulated Seleucus with an expedition into India where he met with King Sophagasenus () receiving war elephants, perhaps in accordance of the existing treaty and alliance set after the Seleucid-Mauryan War.

Actual translation of Polybius 11.34 (No other source except Polybius makes any reference to Sophagasenus):

When he returned to the west in 205 BC, Antiochus found that with the death of Ptolemy IV, the situation now looked propitious for another western campaign. Antiochus and Philip V of Macedon then made a pact to divide the Ptolemaic possessions outside of Egypt, and in the Fifth Syrian War, the Seleucids ousted Ptolemy V from control of Coele-Syria. The Battle of Panium (200 BC) definitively transferred these holdings from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Antiochus appeared, at the least, to have restored the Seleucid Kingdom to glory.

====Expansion into Greece and war with Rome====
Following the defeat of his erstwhile ally Philip by Rome in 197 BC, Antiochus saw the opportunity for expansion into Greece itself. Encouraged by the exiled Carthaginian general Hannibal, and making an alliance with the disgruntled Aetolian League, Antiochus launched an invasion across the Hellespont. With his huge army he aimed to establish the Seleucid empire as the foremost power in the Hellenic world, but these plans put the empire on a collision course with the new rising power of the Mediterranean, the Roman Republic. At the battles of Thermopylae (191 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), Antiochus&#x27;s forces suffered resounding defeats, and he was compelled to make peace and sign the Treaty of Apamea (188 BC), the main clause of which saw the Seleucids agree to pay a large indemnity, to retreat from Anatolia and to never again attempt to expand Seleucid territory west of the Taurus Mountains. The Kingdom of Pergamum and the Republic of Rhodes, Rome&#x27;s allies in the war, gained the former Seleucid lands in Anatolia. Antiochus died in 187 BC on another expedition to the east, where he sought to extract money to pay the indemnity.

===Roman power, Parthia and Judea===
The reign of his son and successor Seleucus IV Philopator (187–175 BC) was largely spent in attempts to pay the large indemnity, and Seleucus was ultimately assassinated by his minister Heliodorus.

Seleucus&#x27; younger brother, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, now seized the throne. He attempted to restore Seleucid power and prestige with a successful war against the old enemy, Ptolemaic Egypt, which met with initial success as the Seleucids defeated and drove the Egyptian army back to Alexandria itself. As the king planned on how to conclude the war, he was informed that Roman commissioners, led by the Proconsul Gaius Popillius Laenas, were near and requesting a meeting with the Seleucid king. Antiochus agreed, but when they met and Antiochus held out his hand in friendship, Popilius placed in his hand the tablets on which was written the decree of the senate and told him to read it. The decree demanded that he should abort his attack on Alexandria and immediately stop waging the war on Ptolemy. When the king said that he would call his friends into council and consider what he ought to do, Popilius drew a circle in the sand around the king&#x27;s feet with the stick he was carrying and said, &quot;Before you step out of that circle give me a reply to lay before the senate.&quot; For a few moments he hesitated, astounded at such a peremptory order, and at last replied, &quot;I will do what the senate thinks right.&quot; He then chose to withdraw rather than set the empire to war with Rome again.

On his return journey, according to Josephus, he made an expedition to Judea, took Jerusalem by force, slew a great many who had favored Ptolemy, sent his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and interrupted the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation, for three years and six months.

The latter part of his reign saw a further disintegration of the Empire despite his best efforts. Weakened economically, militarily and by loss of prestige, the Empire became vulnerable to rebels in the eastern areas of the empire, who began to further undermine the empire while the Parthians moved into the power vacuum to take over the old Persian lands. Antiochus&#x27; aggressive Hellenizing (or de-Judaizing) activities provoked a full scale armed rebellion in Judea—the Maccabean Revolt. Efforts to deal with both the Parthians and the Jews as well as retain control of the provinces at the same time proved beyond the weakened empire&#x27;s power. Antiochus orchestrated a military campaign, capturing Artaxias I, King of Armenia, and reoccupying Armenia. His offensive ventured as far as Persepolis, but he was forced from the city by the populace. On his return home, Antiochus died in Isfahan in 164 BC.

===Civil war and further decay===


After the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Seleucid Empire became increasingly unstable. Frequent civil wars made central authority tenuous at best. Epiphanes&#x27; young son, Antiochus V Eupator, was first overthrown by Seleucus IV&#x27;s son, Demetrius I Soter in 161 BC. Demetrius I attempted to restore Seleucid power in Judea particularly, but was overthrown in 150 BC by Alexander Balas—an impostor who (with Egyptian backing) claimed to be the son of Epiphanes. Alexander Balas reigned until 145 BC when he was overthrown by Demetrius I&#x27;s son, Demetrius II Nicator. Demetrius II proved unable to control the whole of the kingdom, however. While he ruled Babylonia and eastern Syria from Damascus, the remnants of Balas&#x27; supporters—first supporting Balas&#x27; son Antiochus VI, then the usurping general Diodotus Tryphon—held out in Antioch.

Meanwhile, the decay of the Empire&#x27;s territorial possessions continued apace. By 143 BC, the Jews in the form of the Maccabees had fully established their independence. Parthian expansion continued as well. In 139 BC, Demetrius II was defeated in battle by the Parthians and was captured. By this time, the entire Iranian Plateau had been lost to Parthian control.

Demetrius Nicator&#x27;s brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, took the throne after his brother&#x27;s capture. He faced the enormous task of restoring a rapidly crumbling empire, one facing threats on multiple fronts. Hard-won control of Coele-Syria was threatened by the Jewish Maccabee rebels. Once-vassal dynasties in Armenia, Cappadocia, and Pontus were threatening Syria and northern Mesopotamia; the nomadic Parthians, brilliantly led by Mithridates I of Parthia, had overrun upland Media (home of the famed Nisean horse herd); and Roman intervention was an ever-present threat. Sidetes managed to bring the Maccabees to heel and frighten the Anatolian dynasts into a temporary submission; then, in 133, he turned east with the full might of the Royal Army (supported by a body of Jews under the Hasmonean prince, John Hyrcanus) to drive back the Parthians.
Sidetes&#x27; campaign initially met with spectacular success, recapturing Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and Media. In the winter of 130/129 BC, his army was scattered in winter quarters throughout Media and Persis when the Parthian king, Phraates II, counter-attacked. Moving to intercept the Parthians with only the troops at his immediate disposal, he was ambushed and killed at the Battle of Ecbatana in 129 BC. Antiochus Sidetes is sometimes called the last great Seleucid king.

After the death of Antiochus VII Sidetes, all of the recovered eastern territories were recaptured by the Parthians. The Maccabees again rebelled, civil war soon tore the empire to pieces, and the Armenians began to encroach on Syria from the north.

===Collapse (100–63 BC)===
By 100 BC, the once-formidable Seleucid Empire encompassed little more than Antioch and some Syrian cities. Despite the clear collapse of their power, and the decline of their kingdom around them, nobles continued to play kingmakers on a regular basis, with occasional intervention from Ptolemaic Egypt and other outside powers. The Seleucids existed solely because no other nation wished to absorb them—seeing as they constituted a useful buffer between their other neighbours. In the wars in Anatolia between Mithridates VI of Pontus and Sulla of Rome, the Seleucids were largely left alone by both major combatants.

Mithridates&#x27; ambitious son-in-law, Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia, however, saw opportunity for expansion in the constant civil strife to the south. In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he invaded Syria and soon established himself as ruler of Syria, putting the Seleucid Empire virtually at an end.

Seleucid rule was not entirely over, however. Following the Roman general Lucullus&#x27; defeat of both Mithridates and Tigranes in 69 BC, a rump Seleucid kingdom was restored under Antiochus XIII. Even so, civil wars could not be prevented, as another Seleucid, Philip II, contested rule with Antiochus. After the Roman conquest of Pontus, the Romans became increasingly alarmed at the constant source of instability in Syria under the Seleucids. Once Mithridates was defeated by Pompey in 63 BC, Pompey set about the task of remaking the Hellenistic East, by creating new client kingdoms and establishing provinces. While client nations like Armenia and Judea were allowed to continue with some degree of autonomy under local kings, Pompey saw the Seleucids as too troublesome to continue; doing away with both rival Seleucid princes, he made Syria into a Roman province.

==Culture==
The domain of the Seleucids stretched from the Aegean Sea to what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, therefore including a diverse array of cultures and ethnic groups. Greeks, Assyrians, Armenians, Georgians, Persians, Medes, Mesopotamians, Jews, and more all lived within its bounds. The immense size of the empire gave the Seleucid rulers a difficult balancing act to maintain order, resulting in a mixture of concessions to local cultures to maintain their own practices while also firmly controlling and unifying local elites under the Seleucid banner.

The government established Greek cities and settlements throughout the empire via a program of colonization that encouraged immigration from Greece; both city settlements as well as rural ones were created that were inhabited by ethnic Greeks. These Greeks were given good land and privileges, and in exchange were expected to serve in military service for the state. Despite being a tiny minority of the overall population, these Greeks were the backbone of the empire: loyal and committed to a cause that gave them vast territory to rule, they overwhelmingly served in the military and government. Unlike Ptolemaic Egypt, Greeks in the Seleucid Empire seem to rarely have engaged in mixed marriages with non-Greeks; they kept to their own cities.

The various non-Greek peoples of the empire were still influenced by the spread of Greek thought and culture, a phenomenon referred to as Hellenization. Historically significant towns and cities, such as Antioch, were created or renamed with Greek names, and hundreds of new cities were established for trade purposes and built in Greek style from the start. Local educated elites who needed to work with the government learned the Greek language, wrote in Greek, absorbed Greek philosophical ideas, and took on Greek names; some of these practices then slowly filtered down to the lower classes. Hellenic ideas began an almost 250-year expansion into the Near East, Middle East, and Central Asian cultures.
Synthesizing Hellenic and indigenous cultural, religious, and philosophical ideas – an ethnic unity framework established by Alexander – met with varying degrees of success. The result was times of simultaneous peace and rebellion in various parts of the empire. In general, the Seleucids allowed local religions to operate undisturbed, such as incorporating Babylonian religious tenets, to gain support. Tensions around the integration of Judaism were present during the reign of the Seleucid governments. Though previous governments had managed a relatively seamless integration of Judean religious and cultural practices, the rule of Antiochus IV introduced significant changes. Antiochus IV instigated a bidding process for the High Priest position—this led to Menelaus, a radical Hellenist, outbidding Jason, a moderate Hellenist who upheld many traditional Judean practices. The shift from Jason to Menelaus unsettled the Jewish populace due to Menelaus&#x27;s more extreme Hellenistic leanings. Aggravating the situation, Antiochus IV initiated a series of religious persecutions. This cumulated in a localized revolt in Jerusalem. Antiochus IV&#x27;s violent retaking of the city and the banning of traditional Judean practices led to the eventual loss of control of Judea by the Seleucid government, paving the way for the rise of an independent Hasmonean kingdom.

==Military==
As with the other major Hellenistic armies, the Seleucid army fought primarily in the Greco-Macedonian style, with its main body being the phalanx. The phalanx was a large, dense formation of men armed with small shields and a long pike called the . This form of fighting had been developed by the Macedonian army in the reign of Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great. Alongside the phalanx, the Seleucid armies used numerous native and mercenary troops to supplement their Greek forces, which were limited due to the distance from the Seleucid rulers&#x27; Macedonian homeland. The size of the Seleucid army usually varied between 70,000 and 200,000 in manpower.

The distance from Greece put a strain on the Seleucid military system, as it was primarily based around the recruitment of Greeks as the key segment of the army. In order to increase the population of Greeks in their kingdom, the Seleucid rulers created military settlements. There were two main periods in the establishment of settlements, firstly under Seleucus I Nicator and Antiochus I Soter and then under Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The military settlers were given land, &quot;varying in size according to rank and arm of service&#x27;. They were settled in &#x27;colonies of an urban character, which at some point could acquire the status of a polis&quot;. The settler-soldiers were called ; they would maintain the land as their own and in return, they would serve in the Seleucid army when called. The majority of settlements were concentrated in Lydia, northern Syria, the upper Euphrates and Media. Antiochus III brought Greeks from Euboea, Crete and Aetolia and settled them in Antioch.

These Greek settlers would be used to form the Seleucid phalanx and cavalry units, with picked men put into the kingdom&#x27;s guards&#x27; regiments. The rest of the Seleucid army would consist of native and mercenary troops, who would serve as light auxiliary troops. While the Seleucids were happy to recruit from less populated and outlying parts of the Empire such as the Arabs and Jews, Iranian peoples in the east, and inhabitants of Asia Minor to the north, they generally eschewed recruiting native Syrians and native Mesopotamians (Babylonians). This was presumably mostly from a desire not to train and arm the people who were an overwhelming majority in the trade and governmental centers of the Empire in Antioch and Babylon, risking revolt. While a revolt in a remote place could be put down by resolute action from the center, an uprising in Syria-Coele would have undermined the kingdom&#x27;s very existence.

Following losses of territory in Asia Minor during the Roman-Seleucid War, King Antiochus IV sponsored a new wave of immigration and settlements to replace them and maintain enough Greeks to staff the phalanxes seen at the military parade at Daphne in 166–165 BC. Antiochus IV built 15 new cities &quot;and their association with the increased phalanx... at Daphne is too obvious to be ignored&quot;.

== Economy ==
As a hegemonic empire, much of the state&#x27;s wealth accumulation centered around maintaining its sizable military. While the motive is simple enough, the Seleucid Empire boasts of a sophisticated political economy that extracts wealth from local temples, cities (or ), and royal estates; much of which was inherited from their Achaemenid predecessors. Recent discussion indicates a market-oriented economy under the Seleucids. However, evidencing limits our understanding of the Seleucid economy to the Hellenistic Near-East; that is, through their holdings in Syria, Asia Minor, and Mesopotamia. Little is known about the economy of the Upper Satrapies.

===Monetization===
Currency plays an increasingly central role under the Seleucids; however, monetization was nothing new in their newly acquired lands. Rather, the introduction and widespread implementation of currency is attributed to Darius I&#x27;s tax reforms centuries prior; hence, the Seleucids see a continuation rather than shift in this practice, i.e. the payment of taxation in silver or, if necessary, in kind. In this regard, the Seleucids are notable for paying their sizeable armies exclusively in silver. Nevertheless, there are two significant developments of currency during the Seleucid period: the adoption of the &quot;Attic Standard&quot; in certain regions, and the popularization of bronze coinage.

The adoption of the Attic standard was not uniform across the realm. The Attic standard was already the common currency of the Mediterranean prior to Alexander&#x27;s conquest; that is, it was the preferred currency for foreign transactions. As a result, coastal regions under the Seleucids—Syria and Asia Minor—were quick to adopt the new standard. In Mesopotamia, however, the millennia-old shekel (weighing 8.33 g silver) prevailed over the Attic standard. According to Historian R. J. van der Spek, this is due to their particular method in recording price, which favored bartering over monetary transactions. The Mesopotamians used the value of one shekel as a fixed reference point, against which the amount of a good is given. Prices themselves are accounted in terms of their weight in silver per ton, e.g., 60 g silver, barley, June 242 BC. The minute difference in weight between a shekel and didrachm (weighing 8.6 g silver) could not be expressed in this barter system, and a Greek tetradrachm would be &quot;a far too heavy denomination...in daily trade.&quot;

Bronze coinage, dating from the late fifth and fourth century, was popularized as a &quot;fiduciary&quot; currency facilitating &quot;small-scale exchanges&quot; in the Hellenistic period. It was principally a legal tender which circulated only around its locales of production; however, the great Seleucid mint at Antioch during Antiochus III&#x27;s reign (which Numismatist Arthur Houghton dubs &quot;The Syrian and Coele-Syrian Experiment&quot;) began minting bronze coins (weighing 1.25–1.5g) to serve a &quot;regional purpose.&quot; The reasons behind this remain unclear. However, Spek notes a chronic shortage of silver in the Seleucid empire. In fact, Antiochus I&#x27;s heavy withdrawal of silver from a satrap is noted by the Babylonian astronomical diaries (AD No. – 273 B &#x27;Rev. 33&#x27;): &quot;purchases in Babylon and other cities were made in Greek bronze coins.&quot; This was unprecedented because &quot;in official documents [bronze coins] played no part&quot;; it was a sign of &quot;hardship&quot; for the Seleucids. Nevertheless, the low denomination of bronze coinage meant it was used in tandem with bartering; making it a popular and successful medium of exchange.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture, like most pre-modern economies, constituted a vast majority of the Seleucid economy. Somewhere between 80 and 90% of the Seleucid population was employed, in some form, within the prevailing agricultural structures inherited from their Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid predecessors. These included temples, , and royal estates. We should clarify that the term , according to Spek, did not confer any special status to cities in the Seleucid sources; it was simply the term for &quot;city&quot;—Greek or otherwise. Regardless, agricultural produce varied from region to region. But in general, Greek produced: &quot;grain, olives and their oil, wine...figs, cheese from sheep and goats, [and] meat.&quot; Whereas Mesopotamian production from temple land consisted of: &quot;barley, dates, mustard (or cascuta/dodder), cress (cardamom), sesame and wool&quot;; which, as the core region of the Seleucid empire, was also the most productive.
Recent evidence indicates that Mesopotamian grain production, under the Seleucids, was subject to market forces of supply and demand. Traditional &quot;primitivist&quot; narratives of the ancient economy argue that it was &quot;marketless&quot;; however, the Babylonian astronomical diaries show a high degree of market integration of barley and date prices—to name a few—in Seleucid Babylonia. Prices exceeding &quot;370g&quot; silver per ton in Seleucid Mesopotamia was considered a sign of famine. Therefore, during periods of war, heavy taxation, and crop failure, prices increase drastically. In an extreme example, Spek believes tribal Arab raiding into Babylonia caused barley prices to skyrocket to 1493 grams of silver per ton from 5–8 May, 124 BC. The average Mesopotamian peasant, if working for a wage at a temple, would receive 1 shekel; it &quot;was a reasonable monthly wage for which one could buy one kor of grain= 180 [liters].&quot; While this appears dire, we should be reminded that Mesopotamia under the Seleucids was largely stable and prices remained low. With encouraged Greek colonization and land reclamation increasing the supply of grain production, however, the question of whether this artificially kept prices stable is uncertain.

The Seleucids also continued the tradition of actively maintaining the Mesopotamian waterways. As the greatest source of state income, the Seleucid kings actively managed the irrigation, reclamation, and population of Mesopotamia. In fact, canals were often dug by royal decrees, to which &quot;some were called the King&#x27;s Canal for that reason.&quot; For example, the construction of the Pallacottas canal was able to control the water level of the Euphrates which, as Arrian notes in his Anabasis 7.21.5, required: &quot;over two months of work by more than 10,000 Assyrians.&quot;

===Role of the state–political economy===

As a hegemonic empire, the state&#x27;s primary focus was maintaining its sizable army via wealth extraction from three major sources: tribute from autonomous and temples, and proportional land-tax from royal land. The definition of &quot;royal land&quot; remains contested. While all agree do not constitute royal land, some remain uncertain over the status of temple land. Yet, they commanded notable economic power and functioned almost independently from the state. Nevertheless, the Seleucid manner of extraction, in contrast to earlier regimes, is considered more &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;predatory&quot;.
In theory, the Seleucid state was an absolute monarchy that did not recognize private property in our modern sense. Any land that was not delegated to the or temples was considered private property of the sovereign; thus, considered as Royal Land and liable to direct tax by the state. Here, a &quot;proportional land-tax&quot;, that is, a tax based on the size of one&#x27;s plot, is collected by the local governor (or Satrap) and sent to the capital. However, there is no evidence for the amount that was taxed on any given region.

Tribute was heavily levied on and temples. Although tribute is paid annually, the amount demanded increases significantly during wartime. During a civil war in 149 BC, Demetrius II demanded the province of Judaea to pay 300 talents of silver, which was seen as &quot;severe.&quot; But this was far from an isolated case. In fact, the Babylonian Astronomical Diaries in 308/7 BC note a hefty 50% tax on harvest &quot;from the lands of the temple of Shamash (in Sipprar or Larsa).&quot; Nevertheless, annual tribute was &quot;a long-accepted and uncontroversial practice.&quot; Also, royal land was regularly donated to the temples and ; albeit under the assumption that a greater share of revenue is given to the state in exchange.
The controversial practice of temple &quot;despoliation&quot;, however, was a regular occurrence under the Seleucids—in contrast to earlier times. Although the Seleucid kings were aware and appreciated the sacrosanctity of religious treasures, their concentration in these places &quot;proved irresistible&quot; in the face of &quot;short-term fiscal constraints.&quot; As an example, Antiochus III&#x27;s despoliation of the Anahit Temple in Ecbatana, wherein he procured 4000 silver talents, was used to fund his Great Eastern campaign. According to historian Michael J. Taylor:It is difficult to believe that these monarchs who knew enough to bow before Nabu, bake bricks for Esagil, and enforce kosher regulations in Jerusalem, would be blithely aware of the political hazards of removing Temple treasures. It is more likely that they knew the risks but took them anyway.

A rebellion in 169 BC during Antiochus III&#x27;s campaign in Egypt demonstrates that these &quot;risks&quot; occasionally backfire. The increasingly bold interference is due, in large part, to the appointment of provincial high-priests by the monarch himself. Often they were his court &quot;favorites&quot;, whose prerogatives were purely administrative; essentially, they served to collect tribute for the state. Unsurprisingly: &quot;native elites profoundly feared that the arrival of a Seleucid official might quickly cascade into a wholesale removal of Temple treasures.&quot;

=== Academic discussion ===
Interpretations on the Seleucid economy since the late 19th century traditionally fell between the &quot;modernist&quot; and &quot;primitivist&quot; camps. On one hand, the modernist view—largely associated with Michael Rostovtzeff and Eduard Meyer—argues that the Hellenistic economies operated along price-setting markets with capitalist enterprises exported over long distances in &quot;completely monetarized markets.&quot; On the other hand, the primitivist view—associated with M.I. Finley, Karl Polanyi and Karl Bücher—interprets ancient economies as &quot;autarchic&quot; in nature with little to no interaction among each other. However, recent discussion has since criticized these models for their grounding on &quot;Greco-centric&quot; sources.

Recent discussion has since rejected these traditional dichotomies. According to Spek and Reger, the current view is that the Seleucid economy—and Hellenistic economies more broadly—were &quot;partially&quot; market-oriented, and &quot;partially&quot; monetarized. While the market was subject to forces of supply and demand, a majority of produce was still consumed by their producers and was, hence, &quot;invisible&quot; to the observer.
