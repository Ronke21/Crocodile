<text>Renzo Piano (; born 14 September 1937) is an Italian architect. His notable buildings include the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (with Richard Rogers, 1977), The Shard in London (2012), Kansai International Airport in Osaka (1994), the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (2015), İstanbul Modern in Istanbul (2022) and Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens (2016). He won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1998.

Piano has been a Senator for Life in the Italian Senate since 2013. 
==Early life and first buildings==
Piano was born and raised in Genoa, Italy, into a family of builders. His grandfather had created a masonry enterprise, which had been expanded by his father, Carlo Piano, and his father&#x27;s three brothers, into the firm Fratelli Piano. The firm prospered after World War II, constructing houses and factories and selling construction materials. When his father retired, the enterprise was led by Renzo&#x27;s older brother, Ermanno, who studied engineering at the University of Genoa. Renzo studied architecture at the University of Florence and Polytechnic University of Milan. He graduated in 1964 with a dissertation about modular coordination (&quot;coordinazione modulare&quot;) supervised by Giuseppe Ciribini and began working with experimental lightweight structures and basic shelters.

Piano taught at the Polytechnic University from 1965 until 1968, and expanded his horizons and technical skills by working in two large international firms, for the modernist architect Louis Kahn in Philadelphia and for the Polish engineer Zygmunt Stanisław Makowski in London. He completed his first building, the IPE factory in Genoa, in 1968, with a roof of steel and reinforced polyester, and created a continuous membrane for the covering of a pavilion at the Milan Triennale in the same year. In 1970, he received his first international commission, for the Pavilion of Italian Industry for Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan. He collaborated with his brother Ermanno and the family firm, which manufactured the structure. It was lightweight and original composed of steel and reinforced polyester, and it appeared to be simultaneously artistic and industrial.

The 1970 Osaka structure was greatly admired by the British architect Richard Rogers, and in 1971 the two men decided to open their own firm, Piano and Rogers, where they worked together from 1971 to 1977. The first project of the firm was the administrative building of B&amp;B Italia, an Italian furniture company, in Novedrate, Como, Italy. This design featured suspended container and an open bearing structure, with the conduits for heating and water on the exterior painted in bright colors (blue, red and yellow). These unusual features attracted considerable attention in the architectural world, and influenced the choice of the jurors who selected Piano and Rogers to design the Pompidou Center.

==The Centre Pompidou and early projects 1973–1977==
===Centre Pompidou (1973–1977)===
In 1971 the thirty-four-year old Piano and Richard Rogers, thirty-eight, in collaboration with the Italian architect Gianfranco Franchini, competed with the major architectural firms in the United States and Europe, and were awarded the commission for the most prestigious project in Paris, the new French national museum of 20th century art to be located in Beaubourg. The award came a surprise, to the architectural world, since the two were little-known, and had no experience with museums or other major structures. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that their design &quot;turned the architecture world upside down&quot;. More literally it turned architecture inside-out, since in the new museum, the apparent structural frame of the building and the heating and air conditioning ducts were on the exterior, painted in bright colors. The escalator, in a transparent tube, crossed the facade of the building at a diagonal. The building was an astonishing success, entirely transforming the character of a run-down commercial section near the Marais in Paris, and made Piano one of the best-known architects in the world.

The media dubbed the style of the building as &quot;high-tech&quot;, but this was later disputed by Piano. &quot;Beaubourg,&quot; he said, &quot;was a joyous urban machine, a creature which might have come out of a Jules Verne novel, a sort of bizarre boat in dry dock... It is a double provocation; a challenge to academism, but also a parody of the imagery of technology of our time. To consider it as a high-tech object is a mistake.&quot;

===Menil Collection (1981–1987)===
In 1977 Piano ended his collaboration with Rogers and began a new collaboration with engineer Peter Rice, who had assisted in the design of the Pompidou Center. They established their offices in Genoa. One of their first projects was a plan for the rehabilitation of the old port of Otranto from an industrial site into a commercial and tourist attraction (1977). Their first major building was the Menil Collection, an art museum for the art collector Dominique de Menil. The chief requirements of the owner for this building was to make the maximum use of natural light in the interiors. Piano wrote, &quot;Paradoxically, the Menil Collection, with its serenity, its calm, its discretion, is much more modern, scientifically speaking, than the Beaubourg.&quot; The Menil Collection building, with its simple gray and white cubic forms, is the stylistic opposite of the Pompidou Center. The technological innovations were not expressed on the facade, but in the high-tech but discreet systems of shutters and screens and air conditioning which allowed maximum illumination while protecting against the intense Texas heat and sunlight.

=== Old Port of Genoa (1985–2001) and Lingotto Factory in Turin (1983–2003) ===
In the mid-1980s Piano and his firm took on a wide variety of projects, using the most advanced technology available, but, in contrast to the Pompidou Center, as discreetly as possible. His portable pavilion for IBM (1983–1986) was an example; designed with Peter Rice, of a lightweight portable tunnel for expositions. It composed of a series of pyramids of polycarbonate supported by a wooden frame, and could be transported in a truck. It was designed to integrate the scenery outside into displays in the interior. He designed two major reconstruction projects in northern Italy; the reanimation of the old port of his native city, Genoa, and the conversion and modernization of the gigantic and historic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy. For the Fiat Lingotto factory, he preserved the enormous main structure, including its famous oval test track for automobiles on the roof, but added new structures, including a concert hall beneath the building, a heliport, and a glass domed conference center on the roof. He continued his modifications and additions over two decades; without destroying the historic core of the building. The most recent was a museum for the art collection of the Fiat head Giovanni Agnelli in an elegant glass and steel box perched on the roof, as if it were about to take off; it was nicknamed the &quot;Flying bank vault&quot;.

Piano also carried out a large program for revitalization of the old port of Genoa to transform it from a rundown industrial area into a cultural center and tourist attraction. He prolonged streets to give access to the port, transformed old port buildings into cultural and commercial buildings, added a library, an aquarium and an auditorium, a botanical garden in glass dome and a giant multi-armed crane, modeled after the old cranes of the port, which hoists visitors high in the air for a view of the port.

In addition, he designed the new headquarters of his firm, the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (1989–1991), on a series of stepped terraces hanging over the Mediterranean to the west of the city. The building is accessed by an eight-passenger funicular railway car which shuttles up and down the hillside.

===Paris &quot;The Whale&quot; Commercial Mall Bercy 2 (1990)===
&quot;The Whale&quot; Bercy 2 is a shopping mall with 70 stores and 36,000 m2 located in Paris Charenton, along the bankside of the river Seine and the &quot;Périphérique&quot; ring road.

Inaugurated on 24 April 1990, the building is only the third work by the architect after the Centre Pompidou. The cyclopean wooden structure, covered with 27,000 satin stainless steel tiles and pierced with oculus to let an overhead light pass, is completely innovative. Its curvature which follows the turn of a ramp on the ring road evokes a large airship, hence the nicknames &quot;The Zeppelin&quot; or &quot;The Whale&quot;.

==Projects completed 1991–2000==
===Crown Class Cruise Ships (1989–1991)===
In the mid-1980s Sitmar Cruises began a rigorous building schedule for the North American market. At the time one ship the Sitmar Fairmajesty was ordered for French shipyard Chantiers de l&#x27;Atlantique. The Italian government through Fincantieri would desire for the next Sitmar ships to be built in Italy. Piano was commissioned to design the ships. Piano designed the exterior of the ships to resemble a dolphin. The Crown Princess was delivered to Princess Cruises in 1990 and the Regal Princess followed a year later in 1991.

===Kansai International Airport (1991–1994)===
In 1988 Piano and Rice won an international competition for a new airport to be constructed on an artificial island in the port of Osaka, Japan. The main terminal he designed was extremely long (), with a very low profile, so that the controllers in the control tower could always see the aircraft on the runways. The frequent earthquakes in the Japanese islands required special building techniques; the structure is mounted on hydraulic joints which adjust to movements of the earth. The long, curving roof is covered with 82,000 panels of stainless steel, which reflect the sunlight, and is supported by arches long, which give a feeling of openness.

===Fondation Beyeler (1991–1997)===
The Fondation Beyeler is a private art museum in Riehen, near Basel, Switzerland, built for the art collection of Ernst Beyeler. Although it opened in the same year as the Guggenheim Bilbao of Frank Gehry, in spirit it was exactly the opposite. It was designed, at the request of the founder, to inspire tranquility, with white walls, light-colored wooden floors, and natural light. The wall separating the museum from the neighboring road constructed of porphyry stone from Patagonia. also used in different parts of the Museum.

===Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre, Noumea, New Caledonia (1991–1998)===
The Jean-Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre in Nouméa, New Caledonia (1991–1998), is among the most unusual of Piano&#x27;s works. A joint project between New Caledonia and the French government, it is designed to display the culture of the Kanak people. The project uses a combination of traditional and modern material; local wood, along with glass and aluminum. The complex is located on a narrow peninsula in a lagoon with prevailing winds. Piano designed a series of curved wooden screens, from high, to protect the exposition structures, then three &quot;villages&quot; of structures; one for welcome and exhibitions space; one for an auditorium and media center; and one for service functions. The curving wooden pavilions, inspired in form by the local architecture, have a double wooden skin to protect against the weather, but also let in the sunlight. While it is devoted to the local culture, some of the buildings, particularly the towering reception center, with curving walls and wooden spires, are strikingly post-modern in form.

His other projects begun in the 1990s included the New Metropolis Museum in Amsterdam, which later became the science museum and technology NEMO (1992–1997), placed on the edge of the harbor, and resembling the hull of an enormous ship; the Parco della Musica, a complex of music performance halls in Rome (1994–2002), Each was entirely different from the others, and in this period it was difficult to discern a specific element that or style defined his architecture, other than careful craftsmanship and attention to detail.

===Potsdamer Platz, Berlin (1992–2000)===
Potsdamer Platz is a historic triangle in the heart of Berlin Germany, which had been largely destroyed during World War II, and then divided by the Berlin Wall between East and West Berlin. When a major reconstruction was commenced in 1990, Piano was selected to design the new buildings on five of the fifteen sites of the project, with the requirement that the buildings have roofs of copper, and facades of clear glass and materials of a baked earth color. Other architects engaged in the enormous project included Rafael Moneo, Arata Isozaki, and his former partner, Richard Rogers. The centerpiece of Piano&#x27;s part of the project was the Debis building, composed of four different buildings of different sizes but in the same style. Distinctive elements include an atrium high, and a 21-story tower whose east, south and west facades are covered with double walls of glass separated by , which reduced the need for air conditioning and heating. The complex also included an IMAX movie theater, restaurant and shops. The dome of the IMAX theater was visible from a distance and also from the street, through the clear glass of the facade. Piano wrote in &quot;The Disobedience of the Architect&quot; (2004) that he tried to match his architecture to the personality of a city. &quot;The Berliners are accustomed to living outdoors, and to a certain form of conviviality.&quot; The new Potsdamer Platz was designed to capture the Berliner&#x27;s &quot;sense of gaiety, their sense of humor...Why should a city be demoralizing? The beautiful thing about a city is that it is a place of meetings and surprises.&quot;

===Aurora Place, Sydney, Australia (1996–2000)===
Aurora Place in Sydney, Australia (1996–2009) is composed of two towers, an eighteen-story residential building next to a forty-one story office building with different facades but similar metal and glass sunscreens on the roofs. The lower tower was an early example of the luxury high-rise residential buildings by star architects in the center large cities which became very popular in the early 21st century. The office tower has a discreetly peculiar form; the east façade bulges out slightly from its base, reaching its maximum width at the top floors. The curved and twisted shape of east the façade echoes that of the Sydney Opera House on the harbor. The exterior glass curtain-wall extends beyond the main frame, creating an illusion that the wall is independent of the building. of its Glass shutters on the exterior can be opened for ventilation, and Piano designed an exterior skin combining glass and ceramics to regulate the intensity of the sunlight. The office building has interior winter gardens on each floor, and earth-colored ceramic tiles give a dash of color to the facade.

==Projects completed 2001–2009==
===Auditorium Niccolò Paganini (1997–2001)===
The Auditorium Niccolò Paganini is a concert hall constructed inside a former sugar mill in the historic center of the city of Parma, Italy. The theater has 780 seats placed on a slope for maximum visibility of the stage. Piano retained the original exterior walls of the main building, but removed the transversal interior walls and replaced them with glass walls, so the entire interior is visible from the outside, and those inside can see the park outside the theater.

===Maison Hermès (1998–2001)===
The Maison Hermès in the Ginza commercial district of Tokyo is the flagship store in Japan of the French luxury brand. The building is ten stories high, with three floors underground, and includes space for expositions and for a small museum on the history of the firm. The building is highly geometrical; precisely high, with a facade composed of 13,000 pieces of glass each exactly . The panels of glass were made in Florence, Italy, and placed in supports made in Switzerland, for assembly in Japan. Each piece of the facade is designed to be able to move to resist earthquakes. When illuminated a night, the building is intended to resemble a &quot;magic lantern&quot;.

===Auditorium of the Parco della Musica (1994–2002)===
The Parco della Musica is the complex of music venues located in the Rome neighborhood which hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics. The park has three theaters, the largest with 2800 seats; when completed it was the largest symphonic concert hall in Europe. Piano acknowledged that his inspiration for the interior plan was the vineyard style seating, placed around the orchestra, of the Berlin Philharmonic by Hans Sharon. The three brick concert halls covered with what New York Times critic Sam Lubell described as &quot;weathered armadillo-like steel shells,&quot; which looked forbidding in photographs but in person were &quot;lovely&quot;; and noted that the theaters &quot;inside are heavy with wood, fabrics, and typical Piano elegance.&quot; He called the whole complex &quot;deceptively simple but smart.&quot;.

===Nasher Sculpture Center (1999–2003)===
In the first decade of the 21st century, a wave of new art museums or museum wings were built to house the collections of wealthy art patrons. Piano, who had been building art museums since 1977, was one of the most active and creative designers of these new buildings; though the requirements and the collections were often similar, he usually succeeded in giving each museum a distinct look and personality. The Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas, was funded with 60 million dollars by Raymond Nasher, who had made a fortune in developing shopping centers, to display his collection of modern sculpture, which includes works by Auguste Rodin, Joan Miró, Henri Matisse and Alberto Giacometti. The building is very simple in form, like his early Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, and does not distract from the sculptures within; six walls of travertine marble with a glass ceiling that filters the light define five long galleries, while outside a sunken sculpture garden is placed below the street level, away sheltered from noise giving the appearance of an overgrown archeological excavation.

===Zentrum Paul Klee (1999–2005)===
The Zentrum Paul Klee near Bern, Switzerland (1999–2005), continued his series of art museums each very different from the others. It was designed in large part to protect the fragile drawings of Paul Klee from sunlight. It housed in a series galleries resembling rolling hills in the Swiss countryside. Piano explained that the shape of the galleries was inspired by naval architecture and the hulls of ships, which were adapted to the form of waves as his building was adapted to the landscape.

===High Museum of Art Extension (1999–2005)===
The original building of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, designed by Richard Meier, and inspired by the form of the Guggenheim Museum in New York City of Frank Lloyd Wright, opened in 1983. Piano&#x27;s project added four new structures; a pavilion for exhibitions, a gallery for special collections, a building for offices, and a residence hall for the Atlanta College Of Art, creating of additional space. Both the new building and the original building are a gleaming white. A glass bridge with two levels connects the main pavilion with the original part of the museum. The careful management of external light is a particular feature of Piano&#x27;s buildings; the High Museum Extension rows of curving fan-shaped panels on the facade and on the interior ceiling with filter the sunlight. From the parvis on the outside, the white facade gives the impression that the building has no weight at all.

===Morgan Library Renovation and Extension (2000–2006)===
The extension of the Morgan Library in New York City is next to the original library, a monument of Beaux-Arts architecture designed by McKim, Meade and White (1903), which had been expanded several times. Piano extensively renovated the existing structures and a built a new building the same height as the historic building, with a simple rectangular facade that complemented it. He also added a cube as a small exhibit space, an underground auditorium with 199 seats, and a glass-walled atrium which united all the parts, old and new. The architecture critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Nicolai Ouroussoff, wrote, &quot;the result is a space with the weight of history and the lightness of clouds...a sublime expression of the architect&#x27;s preoccupation with light.&quot;

===New York Times Building (2000–2007)===
Piano&#x27;s design for the New York Times Building was chosen after competition whose entrants included projects by Norman Foster, Frank Gehry and Cesar Pelli. The competition rules asked for a building that be as open and transparent as possible, to symbolize the connection between the newspaper and the city. The first six floors are occupied by an atrium with restaurants, shops and a conference center. The distinctive Piano feature of the tower is the clear glass curtain wall outside the facade, and rising higher than the facade itself. The curtain is composed of clear glass and a frame of ceramic tubes suspended from the facade; it serves as a sunscreen, eliminating the need for tinted or sintered glass.

===California Academy of Sciences renovation and extension, San Francisco (2000–2008)===
In 1989, after their old museum buildings were damaged by an earthquake, the trustees of the California Academy of Sciences decided to rebuild their entire complex of twelve buildings, including an aquarium, planetarium, and a museum of Natural History, located in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Piano&#x27;s plan called for &quot;a group of volumes under a single roof, a little like a village.&quot; The roof itself, 1.5 hectares in area, was covered with vegetation, and blends with the surrounding park. The facade of the building also harmonizes smoothly with the nearby turn-of-the-century greenhouse that is a landmark of the Park. Three cupolas resemble shallow hills across the roof, pierced by round portholes to admit natural light; they contain the entry hall, a botanical garden, and a planetarium. Piano&#x27;s design for the new building was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as a &quot;comforting reminder of the civilizing function of great art in a barbaric age&quot;.

===Modern wing of the Art Institute of Chicago (2000–2009)===
In 2000 the City of Chicago launched a major program of cultural buildings in Millennium Park with a new concert hall by Frank Gehry and a new wing of the beaux-arts building Art Institute of Chicago. With its construction of glass, steel and white stone, the new wing is carefully harmonized with the old structure, and, like his other art museums, makes maximum use of natural light. A horizontal sunscreen on the roof, nicknamed the &quot;flying carpet&quot;, is a graceful update of his rooftop art museum on the Lingotto factory in Turin. He also designed a minimalist steel bridge connecting the sculpture terrace of the museum to Millennium Park. Nikolai Ouroussof, critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, noted that some aspects of the building recalled the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who had made much of his career in Chicago. &quot;The taut forms and refined details, the elevation of an industrial aesthetic to an art form all are hallmarks of Mies&#x27;s work.&quot; But he noted particularly Piano&#x27;s masterful control of light within the building: &quot;...it is the light that most people will notice... The glass roof of the top-floor galleries is supported on delicate steel trusses. Rows of white blades rest on top of the trusses to filter out strong southern light; thin fabric panels soften the view from below... On a clear afternoon you can catch faint glimpses through the structural frame of clouds drifting by overhead. But most of the time the art takes center stage, everything else fading quietly into the background It is this obsessive refinement that raises Mr. Piano&#x27;s best architecture to the level of art.&quot;

==Projects completed 2010 to present==
===The Shard, London (2000–2010)===
The Shard, built over the underground station of London Bridge, is sixty-six stories and high, which made it, when completed in 2012, the tallest skyscraper in Europe. Inside, it contains luxury residences and a hotel, along with offices, shops, restaurants, and cultural centers. It has a wide base and a split pinnacle point which seems to disappear into the clouds, like, as Piano described it, &quot;a bell tower of the 16th century, or the mast of great ship...Often buildings of great height are aggressive and arrogant symbols of power and egoism,&quot; but the Shard is designed &quot;to express its sharp and light presence in the urban panorama of London.&quot; Like his other tall buildings, the glass sunscreen on the exterior extends slightly above the building itself, appearing to split apart at the top. The critical reaction to the tower was predictably mixed. Simon Jenkins of the &quot;Guardian&quot; of London saw it as a foreign attack on the traditional London skyline and monuments: &quot;This tower is anarchy. It conforms to no planning policy. It marks no architectural focus or rond-point. It offers no civic forum or function, just luxury flats and hotels. It stands apart from the City cluster and pays no heed to its surrounding context in scale, materials or ground presence. It seems to have lost its way from Dubai to Canary Wharf... The Shard has slashed the face of London for ever.&quot; However, Jonathan Glancy in the London &quot;Telegraph&quot; defended Piano&#x27;s building: &quot;The criticism – hurled against Piano like the spears of Ancient Britons fighting the civilised Romans – is, I think, a bottled up attack on our low standards of design and the beetle-browed politics that have allowed so many poor tall buildings to have been rushed up around St Paul&#x27;s. The Shard, whatever its flaws – and all its many floors – is a much better building than most of the flakes below it.&quot;

===Central Saint Giles, London (2002–2010)===
The Central Saint Giles between St Giles High Street and New Oxford Street in London (2002–2010) is a complex composed of 56 luxury apartments, 53 social rented apartments, and of office around a public square with retail and food outlets, covering . The site was previously occupied by a Ministry of Defence building and is partially on the site of a medieval leper colony, St Giles Hospital. A block 109 flats rises 11 floors and is set alongside offices rising to 11 floors to the east. A distinctive element is strident solid color which is designed not to mellow with time; the buildings are covered with large kiln-fired ceramic panels glazed leaf green, orange, lime green, pale grey and yellow. &quot;Cities should not be dull and repetitive&quot;, Piano declared. &quot;One of the reason we find them so beautiful and interesting is that they are full of surprises; even the idea of color represents a joyful surprise.&quot;

===Los Angeles County Museum of Art (BCAM and Resnick Pavilion), Los Angeles (2003–2010)===
Commissioned to design a &quot;transformation&quot; of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Piano designed a new building, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at LACMA (BCAM) (2008), with of space, as well as the BP Grand Entrance, an entrance pavilion with of space, and the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion (2010). The BCAM facade is concrete covered with plaques of cream-colored Italian travertine, harmonizing with the older buildings of the museum complex, but added distinctive Piano touches; finlike white sun shutters on the roof softening the sunlight, a red escalator on the outside of the main facade, and a stairway suspended by red cables on the other facade, reminiscent of the Centre Pompidou. The Resnik Pavilion, to the north of the BCAM, has of space, with travertine covered walls to the east and west, glass walls on the north and south, and a roof with vertical glass shutters that open to the sky. Describing this project, Piano wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not enough that the light is perfect. You also have a need for calm, serenity, and even a quality of voluptuousness connected with the contemplation of a work of art.&quot; Nicolai Ouroussoff, the architecture critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, admired the interior of the BCAM but was less impressed by the exteriors: &quot;There is little of the formal freedom that is at the heart of the city&#x27;s architectural legacy; nor is there much evidence of the structural refinement that we have come to expect in Mr. Piano&#x27;s best work. The museum&#x27;s monumental travertine form and lipstick-red exterior stairways are a curious mix of pomposity and pop-culture references. It&#x27;s an architecture without conviction.&quot;

===Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo, Norway (2006–2012)===
The Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo, Norway (2006–2012) was designed to revive an old port and industrial area southwest of the center of Oslo with an art museum and offices, and to provide a destination and attraction on the edge of the picturesque fjord. The project has three buildings, two museum buildings and an office building, under a single glass roof, which covers . The construction materials include both steel and wood beams. A canal and walkway connect the museum with another area under development nearby, while the museum and walkway offer views of the fjord and center of Oslo. A sculpture park with works of Anish Kapoor, Louise Bourgeois and other notable sculptors is placed between the museum and the water. The museum building on one side of the canal holds permanent exhibits, while the building on the other side is used for temporary exhibits. A bridge over the canal the two museum buildings. The construction materials include steel, glass and wooden beams, while the facades that are not made of glass are covered with finely-crafted weathered panels, in the tradition of Scandinavian architecture.

===Kimbell Art Museum extension, Fort Worth, Texas (2007–2013)===
The extension of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas (2007–2013) is an addition to the museum designed by Louis Kahn the modernist architect for whom Piano worked at the beginning of his career, completed in 1972. The building faces the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, designed by Tadao Ando (2002). The new gallery occupies , compared with for the Kahn building, and cost 135 million dollars. Piano created a dramatic new entrance for the museum, with huge windows showing the bright red furniture against the alabaster white walls within. The materials used in the new museum included light-colored concrete, to harmonize with the Kahn building, combined with beams and ceilings of Douglas fir, and floors of white oak and an abundance of double-paned and fritted glass. The museum also includes modern ecological features including a vegetal roof, photovoltaic cells on the roof, geothermal wells, and LED lighting. Piano wrote: &quot;Our building echoes the Kahn building through its height, its scale and its general plan, but our building has a character that is more transparent and more open. Light, discreet (half of the surfaces are underground), it nonetheless has its own character and creates a dialogue between the old and the new.&quot; However, the museum also attracted critics, who said it was not ambitious enough. Mark Lamster, architecture critic of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, wrote: &quot;With its almost impossibly smooth walls and squared columns of titanium-treated concrete, Piano&#x27;s front facade evinces a clinical, stoic perfectionism... Altogether, the assembly is a minor miracle of construction. Most impressive are the beams: 100-foot-long bars of laminated Douglas fir, trucked from Canada. But for all its technical mastery, it offers none of the elemental majesty of Kahn&#x27;s building across the lawn. It is deferential to a fault.&quot;

===Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City (2007–2015)===
The Whitney Museum of American Art decided to move from its original building on Madison Avenue, constructed by Marcel Breuer in 1966, to a new location at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington in Manhattan, a neighborhood once occupied by meat packing houses, next to the High Line, a riverside highway and park. The museum, with nine levels, has an asymmetric industrial look to match the architecture of the neighborhood. In addition to its interior galleries, it has of open-air exhibit space on a large terrace atop one section of the building. It was built of steel, concrete, and stone, but also with pine wood and other materials recycled from demolished factories. Jule Iovine, architecture critic of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, called it &quot;a welcoming, creative machine&quot; thanks to its &quot;open, changeable spaces,&quot; and Michael Kimmelman, critic of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;an outdoor perch to see and be seen... There&#x27;s a generosity to the architecture, a sense of art connecting with the city and vice versa&quot;.

===The Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts (2008–2014)===
Beginning in 2008, Piano rebuilt an existing structure to house the Harvard Art Museums, a consolidation of collections of the three art museums associated with Harvard University. The new museum preserved the picturesque brick Ivy-League facade of the 1925 Fogg Museum (1925), but added a new space in the courtyard, covered by a pyramidal glass roof, which increased the gallery space by 40 percent. The renovation adds six levels of galleries, classrooms, lecture halls, and new study areas providing access to parts of the 250,000-piece collection of the museums. The new building was opened in November 2014.

===Valletta City Gate and Parliament House, Malta (2011–2015)===
The &#x27;City Gate&#x27; project in Valletta, Malta was the complete reorganization of the principal entrance to the Maltese capital of Valletta. It included a massive City Gate through the 16th-century city walls, an open-air theatre &#x27;machine&#x27; within the ruins of the former Royal Opera House, and the construction of a new Parliament building. The gate project was controversial, though the old gate it replaced was only built in the 1960s, in the Italian rationalist style. The &quot;theater machine&quot; is particularly unusual; the original idea was that in summertime a steel portable theater with stage and wings and a thousand seats can be installed inside the ruins of the 19th century opera house, which had been destroyed in World War II. It has its own stage equipment and technology for reproducing the acoustics of a traditional opera house. When performances are not taking place, the &quot;machine&quot; was meant to turn back into a public square and gathering place. The Parliament House (2011–2015) is a mixture of modern technique and technology with the massive stone look of the city&#x27;s old walls.

===Centro de Arte Botín, Santander, Spain (2012–2017)===
The &quot;Centro Botín&quot; in Santander, Spain is a private sponsored project by the Fundación Botín whose aim is to be a hub for the promotion of culture both as a museum and as study centre.

The western building hosts the exhibition space of and the eastern is the one dedicated to study which hosts an auditorium, study rooms and other installations. Both are connected by a suspended square and set of stairs and platforms named &quot;pachinko&quot;. This was Piano&#x27;s first project in Spain and had some controversy over its location. Critics describe the building as sublime and striking due to the conjunction of light, views and design that the buildings propose.

===Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, Athens, Greece (2016)===
The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center (SNFCC) in Athens, Greece is one of Piano&#x27;s most dramatic projects. Located next to Falirio Bay at Kalithea, an ancient Greek port, south of central Athens, on a site which served as a parking lot for the 2004 Summer Olympics, it combines the Greek National Library and a new opera house for the Greek National Opera along with the Stavros Niarchos Park, an urban park covering an area of . An artificial hill was created to raise the building and give it a view of the nearby sea. The opera house has a 1400-seat main theater and a smaller &quot;black box&quot; theater of 400 seats. On top of the opera house a square horizontal glass box is placed, called &quot;Pharos (Lighthouse),&quot; similar to the perch of the art museum atop the Lingotto factory in Turin. The entire structure is covered by a single flat roof, which provides shade, and which is covered with of photovoltaic cells, generating 1.5 megawatts of electricity, designed to the building self-sufficient in energy during working hours. The cost of the project was 588 million dollars.

In 2004, he became head of the Renzo Piano Foundation, dedicated to the promotion of the architectural profession. Since June 2008, the headquarters has been co-located with his architectural office at Punta Nave, near Genoa.

After his nomination as Senator for Life in 2013, an honour limited to five office holders in the sole gift of the Italian President, Renzo Piano set up a team of young architects called G124 whose mission is to work on the transformation of Italy&#x27;s major cities&#x27; suburbs. Team members are paid with Renzo Piano senator&#x27;s salary and change every year through a public selection. Projects have been developed in Turin, Milan, Padua, Venice and Rome.

Piano resides in Paris with his second wife Milly and four children, Carlo, Matteo, Lia – from his first wife – and Giorgio.

<doc id="25948" wikidata="Q72277" url="?curid=25948" title="Refraction">
<text>In physics, refraction is the redirection of a wave as it passes from one medium to another. The redirection can be caused by the wave&#x27;s change in speed or by a change in the medium. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but other waves such as sound waves and water waves also experience refraction. How much a wave is refracted is determined by the change in wave speed and the initial direction of wave propagation relative to the direction of change in speed.

Optical prisms and lenses use refraction to redirect light, as does the human eye. The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength of light, and thus the angle of the refraction also varies correspondingly. This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors.
==Law==

For light, refraction follows Snell&#x27;s law, which states that, for a given pair of media, the ratio of the sines of the angle of incidence formula_1 and angle of refraction formula_2 is equal to the ratio of phase velocities formula_3 in the two media, or equivalently, to the refractive indices formula_4 of the two media:

formula_5


== General explanation ==
Refraction involves two related parts, both a result of the wave nature of light: a reduced speed in an optical medium and a change in angle when a wave front crosses between different media at an angle.

# Light slows as it travels through a medium other than vacuum (such as air, glass or water). This is not because of scattering or absorption. Rather it is because, as an electromagnetic oscillation, light itself causes other electrically charged particles such as electrons, to oscillate. The oscillating electrons emit their own electromagnetic waves which interact with the original light. The resulting combined wave has a lower speed. When light returns to a vacuum and there are no electrons nearby, this slowing effect ends and its speed returns to .
# When light enters a slower medium at an angle, one side of the wavefront is slowed before the other. This asymmetrical slowing of the light causes it to change the angle of its travel. Once light is within the new medium with constant properties, it travels in a straight line again.

===Slowing of light===

As described above, the speed of light is slower in a medium other than vacuum. This slowing applies to any medium such as air, water, or glass, and is responsible for phenomena such as refraction. On the other side of the medium its speed will again be the speed of light in vacuum, .

A correct explanation rests on light&#x27;s nature as an electromagnetic wave. Because light is an oscillating electrical/magnetic wave, light traveling in a medium causes the electrically charged electrons of the material to also oscillate. (The material&#x27;s protons also oscillate but as they are around 2000 times more massive, their movement and therefore their effect, is far smaller). A moving electrical charge emits electromagnetic waves of its own. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the oscillating electrons interact with the electromagnetic waves that make up the original light, similar to water waves on a pond, a process known as constructive interference. When two waves interfere in this way, the resulting &quot;combined&quot; wave may have wave packets that pass an observer at a slower rate. The light has effectively been slowed. When the light leaves the material, this interaction with electrons no longer happens, and therefore the wave packet rate (and therefore its speed) return to normal.

===Bending of light===

Consider a wave going from one material to another where its speed is slower as in the figure. If it reaches the interface between the materials at an angle one side of the wave will reach the second material first, and therefore slow down earlier. With one side of the wave going slower the whole wave will pivot towards that side. This is why a wave will bend away from the surface or toward the normal when going into a slower material. In the opposite case of a wave reaching a material where the speed is higher, one side of the wave will speed up and the wave will pivot away from that side.

Another way of understanding the same thing is to consider the change in wavelength at the interface. When the wave goes from one material to another where the wave has a different speed , the frequency of the wave will stay the same, but the distance between wavefronts or wavelength will change. If the speed is decreased, such as in the figure to the right, the wavelength will also decrease. With an angle between the wave fronts and the interface and change in distance between the wave fronts the angle must change over the interface to keep the wave fronts intact. From these considerations the relationship between the angle of incidence , angle of transmission and the wave speeds and in the two materials can be derived. This is the law of refraction or Snell&#x27;s law and can be written as

formula_6

The phenomenon of refraction can in a more fundamental way be derived from the 2 or 3-dimensional wave equation. The boundary condition at the interface will then require the tangential component of the wave vector to be identical on the two sides of the interface. Since the magnitude of the wave vector depend on the wave speed this requires a change in direction of the wave vector.

The relevant wave speed in the discussion above is the phase velocity of the wave. This is typically close to the group velocity which can be seen as the truer speed of a wave, but when they differ it is important to use the phase velocity in all calculations relating to refraction.

A wave traveling perpendicular to a boundary, i.e. having its wavefronts parallel to the boundary, will not change direction even if the speed of the wave changes.

===Dispersion of light===

Refraction is also responsible for rainbows and for the splitting of white light into a rainbow-spectrum as it passes through a glass prism. Glass and water have higher refractive indexes than air. When a beam of white light passes from air into a material having an index of refraction that varies with frequency (and wavelength), a phenomenon known as dispersion occurs, in which different coloured components of the white light are refracted at different angles, i.e., they bend by different amounts at the interface, so that they become separated. The different colors correspond to different frequencies and different wavelengths.

==On water==
Refraction occurs when light goes through a water surface since water has a refractive index of 1.33 and air has a refractive index of about 1. Looking at a straight object, such as a pencil in the figure here, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water&#x27;s surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the eye traces them back as straight lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight (shown as dashed lines) intersect at a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is.

The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the &quot;apparent depth&quot;. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place, and the fisher must aim lower to catch the fish. Conversely, an object above the water has a higher &quot;apparent height&quot; when viewed from below the water. The opposite correction must be made by an archer fish.

For small angles of incidence (measured from the normal, when is approximately the same as ), the ratio of apparent to real depth is the ratio of the refractive indexes of air to that of water. But, as the angle of incidence approaches 90°, the apparent depth approaches zero, albeit reflection increases, which limits observation at high angles of incidence. Conversely, the apparent height approaches infinity as the angle of incidence (from below) increases, but even earlier, as the angle of total internal reflection is approached, albeit the image also fades from view as this limit is approached.

==Atmospheric==

The refractive index of air depends on the air density and thus vary with air temperature and pressure. Since the pressure is lower at higher altitudes, the refractive index is also lower, causing light rays to refract towards the earth surface when traveling long distances through the atmosphere. This shifts the apparent positions of stars slightly when they are close to the horizon and makes the sun visible before it geometrically rises above the horizon during a sunrise.
Temperature variations in the air can also cause refraction of light. This can be seen as a heat haze when hot and cold air is mixed e.g. over a fire, in engine exhaust, or when opening a window on a cold day. This makes objects viewed through the mixed air appear to shimmer or move around randomly as the hot and cold air moves. This effect is also visible from normal variations in air temperature during a sunny day when using high magnification telephoto lenses and is often limiting the image quality in these cases.
 In a similar way, atmospheric turbulence gives rapidly varying distortions in the images of astronomical telescopes limiting the resolution of terrestrial telescopes not using adaptive optics or other techniques for overcoming these atmospheric distortions.
Air temperature variations close to the surface can give rise to other optical phenomena, such as mirages and Fata Morgana. Most commonly, air heated by a hot road on a sunny day deflects light approaching at a shallow angle towards a viewer. This makes the road appear reflecting, giving an illusion of water covering the road.

== In eye care ==
In medicine, particularly optometry, ophthalmology and orthoptics, &quot;refraction&quot; (also known as &quot;refractometry&quot;) is a clinical test in which a phoropter may be used by the appropriate eye care professional to determine the eye&#x27;s refractive error and the best corrective lenses to be prescribed. A series of test lenses in graded optical powers or focal lengths are presented to determine which provides the sharpest, clearest vision.
Refractive surgery is a medical procedure to treat common vision disorders.

==Mechanical waves==

===Water===
Water waves travel slower in shallower water. This can be used to demonstrate refraction in ripple tanks and also explains why waves on a shoreline tend to strike the shore close to a perpendicular angle. As the waves travel from deep water into shallower water near the shore, they are refracted from their original direction of travel to an angle more normal to the shoreline.

===Sound===

In underwater acoustics, refraction is the bending or curving of a sound ray that results when the ray passes through a sound speed gradient from a region of one sound speed to a region of a different speed. The amount of ray bending is dependent on the amount of difference between sound speeds, that is, the variation in temperature, salinity, and pressure of the water.
Similar acoustics effects are also found in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The phenomenon of refraction of sound in the atmosphere has been known for centuries. Beginning in the early 1970s, widespread analysis of this effect came into vogue through the designing of urban highways and noise barriers to address the meteorological effects of bending of sound rays in the lower atmosphere.

<doc id="25949" wikidata="Q7708739" url="?curid=25949" title="Recreational drug use">
<text>Recreational drug use is the use of one or more psychoactive drugs to induce an altered state of consciousness, either for pleasure or for some other casual purpose or pastime. When a psychoactive drug enters the user&#x27;s body, it induces an intoxicating effect. Recreational drugs are commonly divided into three categories: depressants (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calmness), stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness), and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).

In popular practice, recreational drug use is generally tolerated as a social behaviour, rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication. However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world. Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, opiates, and benzodiazepines. What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged 15 to 65 (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.

Common recreational drugs include caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate; alcohol, commonly found in beer, wine, cocktails, and distilled spirits; nicotine, commonly found in tobacco, tobacco-based products, and electronic cigarettes; cannabis and hashish (with legality of possession varying inter/intra-nationally); and the controlled substances listed as controlled drugs in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) of the United Nations (UN). Since the early 2000s, the European Union (EU) has developed several comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategies as part of its drug policy in order to prevent the diffusion of recreational drug use and abuse among the European population and raise public awareness on the adverse effects of drugs among all member states of the European Union, as well as conjoined efforts with European law enforcement agencies, such as Europol and EMCDDA, in order to counter organized crime and illegal drug trade in Europe.

==Reasons for use==

Many researchers have explored the etiology of recreational drug use. Some of the most common theories are: genetics, personality type, psychological problems, self-medication, sex, age, depression, curiosity, boredom, rebelliousness, a sense of belonging to a group, family and attachment issues, history of trauma, failure at school or work, socioeconomic stressors, peer pressure, juvenile delinquency, availability, historical factors, or socio-cultural influences. There has been no consensus on a single cause. Instead, experts tend to apply the biopsychosocial model. Any number of factors may influence an individual&#x27;s drug use, as they are not mutually exclusive. Regardless of genetics, mental health, or traumatic experiences, social factors play a large role in the exposure to and availability of certain types of drugs and patterns of use.

According to addiction researcher Martin A. Plant, some people go through a period of self-redefinition before initiating recreational drug use. They tend to view using drugs as part of a general lifestyle that involves belonging to a subculture that they associate with heightened status and the challenging of social norms. Plant states: &quot;From the user&#x27;s point of view there are many positive reasons to become part of the milieu of drug taking. The reasons for drug use appear to have as much to do with needs for friendship, pleasure and status as they do with unhappiness or poverty. Becoming a drug taker, to many people, is a positive affirmation rather than a negative experience&quot;.

===Evolution===

Anthropological research has suggested that humans &quot;may have evolved to counter-exploit plant neurotoxins&quot;. The ability to use botanical chemicals to serve the function of endogenous neurotransmitters may have improved survival rates, conferring an evolutionary advantage. A typically restrictive prehistoric diet may have emphasized the apparent benefit of consuming psychoactive drugs, which had themselves evolved to imitate neurotransmitters. Chemical–ecological adaptations and the genetics of hepatic enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450, have led researchers to propose that &quot;humans have shared a co-evolutionary relationship with psychotropic plant substances that is millions of years old.&quot;

==Health risks==

The severity of impact and type of risks that come with recreational drug use vary widely with the drug in question and the amount being used. There are many factors in the environment and within the user that interact with each drug differently. Alcohol is sometimes considered one of the most dangerous recreational drugs. Alcoholic drinks, tobacco products and other nicotine-based products (e.g., electronic cigarettes), and cannabis are regarded by various medical professionals as the most common and widespread gateway drugs. In the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the general onset of drinking alcohol, tobacco smoking, cannabis smoking, and consumption of multiple drugs most frequently occurs during adolescence and in middle school and secondary school settings.

Some scientific studies in the early 21st century found that a low to moderate level of alcohol consumption, particularly of red wine, might have substantial health benefits such as decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and cognitive decline. This claim has been disputed, specifically by British researcher David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at the Imperial College London, who stated that studies showing benefits for &quot;moderate&quot; alcohol consumption in &quot;some middle-aged men&quot; lacked controls for the variable of what the subjects were drinking beforehand. Experts in the United Kingdom have suggested that some psychoactive drugs that may be causing less harm to fewer users (although they are also used less frequently in the first place) are cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, and MDMA; however, these drugs have risks and side effects of their own.

===Drug harmfulness===
Drug harmfulness is defined as the degree to which a psychoactive drug has the potential to cause harm to the user and is measured in several ways, such as by addictiveness and the potential for physical harm. More objectively harmful drugs may be colloquially referred to as &quot;hard drugs&quot;, and less harmful drugs as &quot;soft drugs&quot;. The term &quot;soft drug&quot; is considered controversial by critics as it may imply the false belief that soft drugs cause lesser or insignificant harm.

===Responsible use===

Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture, through cartoons explaining responsible drug use and the consequences of irresponsible drug use to users. Another issue is that the illegality of drugs causes social and economic consequences for users—the drugs may be &quot;cut&quot; with adulterants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely—and legalization of drug production and distribution could reduce these and other dangers of illegal drug use.

==Prevention==

In efforts to curtail recreational drug use, governments worldwide introduced several laws prohibiting the possession of almost all varieties of recreational drugs during the 20th century. The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; promoted by the United States, however, is now facing increasing criticism. Evidence is insufficient to tell if behavioral interventions help prevent recreational drug use in children.

One in four adolescents has used an illegal drug, and one in ten of those adolescents who need addiction treatment get some type of care. School-based programs are the most commonly used method for drug use education; however, the success rates of these intervention programs are highly dependent on the commitment of participants and are limited in general.

==Demographics==


===Australia===

Alcohol is the most widely used recreational drug in Australia. 86.2% of Australians aged 12 years and over have consumed alcohol at least once in their lifetime, compared to 34.8% of Australians aged 12 years and over who have used cannabis at least once in their lifetime.

===United States===

From the mid-19th century to the 1930s, American physicians prescribed &quot;Cannabis sativa&quot; as a prescription drug for various medical conditions. In the 1960s, the counterculture movement introduced the use of psychoactive drugs, including cannabis. Young adults and college students reported the recreational prevalence of cannabis, among other drugs, at 20-25% while the cultural mindset of using was open and curious. In 1969, the FBI reported that between the years 1966 and 1968, the number of arrests for marijuana possession, which had been outlawed throughout the United States under Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, had increased by 98%. Despite acknowledgement that drug use was greatly growing among America&#x27;s youth during the late 1960s, surveys have suggested that only as much as 4% of the American population had ever smoked marijuana by 1969. By 1972, however, that number would increase to 12%. That number would then double by 1977.

The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana along with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug, i.e., having the relatively highest abuse potential and no accepted medical use. Most marijuana at that time came from Mexico, but in 1975 the Mexican government agreed to eradicate the crop by spraying it with the herbicide paraquat, raising fears of toxic side effects. Colombia then became the main supplier. The &quot;zero tolerance&quot; climate of the Reagan and Bush administrations (1981–1993) resulted in passage of strict laws and mandatory sentences for possession of marijuana. The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; thus brought with it a shift from reliance on imported supplies to domestic cultivation, particularly in Hawaii and California. Beginning in 1982, the Drug Enforcement Administration turned increased attention to marijuana farms in the United States, and there was a shift to the indoor growing of plants specially developed for small size and high yield. After over a decade of decreasing use, marijuana smoking began an upward trend once more in the early 1990s, especially among teenagers, but by the end of the decade this upswing had leveled off well below former peaks of use.

==Society and culture==


Many movements and organizations are advocating for or against the liberalization of the use of recreational drugs, most notably regarding the legalization of marijuana and cannabinoids for medical and/or recreational use. Subcultures have emerged among users of recreational drugs, as well as alternative lifestyles and social movements among those who abstain from them, such as teetotalism and &quot;straight edge&quot;.

Since the early 2000s, medical professionals have acknowledged and addressed the problem of the increasing consumption of alcoholic drinks and club drugs (such as MDMA, cocaine, rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, PCP, LSD, and methamphetamine) associated with rave culture among adolescents and young adults in the Western world. Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely than young adults to use multiple drugs, and the consumption of club drugs is highly associated with the presence of criminal behaviors and recent alcohol abuse or dependence.

The prevalence of recreational drugs in human societies is widely reflected in fiction, entertainment, and the arts, subject to prevailing laws and social conventions. For instance, in the music industry, the musical genres hip hop, hardcore rap, and trap, alongside their derivative subgenres and subcultures, are most notorious for having continuously celebrated and promoted drug trafficking, gangster lifestyle, and consumption of alcohol and other drugs since their inception in the United States during the late 1980s–early 1990s. In video games, for example, drugs are portrayed in a variety of ways: including power-ups (cocaine gum replenishes stamina in &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;), obstacles to be avoided (such as the Fuzzies in &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot; that distort the player&#x27;s view when accidentally consumed), items to be bought and sold for in-game currency (coke dealing is a big part of &quot;&quot;). In the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game franchise, drugs (&quot;chems&quot; in the game) can fill the role of any above mentioned. Drug trafficking, gang rivalries, and their related criminal underworld also play a big part in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; video game franchise.

==Common recreational drugs==
The following substances are commonly used recreationally:
* Alcohol: Most drinking alcohol is ethanol, . Drinking alcohol creates intoxication, relaxation and lowered inhibitions. It is produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts to create wine, beer, and distilled liquor (e.g., vodka, rum, gin, etc.). In most areas of the world, it is legal for those over a certain age (18 in most countries). It is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and a teratogen. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening.
* Amphetamines: Used recreationally to provide alertness and a sense of energy. Prescribed for ADHD, narcolepsy, depression, and weight loss. A potent central nervous system stimulant, in the 1940s and 50s methamphetamine was used by Axis and Allied troops in World War II, and, later on, other armies, and by Japanese factory workers. It increases muscle strength and fatigue resistance and improves reaction time. Methamphetamine use can be neurotoxic, which means it damages dopamine neurons. As a result of this brain damage, chronic use can lead to post acute withdrawal syndrome.
* Caffeine: Often found in coffee, black tea, energy drinks, some soft drinks (e.g., Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Mountain Dew, among others), and chocolate. It is the world&#x27;s most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but has only mild dependence liability for long-term users.
* Cannabis: Its common forms include marijuana and hashish, which are smoked, vaporized or eaten. It contains at least 85 cannabinoids. The primary psychoactive component is THC, which mimics the neurotransmitter anandamide, named after the Hindu &quot;ananda&quot;, &quot;joy, bliss, delight&quot;. When cannabis is eaten, THC metabolized into 11-OH-THC, this molecule is the primary psychoactive coumpound of edible forms of cannabis. THC and 11-OH-THC are partial agonist at CB1 and CB2 receptors of the endocannabinoid system. 
* Cocaine: It is available as a white powder, which is insufflated (&quot;sniffed&quot; into the nostrils) or converted into a solution with water and injected. A popular derivative, crack cocaine is typically smoked. When transformed into its freebase form, crack, the cocaine vapour may be inhaled directly. This is thought to increase bioavailability, but has also been found to be toxic, due to the production of methylecgonidine during pyrolysis.
* MDMA: Commonly known as ecstasy, it is a common club drug in the rave scene.
* Ketamine: An anesthetic used legally by paramedics and doctors in emergency situations for its dissociative and analgesic qualities and illegally in the club drug scene.
* Lean: A liquid drug mixture made when mixing cough syrup, sweets, soft drinks and codeine. It originated in the 1990s in Houston. Ever since then, this drug usage has grown and is often used at parties and in the trap music scene. Many people would get a drowsy feeling when consuming this drug.
* LSD: A popular ergoline derivative, that was first synthesized in 1938 by Albert Hofmann. However, he failed to notice its psychedelic effects until 1943. It&#x27;s a serotonergic psychedelic (partial agonist at serotonin receptors, particularly the 5-HT2A subtypes) like psilocin, mescaline and DMT. But LSD is unique because it is also a partial agonist of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, particularly the D2R subtypes. LSD (d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide) is a molecule of the lysergamide family, a subclass of the tryptamine family. In the 1950s, it was used in psychological therapy, and, covertly, by the CIA in Project MKULTRA, in which the drug was administered to unwitting US and Canadian citizens. It played a central role in 1960s &#x27;counter-culture&#x27;, and was banned in October 1968 by US President Lyndon B Johnson.
* Nitrous oxide: legally used by dentists as an anxiolytic and anaesthetic, it is also used recreationally by users who obtain it from whipped cream canisters (whippets or whip-its) (see inhalant), as it causes perceptual effects, a &quot;high&quot; and at higher doses, hallucinations.
* Opiates and opioids: Available by prescription for pain relief. Commonly used opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, fentanyl, heroin, methadone, and morphine. Opioids have a high potential for addiction and have the ability to induce severe physical withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of frequent use. Heroin can be smoked, insufflated, or turned into a solution with water and injected. Percocet is a prescription opioid containing oxycodone and acetaminophen. 
* Psilocybin mushrooms: This hallucinogenic drug was an important drug in the psychedelic scene. Until 1963, when it was chemically analysed by Albert Hofmann, it was completely unknown to modern science that &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; (&quot;Liberty Cap&quot;, common throughout Europe) contains psilocybin, a hallucinogen previously identified only in species native to Mexico, Asia, and North America.
* Tobacco: &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;. Nicotine is the key drug contained in tobacco leaves, which are either smoked, chewed or snuffed. It contains nicotine, which crosses the blood–brain barrier in 10–20 seconds. It mimics the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain and the neuromuscular junction. The neuronal forms of the receptor are present both post-synaptically (involved in classical neurotransmission) and pre-synaptically, where they can influence the release of multiple neurotransmitters.
* Tranquilizers: barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g. alprazolam, diazepam, etc.)(commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders; known to cause dementia and post acute withdrawal syndrome)
* &quot;Bath salts&quot;: slang term that generally refers to substituted cathinones such as Mephedrone and Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), but not always
* DMT – primary ingredient in ayahuasca, can also be smoked (inhalation causes a brief effect lasting usually 5 to 15 minutes).
* Peyote: This hallucinogen contains mescaline, native to southwestern Texas and Mexico. Echinopsis pachanoi is a faster growing cactus containing mescaline. It is one of the few narcotics legally available in the United States for religious purposes by the Native American Church.
* Salvia divinorum: This hallucinogenic Mexican herb in the mint family; not considered recreational, most likely due to the nature of the hallucinations (legal in some jurisdictions)
* Synthetic cannabis: &quot;Spice&quot;, &quot;K2&quot;, JWH-018, AM-2201
* Quaaludes: A popular club drug in the 1970s. No longer prescribed or manufactured in many countries but remains popular in South Africa.

==Routes of administration==

Drugs are often associated with a particular route of administration. Many drugs can be consumed in more than one way. For example, marijuana can be swallowed like food or smoked, and cocaine can be &quot;sniffed&quot; in the nostrils, injected, or, with various modifications, smoked.

* inhalation: all intoxicative inhalants (see below) that are gases or solvent vapours that are inhaled through the trachea, as the name suggests
* insufflation: also known as &quot;snorting&quot;, or &quot;sniffing&quot;, this method involves the user placing a powder in the nostrils and breathing in through the nose, so that the drug is absorbed by the mucous membranes. Drugs that are &quot;snorted&quot;, or &quot;sniffed&quot;, include powdered amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, ketamine, MDMA, and snuff tobacco.
* Subcutaneous injection (see also the article Skin popping): injection of drug into the third lowest layer of skin.
* Intramuscular injection: injection of drug into a muscle.
* intravenous injection (see also the article Drug injection): the user injects a solution of water and the drug into a vein, or less commonly, into the tissue. Drugs that are injected include morphine and heroin, less commonly other opioids. Stimulants like cocaine or methamphetamine may also be injected. In rare cases, users inject other drugs.
* oral intake: caffeine, ethanol, cannabis edibles, psilocybin mushrooms, coca tea, poppy tea, laudanum, GHB, ecstasy pills with MDMA or various other substances (mainly stimulants and psychedelics), prescription and over-the-counter drugs (ADHD and narcolepsy medications, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, sedatives, cough suppressants, morphine, codeine, opioids and others)
* sublingual: substances diffuse into the blood through tissues under the tongue. Many psychoactive drugs can be or have been specifically designed for sublingual administration, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics with poor gastrointestinal bioavailability, LSD blotters, coca leaves, some hallucinogens. This route of administration is activated when chewing some forms of smokeless tobacco (e.g. dipping tobacco, snus).
* intrarectal: administering into the rectum, most water-soluble drugs can be used this way.
* smoking (see also the section below): tobacco, cannabis, opium, crystal meth, phencyclidine, crack cocaine, and heroin (diamorphine as freebase) known as chasing the dragon.
* transdermal patches with prescription drugs: e.g. methylphenidate (&quot;Daytrana&quot;) and fentanyl.

Many drugs are taken through various routes. Intravenous route is the most efficient, but also one of the most dangerous. Nasal, rectal, inhalation and smoking are safer. The oral route is one of the safest and most comfortable, but of little bioavailability.

==Types==
===Depressants===

Depressants are psychoactive drugs that temporarily diminish the function or activity of a specific part of the body or mind. Colloquially, depressants are known as &quot;downers&quot;, and users generally take them to feel more relaxed and less tense. Examples of these kinds of effects may include anxiolysis, sedation, and hypotension. Depressants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines and as illicit substances. When these are used, effects may include anxiolysis (reduction of anxiety), analgesia (pain relief), sedation, somnolence, cognitive/memory impairment, dissociation, muscle relaxation, lowered blood pressure/heart rate, respiratory depression, anesthesia, and anticonvulsant effects. Depressants exert their effects through a number of different pharmacological mechanisms, the most prominent of which include potentiation of GABA or opioid activity, and inhibition of adrenergic, histamine or acetylcholine activity. Some are also capable of inducing feelings of euphoria. The most widely used depressant by far is alcohol (i.e. ethanol).

Stimulants or &quot;uppers&quot;, such as amphetamines or cocaine, which increase mental or physical function, have an opposite effect to depressants.

Depressants, in particular alcohol, can precipitate psychosis. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Murrie et al. found that the rate of transition from opioid, alcohol and sedative induced psychosis to schizophrenia was 12%, 10% and 9% respectively.

====Antihistamines====

Antihistamines (or &quot;histamine antagonists&quot;) inhibit the release or action of histamine. &quot;Antihistamine&quot; can be used to describe any histamine antagonist, but the term is usually reserved for the classical antihistamines that act upon the H1 histamine receptor. Antihistamines are used as treatment for allergies. Allergies are caused by an excessive response of the body to allergens, such as the pollen released by grasses and trees. An allergic reaction causes release of histamine by the body. Other uses of antihistamines are to help with normal symptoms of insect stings even if there is no allergic reaction. Their recreational appeal exists mainly due to their anticholinergic properties, that induce anxiolysis and, in some cases such as diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and orphenadrine, a characteristic euphoria at moderate doses. High dosages taken to induce recreational drug effects may lead to overdoses. Antihistamines are also consumed in combination with alcohol, particularly by youth who find it hard to obtain alcohol. The combination of the two drugs can cause intoxication with lower alcohol doses.

Hallucinations and possibly delirium resembling the effects of Datura stramonium can result if the drug is taken in much higher than therapeutic doses. Antihistamines are widely available over the counter at drug stores (without a prescription), in the form of allergy medication and some cough medicines. They are sometimes used in combination with other substances such as alcohol.
The most common unsupervised use of antihistamines in terms of volume and percentage of the total is perhaps in parallel to the medicinal use of some antihistamines to extend and intensify the effects of opioids and depressants. The most commonly used are hydroxyzine, mainly to extend a supply of other drugs, as in medical use, and the above-mentioned ethanolamine and alkylamine-class first-generation antihistamines, which are – once again as in the 1950s – the subject of medical research into their anti-depressant properties.

For all of the above reasons, the use of medicinal scopolamine for recreational uses is also observed.

====Analgesics====

Analgesics (also known as &quot;painkillers&quot;) are used to relieve pain (achieve ). The word &quot;analgesic&quot; derives from Greek &quot;αν-&quot; (&quot;an-&quot;, &quot;without&quot;) and &quot;άλγος&quot; (&quot;álgos&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;). Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems; they include paracetamol (also known in the US as acetaminophen), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the salicylates (e.g. aspirin), and opioid drugs such as hydrocodone, codeine, heroin and oxycodone. Some further examples of the brand name prescription opiates and opioid analgesics that may be used recreationally include Vicodin, Lortab, Norco (hydrocodone), Avinza, Kapanol (morphine), Opana, Paramorphan (oxymorphone), Dilaudid, Palladone (hydromorphone), and OxyContin (oxycodone).

====Tranquilizers====

The following are examples of tranquilizers (GABAergics):
* Barbiturates
* Benzodiazepines
* Ethanol (drinking alcohol; ethyl alcohol)
* Nonbenzodiazepines
* Others
** carisoprodol (Soma)
** chloral hydrate
** diethyl ether
** ethchlorvynol (Placidyl; &quot;jelly-bellies&quot;)
** gamma-butyrolactone (GBL, a prodrug to GHB)
** gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; G; Xyrem; &quot;Liquid Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;)
** glutethimide (Doriden)
** kava (from &quot;Piper methysticum&quot;; contains kavalactones)
** ketamine, a phencyclidine (PCP) analog
** meprobamate (Miltown)
** methaqualone (Sopor, Mandrax; &quot;Quaaludes&quot;)
** phenibut
** propofol (Diprivan), a general anesthetic
** theanine (found in &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, the tea plant)
** valerian (from &quot;Valeriana officinalis&quot;)

===Stimulants===
Stimulants, also known as &quot;psychostimulants&quot;, induce euphoria with improvements in mental and physical function, such as enhanced alertness, wakefulness, and locomotion. Stimulants are also occasionally called &quot;uppers&quot;. Depressants or &quot;downers&quot;, which decrease mental or physical function, are in stark contrast to stimulants and are considered to be their functional opposites.

Stimulants enhance the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Common effects may include increased alertness, awareness, wakefulness, endurance, productivity, and motivation, arousal, locomotion, heart rate, and blood pressure, and a diminished desire for food and sleep.

Use of stimulants may cause the body to significantly reduce its production of endogenous compounds that fulfill similar functions. Once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and dysphoric. This is colloquially termed a &quot;crash&quot; and may promote reuse of the stimulant.

Amphetamines are a significant cause of drug-induced psychosis. Importantly, a 2019 meta-analysis found that 22% of people with amphetamine-induced psychosis transition to a later diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Examples of stimulants include:
* Sympathomimetics (catecholaminergics)—e.g. amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, methylphenidate, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine
* Entactogens (serotonergics, primarily phenethylamines)—e.g. MDMA (which is also an amphetamine)
* Eugeroics, e.g. modafinil
* Others
** arecoline (found in &quot;Areca catechu&quot;)
** caffeine (found in &quot;Coffea spp.&quot;)
** nicotine (found in &quot;Nicotiana spp.&quot;)
** rauwolscine (found in &quot;Rauvolfia serpentina&quot;)
** yohimbine (Procomil; a tryptamine alkaloid found in &quot;Pausinystalia johimbe&quot;)

===Euphoriants===

* Alcohol: &quot;Euphoria, the feeling of well-being, has been reported during the early (10–15 min) phase of alcohol consumption&quot; (e.g., beer, wine or spirits)
* Cannabis: Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive ingredient in this plant, can have sedative and euphoric properties.
* Catnip: Catnip contains a sedative known as nepetalactone that activates opioid receptors. In cats it elicits sniffing, licking, chewing, head shaking, rolling, and rubbing which are indicators of pleasure. In humans, however, catnip does not act as a euphoriant.
* Stimulants: &quot;Psychomotor stimulants produce locomotor activity (the subject becomes hyperactive), euphoria, (often expressed by excessive talking and garrulous behaviour), and anorexia. The amphetamines are the best known drugs in this category...&quot;
* MDMA: The &quot;euphoriant drugs such as MDMA (&#x27;ecstasy&#x27;) and MDEA (&#x27;eve&#x27;)&quot; are popular among young adults. MDMA &quot;users experience short-term feelings of euphoria, rushes of energy and increased tactility&quot; as well as interpersonal connectedness.
* Opium: This &quot;drug derived from the unripe seed-pods of the opium poppy…produces drowsiness and euphoria and reduces pain. Morphine and codeine are opium derivatives.&quot; Opioids have led to many deaths in the United States, particularly by causing respiratory depression.

===Hallucinogens===
Hallucinogens can be divided into three broad categories: psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. They can cause subjective changes in perception, thought, emotion and consciousness. Unlike other psychoactive drugs such as stimulants and opioids, hallucinogens do not merely amplify familiar states of mind but also induce experiences that differ from those of ordinary consciousness, often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, conversion experiences, and dreams.

Psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants have a long worldwide history of use within medicinal and religious traditions. They are used in shamanic forms of ritual healing and divination, in initiation rites, and in the religious rituals of syncretistic movements such as União do Vegetal, Santo Daime, Temple of the True Inner Light, and the Native American Church. When used in religious practice, psychedelic drugs, as well as other substances like tobacco, are referred to as entheogens.

Hallucinogen-induced psychosis occurs when psychosis persists despite no longer being intoxicated with the drug. It is estimated that 26% of people with hallucinogen-induced psychosis will transition to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This percentage is less than the psychosis transition rate for cannabis (34%) but higher than that of amphetamines (22%).

Starting in the mid-20th century, psychedelic drugs have been the object of extensive attention in the Western world. They have been and are being explored as potential therapeutic agents in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, alcoholism, and opioid addiction. Yet the most popular, and at the same time most stigmatized, use of psychedelics in Western culture has been associated with the search for direct religious experience, enhanced creativity, personal development, and &quot;mind expansion&quot;. The use of psychedelic drugs was a major element of the 1960s counterculture, where it became associated with various social movements and a general atmosphere of rebellion and strife between generations.

===Inhalants===

Inhalants are gases, aerosols, or solvents that are breathed in and absorbed through the lungs. While some &quot;inhalant&quot; drugs are used for medical purposes, as in the case of nitrous oxide, a dental anesthetic, inhalants are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled, including organic solvents (found in cleaning products, fast-drying glues, and nail polish removers), fuels (gasoline (petrol) and kerosene), and propellant gases such as Freon and compressed hydrofluorocarbons that are used in aerosol cans such as hairspray, whipped cream, and non-stick cooking spray. A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly, such as anesthetics (ether and nitrous oxide) and volatile anti-angina drugs (alkyl nitrites, more commonly known as &quot;poppers&quot;).

The most serious inhalant abuse occurs among children and teens who &quot;[...] live on the streets completely without family ties&quot;. Inhalant users inhale vapor or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from a solvent-soaked rag or an open container. The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dosage. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases, or due to other chemicals used in the products inhaled. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. Computer cleaning dusters are dangerous to inhale, because the gases expand and cool rapidly upon being sprayed. In many cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, or aspiration of vomit.

Examples include:
* Chloroform
* Ethyl chloride
* Diethyl ether
* Ethane and ethylene
* Laughing gas (nitrous oxide)
* Poppers (alkyl nitrites)
* Solvents and propellants (including propane, butane, freon, gasoline, kerosene, toluene) along with the fumes of glues containing them

<text>Robert Lee Frost (March26, 1874January29, 1963) was an American poet. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech, Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early 20th century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes. 

Frequently honored during his lifetime, Frost is the only poet to receive four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He became one of America&#x27;s rare &quot;public literary figures, almost an artistic institution&quot;. Frost was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 and in 1961 was named poet laureate of Vermont. Randall Jarrell wrote: &quot;Robert Frost, along with Stevens and Eliot, seems to me the greatest of the American poets of this century. Frost&#x27;s virtues are extraordinary. No other living poet has written so well about the actions of ordinary men; his wonderful dramatic monologues or dramatic scenes come out of a knowledge of people that few poets have had, and they are written in a verse that uses, sometimes with absolute mastery, the rhythms of actual speech&quot;. In his 1939 essay &quot;The Figure a Poem Makes&quot;, Frost explains his poetics:No tears in the writer, no tears in the reader. No surprise for the writer, no surprise for the reader. For me the initial delight is in the surprise of remembering something I didn&#x27;t know I knew...[Poetry] must be a revelation, or a series of revelations, for the poet as for the reader. For it to be that there must have been the greatest freedom of the material to move about in it and to establish relations in it regardless of time and space, previous relation, and everything but affinity.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Robert Frost was born in San Francisco to journalist William Prescott Frost Jr. and Isabelle Moodie. His father was a descendant of Nicholas Frost of Tiverton, Devon, England, who had sailed to New Hampshire in 1634 on the &quot;Wolfrana&quot;, and his mother was a Scottish immigrant.

Frost was also a descendant of Samuel Appleton, one of the early English settlers of Ipswich, Massachusetts, and Rev. George Phillips, one of the early English settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts.

Frost&#x27;s father was a teacher and later an editor of the &quot;San Francisco Evening Bulletin&quot; (which later merged with the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;), and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector. After his death on May 5, 1885, the family moved across the country to Lawrence, Massachusetts, under the patronage of Robert&#x27;s grandfather William Frost Sr., who was an overseer at a New England mill. Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892, where he published his first poem in the high school magazine, served as class poet and, with his future wife Elinor White, was co-valedictorian. Frost&#x27;s mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it, but he left it as an adult. 

Although known for his later association with rural life, Frost grew up in the city. He attended Dartmouth College for two months, long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs, helping his mother teach her class of unruly boys, delivering newspapers and working in a factory maintaining carbon arc lamps. He said that he did not enjoy these jobs, feeling that his true calling was to write poetry.

===Adult years===

In 1894, he sold his first poem, &quot;My Butterfly. An Elegy&quot; (published in the November 8, 1894, edition of &quot;The Independent&quot; of New York) for $15 ($ today). Proud of his accomplishment, he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White, but she demurred, wanting to finish college at St. Lawrence University before they married. Frost then went on an excursion to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia and asked Elinor again upon his return. Having graduated, she agreed, and they were married in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on December 19, 1895.

Frost attended Harvard University from 1897 to 1899, but he left voluntarily due to illness. Shortly before his death, Frost&#x27;s grandfather purchased a farm for Robert and Elinor in Derry, New Hampshire; Frost worked the farm for nine years while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous. Ultimately his farming proved unsuccessful and he returned to the field of education as an English teacher at New Hampshire&#x27;s Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911, then at the New Hampshire Normal School (now Plymouth State University) in Plymouth, New Hampshire.

In 1912, Frost sailed with his family to Great Britain, settling first in Beaconsfield, a small town in Buckinghamshire outside London. His first book of poetry, &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Will&quot;, was published the next year. In England he made some important acquaintances, including Edward Thomas (a member of the group known as the Dymock poets and Frost&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;), T. E. Hulme and Ezra Pound. Although Pound would become the first American to write a favorable review of Frost&#x27;s work, Frost later resented Pound&#x27;s attempts to manipulate his American prosody. Frost met or befriended many contemporary poets in England, especially after his first two poetry volumes were published in London in 1913 (&quot;A Boy&#x27;s Will&quot;) and 1914 (&quot;North of Boston&quot;).

In 1915, during World War I, Frost returned to America, where Holt&#x27;s American edition of &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Will&quot; had recently been published, and bought a farm in Franconia, New Hampshire, where he launched a career of writing, teaching and lecturing. This family homestead served as the Frosts&#x27; summer home until 1938. It is maintained today as The Frost Place, a museum and poetry conference site. He was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard in 1916. During the years 1917–20, 1923–25, and, on a more informal basis, 1926–1938, Frost taught English at Amherst College in Massachusetts, notably encouraging his students to account for the myriad sounds and intonations of the spoken English language in their writing. He called his colloquial approach to language &quot;the sound of sense&quot;.

He won the first of four Pulitzer Prizes for &quot;New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes&quot; (1923). He would win Pulitzers for &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1930), &quot;A Further Range&quot; (1936) and &quot;A Witness Tree&quot; (1942).

From 1921 to 1962, Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the Bread Loaf School of English of Middlebury College, at its mountain campus at Ripton, Vermont. He is credited with being a major influence upon the development of the school and its writing programs. The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead, a National Historic Landmark, near the Bread Loaf campus. In 1921, Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he resided until 1927, when he returned to teach at Amherst. While teaching at the University of Michigan, he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the university as a Fellow in Letters. The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home was purchased by The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan and relocated to the museum&#x27;s Greenfield Village site for public tours. Throughout the 1920s, Frost also lived in his colonial-era house in Shaftsbury, Vermont. In 2002, the house was opened to the public as the Robert Frost Stone House Museum and was given to Bennington College in 2017.

In 1934, Frost began to spend winter months in Florida. In March 1935, he gave a talk at the University of Miami. In 1940, he bought a plot in South Miami, Florida, naming it &quot;Pencil Pines&quot;; he spent his winters there for the rest of his life. In her memoir about Frost&#x27;s time in Florida, Helen Muir writes, &quot;Frost had called his five acres &quot;Pencil Pines&quot; because he said he had never made a penny from anything that did not involve the use of a pencil.&quot; His properties also included a house on Brewster Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Frost was 86 when he performed a reading at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy on January 20, 1961. He began by attempting to read his poem &quot;Dedication&quot;, which he had composed for the occasion, but due to the brightness of the sunlight he was unable to see the text, so he recited &quot;The Gift Outright&quot; from memory instead. In the summer of 1962, Frost accompanied Interior Secretary Stewart Udall on a visit to the Soviet Union in hopes of meeting Nikita Khrushchev to lobby for peaceful relations between the two Cold War powers.

In the early hours of January 29, 1963, Frost died at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, at the age of 88. He was buried in the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont. His epitaph, from the last line of his poem &quot;The Lesson for Today&quot; (1942), is: &quot;I had a lover&#x27;s quarrel with the world.&quot;

===Personal life===

Frost&#x27;s personal life was plagued by grief and loss. In 1885, when he was 11, his father died of tuberculosis, leaving the family with just eight dollars. Frost&#x27;s mother died of cancer in 1900. In 1920, he had to commit his younger sister Jeanie to a mental hospital, where she died nine years later. Mental illness apparently ran in Frost&#x27;s family, as both he and his mother suffered from depression, and his daughter Irma was committed to a mental hospital in 1947. Frost&#x27;s wife, Elinor, also experienced bouts of depression.

Elinor and Robert Frost had six children: son Elliott (1896–1900, died of cholera); daughter Lesley Frost Ballantine (1899–1983); son Carol (1902–1940); daughter Irma (1903–1967); daughter Marjorie (1905–1934, died as a result of puerperal fever after childbirth); and daughter Elinor Bettina (died just one day after her birth in 1907). Only Lesley and Irma outlived their father. Frost&#x27;s wife, who had heart problems throughout her life, developed breast cancer in 1937 and died of heart failure in 1938.

===Style and critical reception===
Critic Harold Bloom argued that Frost was one of &quot;the major American poets&quot;.

Randall Jarrell&#x27;s influential essays on Frost include &quot;Robert Frost&#x27;s &#x27;Home Burial (1962), an extended close reading of that particular poem, and &quot;To The Laodiceans&quot;, (1952) in which Jarrell defended Frost against critics who had accused Frost of being too &quot;traditional&quot; and out of touch with Modern or Modernist poetry. Jarrell wrote &quot;the regular ways of looking at Frost&#x27;s poetry are grotesque simplifications, distortions, falsifications—coming to know his poetry well ought to be enough, in itself, to dispel any of them, and to make plain the necessity of finding some other way of talking about his work.&quot; Jarrell&#x27;s close readings of poems like &quot;Neither Out Too Far Nor In Too Deep&quot; led readers and critics to perceive more of the complexities in Frost&#x27;s poetry.

Brad Leithauser notes that &quot;the &#x27;other&#x27; Frost that Jarrell discerned behind the genial, homespun New England rustic—the &#x27;dark&#x27; Frost who was desperate, frightened, and brave—has become the Frost we&#x27;ve all learned to recognize, and the little-known poems Jarrell singled out as central to the Frost canon are now to be found in most anthologies&quot;. Jarrell lists a selection of the Frost poems he considers the most masterful, including &quot;The Witch of Coös&quot;, &quot;Home Burial&quot;, &quot;A Servant to Servants&quot;, &quot;Directive&quot;, &quot;Neither Out Too Far Nor In Too Deep&quot;, &quot;Provide, Provide&quot;, &quot;Acquainted with the Night&quot;, &quot;After Apple Picking&quot;, &quot;Mending Wall&quot;, &quot;The Most of It&quot;, &quot;An Old Man&#x27;s Winter Night&quot;, &quot;To Earthward&quot;, &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;, &quot;Spring Pools&quot;, &quot;The Lovely Shall Be Choosers&quot;, &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Desert Places&quot;.

In 2003, the critic Charles McGrath noted that critical views on Frost&#x27;s poetry have changed over the years (as has his public image). In &quot;The Vicissitudes of Literary Reputation,&quot; McGrath wrote, &quot;Robert Frost ... at the time of his death in 1963 was generally considered to be a New England folkie ... In 1977, the third volume of Lawrance Thompson&#x27;s biography suggested that Frost was a much nastier piece of work than anyone had imagined; a few years later, thanks to the reappraisal of critics like William H. Pritchard and Harold Bloom and of younger poets like Joseph Brodsky, he bounced back again, this time as a bleak and unforgiving modernist.&quot;

In &quot;The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry&quot;, editors Richard Ellmann and Robert O&#x27;Clair compared and contrasted Frost&#x27;s unique style to the work of the poet Edwin Arlington Robinson since they both frequently used New England settings for their poems. However, they state that Frost&#x27;s poetry was &quot;less [consciously] literary&quot; and that this was possibly due to the influence of English and Irish writers like Thomas Hardy and W. B. Yeats. They note that Frost&#x27;s poems &quot;show a successful striving for utter colloquialism&quot; and always try to remain down to earth, while at the same time using traditional forms, despite the trend of American poetry towards free verse, which Frost famously said was &quot;&#x27;like playing tennis without a net.&#x27;&quot;

The Poetry Foundation makes the same point, placing Frost&#x27;s work &quot;at the crossroads of nineteenth-century American poetry [with regard to his use of traditional forms] and modernism [with his use of idiomatic language and ordinary, everyday subject matter].&quot; They also note that Frost believed that &quot;the self-imposed restrictions of meter in form&quot; was more helpful than harmful because he could focus on the content of his poems instead of concerning himself with creating &quot;innovative&quot; new verse forms.

An earlier study by the poet James Radcliffe Squires spoke to the distinction of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves. &quot;He has written at a time when the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century ... Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others ... But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution ... Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us. Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better than most of us. That is to say, as a poet must.&quot;

The classicist Helen H. Bacon has proposed that Frost&#x27;s deep knowledge of Greek and Roman classics influenced much of his work. Frost&#x27;s education at Lawrence High School, Dartmouth, and Harvard &quot;was based mainly on the classics&quot;. As examples, she links imagery and action in Frost&#x27;s early poems &quot;Birches&quot; (1915) and &quot;Wild Grapes&quot; (1920) with Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot;. She cites certain motifs, including that of the tree bent down to earth, as evidence of his &quot;very attentive reading of &quot;Bacchae&quot;, almost certainly in Greek&quot;. Bacon compares the poetic techniques used by Frost in &quot;One More Brevity&quot; (1953) to those of Virgil in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. She notes that &quot;this sampling of the ways Frost drew on the literature and concepts of the Greek and Roman world at every stage of his life indicates how imbued with it he was&quot;.

===Themes===
In &quot;Contemporary Literary Criticism&quot;, the editors state that &quot;Frost&#x27;s best work explores fundamental questions of existence, depicting with chilling starkness the loneliness of the individual in an indifferent universe.&quot; The critic T. K. Whipple focused on this bleakness in Frost&#x27;s work, stating that &quot;in much of his work, particularly in &quot;North of Boston&quot;, his harshest book, he emphasizes the dark background of life in rural New England, with its degeneration often sinking into total madness.&quot;

In sharp contrast, the founding publisher and editor of &quot;Poetry&quot;, Harriet Monroe, emphasized the folksy New England persona and characters in Frost&#x27;s work, writing that &quot;perhaps no other poet in our history has put the best of the Yankee spirit into a book so completely.&quot; She notes his frequent use of rural settings and farm life, and she likes that in these poems, Frost is most interested in &quot;showing the human reaction to nature&#x27;s processes.&quot; She also notes that while Frost&#x27;s narrative, character-based poems are often satirical, Frost always has a &quot;sympathetic humor&quot; towards his subjects.

==Awards and recognition==
Frost was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature 31 times.

Harvard&#x27;s 1965 alumni directory notes that Frost received an honorary degree there. Although he never graduated from college, Frost received over 40 honorary degrees, including from Princeton, Oxford and Cambridge universities, and became the only person to have received two honorary degrees from Dartmouth College. During his lifetime, the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax, Virginia, the Robert L. Frost School in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and the main library of Amherst College were named after him.

In 1960, Frost was awarded a United States Congressional Gold Medal, &quot;In recognition of his poetry, which has enriched the culture of the United States and the philosophy of the world&quot;; it was formally bestowed on him by John F. Kennedy in March 1962. Also in 1962, he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contribution to the arts by the MacDowell Colony. 

In June 1922, the Vermont State League of Women&#x27;s Clubs elected Frost as Poet Laureate of Vermont. When a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial strongly criticized the decision of the Women&#x27;s Clubs, Sarah Cleghorn and other women wrote to the newspaper defending Frost. Frost was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1931 and the American Philosophical Society in 1937. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named Poet Laureate of Vermont by the state legislature through Joint Resolution R-59 of the Acts of 1961, which also created the position. Frost won the 1963 Bollingen Prize.

==Legacy and cultural influence==

* Robert Frost Hall is an academic building at Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, New Hampshire.
* In the early morning of November 23, 1963, Westinghouse Broadcasting&#x27;s Sid Davis reported the arrival of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s casket at the White House. Since Frost was one of the President&#x27;s favorite poets, Davis concluded his report with a passage from &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;, but was overcome with emotion as he signed off.
* Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), the first Prime Minister of India, had kept a book of Robert Frost&#x27;s close to him towards his later years, even at his bedside table as he lay dying.
* The poem &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; is featured in both the 1967 novel &quot;The Outsiders&quot; by S. E. Hinton and the 1983 film adaptation, first recited aloud by the character Ponyboy to his friend Johnny. In a subsequent scene Johnny quotes a stanza from the poem back to Ponyboy by means of a letter which was read after he passes away.
* His poem &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; influenced the title and other aspects of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;.
* &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; is the name of the debut studio album by American pop-punk band New Found Glory, released on October 19, 1999.
* At the funeral of former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, on October 3, 2000, his eldest son Justin rephrased the last stanza of the poem &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; in his eulogy: &quot;The woods are lovely, dark and deep. He has kept his promises and earned his sleep.&quot;
* A &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strip published on October 20, 2002, originally featured the titular character reciting &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;. However, this was replaced in book collections and online edition, likely due to the poem being still under copyright when the comic ran (the poem has since lapsed into public domain, in 2019).
* The poem &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; is the epigraph of Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s 2007 book, &quot;Eclipse&quot;, of the &quot;Twilight&quot; Saga. It is also read by Kristen Stewart&#x27;s character, Bella Swan, at the beginning of the 2010 &quot;Eclipse&quot; film.
* &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; is referenced in First Aid Kit&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Stay Gold&quot;: &quot;But just as the moon it shall stray / So dawn goes down today / No gold can stay / No gold can stay.&quot;
* &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot; (February 4, 2015) is the title given to the tenth episode of the seventh season of &quot;The Mentalist&quot; in which a character is killed.
* The character of Baron Quinn recites &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; in an episode of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Into the Badlands&quot;.
* Verses of &quot;Fire and Ice&quot; are referenced and recited throughout the 2017 episodic video game &quot;Life Is Strange: Before the Storm&quot;.
* The line &quot;Nothing gold can stay&quot; is featured in the 2018 single &quot;Venice Bitch&quot; by American singer Lana Del Rey. Del Rey also previously used this line in her 2015 single &quot;Music to Watch Boys To&quot;.

One of the original collections of Frost materials, which he personally helped compile, is held in the Special Collections department of the Jones Library in Amherst, Massachusetts. The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, correspondence, photographs, and audio and visual recordings. The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds a small collection of his papers. The University of Michigan Library holds the Robert Frost Family Collection of manuscripts, photographs, printed items, and artwork. The most significant collection of Frost&#x27;s working manuscripts is held by Dartmouth.

<text>A rotary dial is a component of a telephone or a telephone switchboard that implements a signaling technology in telecommunications known as pulse dialing. It is used when initiating a telephone call to transmit the destination telephone number to a telephone exchange.

On the rotary dial, the digits are arranged in a circular layout, with one finger hole in the finger wheel for each digit. For dialing a digit, the wheel is rotated against spring tension with one finger positioned in the corresponding hole, pulling the wheel with the finger to a stop position given by a mechanical barrier, the finger stop. When released at the finger stop, the wheel returns to its home position driven by the spring at a speed regulated by a governor device. During this return rotation, an electrical switch interrupts the direct current (DC) of the telephone line (local loop) the specific number of times associated with each digit and thereby generates electrical pulses which the telephone exchange decodes into each dialed digit. Thus, each of the ten digits is encoded in sequences to correspond to the number of pulses; thus, the method is sometimes called &quot;decadic dialing&quot;. Pulse count dialing is a digital addressing system which uses decimal pulse count modulation. The typical average baud rate is 10 bits per second, though the system will usually accept from about 9 through 13 pulses per second, a requirement due to variations in the rotary dial mechanism governor speed. 

This dialing method is the world&#x27;s first mass scale digital addressing system. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as an analog system due to some individuals&#x27; beliefs that mechanical and old are synonyms for analog. However, like the telegraph, which is also mechanical and digital, and which uses both pulse count and pulse width modulation for communicating, pulse dialing is a digital communication method used for addressing telephone subscribers.

The first patent for a rotary dial was granted to Almon Brown Strowger on November 29, 1892, but the commonly known form with holes in the finger wheel was not introduced until about 1904. While used in telephone systems of the independent telephone companies, rotary dial service in the Bell System in the United States was not common until the early 1920s.

From the 1960s onward, the rotary dial was gradually supplanted by push-button telephones, first introduced to the public at the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair under the trade name Touch-Tone (DTMF). Touch-tone technology primarily used a keypad in the form of a rectangular array of push-buttons. Although no longer in common use, the rotary dial&#x27;s legacy remains in the verb &quot;to dial (a telephone number)&quot;.

==History==


From as early as 1836 onward, various suggestions and inventions of dials for sending telegraph signals were reported. After the first commercial telephone exchange was installed in 1878, the need for an automated, user-controlled method of directing a telephone call became apparent. Addressing the technical shortcomings, Almon Brown Strowger invented a telephone dial in 1891. Before 1891, numerous competing inventions, and 26 patents for dials, push-buttons, and similar mechanisms, specified methods of signalling a destination telephone station that a subscriber wanted to call. Most inventions involved costly, intricate mechanisms and required the user to perform complex manipulations.

The first commercial installation of a telephone dial accompanied the first commercial installation of a 99-line automatic telephone exchange in La Porte, Indiana, in 1892, which was based on the 1891 Strowger designs. The original dials required complex operational sequences. A workable, albeit error-prone, system was invented by the Automatic Electric Company using three push-buttons on the telephone. These buttons represented the hundreds, tens, and single units of a telephone number. When calling the subscriber number 163, for example, the user had to push the hundreds button once, followed by six presses of the tens button, and three presses of the units button. In 1896, this system was supplanted by an automatic &quot;contact-making machine&quot;, or &quot;calling device&quot;. Further development continued during the 1890s and the early 1900s in conjunction with improvements in switching technology.

Almon Brown Strowger was the first to file a patent for a rotary dial on December 21, 1891, which was awarded on November 29, 1892, as . The early rotary dials used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes, and did not produce a linear sequence of pulses, but interrupted two independent circuits for control of relays in the exchange switch. The pulse train was generated without the control of spring action or a governor on the forward movement of the wheel, which proved to be difficult to operate correctly.

Despite their lack of modern features, rotary dials occasionally find special uses, particularly in industrial equipment. For instance, the anti-drug Fairlawn Coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C., persuaded the phone company to reinstall rotary-dial pay phones in the 1980s to discourage loitering by drug purchasers, since they lacked a telephone keypad to leave messages on dealers&#x27; pagers. They are also retained for authenticity in historic properties such as the U.S. Route 66 Blue Swallow Motel, which date back to the era of named exchanges and pulse dialing.

==Function==
For dialing a digit of the telephone number, the user inserts a finger into the corresponding finger hole and rotates the dial clockwise until the finger reaches the finger stop. The user then releases the finger wheel by pulling the finger from the hole. A spring around the dial shaft rotates it back to the rest position. During the period of return, the dial operates electrical contacts that break the electrical continuity of the local loop, and interrupt the current flow a certain number of times for each digit marked on the front of the dial.

The number of pulses sent for each digit is defined by the type of dial system in use. The encoding has traditionally varied by country, or by the manufacturer of the telephone system. For example, Sweden used one pulse to signal the number zero, and ten pulses to signal the number nine. In Finland, where many telephones were of Swedish manufacture, one pulse signaled digit &quot;1&quot;, and ten pulses &quot;0&quot;. New Zealand used ten pulses minus the number desired; so dialing the digit &quot;7&quot; produces three pulses. In Norway, the North American system with the digit &quot;1&quot; corresponding to one pulse was used, except for the capital city, Oslo, which used the same &quot;inverse&quot; system as in New Zealand. The sequencing of the digits on the dial varies accordingly. 

Rotary dials have no redial feature; the entire telephone number must be dialed for every attempted call. The time it took for dialing depended on the digit, i.e. how far the dial had to travel to return to the rest position.

==Construction==
A rotary dial typically features a circular construction. The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism is driven by the finger wheel, a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference. The finger wheel may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate (number plate), either in whole, or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole. The faceplate is printed with digits, and often letters, corresponding to each finger hole. Digit 1 is typically set in the upper right quadrant of the dial front, then the numbers progress counterclockwise. A curved device, the &quot;finger stop&quot; is positioned in the lower right quadrant. Some dialing mechanism allowed the use of physical locking mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use. The lock could be integral to the telephone itself or a separate device inserted through the finger hole nearest the finger stop to prevent the dial from rotating.

The rotational return speed of the dial to its rest position is controlled by the &quot;governor&quot;, a mechanical regulating device, that assures a constant electrical pulsing rate of the dial.

===Principal dial mechanisms in the United States===
In the United States, two principal dial mechanisms arose in the engineering laboratories of the largest manufacturers, that of the Western Electric Company for the Bell System, and that of the Automatic Electric Company.

The Western Electric dial had spur gears to power the governor, so the axis of the governor was parallel to the dial shaft. The Automatic Electric governor shaft was parallel to the plane of the dial at a right angle to the dial shaft. The governor shaft had worm gearing in which, very atypically, the gear drove the worm. The worm, highly polished, had extreme pitch, with teeth at about 45° to its axis. This was the same as the gearing for the speed-limiting fan in traditional music boxes. The Western Electric governor was a cup surrounding spring-loaded pivoted weights with friction pads. The Automatic Electric governor had weights on the middle of curved springs made from strip stock. When it sped up after the dial was released, the weights moved outward, pulling the ends of their springs together. Springs were fixed to a collar on the shaft at one end and to the hub of a sliding brake disc at the other end. At speed, the brake disc contacted a friction pad. This governor was similar to that in spring-driven windup phonograph turntables of the early 20th century.

Both types had wrap-spring clutches for driving their governors. When winding the dial-return spring, these clutches disconnected to let the dial turn quickly. When the dial was released, the clutch spring wrapped tightly to drive the governor.

While winding the dial, a spring-centered pawl in the Western Electric dial wiggled off-center when driven by the cam on the dial shaft. Teeth on that cam were spaced apart by the same angle as dial hole spacing. During winding, the pawl moved off-center away from the normally-closed pulsing contacts. When the dial was released, the cam teeth moved the pawl the other way to open and release the dial contacts. In the Automatic Electric dial, the pulsing cam and governor were driven by a wrap-spring clutch as the dial returned. When winding, that clutch disconnected both cam and governor.

===Recoil spring===
Early dials worked by direct or forward rotating action. The pulses were generated as the dial turned toward the finger stop position. When the user&#x27;s hand motion was erratic, it could produce the wrong digit. In the late 19th century, the dial was refined to operate automatically by a recoil spring. The user selected the digit to be dialed, rotated the dial to the finger stop, then released it. The spring caused the dial to rotate back to its home position during which time constant speed was maintained with a centrifugal governor.

Dials at user stations typically produced pulses at the rate of ten pulses per second (PPS), while dials on operator consoles on crossbar or electronic exchanges often pulsed at 18 PPS.

The rotary dial governor is subject to wear and aging, and may require periodic cleaning, lubrication and adjustment by a technician. In the video, the green LED shows the dial impulse pulses and the red LED shows the dial&#x27;s off-normal contact function.

Off-normal contacts typically serve two additional functions. They may implement a shunt across the transmitter circuit and induction coil to maximize the pulsing signal of the dial by eliminating all internal impedances of the telephone set. Another function is to short-circuit or interrupt the telephone receiver during dialing, to prevent audible clicking noise from being heard by the telephone user.

===Dials located in handsets===
Some telephones include a small dial built into the handset, with a movable finger stop. The user rotates the dial clockwise until the finger stop ceases moving, then releases both. In this design the holes extend around the full circumference of the dial, allowing a reduced diameter. This was introduced by Western Electric on the compact Trimline telephone, the first to locate the dial in the handset. In Spain, such phones were manufactured for CTNE (Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España) by Málaga-based factory &quot;CITESA&quot;, being named as &quot;Góndola&quot; phones by its particular shape. Spanish Góndola sets were fitted from the beginning with a red LED series connected with the line, allowing the dial (&quot;disco&quot; in Spanish) to be backlit while dialling. For that, the LED was bridged by an anti-parallel Zener diode, to allow the DC to pass even if the line polarity were reversed. In case of line polarity reversal, the LED would not light, but the phone would work anyway. The LED and Zener diode were contained in the same package for ease of assembly in manufacturing.

===Britain===
In the United Kingdom the letter &quot;O&quot; was combined with the digit &quot;0&quot; rather than &quot;6&quot;. In large cities the seven-digit numbers comprised three letters for the exchange name, followed by four numbers. 

===Australia===
Before 1960 Australian rotary dial telephones had each number&#x27;s corresponding letter printed on a paper disc in the centre of the plate, with space where the subscriber could add the phone number. The paper was protected by a clear plastic disc, held in place by a form of retaining ring which also served to locate the disc radially. The Australian letter-to-number mapping was A=1, B=2, F=3, J=4, L=5, M=6, U=7, W=8, X=9, Y=0, so the phone number BX 3701 was in fact 29 3701. When Australia around 1960 changed to all-numeric telephone dials, a mnemonic to help people associate letters with numbers was the sentence, &quot;All Big Fish Jump Like Mad Under Water eXcept Yabbies.&quot;

===Eastern bloc===
Alphabetic designation of exchanges with Cyrillic letters (А, Б, В, Г, Д, Е, Ж, И, К, Л for each of the digits from 1 through 0 respectively) was also used for a short period in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and 1960s, but by the next decade this practice was largely discontinued.

Letter codes were not used in all East European countries.

===Emergency calling===
A relic of these differences is found in emergency telephone numbers used in various countries; the United Kingdom selected 999 due to the ease of converting call office dials to make free calls. &quot;0&quot; for the Operator was already free, and the cam that removed the shunt on the line when the dial was rotated to the &quot;0&quot; position could be altered to include the adjacent digit &quot;9&quot; (and &quot;8&quot; if required) so that calls to &quot;0&quot; and &quot;999&quot; could be made without inserting coins. In New Zealand, 111 was selected because New Zealand reverse-numbered dials make each digit &quot;1&quot; send 9 pulses to the central office/telephone exchange (like &quot;9&quot; in Britain), allowing British exchange equipment to be used off the shelf. 

==Alphanumeric dialing==

In addition to the ten digits, the faceplate is often printed with letters corresponding to each position. 
In North America, traditional dials have letter codes displayed with the numbers under the finger holes in the following pattern: 1, 2 ABC, 3 DEF, 4 GHI, 5 JKL, 6 MNO, 7 PRS, 8 TUV, 9 WXY, and 0 (sometimes Z) Operator. Letters were associated with the dial numbers to represent telephone exchange names in communities that required multiple central offices. For example, &quot;RE7-3456&quot; represented &quot;REgent 7-3456&quot;.

In 1917, W. G. Blauvelt of AT&amp;T developed the combination pattern of letters assigned to each digit, which became the standard in North America. Large cities like New York City would ultimately require a seven-digit telephone number. Some tests in the early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people was insufficient for seven digits, causing dialing errors (the documentation for these tests is lost). As large cities had both manual and automatic exchanges for many years, the numbers for manual or automatic exchanges used the same format, which could be either spoken or dialed.

In the late 1940s, telephones were redesigned with the numbers and letters displayed on a ring outside the finger wheel to provide better visibility.

==Push-button pulse dialing==
Even after the transition to DTMF dialing with push-button keypads in most areas, pulse-dialing telephones continued to be produced for some time, even with keypads for dialing, for use with certain private exchange systems. Some of these can be distinguished visually by the lack of keys with the symbols &quot;#&quot; and &quot;*&quot;. Some telephones may have an option to select pulse dialing or DTMF dialing.

<text>In political science, a revolution (, &#x27;a turn around&#x27;) is a rapid, fundamental transformation of a society&#x27;s class, state, ethnic or religious structures. According to sociologist Jack Goldstone, all revolutions contain &quot;a common set of elements at their core: (a) efforts to change the political regime that draw on a competing vision (or visions) of a just order, (b) a notable degree of informal or formal mass mobilization, and (c) efforts to force change through noninstitutionalized actions such as mass demonstrations, protests, strikes, or violence.&quot;

Revolutions have occurred throughout human history and varied in their methods, durations and outcomes. Some revolutions started with peasant uprisings or guerrilla warfare on the periphery of a country; others started with urban insurrection aimed at seizing the country&#x27;s capital city. Revolutions can be inspired by the rising popularity of certain political ideologies, moral principles, or models of governance such as nationalism, republicanism, egalitarianism, self-determination, human rights, democracy, liberalism, fascism, or socialism. A regime may become vulnerable to revolution due to a recent military defeat, or economic chaos, or an affront to national pride and identity, or persistent repression and corruption. Revolutions typically trigger counter-revolutions which seek to halt revolutionary momentum, or to reverse the course of an ongoing revolutionary transformation.

Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the American Revolution (1765–1783), French Revolution (1789–1799), Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826), Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), Xinhai Revolution in China in 1911, Revolutions of 1917–1923 in Europe (including the Russian Revolution and German Revolution), Chinese Communist Revolution (1927–1949), decolonization of Africa (mid-1950s to 1975), Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962), Cuban Revolution in 1959, Iranian Revolution and Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979, worldwide Revolutions of 1989, and Arab Spring in the early 2010s.

== Etymology ==
The French noun &quot;revolucion&quot; traces back to the 13th century, and the English equivalent &quot;revolution&quot; to the late 14th century. The word was limited then to mean the revolving motion of celestial bodies. &quot;Revolution&quot; in the sense of abrupt change in a social order was first recorded in the mid-15th century. By 1688, the political meaning of the word was familiar enough that the replacement of James II with William III was termed the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;.

== Definition ==
&quot;Revolution&quot; is now employed most often to denote a change in social and political institutions. Jeff Goodwin offers two definitions. First, a broad one, including &quot;any and all instances in which a state or a political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extraconstitutional or violent fashion&quot;. Second, a narrow one, in which &quot;revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for state power&quot;.

Jack Goldstone defines a revolution thusly:
&quot;[Revolution is] an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and noninstitutionalized actions that undermine authorities. This definition is broad enough to encompass events ranging from the relatively peaceful revolutions that toppled communist regimes to the violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan. At the same time, this definition is strong enough to exclude coups, revolts, civil wars, and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority.&quot; Goldstone&#x27;s definition excludes peaceful transitions to democracy through plebiscite or free elections, as occurred in Spain after the death of Francisco Franco, or in Argentina and Chile after the demise of their military juntas. Early scholars often debated the distinction between revolution and civil war. They also questioned whether a revolution is purely political (i.e., concerned with the restructuring of government) or whether &quot;it is an extensive and inclusive social change affecting all the various aspects of the life of a society, including the economic, religious, industrial, and familial as well as the political&quot;.

== Types ==
There are numerous typologies of revolution in the social science literature. Alexis de Tocqueville differentiated between:
* sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to overhaul an entire society, and; 
* slow and relentless revolutions that involve sweeping transformations of the entire society and may take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion).
One of the Marxist typologies divides revolutions into: 
* pre-capitalist 
* early bourgeois
* bourgeois
* bourgeois-democratic
* early proletarian
* socialist

Charles Tilly, a modern scholar of revolutions, differentiated between: 
* coup d&#x27;état (a top-down seizure of power), e.g., Poland, 1926
* civil war 
* revolt, and
* &quot;great revolution&quot; (a revolution that transforms economic and social structures as well as political institutions, such as the French Revolution of 1789, Russian Revolution of 1917, or Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979).

Mark Katz identified six forms of revolution:
* rural revolution
* urban revolution
* coup d&#x27;état, e.g., Egypt, 1952
* revolution from above, e.g., Mao Zedong&#x27;s Great Leap Forward of 1958
* revolution from without, e.g., the Allied invasions of Italy in 1943 and of Germany in 1945
* revolution by osmosis, e.g., the gradual Islamization of several countries.
These categories are not mutually exclusive; the Russian Revolution of 1917 began with an urban revolution to depose the Czar, followed by a rural revolution, followed by the Bolshevik coup in November. Katz also cross-classified revolutions as follows:
* Central: countries, usually Great Powers, which play a leading role in a revolutionary wave; e.g., the USSR, Nazi Germany, Iran since 1979
* Aspiring revolutions, which follow the Central revolution
* subordinate or puppet revolutions
* rival revolutions, in which a former alliance is broken, such as Yugoslavia after 1948, and China after 1960.

A further dimension to Katz&#x27;s typology is that revolutions are either against (anti-monarchy, anti-dictatorial, anti-communist, anti-democratic) or for (pro-fascism, pro-communism, pro-nationalism, etc.). In the latter cases, a transition period is generally necessary to decide which direction to take to achieve the desired form of government. Other types of revolution, created for other typologies, include proletarian or communist revolutions (inspired by the ideas of Marxism that aim to replace capitalism with communism); failed or abortive revolutions (that are not able to secure power after winning temporary victories or amassing large-scale mobilizations); or violent vs. nonviolent revolutions. The term &quot;revolution&quot; has also been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. Such revolutions, often labeled social revolutions, are recognized as major transformations in a society&#x27;s culture, philosophy, or technology, rather than in its political system. Some social revolutions are global in scope, while others are limited to single countries. Commonly cited examples of social revolution are the Industrial Revolution, Scientific Revolution, Commercial Revolution, and Digital Revolution. These revolutions also fit the &quot;slow revolution&quot; type identified by Tocqueville.

== Studies of revolution ==


Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many social sciences, particularly sociology, political science and history. Scholars of revolution differentiate four generations of theoretical research on the subject of revolution. Theorists of the first generation, including Gustave Le Bon, Charles A. Ellwood, and Pitirim Sorokin, were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions were usually related to social psychology, such as Le Bon&#x27;s crowd psychology theory. The second generation sought to develop detailed frameworks, grounded in social behavior theory, to explain why and when revolutions arise. Their work can be divided into three categories: psychological, sociological and political.

The writings of Ted Robert Gurr, Ivo K. Feierbrand, Rosalind L. Feierbrand, James A. Geschwender, David C. Schwartz, and Denton E. Morrison fall into the first category. They utilized theories of cognitive psychology and frustration-aggression theory to link the cause of revolution to the state of mind of the masses. While these theorists varied in their approach as to what exactly incited the people to revolt (e.g., modernization, recession, or discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was a widespread frustration with the socio-political situation.

The second group, composed of academics such as Chalmers Johnson, Neil Smelser, Bob Jessop, Mark Hart, Edward A. Tiryakian, and Mark Hagopian, drew on the work of Talcott Parsons and the structural-functionalist theory in sociology. They saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands, and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions.

The third group, including writers such as Charles Tilly, Samuel P. Huntington, Peter Ammann, and Arthur L. Stinchcombe, followed a political science path and looked at pluralist theory and interest group conflict theory. Those theories view events as outcomes of a power struggle between competing interest groups. In such a model, revolutions happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within the current political system&#x27;s normal decision-making process, and when they possess the required resources to employ force in pursuit of their goals.

The second-generation theorists regarded the development of revolutionary situations as a two-step process: &quot;First, a pattern of events arises that somehow marks a break or change from previous patterns. This change then affects some critical variable—the cognitive state of the masses, the equilibrium of the system, or the magnitude of conflict and resource control of competing interest groups. If the effect on the critical variable is of sufficient magnitude, a potentially revolutionary situation occurs.&quot; Once this point is reached, a negative incident (a war, a riot, a bad harvest) that in the past might not have been enough to trigger a revolt, will now be enough. However, if authorities are cognizant of the danger, they can still prevent revolution through reform or repression.

In his influential 1938 book &quot;The Anatomy of Revolution&quot;, historian Crane Brinton established a convention by choosing four major political revolutions—England (1642), Thirteen Colonies of America (1775), France (1789), and Russia (1917)—for comparative study. He outlined what he called their &quot;uniformities&quot;, although the American Revolution deviated somewhat from the pattern. As a result, most later comparative studies of revolution substituted China (1949) in their lists, but they continued Brinton&#x27;s practice of focusing on four.

In subsequent decades, scholars began to classify hundreds of other events as revolutions (see List of revolutions and rebellions). Their expanded notion of revolution engendered new approaches and explanations. The theories of the second generation came under criticism for being too limited in geographical scope, and for lacking a means of empirical verification. Also, while second-generation theories may have been capable of explaining a specific revolution, they could not adequately explain why revolutions failed to occur in other societies experiencing very similar circumstances.

The criticism of the second generation led to the rise of a third generation of theories, put forth by writers such as Theda Skocpol, Barrington Moore, Jeffrey Paige, and others expanding on the old Marxist class-conflict approach. They turned their attention to &quot;rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous elites, and the impact of interstate economic and military competition on domestic political change.&quot; In particular, Skocpol&#x27;s &quot;States and Social Revolutions&quot; (1979) was a landmark book of the third generation. Skocpol defined revolution as &quot;rapid, basic transformations of society&#x27;s state and class structures ... accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below&quot;, and she attributed revolutions to &quot;a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes&quot;.
In the late 1980s, a new body of academic work started questioning the dominance of the third generation&#x27;s theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by a series of revolutionary events that they could not readily explain. The Iranian and Nicaraguan Revolutions of 1979, the 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines, and the 1989 Autumn of Nations in Europe, Asia and Africa saw diverse opposition movements topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and mass strikes in nonviolent revolutions.

For some historians, the traditional paradigm of revolutions as class struggle-driven conflicts centered in Europe, and involving a violent state versus its discontented people, was no longer sufficient to account for the multi-class coalitions toppling dictators around the world. Consequently, the study of revolutions began to evolve in three directions. As Goldstone describes it, scholars of revolution:
#Extended the third generation&#x27;s structural theories to a more heterogeneous set of cases, &quot;well beyond the small number of &#x27;great&#x27; social revolutions&quot;.
#Called for greater attention to conscious agency and contingency in understanding the course and outcome of revolutions.
#Observed how studies of social movements—for women&#x27;s rights, labor rights, and U.S. civil rights—had much in common with studies of revolution and could enrich the latter. Thus, &quot;a new literature on &#x27;contentious politics&#x27; has developed that attempts to combine insights from the literature on social movements and revolutions to better understand both phenomena.&quot;

The fourth generation increasingly turned to quantitative techniques when formulating its theories. Political science research moved beyond individual or comparative case studies towards large-N statistical analysis assessing the causes and implications of revolution. The initial fourth-generation books and journal articles generally relied on the Polity data series on democratization. Such analyses, like those by A. J. Enterline, Zeev Maoz, and Edward D. Mansfield and Jack Snyder, identified a revolution by a significant change in the country&#x27;s score on Polity&#x27;s autocracy-to-democracy scale.

Since the 2010s, scholars like Jeff Colgan have argued that the Polity data series—which evaluates the degree of democratic or autocratic authority in a state&#x27;s governing institutions based on the openness of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority, and political competition—is inadequate because it measures democratization, not revolution, and doesn&#x27;t account for regimes which come to power by revolution but fail to change the structure of the state and society sufficiently to yield a notable difference in the Polity score. Instead, Colgan offered a new data set to single out governments that &quot;transform the existing social, political, and economic relationships of the state by overthrowing or rejecting the principal existing institutions of society.&quot; This data set has been employed to make empirically based contributions to the literature on revolution by finding links between revolution and the likelihood of international disputes.

Revolutions have been further examined from an anthropological perspective. Drawing on Victor Turner&#x27;s writings on ritual and performance, Bjorn Thomassen suggested that revolutions can be understood as &quot;liminal&quot; moments: modern political revolutions very much resemble rituals and can therefore be studied within a process approach. This would imply not only a focus on political behavior &quot;from below&quot;, but also a recognition of moments where &quot;high and low&quot; are relativized, subverted, or made irrelevant, and where the micro and macro levels fuse together in critical conjunctions. Economist Douglass North raised a note of caution about revolutionary change, how it &quot;is never as revolutionary as its rhetoric would have us believe&quot;. While the &quot;formal rules&quot; of laws and constitutions can be changed virtually overnight, the &quot;informal constraints&quot; such as institutional inertia and cultural inheritance do not change quickly and thereby slow down the societal transformation. According to North, the tension between formal rules and informal constraints is &quot;typically resolved by some restructuring of the overall constraints—in both directions—to produce a new equilibrium that is far less revolutionary than the rhetoric.&quot;

<text>The Roland TB-303 Bass Line (also known as the 303) is a bass synthesizer released by Roland Corporation in 1981. Designed to simulate bass guitars, it was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. However, cheap second-hand units were adopted by electronic musicians, and its &quot;squelching&quot; or &quot;chirping&quot; sound became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as acid house, Chicago house and techno. It has inspired numerous clones.

==Design and features==

The TB-303 was manufactured by the Japanese company Roland. It was designed by Tadao Kikumoto, who also designed the Roland TR-909 drum machine. It was marketed as a &quot;computerised bass machine&quot; to replace the bass guitar. However, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, it instead produces a &quot;squelchy tone more reminiscent of a psychedelic mouth harp than a stringed instrument&quot;.

The TB-303 has a single oscillator, which produces either a &quot;buzzy&quot; sawtooth wave or a &quot;hollow-sounding&quot; square wave. This is fed into a 24 dB/octave low-pass filter, which is manipulated by an envelope generator. Users program notes and slides using the internal sequencer.

==Legacy==
The TB-303&#x27;s unrealistic sound made it unpopular with its target audience, musicians who wanted to replace bass guitars. It was discontinued in 1984, and Roland sold off remaining units cheaply. 10,000 units were manufactured.

Indian musician Charanjit Singh&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Synthesizing: Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat&quot; featured an early use of a TB-303, alongside the TR-808. The album remained obscure until the early 21st century, when it was reissued and recognized as a precursor to acid house. Singh had an influence on Bollywood music producer Bappi Lahiri, who experimented with tweaked TB-303 basslines for several Indian disco film songs released in 1983: &quot;Koi Lutera&quot; in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Aah Ha Oonh Hun&quot; in &quot;Do Gulaab&quot;, and &quot;Tum Tum Tumba&quot; in &quot;Karate&quot;. The first song using the TB-303 to enter the top ten of the UK Singles Chart was &quot;Rip It Up&quot; (1983) by Scottish band Orange Juice. The same year, Japanese musician Ryo Kawasaki used the TB-303 with a TR-808 and synth guitar in his electronic jazz album &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1983).

The Chicago group Phuture bought a cheap TB-303 and began experimenting. By manipulating the synthesizer as it played, they created a unique &quot;squelching, resonant and liquid sound&quot;. This became the foundation of the single &quot;Acid Tracks&quot; (1987), often credited as the first acid house track. With the TB-303 as a staple sound, acid became popular worldwide, particularly as part of the UK&#x27;s emerging rave culture known as the second summer of love.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as new acid styles emerged, the TB-303 was often overdriven, producing a harsher sound, such as on Hardfloor&#x27;s 1992 EP &quot;Acperience&quot; and Interlect 3000&#x27;s 1993 EP &quot;Volcano&quot;. In 1995, the TB-303 was distorted and processed on Josh Wink&#x27;s hit &quot;Higher State of Consciousness&quot; and on Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Da Funk&quot;. 

In 2011, the &quot;Guardian&quot; named the release of the TB-303 one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music. The popularity of acid caused a dramatic increase in the price of used 303 units. As of 2014, units sold for over £1,000.

== Successors ==
The TB-303 has inspired numerous software emulations and clones, such as the TD-3 by Behringer, released in 2019. In 2014, Roland released the TB-3 Touch Bassline, with a touchpad interface and MIDI and USB connections. In 2017, Roland released the TB-03, a miniaturized model featuring an LED display and delay and overdrive effects.

<text>The RCA Corporation was a major American electronics company, which was founded in 1919 as the Radio Corporation of America. It was initially a patent trust owned by General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, AT&amp;T Corporation and United Fruit Company. In 1932, RCA became an independent company after the partners were required to divest their ownership as part of the settlement of a government antitrust suit.

An innovative and progressive company, RCA was the dominant electronics and communications firm in the United States for over five decades. In the early 1920s, RCA was at the forefront of the mushrooming radio industry as a major manufacturer of radio receivers, and the exclusive manufacturer of the first superheterodyne sets. The company also created the first nationwide American radio network, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). RCA was also a pioneer in the introduction and development of television, both black and white and especially color television. Throughout most of the company&#x27;s existence, RCA was closely identified with the leadership of David Sarnoff. He became general manager at the company&#x27;s founding, served as president from 1930 to 1965, and remained active as chairman of the board until the end of 1969.

During the 1970s, RCA&#x27;s seemingly impregnable stature as America&#x27;s leading name in technology, innovation and home entertainment began to weaken as the company attempted to expand beyond its main focus of the development and marketing of consumer electronics and communications into a diversified multinational conglomerate. Additionally, RCA began to face increasing domestic competition from international electronics firms such as Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Mitsubishi. RCA suffered enormous financial losses in the mainframe computer industry and other failed projects including the CED videodisc system.

Although the company was rebounding by the mid-1980s, RCA never regained its former eminence and was reacquired by General Electric in 1986. This was during the Jack Welch era of GE and Welch began selling off or liquidating most of RCA&#x27;s assets, retaining only NBC and government services. Today, RCA exists as a brand name only; the various RCA trademarks are currently owned by Sony Music Entertainment and Vantiva, which in turn license the RCA brand name and trademarks to several other companies, including Voxx International, Curtis International, AVC Multimedia, TCL Corporation and Express LUCK International, Ltd. for their various products.

==Establishment by General Electric==
RCA originated as a reorganization of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America (commonly called &quot;American Marconi&quot;). In 1897, the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, Limited, was founded in London to promote the radio (then known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;) inventions of Guglielmo Marconi. As part of worldwide expansion, in 1899 American Marconi was organized as a subsidiary company, holding the rights to use the Marconi patents in the United States and Cuba. In 1912 it took over the assets of the bankrupt United Wireless Telegraph Company, and from that point forward it became the dominant radio communications company in the United States.

When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the federal government took control of most civilian radio stations to use them for the war effort. Although the government planned to restore civilian ownership of the radio stations once the war ended, many United States Navy officials hoped to retain a monopoly on radio communication even after the war. Contrary to instructions it had received, the Navy began purchasing large numbers of radio stations. When the war ended, Congress rejected the Navy&#x27;s efforts to have peacetime control of the radio industry and instructed that the Navy return the stations it had taken control of to the original owners.

Due to national security considerations, the Navy was particularly concerned about returning high-powered international stations to American Marconi, since the majority of its stock was in foreign hands, and the British already largely controlled the international undersea telegraph cables. This concern was increased by the announcement in late 1918 of the formation of the Pan-American Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Company, a joint venture between American Marconi and the Federal Telegraph Company, with plans to set up service between the United States and South America.
The Navy had installed a high-powered Alexanderson alternator, built by General Electric (GE), at the American Marconi transmitter site in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It proved to be superior for transatlantic transmissions to the spark-gap transmitters that had been traditionally used by the Marconi companies. Marconi officials were so impressed by the capabilities of the Alexanderson alternators that they began making preparations to adopt them as their standard transmitters for international communication. A tentative plan made with General Electric proposed that over a two-year period the Marconi companies would purchase most of GE&#x27;s alternator production. However, the U.S. Navy objected to the plan, fearing British domination in international radio communications and the national security concerns this raised.

The Navy, claiming support from U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, looked for an alternative that would result in an &quot;all-American&quot; company taking over the American Marconi assets. In April 1919, two naval officers, Admiral H. G. Bullard and Commander S. C. Hooper, met with GE president, Owen D. Young and requested a suspension of the pending alternator sales to the Marconi companies. This would leave General Electric without a buyer for its transmitters, so the officers proposed that GE purchase American Marconi, and use the assets to form its own radio communications subsidiary. Young consented to this proposal, which, effective November 20, 1919, transformed American Marconi into the Radio Corporation of America. The decision to form the new company was promoted as a patriotic gesture. The corporate officers were required to be citizens of the United States, with a majority of the company stock to be held by U.S. citizens.

Upon its founding, RCA was the largest radio communications firm in the United States. Most of the former American Marconi staff continued to work for RCA. Owen Young became the chairman of the board of the new company. Former American Marconi vice president and general manager E. J. Nally become RCA&#x27;s first president. Nally was succeeded by Major General James G. Harbord, who served from 1922 until January 3, 1930, when Harbord replaced Owen Young as chairman of the board. David Sarnoff, who was RCA&#x27;s founding general manager, became its third president on the same day. RCA worked closely with the federal government and felt it deserved to maintain its predominant role in U.S. radio communications. At the company&#x27;s recommendation, President Wilson appointed Rear Admiral Bullard &quot;to attend the stockholders&#x27; and director&#x27;s meetings... in order that he may present and discuss informally the Government&#x27;s views and interests&quot;.

The radio industry had been making technical advances, particularly in the area of vacuum tube technology and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. During this time American Marconi had been steadily falling behind others in the industry. The two companies entered into negotiations which resulted in a series of mutually beneficial cross-licensing agreements between themselves and various other companies in the industry. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The United Fruit Company held a small portfolio of radio patents and signed two agreements in 1921. GE&#x27;s traditional electric company rival, the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Corporation, had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for heterodyne receiving originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, plus regenerative circuit and superheterodyne receiver patents issued to Edwin Armstrong. Westinghouse used this position to negotiate a cross-licensing agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA&#x27;s equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA&#x27;s stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT&amp;T 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.

In 1930, RCA agreed to occupy the yet-to-be-constructed landmark skyscraper of the Rockefeller Center complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which in 1933 became known as the RCA Building (renamed the GE Building in 1988 and currently known as the Comcast Building after Comcast acquired NBC). This lease was critical for enabling the massive project to proceed as a commercially viable venture—David Rockefeller cited RCA&#x27;s action as being responsible for &quot;the salvation of the project&quot;.

==Radio development==
===International and marine communication===

RCA&#x27;s primary business objectives at its founding were to provide equipment and services for seagoing vessels, and &quot;worldwide wireless&quot; communication in competition with existing international undersea telegraph cables. To provide the international service, the company soon undertook a massive project to build a &quot;Radio Central&quot; communications hub at Rocky Point, Long Island, New York, designed to achieve &quot;the realization of the vision of communication engineers to transmit messages to all points of the world from a single centrally located source&quot;. Construction began in July 1920, and the site was dedicated on November 5, 1921, after two of the proposed twelve antenna spokes had been completed, and two of the 200-kilowatt alternators installed. The debut transmissions received replies from stations in 17 countries.

Although the initial installation would remain in operation, the additional antenna spokes and alternator installations would not be completed, due to a major discovery about radio signal propagation. While investigating transmitter &quot;harmonics&quot; – unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station&#x27;s normal transmission frequency – Westinghouse&#x27;s Frank Conrad unexpectedly found that in some cases the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency shortwave signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited transmission range. In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a curtain rod as an antenna, matching, at a small fraction of the cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926, Harold H. Beverage further reported that a shortwave signal, transmitted on a 15-meter wavelength (approximately 20 MHz), was received in South America more readily during the daytime than the 200-kilowatt alternator transmissions.

The Alexanderson alternators, control of which had led to RCA&#x27;s formation, were now considered obsolete, and international radio communication would be primarily conducted using vacuum tube transmitters operating on shortwave bands. RCA would continue to operate international telecommunications services for the remainder of its existence, through its subsidiary RCA Communications, Inc., and later the RCA Global Communications Company. In 1975, the company formed RCA American Communications, which operated its Satcom series of geostationary communications satellites. International shortwave links were in turn largely supplanted by communications satellites, especially for distributing network radio and television programming.

At the time RCA was founded in 1919, all radio and telegraphic communication between China and the US, including official messages, were sent through either German radio or British cable links. The U.S. Navy lobbied RCA to seek a concession for a radio link to China, however the company was reluctant because its other concessions were already operating at a loss. This link began operation in 1928. The Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company of California signed a similar agreement with China in 1932. RCA claimed this was breach of contract on the grounds that its 1928 agreement had given it exclusive rights. The dispute went to arbitration, and in 1935 a decision, issued in &quot;Radio Corporation of America v China&quot;, concluded the Mackay concession was valid, because the earlier RCA concession had not granted exclusive rights.

===Broadcasting===

The introduction of organized radio broadcasting in the early 1920s resulted in a dramatic reorientation and expansion of RCA&#x27;s business activities. The development of vacuum tube radio transmitters made audio transmissions practical, in contrast with the earlier transmitters which were limited to sending the dits-and-dahs of Morse code. Since at least 1916, when he was still at American Marconi, David Sarnoff had proposed establishing broadcasting stations, but his memos to management promoting the idea for sales of a &quot;Radio Music Box&quot; had not been followed up at the time.

A small number of broadcasting stations began operating, and soon interest in the innovation was spreading nationwide. In the summer of 1921, a Madison Square Garden employee, Julius Hopp, devised a plan to raise charitable funds by broadcasting, from ringside, the July 2, 1921 Dempsey-Carpentier heavyweight championship fight to be held in Jersey City, New Jersey. Hopp recruited theaters and halls as listening locations that would charge admission fees to be used as charitable donations. He also contacted RCA&#x27;s J. Andrew White, the acting president of the National Amateur Wireless Association (NAWA), an organization originally formed by American Marconi which had been inherited by RCA. White agreed to recruit the NAWA membership for volunteers to provide assistance at the listening sites, and also enlisted David Sarnoff for financial and technical support. RCA was authorized to set up a temporary longwave radio station, located in Hoboken a short distance from the match site, and operating under the call letters WJY. For the broadcast White and Sarnoff telephoned commentary from ringside, which was typed up and then read over the air by J. Owen Smith. The demonstration was a technical success, with a claimed audience of 300,000 listeners throughout the northeast.

RCA quickly moved to expand its broadcasting activities. In the fall of 1921, it set up its first full-time broadcasting station, WDY, at the Roselle Park, New Jersey company plant. By 1923, RCA was operating three stations—WJZ (now WABC) and WJY in New York City, and WRC (now WTEM) in Washington, D.C. A restriction imposed by AT&amp;T&#x27;s interpretation of the patent cross-licensing agreements required that the RCA stations remain commercial free, and they were financed by profits from radio equipment sales.

===National Broadcasting Company===
Beginning in 1922, AT&amp;T became heavily involved in radio broadcasting, and soon became the new industry&#x27;s most important participant. From the beginning, AT&amp;T&#x27;s policy was to finance stations by commercial sponsorship of the programs. The company also created the first radio network, centered on its New York City station WEAF (now WFAN), using its long-distance telephone lines to interconnect stations. This allowed them to economize by having multiple stations carry the same program.

RCA and its partners soon faced an economic crisis, as the costs of providing programming threatened to exceed the funds available from equipment profits. The problem was resolved in 1926 when AT&amp;T unexpectedly decided to exit the radio broadcasting field. RCA purchased, for $1,000,000, AT&amp;Ts two radio stations, WEAF and WCAP in Washington, D.C., as well as its network operations. These assets formed the basis for the creation of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), with ownership divided between RCA (50%), General Electric (30%), and Westinghouse (20%) until 1930, when RCA assumed 100% ownership. This purchase also included the right to begin commercial operations. NBC formed two radio networks that eventually expanded nationwide: the NBC-Red Network, with flagship station WEAF, and NBC-Blue, centered on WJZ. Although NBC was originally promoted as expecting to just break even economically, it soon became extremely profitable, which would be an important factor in helping RCA survive the economic pressures of the Great Depression that began in late 1929.

Concerned that NBC&#x27;s control of two national radio networks gave it too much power over the industry, in 1941 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated a rule designed to force NBC to divest one of them. This order was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, and on October 12, 1943, the NBC-Blue network was sold to candy magnate Edward J. Noble for $8,000,000, and renamed &quot;The Blue Network, Inc.&quot; In 1946 the name was changed to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The &quot;Red&quot; network retained the NBC name and remained under RCA ownership until 1986.

For two decades the NBC radio network&#x27;s roster of stars provided ratings consistently surpassing those of its main competitor, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). But in 1948, as the transition from radio to television was beginning, NBC&#x27;s leadership came under attack due to what became known as the &quot;Paley raids&quot;, named after the president of CBS, William S. Paley. After World War II the tax rate for annual incomes above $70,000 was 77%, while capital gains were taxed at 25%. Paley worked out an accounting technique whereby individual performers could set up corporations that allowed their earnings to be taxed at the significantly lower rate. Instead of NBC responding with a similar package, Sarnoff decided that this accounting method was legally and ethically wrong. NBC&#x27;s performers did not agree, and most of the top stars, including Amos and Andy, Jack Benny, Red Skelton, Edgar Bergen, Burns and Allen, Ed Wynn, Fred Waring, Al Jolson, Groucho Marx and Frank Sinatra moved from NBC to CBS. As a result, CBS boasted of having sixteen of the twenty top-rated programs in 1949. The consequences would carry over to television, where CBS maintained its newfound dominance for decades. Paley had personally worked to woo the performers, while Sarnoff professed his indifference to the defections, stating at an annual meeting that &quot;Leadership built over the years on a foundation of solid service cannot be snatched overnight by buying a few high-priced comedians. Leadership is not a laughing matter.&quot;

===Radio receivers===
Following its founding, RCA acted as the sales agent for a small line of Westinghouse and GE branded receivers and parts used by home constructors, originally for a limited market of amateur radio enthusiasts. By 1922, the rise of broadcasting had dramatically increased the demand for radio equipment by the general public, and this development was reflected in the title of RCA&#x27;s June 1, 1922 catalog, &quot;Radio Enters the Home&quot;. RCA began selling receivers under the &quot;Radiola&quot; name, marketing equipment produced by GE and Westinghouse under the production agreement that allocated a 60%–40% ratio in output between the two companies. Although the patent cross-licensing agreements had been intended to give the participants domination of equipment sales, the tremendous growth of the market led to fierce competition, and in 1925 RCA fell behind Atwater Kent as the leader in receiver sales. RCA was particularly hamstrung by the need to coordinate its sales within the limits of the GE/Westinghouse production quotas, and often had difficulty keeping up with industry trends. However, the company made a key advance in early 1924 when it began selling the first superheterodyne receivers, whose high level of performance increased the brand&#x27;s reputation and popularity. RCA was the exclusive manufacturer of superheterodyne radio sets until 1930. All RCA receivers were battery powered until late 1927 when plug-in AC sets were introduced, providing another boost in sales.

==Vacuum tubes==

RCA inherited American Marconi&#x27;s status as a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded Radiotron in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA&#x27;s strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which were significantly higher than in Europe, where Lee de Forest had allowed a key patent to lapse.

The company began work on a secret project for the U.S. Navy called Madame X in September 1942. The Bloomington, Indiana, plant was one of the first of five RCA plants to produce Madame X vacuum tubes, which included a proximity fuse used to electronically detonate its payload when it was in range of its target, as opposed to relying on a direct hit. James V. Forrestal, former secretary of the Navy said, &quot;The proximity fuse had helped blaze the trail to Japan. Without the protection this ingenious device has given the surface ships of the fleet, our westward push could not have been so swift and the cost in men and ships would have been immeasurably greater.&quot;

RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from octal base metal tubes co-developed with General Electric before World War II, to greatly miniaturized Nuvistor tubes, used in the tuners of the New Vista series of television receivers. The Nuvistors were a last major vacuum tube innovation, along with General Electric&#x27;s Compactron, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the Cathode-ray tube (CRT) picture tube itself.

==Phonographs and records==
The rapid rise of radio broadcasting during the early 1920s, which provided unlimited free entertainment in the home, had a detrimental effect on the American phonograph record industry. The Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, was then the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of records and phonographs, including its popular showcase &quot;Victrola&quot; line. In January 1929, RCA purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company; this acquisition became known as the RCA Victor Division of the Radio Corporation of America, and included ownership of Victor&#x27;s Japanese subsidiary, the Victor Company of Japan (JVC), formed in 1927 and controlling interest in The Gramophone Company Ltd. (later EMI Records) in England.

RCA&#x27;s acquisition of the Victor company included the rights to the iconic Nipper/&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark across North America. RCA Victor popularized combined radio receiver-phonographs, and also created RCA Photophone, a movie sound-on-film system that competed with William Fox&#x27;s sound-on-film Movietone and Warner Bros.&#x27; sound-on-disc Vitaphone. Although early announcements of the RCA and Victor merger stressed that the two firms were linking equally to form a joint new company, RCA initially had little true interest in the phonograph record business. The management of RCA was interested essentially in Victor&#x27;s superior sales capabilities through the record company&#x27;s large network of authorized distributors and dealers, as well as the extensive, efficient manufacturing facilities in Camden, New Jersey. Immediately following the purchase of Victor, RCA began planning the manufacture of radio sets and components on Victor&#x27;s Camden assembly lines, while decreasing the production of Victrolas and records.

The entire phonograph record industry in America nearly foundered after the stock market crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression. During the nadir of the record business in the early 1930s, the manufacture of phonographs and records all but ceased; extant older phonographs were now obsolete and many had been relegated to the attic or basement. RCA Victor began selling the first all-electric Victrola in 1930 and in 1931 the company attempted to revitalize record sales with the introduction of 33 revolutions-per-minute (rpm) long play records, which were a commercial failure during the Great Depression, partly because the Victrolas with two speed turntables required to play them were exorbitantly expensive, and also because the audio performance of the new records was generally poor; the new format used the same groove size as existing 78 rpm records, and it would require the smaller-radius stylus of the later microgroove systems to achieve acceptable slower-speed performance. Additionally, the new long-play records were pressed in a pliable, vinyl-based material called &quot;Victrolac&quot; which wore out rapidly under the heavy tonearms then in use.

In 1934, following the debacle of its long-play record, RCA Victor introduced the Duo Jr., an inexpensive, small, basic electric turntable designed to be plugged into radio sets. The Duo Jr. was sold at cost, but was practically given away with the purchase of a certain number of Victor records. The Duo Jr.&#x27;s rock-bottom price helped to overcome the national apathy to phonographs, and record sales gradually began to recover. Around 1935, RCA began marketing the modernistic RCA Victor M Special, a polished aluminum portable record player designed by John Vassos that has become an icon of 1930s American industrial design. In 1949, RCA Victor released the first 45 rpm &quot;single&quot; records, as a response to Columbia Records successful introduction of its microgroove 33 rpm &quot;LP&quot; format in 1948. As RCA Victor adopted Columbia&#x27;s 33 rpm LP records in 1950, Columbia then adopted RCA Victor&#x27;s 45 rpm records.

==Motion pictures==
RCA also made investments in the movie industry, but they performed poorly. In April 1928, RCA Photophone, Inc., was organized by a group of companies including RCA to develop sound-movie technology. In the fall of 1927, RCA had purchased stock in Film Booking Office (FBO), and on October 25, 1928, with the help of Joseph P. Kennedy, the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation (RKO) studio was formed by merging FBO with Keith-Albee-Orpheum Corporation (KAO), a company whose holdings included motion picture theaters. The theaters in which RKO had an interest provided a potential market for the RCA Photophone sound systems. RCA ownership of RKO stock expanded from about one quarter in 1930 to about 61% in 1932. RKO encountered severe financial problems, going into receivership from early 1933 until 1940. RCA sold its holdings in the studio to raise funds for its basic operations.

==Separation from General Electric==
After years of industry complaints that the cross-licensing agreements between RCA, GE, and Westinghouse had in effect created illegal monopolies, the U.S. Department of Justice brought antitrust charges against the three companies in May 1930. After much negotiation, in 1932 the Justice Department accepted a consent agreement that removed the restrictions established by the cross-licensing agreements, and also provided that RCA would become a fully independent company. As a result, GE and Westinghouse gave up their ownership interests in RCA, while RCA was allowed to keep its factories. To give RCA a chance to establish itself, GE and Westinghouse were required to refrain from competing in the radio business for the next two and one-half years.

==Television==

RCA began television development in early 1929, after an overly optimistic Vladimir K. Zworykin convinced Sarnoff that a commercial version of his prototype system could be produced in a relatively short time for $100,000. Following what would actually be many years of additional research and millions of dollars, RCA demonstrated an all-electronic black-and-white television system at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. RCA began regular experimental television broadcasting from the NBC studios to the New York metropolitan area on April 30, 1939, via station W2XBS, channel 1 (which evolved into WNBC channel 4) from the new Empire State Building transmitter on top of the structure. Around this time, RCA began selling its first television set models, including the TRK-5 and TRK-9, in various New York stores. However, the FCC had not approved the start of commercial television operations, because technical standards had not yet been finalized. Concerned that RCA&#x27;s broadcasts were an attempt to flood the market with sets that would force it to adopt RCA&#x27;s current technology, the FCC stepped in to limit its broadcasts.

Following the adoption of National Television System Committee (NTSC) recommended standards, the FCC authorized the start of commercial television broadcasts on July 1, 1941. The entry of the United States into World War II a few months later greatly slowed its deployment, but RCA resumed selling television receivers almost immediately after the war ended in 1945.

In 1950, the FCC adopted a standard for color television that had been promoted by CBS, but the effort soon failed, primarily because the color broadcasts could not be received by existing black-and-white sets. As the result of a major research push, RCA engineers developed a method of &quot;compatible&quot; color transmissions that, through the use of interlacing, simultaneously broadcast color and black-and-white images, which could be picked up by both color and existing black-and-white sets. In 1953, RCA&#x27;s all-electronic color television technology was adopted as the standard for the United States. At that time, Sarnoff predicted annual color television sales would reach 1.78 million in 1956, but the receivers were expensive and difficult to adjust, and there was initially a lack of color programming, so sales lagged badly and the actual 1956 total would only be 120,000. RCA&#x27;s ownership of NBC proved to be a major benefit, as that network was instructed to promote its color program offerings; even so, it was not until 1968 that color television sales in the United States surpassed those of black-and-white sets.

While lauding the technical prowess of his RCA engineers who had developed color television, David Sarnoff, in marked contrast to William Paley, president of CBS, did not disguise his dislike for popular television programs. His authorized biography even boasted that &quot;no one has yet caught him in communion with one of the upper dozen or so top-rated programs&quot; and &quot;The popular programs, to put the matter bluntly, have very little appeal for him.&quot;

RCA professional video cameras and studio gear, particularly of the TK-40/41 series, became standard equipment at many American television network affiliates, as RCA CT-100 (&quot;RCA Merrill&quot; to dealers) television sets introduced color television to the public.

==Diversification==
In 1941, shortly before the United States entered World War II, the cornerstone was laid for a research and development facility in Princeton, New Jersey called RCA Laboratories. Led for many years by Elmer Engstrom, it was used to develop many innovations, including color television, the electron microscope, CMOS-based technology, heterojunction physics, optoelectronic emitting devices, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), videocassette recorders, direct broadcast television, direct broadcast satellite systems and high-definition television.

RCA plants switched to war production shortly after the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. During World War II, RCA was involved in radar and radio development in support of the war effort, and ranked 43rd among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts. One such contract was to outfit the battleship USS Texas with a 400-megahertz pulse radar set, using technology developed by RCA acoustics scientist, Irving Wolff. During and after the war, RCA set up several new divisions for defense, space exploration and other activities. The RCA Service Corporation provided large numbers of staff for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line. RCA units won five Army–Navy &quot;E&quot; Awards for Excellence in production. Due to the hostilities between Japan and the United States during World War II, the Victor Company of Japan became an independent company after seceding from RCA Victor in the United States; JVC retained the &#x27;Victor&#x27; and &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademarks for use in Japan only.

In 1955, RCA sold its Estate brand of large appliance operations to Whirlpool Corporation. As part of this transaction, Whirlpool was given the right to market &quot;RCA Whirlpool&quot; appliances through the mid-1960s.

RCA manufactured equipment, such as oscilloscopes, for repairing radios, 

RCA Graphic Systems Division (GSD) was an early supplier of electronics designed for the printing and publishing industries. It contracted with German company Rudolf Hell to market adaptations of the Digiset photocomposition system as the Videocomp, and a Laser Color Scanner. The Videocomp was supported by a Spectra computer that ran the Page-1 and, later the Page-II and FileComp composition systems. RCA later sold the Videocomp rights to Information International Inc.

RCA Victor became a major proponent of the 8-track tape cartridge, which it launched in 1965. Initially, the 8-track made a huge and profitable impact on consumers of recorded music. Sales of the 8-track tape format began to decline during the late 1970s when consumers increasingly favored the 4-track compact cassette tape format developed by Philips.

==Computers==
RCA was one of a number of companies in the 1960s that entered the mainframe computer field to challenge the market leader International Business Machines (IBM). Although at this time computers were almost universally used for routine data processing and scientific research, in 1964 Sarnoff, who prided himself as a visionary, predicted that &quot;The computer will become the hub of a vast network of remote data stations and information banks feeding into the machine at a transmission rate of a billion or more bits of information a second ... Eventually, a global communications network handling voice, data and facsimile will instantly link man to machine—or machine to machine—by land, air, underwater, and space circuits. [The computer] will affect man&#x27;s ways of thinking, his means of education, his relationship to his physical and social environment, and it will alter his ways of living. ... [Before the end of this century, these forces] will coalesce into what unquestionably will become the greatest adventure of the human mind.&quot;

RCA marketed a Spectra 70 computer line that was hardware, but not software, compatible with IBM&#x27;s System/360 series. It also produced the RCA Series, which competed against the IBM System/370. This technology was leased to the English Electric company, which used it for their System 4 series, which were essentially RCA Spectra 70 clones. RCA&#x27;s TSOS operating system was the first mainframe, demand paging, virtual memory operating system on the market. By 1971, despite a significant investment, RCA had only a 4% market share, and it was estimated that it would cost around $500 million over the next five years to remain competitive with the IBM/370 series. On September 17, 1971, the RCA board of directors announced its decision to close its computer systems division (RCA-CSD), which would be written off as a $490 million company loss. Sperry Rand&#x27;s UNIVAC division took over the RCA computer division in January 1972. Univac did not want the Spectra computers because they were similar to its own 9000 series; instead, they wanted RCA&#x27;s computer customer base.

==Later years==
On January 1, 1965, Robert Sarnoff succeeded his father as RCA&#x27;s president, although the elder Sarnoff remained in control as chairman of the board. The younger Sarnoff sought to modernize RCA&#x27;s image with the introduction in late 1968 of what was then a futuristic-looking new logo (the letters &#x27;RCA&#x27; in block, modernized form), replacing the original lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademarks. The RCA Victor Division was renamed RCA Records; the &#x27;Victor&#x27; and &#x27;Victrola&#x27; trademarks were no longer used on RCA consumer electronics. &#x27;Victor&#x27; was now restricted to the labels and album covers of RCA&#x27;s regular popular record releases, while the Nipper/&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark was seen only on the album covers of Red Seal records.

In 1969, the company name was officially changed from Radio Corporation of America to the RCA Corporation, to reflect its broader range of corporate activities and expansion into other countries. At the end of that same year, David Sarnoff, after being incapacitated by a long-term illness, was removed as the company&#x27;s chairman of the board. He died in December 1971.

RCA&#x27;s exit from the mainframe computer market in 1971 marked a milestone in its transition from electronics and technology toward Robert Sarnoff&#x27;s goal to diversify RCA as a multinational business conglomerate. During the late 1960s and 1970s, the company made a wide-ranging series of acquisitions, including Hertz (rental cars), Banquet (frozen foods and TV dinners), Coronet (carpeting), Random House (publishing) and Gibson (greeting cards). However, the company was slipping into financial disarray, with wags calling it &quot;Rugs Chickens &amp; Automobiles&quot; (RCA), to poke fun at its new direction.

During this period, RCA continued to maintain its high standards of engineering excellence in broadcast and satellite communications equipment, but profits generated by the NBC television and radio networks began to decline.

Robert Sarnoff&#x27;s tenure as RCA president was unsuccessful, marked by falling profits. While out of the country in October 1975, Sarnoff was ousted in a &quot;boardroom coup&quot; led by Anthony Conrad, who became RCA&#x27;s new president. Conrad resigned less than a year later after he admitted failing to file income tax returns for six years. His successor, Edgar H. Griffiths, proved to be unpopular and retired in early 1981. Griffiths was succeeded by Thornton Bradshaw, who turned out to be the last RCA president.

After the departure of Robert Sarnoff, Griffiths, who considered the demoted &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark a &quot;valuable company asset&quot;, restored Nipper as RCA&#x27;s corporate mascot. On October 31 1976, RCA formally announced the return of the Nipper trademark to RCA products and advertising. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most record labels in countries and territories where RCA held the rights to the trademark. Once again, Nipper was widely used in RCA newspaper, magazine, and TV advertisements. The trademark also returned to company stationery, sales literature, shipping cartons, store displays, delivery and service vehicles and reappeared on RCA television sets and in 1981, the new CED Videodisc system. Several newspaper articles and TV news reports about Nipper&#x27;s revival appeared at the time. A multitude of new Nipper promotional items and collectibles also appeared, including T-shirts, caps, neckties, beach towels, cigarette lighters, coin banks, keychains, watches, clocks, coffee mugs, drinking glasses and stuffed toys.

Projects attempting to establish new consumer electronics products during this era failed and lost RCA much money and prestige. An RCA Studio II home video game console, introduced in 1977, was canceled just under two years later due to poor sales. Development of RCA&#x27;s capacitance electronic (CED) videodisc system began in 1964, and after several years of delays was launched in March 1981. Marketed under the SelectaVision name, the RCA CED videodisc system represented the largest investment RCA made in a single product, even greater than color TV. However, the system was practically obsolete by the time it finally appeared, and never reached the manufacturing volumes needed to bring its price down to the level needed to compete against the newer, recordable and increasingly cheaper videotape technology. In April 1984, after three years of slow sales, RCA abandoned manufacture of the CED players, and ended videodisc production in 1986, after a loss of around $650 million.

Around 1980, RCA corporate strategy reported on moving manufacture of its television receivers to Mexico. In 1981, Columbia Pictures sold its share in the home video division to RCA and outside of North America this division was renamed &quot;RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video (now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment)&quot;. The following year, within North America, it was renamed to &quot;RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video&quot;. In 1983, the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann sold 50% of Arista Records to RCA Records; in 1985, RCA and Bertelsmann formed a joint venture, RCA/Ariola International, which took over management of RCA Records. Bertelsmann would fully acquire RCA Records from General Electric after GE absorbed RCA in 1986.

RCA was still profitable in 1983, when it switched manufacturing of its VHS VCRs from Panasonic to Hitachi. In 1984, RCA Broadcast Systems Division moved from the RCA Victor plant in Camden, New Jersey, to the site of the RCA antenna engineering facility in Gibbsboro, New Jersey. On October 3, 1985, RCA announced it was closing the Broadcast Systems Division. In the years that followed, the broadcast product lines developed in Camden were terminated or sold off, and most of the old RCA Victor buildings and factories in Camden were demolished, except for a few of the original Victor buildings that had been declared national historic buildings. For several years, RCA spinoff L-3 Communications Systems East was headquartered in the famous Nipper Building, but has since moved to an adjacent building built by the city for them. The renovated Nipper Building now houses shops and luxury loft apartments.

==Re-acquisition and breakup by General Electric==
In December 1985, it was announced that General Electric would reacquire its former subsidiary for $6.28 billion in cash, or $66.50 per share of stock. GE&#x27;s acquisition of RCA was the largest non-oil company merger in history up to that time and was completed on June 9, 1986. Despite initial assurances that under GE, RCA would continue to operate as a mostly autonomous unit, over the next few years, GE proceeded to sell off most of RCA&#x27;s remaining assets. It was revealed that GE&#x27;s main motivation for purchasing RCA was to acquire the NBC Television Network and the corporation&#x27;s defense related businesses. In 1987, GE disposed of its 50% interest in RCA Records to its German partner Bertelsmann and RCA Records became a division of Bertelsmann Music Group. RCA Global Communications Inc., a division with roots dating back to RCA&#x27;s founding in 1919, was sold to the MCI Communications Corporation; also in 1987, Westwood One purchased the NBC Radio Network.

In 1988, the rights to manufacture consumer electronics products under the RCA and GE brands was acquired by Thomson Consumer Electronics, in exchange for some of Thomson&#x27;s medical businesses. Also in 1988, its semiconductor business (including the former RCA Solid State unit and Intersil) was bought by Harris Corporation. That same year, the iconic RCA Building, known as &quot;30 Rock&quot; at Rockefeller Center was renamed the GE Building.

In 1991, GE sold its share in RCA/Columbia to Sony Pictures which renamed the unit &quot;Columbia TriStar Home Video&quot; (later further renamed to Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment).

Sarnoff Labs was put on a five-year plan whereby GE would fund all the labs&#x27; activities for the first year, then reduce its support to near zero after the fifth year. This required Sarnoff Labs to change its business model to become an industrial contract research facility. In 1988, it was transferred to SRI International (SRI) as the David Sarnoff Research Center, and subsequently renamed the Sarnoff Corporation. In January 2011, Sarnoff Corporation was fully integrated into SRI.

In 2011, GE sold its controlling interest in NBC, by this time part of the multimedia NBCUniversal venture that included TV and cable, to Comcast, and in 2013, Comcast acquired the remaining interest. After the sale of NBCUniversal, the only former RCA unit which GE retained was Government Services.

In 2022, Thomson&#x27;s successor company, Technicolor SA, sold the RCA trademarks to licensing firm Talisman Brands, Inc. d/b/a Established Incorporated, stylized as &quot;established.&quot;

==Legacy==
RCA antique radios, and early color television receivers such as the RCA Merrill/CT-100, are among the more sought-after collectible radios and televisions, due to their popularity during the golden age of radio and the historic significance of the RCA name, as well as their styling, manufacturing quality and engineering innovations. Most collectable are the pre-war television sets manufactured by RCA beginning in 1939, including the TRK-5, TRK-9 and TRK-12 models.

The RCA Heritage Museum was established at Rowan University in 2012.

The historic RCA Victor Building 17, the &quot;Nipper Building&quot;, in Camden, New Jersey, was converted to luxury apartments in 2003.

A type of plug/jack combination used in audio and video cables is still called the RCA connector.

To this day, a variety of consumer electronics including 2-in-1 tablets, televisions and telephones, home appliances and more are sold under the RCA brand name.

===Environmental issues===
Numerous former RCA manufacturing sites have been reported to be polluted with industrial waste.
* A former RCA facility in Taiwan&#x27;s northern county of Taoyuan (now Taoyuan City) polluted groundwater with toxic chemicals and led to a high incidence of cancer among former employees. The area was declared a toxic site by the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Agency. GE and Thomson spent millions of dollars for cleanup, removing of soil and installing municipal water treatment facilities for neighboring communities. A spokesman for RCA&#x27;s current owners denied responsibility, saying a study conducted by the Taiwan government showed no correlation between the illnesses and the company&#x27;s facilities, which shut down in 1991. On April 17, 2015, RCA lost the case and the Taipei District Court ordered RCA&#x27;s current owners to compensate its former employees with a total of NT$560 million (approximately US$18.1 million).
* A plant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which RCA operated from the late 1940s to June 1986, released more than 250,000 pounds of 1,1,1-trichloroethane pollutants per year from its exhaust stacks. Tests by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, found the groundwater contaminated by trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE). In 1991 and 1992, contaminants were detected in monitoring wells on the east side of the Conestoga River in Lancaster. EPA designated General Electric Company to clean up the area.
* The shallow and deep groundwater aquifers beneath the Intersil Facility in Mountaintop, Pennsylvania, which RCA operated in the 1960s and later sold to Harris Corporation, were found in 1999 to contain elevated levels of volatile organic compounds.
* A site in Burlington, Massachusetts, which RCA used from 1958 to 1994 to make and test military electronics equipment, generated hazardous waste (VOCs, TCE, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes).
* In Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, an RCA-operated plant generated wastes containing chromium, selenium and iron. Four lagoons holding chemical waste drained into the limestone aquifer. Used water from the manufacturing process (process water), containing ferric chloride, was treated onsite to remove contaminants and then was discharged into a sinkhole at the site. The treatment of process water created a sludge that was stored onsite in drying beds and in surface impoundments.

<text>The Rubik&#x27;s Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in 1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer. The cube was released internationally in 1980 and became one of the most recognized icons in popular culture. It won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle. , around 500 million cubes had been sold worldwide, making it the world&#x27;s bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy. The Rubik&#x27;s Cube was inducted into the US National Toy Hall of Fame in 2014.

On the original, classic Rubik&#x27;s Cube, each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, with each face in one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. Some later versions of the cube have been updated to use coloured plastic panels instead. Since 1988, the arrangement of colours has been standardised, with white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and orange opposite red, and with the red, white, and blue arranged clockwise, in that order. On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.
An internal pivot mechanism enables each layer to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to having only one colour. The Cube has inspired other designers to create a number of similar puzzles with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and mechanisms.

Although the Rubik&#x27;s Cube reached the height of its mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practice it and similar puzzles and compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the World Cube Association (WCA), the international governing body of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, has organised competitions worldwide and has recognised world records.

==History==
===Precursors===
In March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2x2x2 &quot;Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups&quot; and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols&#x27;s cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.

On 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an &quot;amusement device&quot;, a type of sliding puzzle on a spherical surface with &quot;at least two 3×3 arrays&quot; intended to be used for the game of noughts and crosses. He received his UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.

===Rubik&#x27;s invention===
In the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest. Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for his &quot;Magic Cube&quot; () on 30 January 1975, and HU170062 was granted later that year.

The first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in toy shops in Budapest. Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle from being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols&#x27;s design. With Ernő Rubik&#x27;s permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany&#x27;s Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it. It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide. Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980. The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg, and New York in January and February 1980.

After its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy shop shelves of the West was briefly halted so that it could be manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A lighter Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. &quot;The Gordian Knot&quot; and &quot;Inca Gold&quot; were considered, but the company finally decided on &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980.

The packaging had a few variations depending on the country, most popular being a clear plastic cylinder but cardboard versions were also used. The cube itself had slightly different variations in the order of the colours (Western vs. Japanese colour scheme where blue/yellow are switched) and some of the cubes did not have a white piece logo.

===1980s Cube craze===

After the first batches of Rubik&#x27;s Cubes were released in May 1980, initial sales were modest, but Ideal began a television advertising campaign in the middle of the year which it supplemented with newspaper advertisements. At the end of 1980, Rubik&#x27;s Cube won a German Game of the Year special award and won similar awards for best toy in the UK, France, and the US. By 1981, Rubik&#x27;s Cube had become a craze, and it is estimated that in the period from 1980 to 1983 around 200 million Rubik&#x27;s Cubes were sold worldwide. In March 1981, a speedcubing championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich, and a Rubik&#x27;s Cube was depicted on the front cover of &quot;Scientific American&quot; that same month. In June 1981, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Rubik&#x27;s Cube is &quot;a puzzle that&#x27;s moving like fast food right now ... this year&#x27;s Hoola Hoop or Bongo Board&quot;, and by September 1981, &quot;New Scientist&quot; noted that the cube had &quot;captivated the attention of children of ages from 7 to 70 all over the world this summer.&quot;

As most people could solve only one or two sides, numerous books were published including David Singmaster&#x27;s &quot;Notes on Rubik&#x27;s &quot;Magic Cube&quot;&quot; (1980) and Patrick Bossert&#x27;s &quot;You Can Do the Cube&quot; (1981). At one stage in 1981, three of the top ten best selling books in the US were books on solving Rubik&#x27;s Cube, and the best-selling book of 1981 was James G. Nourse&#x27;s &quot;The Simple Solution to Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; which sold over 6 million copies. In 1981, the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited a Rubik&#x27;s Cube, and at the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee a six-foot Cube was put on display. In 1983, ABC Television released a cartoon show called &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;. In June 1982, the First Rubik&#x27;s Cube World Championship took place in Budapest and would become the only competition recognized as official until the championship was revived in 2003.

In October 1982, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that sales had fallen and that &quot;the craze has died&quot;, and by 1983 it was clear that sales had plummeted. However, in some countries such as China and the USSR, the craze had started later and demand was still high because of a shortage of Cubes.

===21st-century revival===
Rubik&#x27;s Cubes continued to be marketed and sold throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but it was not until the early 2000s that interest in the Cube began increasing again. In the US, sales doubled between 2001 and 2003, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; remarked that it was &quot;becoming cool to own a Cube again&quot;. The 2003 World Rubik&#x27;s Cube Championship was the first speedcubing tournament since 1982. It was held in Toronto and was attended by 83 participants. The tournament led to the formation of the World Cube Association in 2004. Annual sales of Rubik branded cubes were said to have reached 15 million worldwide in 2008. Part of the new appeal was ascribed to the advent of Internet video sites, such as YouTube, which allowed fans to share their solving strategies. Following the expiration of Rubik&#x27;s patent in 2000, other brands of cubes appeared, especially from Chinese companies. Many of these Chinese branded cubes have been engineered for speed and are favoured by speedcubers. On 27 October 2020, Spin Master said it will pay $50 million to buy the Rubik&#x27;s Cube brand.

==Imitations==
Taking advantage of an initial shortage of cubes, many imitations and variations appeared, many of which may have violated one or more patents. In 2000 the patents expired, and since then, many Chinese companies have produced copies, modifications, and improvements upon the Rubik and V-Cube designs.

===Patent history===
Nichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik&#x27;s 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols&#x27;s patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik&#x27;s 3×3×3 Cube.

Even while Rubik&#x27;s patent application was being processed, Terutoshi Ishigi, a self-taught engineer and ironworks owner near Tokyo, filed for a Japanese patent for a nearly identical mechanism, which was granted in 1976 (Japanese patent publication JP55-008192). Until 1999, when an amended Japanese patent law was enforced, Japan&#x27;s patent office granted Japanese patents for non-disclosed technology within Japan without requiring worldwide novelty. Hence, Ishigi&#x27;s patent is generally accepted as an independent reinvention at that time. Rubik applied for more patents in 1980, including another Hungarian patent on 28 October. In the United States, Rubik was granted on 29 March 1983 for the Cube. This patent expired in 2000.

===Trademarks===
Rubik&#x27;s Brand Ltd. also holds the registered trademarks for the word &quot;Rubik&quot; and &quot;Rubik&#x27;s&quot; and for the 2D and 3D visualisations of the puzzle. The trademarks were upheld by a ruling of the General Court of the European Union on 25 November 2014 in a successful defence against a German toy manufacturer seeking to invalidate them. However, European toy manufacturers are allowed to create differently shaped puzzles that have a similar rotating or twisting functionality of component parts such as for example Skewb, Pyraminx or Impossiball.

On 10 November 2016, Rubik&#x27;s Cube lost a ten-year battle over a key trademark issue. The European Union&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Justice, ruled that the puzzle&#x27;s shape was not sufficient to grant it trademark protection.

==Mechanics==


A standard Rubik&#x27;s Cube measures on each side. The puzzle consists of 26 unique miniature cubes, also known as &quot;cubies&quot; or &quot;cubelets&quot;. Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations. However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square façade; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. Hence, there are 21 pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and 20 smaller plastic pieces that fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.

Each of the six centre pieces pivots on a fastener held by the centre piece, a &quot;3D cross&quot;. A spring between each fastener and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact but can still be easily manipulated. The older versions of the official Cube used a screw that can be tightened or loosened to change the &quot;feel&quot; of the Cube. Newer official Rubik&#x27;s brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted. Inexpensive clones do not have screws or springs, all they have is a plastic clip to keep the centre piece in place and freely rotate.

The Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45° and then prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to &quot;solve&quot; a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.

There are six central pieces that show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces that show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces that show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube by increments of 90 degrees, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered; it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.

Douglas Hofstadter, in the July 1982 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, pointed out that Cubes could be coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.

==Mathematics==
The puzzle was originally advertised as having &quot;over 3,000,000,000 (three billion) combinations but only one solution&quot;. Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number is significantly higher.

===Permutations===

The original (3×3×3) Rubik&#x27;s Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.

:formula_1

which is approximately 43 quintillion. To put this into perspective, if one had one standard-sized Rubik&#x27;s Cube for each permutation, one could cover the Earth&#x27;s surface 275 times, or stack them in a tower 261 light-years high.

The preceding figure is limited to permutations that can be reached solely by turning the sides of the cube. If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number becomes twelve times larger:

:formula_2

which is approximately 519 quintillion possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the cube, but only one-twelfth of these are actually solvable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus, there are 12 possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called &quot;universes&quot; or &quot;orbits&quot;, into which the cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.

The preceding numbers assume the centre faces are in a fixed position. If one considers turning the whole cube to be a different permutation, then each of the preceding numbers should be multiplied by 24. A chosen colour can be on one of six sides, and then one of the adjacent colours can be in one of four positions; this determines the positions of all remaining colours.

===Centre faces===
The original Rubik&#x27;s Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried the &quot;Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; mark on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a &quot;supercube&quot;. Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the Lo Shu magic square or playing card suits. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.

Marking Rubik&#x27;s Cube&#x27;s centres increases its difficulty, because this expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).

When turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1×1024).

===Algorithms===
In Rubik&#x27;s cubers&#x27; parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that have a desired effect on the cube is called an &quot;algorithm&quot;. This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of &quot;algorithm&quot;, meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.

Many algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.

Some algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side effects and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side effects are not important. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.

===Relevance and application of mathematical group theory===
Rubik&#x27;s Cube lends itself to the application of mathematical group theory, which has been helpful for deducing certain algorithms – in particular, those which have a &quot;commutator&quot; structure, namely &quot;XYX&quot;−1&quot;Y&quot;−1 (where &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are specific moves or move-sequences and &quot;X&quot;−1 and &quot;Y&quot;−1 are their respective inverses), or a &quot;conjugate&quot; structure, namely &quot;XYX&quot;−1, often referred to by speedcubers colloquially as a &quot;setup move&quot;. In addition, the fact that there are well-defined subgroups within the Rubik&#x27;s Cube group enables the puzzle to be learned and mastered by moving up through various self-contained &quot;levels of difficulty&quot;. For example, one such &quot;level&quot; could involve solving cubes that have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by Thistlethwaite and Kociemba, which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.

===Unitary representation===
The Rubik&#x27;s group can be endowed with a unitary representation: such a description allows the Rubik&#x27;s Cube to be mapped into a quantum system of few particles, where the rotations of its faces are implemented by unitary operators. The rotations of the faces act as generators of the Lie group.

==Solutions==
===Singmaster notation===
Many 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by David Singmaster to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as &quot;Singmaster notation&quot; or simple &quot;Cube notation&quot;. Its relative nature allows algorithms to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.
* &quot;F&quot; (Front): the side currently facing the solver
* &quot;B&quot; (Back): the side opposite the front
* &quot;U&quot; (Up): the side above or on top of the front side
* &quot;D&quot; (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube
* &quot;L&quot; (Left): the side directly to the left of the front
* &quot;R&quot; (Right): the side directly to the right of the front
* &quot;f&quot; (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;b&quot; (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;u&quot; (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;d&quot; (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;l&quot; (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;r&quot; (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer
* &quot;x&quot; (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on &quot;R&quot;
* &quot;y&quot; (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on &quot;U&quot;
* &quot;z&quot; (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on &quot;F&quot;

When a prime symbol ( ′ ) follows a letter, it indicates an anticlockwise face turn; while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. These directions are as one is looking at the specified face. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally a superscript 2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. For example, &quot;R&quot; means to turn the right side clockwise, but &quot;R′&quot; means to turn the right side anticlockwise. The letters &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; is primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot; is squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees. 

One of the most common deviations from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use &quot;w&quot;, for &quot;wide&quot;, instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of &quot;Rw&quot; is equivalent to one of &quot;r&quot;.

For methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods), there is a generally accepted &quot;MES&quot; extension to the notation where letters &quot;M&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman&#x27;s Algorithm.
* &quot;M&quot; (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)
* &quot;E&quot; (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)
* &quot;S&quot; (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F

The 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (&quot;F B U D L R&quot;) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (&quot;f b u d l r&quot;) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (&quot;Rr&quot;)&#x27; &quot;l&quot;2 &quot;f&quot;&#x27; means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6×6×6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example, 3L.

An alternative notation, Wolstenholme notation, is designed to make memorising sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A, and I for clockwise, anticlockwise, and twice (180-degree) turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′ R′ U L′ U′ R U2 in Singmaster notation). The addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face. Middle layer moves are denoted by adding an M to the corresponding face move, so RIM means a 180-degree turn of the middle layer adjacent to the R face.

Another notation appeared in the 1981 book &quot;The Simple Solution to Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;. Singmaster notation was not widely known at the time of publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F), and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, – for anticlockwise, and 2 for 180-degree turns.

Another notation appeared in the 1982 &quot;The Ideal Solution&quot; book for Rubik&#x27;s Revenge. Horizontal planes were noted as tables, with table 1 or T1 starting at the top. Vertical front to back planes were noted as books, with book 1 or B1 starting from the left. Vertical left to right planes were noted as windows, with window 1 or W1 starting at the front. Using the front face as a reference view, table moves were left or right, book moves were up or down, and window moves were clockwise or anticlockwise.

===Period of move sequences===
The repetition of any given move sequence on a cube which is initially in solved state will eventually return the cube back to its solved state: the smallest number of iterations required is the period of the sequence. For example, the 180-degree turn of any side has period 2 (e.g. ); the 90-degree turn of any side has period 4 (e.g. ). The maximum period for a move sequence is 1260: for example, allowing for full rotations, or or ; not allowing for rotations, , or , or ; only allowing for clockwise quarter turns, , or , or ; only allowing for lateral clockwise quarter turns, , or , or .

===Optimal solutions===
Although there are a significant number of possible permutations for Rubik&#x27;s Cube, a number of solutions have been developed which allow solving the cube in well under 100 moves.

Many general solutions for the Cube have been discovered independently. David Singmaster first published his solution in the book &quot;Notes on Rubik&#x27;s &quot;Magic Cube&quot;&quot; in 1981. This solution involves solving the Cube layer by layer, in which one layer (designated the top) is solved first, followed by the middle layer, and then the final and bottom layer. After sufficient practice, solving the Cube layer by layer can be done in under one minute. Other general solutions include &quot;corners first&quot; methods or combinations of several other methods. In 1982, David Singmaster and Alexander Frey hypothesised that the number of moves needed to solve the Cube, given an ideal algorithm, might be in &quot;the low twenties&quot;. In 2007, Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman used computer search methods to demonstrate that any 3×3×3 Rubik&#x27;s Cube configuration can be solved in 26 moves or fewer.
In 2008, Tomas Rokicki lowered that number to 22 moves, and in July 2010, a team of researchers including Rokicki, working with computers provided by Google, proved that the so-called &quot;God&#x27;s number&quot; for Rubik&#x27;s Cube is 20. This means that all initial configurations can be solved in 20 moves or less, and some (in fact millions) require 20. More generally, it has been shown that an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; Rubik&#x27;s Cube can be solved optimally in Θ(&quot;n&quot;2 / log(&quot;n&quot;)) moves.

===Speedcubing methods===
A solution commonly used by speedcubers was developed by Jessica Fridrich. This method is called CFOP standing for &quot;Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL&quot;. It is similar to the layer-by-layer method but employs the use of a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross is solved first, followed by first layer corners and second layer edges simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece, thus completing the first two layers (F2L). This is then followed by orienting the last layer, then permuting the last layer (OLL and PLL respectively). There are a total of 120 algorithms for Fridrich&#x27;s method, however they are not all required to use the CFOP method. Most dedicated cubers will learn as many of these algorithms as possible, and most advanced cubers know all of them. If a cuber knows every algorithm for OLL they may be described as knowing full OLL. It is the same for PLL and F2L.

A now well-known method was developed by Lars Petrus. In this method, a 2×2×2 section is solved first, followed by a 2×2×3, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a three-move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a possible 32-move algorithm later. The principle behind this is that in layer-by-layer, one must constantly break and fix the completed layer(s); the 2×2×2 and 2×2×3 sections allow three or two layers (respectively) to be turned without ruining progress. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves. For this reason, the method is also popular for fewest move competitions.

The Roux Method, developed by Gilles Roux, is similar to the Petrus method in that it relies on block building rather than layers, but derives from corners-first methods. In Roux, a 3×2×1 block is solved, followed by another 3×2×1 on the opposite side. Next, the corners of the top layer are solved. The cube can then be solved using only moves of the U layer and M slice.

===Beginners&#x27; methods===
Most beginner solution methods involve solving the cube one layer at a time (&quot;layer-by-layer&quot; method or &quot;beginner&#x27;s method&quot;), using algorithms that preserve what has already been solved. The easiest layer by layer methods require only 3–8 algorithms.

In 1981, thirteen-year-old Patrick Bossert developed a solution for solving the cube, along with a graphical notation, designed to be easily understood by novices. It was subsequently published as &quot;You Can Do The Cube&quot; and became a best-seller.

In 1997, Denny Dedmore published a solution described using diagrammatic icons representing the moves to be made, instead of the usual notation.

Philip Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Solution to Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot; takes a different approach, averaging only 65 twists yet requiring the memorisation of only two algorithms. The cross is solved first, followed by the remaining edges (using the Edge Piece Series FR&#x27;F&#x27;R), then five corners (using the Corner Piece Series URU&#x27;L&#x27;UR&#x27;U&#x27;L, which is the same as the typical last layer corner permutation algorithm), and finally the last three corners.
===Rubik&#x27;s Cube solver programs===
The most move optimal online Rubik&#x27;s Cube solver programs use Herbert Kociemba&#x27;s two-phase algorithm which can typically determine a solution of 20 moves or fewer. The user has to set the colour configuration of the scrambled cube, and the program returns the steps required to solve it.

==Competitions and records==
===Speedcubing competitions===

Speedcubing (or speedsolving) is the practice of trying to solve a Rubik&#x27;s Cube in the shortest time possible. There are a number of speedcubing competitions that take place around the world.

A speedcubing championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich on 13 March 1981. The contest used standardised scrambling and fixed inspection times, and the winners were Ronald Brinkmann and Jury Fröschl with times of 38.0 seconds. The first world championship was the 1982 World Rubik&#x27;s Cube Championship held in Budapest on 5 June 1982, which was won by Minh Thai, a Vietnamese student from Los Angeles, with a time of 22.95 seconds.

Since 2003, the winner of a competition is determined by taking the average time of the middle three of five attempts. However, the single best time of all tries is also recorded.
The World Cube Association maintains a history of world records.
In 2004, the WCA made it mandatory to use a special timing device called a Stackmat timer.

In addition to the main 3x3x3 event, the WCA also holds events where the cube is solved in different ways:
* Blindfolded solving
* Multiple blindfolded solving, or &quot;multi-blind&quot;, in which the contestant solves any number of cubes blindfolded in a row
* Solving the cube using a single hand, or one handed solving
* Solving the cube in the fewest possible moves

In blindfolded solving, the contestant first studies the scrambled cube (i.e., looking at it normally with no blindfold), and is then blindfolded before beginning to turn the cube&#x27;s faces. Their recorded time for this event includes both the time spent memorizing the cube and the time spent manipulating it.

In multiple blindfolded solving, all of the cubes are memorised, and then all of the cubes are solved once blindfolded; thus, the main challenge is memorising many – often ten or more – separate cubes. The event is scored not by time but by the number of points achieved after the one-hour time limit has elapsed. The number of points achieved is equal to the number of cubes solved correctly, minus the number of cubes unsolved after the end of the attempt, where a greater number of points is better. If multiple competitors achieve the same number of points, rankings are assessed based on the total time of the attempt, with a shorter time being better.

In fewest moves solving, the contestant is given one hour to find a solution and must write it down.

===Records===
====Competition records====

:On 4 November 2012, 3248 people, mainly students of the College of Engineering Pune, successfully solved Rubik&#x27;s cube in 30 minutes on college ground. The successful attempt is recorded in the Limca Book of Records. The college will submit the relevant data, witness statements and video of the event to Guinness authorities.

=== Top 10 solvers by single solve ===
==Variations==

There are many different variations of Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. The most common class of variants changes the &quot;order&quot; of the cube, defined by the number of layers in each dimension or equivalently by the number of pieces along each edge (including corners). The 2×2×2 (Pocket/Mini Cube), the standard 3×3×3 cube, the 4×4×4 (Rubik&#x27;s Revenge/Master Cube), and the 5×5×5 (Professor&#x27;s Cube) are the most well known, as they are all available under the official Rubik&#x27;s brand. The WCA sanctions speedsolving competitions for cube orders up to 7×7×7. These &quot;big cubes&quot; represent about the limit of practicality for the purpose of competitive speedsolving, as the cubes become increasingly ungainly and prone to mechanical failure (such as &quot;popping&quot;, where one or more pieces become dislodged from the puzzle), and average solve times increase quadratically with each larger order, in proportion to the number of total &quot;facelets&quot; of the cube.

Even larger cubes based on the V-Cube patents are commercially available to the mass-market from non-licensed manufacturers, most of them Chinese firms which also produce popular cubes designed for speed-solving. The 17×17×17 &quot;Over the Top&quot; cube (available late 2011) was until December 2017 the largest commercially sold cube, and the most expensive, costing over US$2000. A mass-produced 17×17×17 was later introduced by the Chinese manufacturer YuXin. A working design for a 22×22×22 cube exists and was demonstrated in January 2016, and a 33×33×33 in December 2017, though designs this large are not currently mass-produced. Chinese manufacturer ShengShou has been producing cubes in all sizes from 2×2×2 to 15×15×15 (as of May 2020), and has also come out with a 17×17×17. The largest currently mass-produced cube is 21×21×21, made by MoYu beginning in 2021, and costing between $1100 and $1600.

There are many variations of the original cube, some of which are made by Rubik. The mechanical products include Rubik&#x27;s Magic, 360, and Twist. There are electronic variants such as Rubik&#x27;s Revolution and Slide that were also inspired by the original. One of the 3×3×3 Cube variants is Rubik&#x27;s TouchCube. Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand. The TouchCube was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York on 15 February 2009.

The Cube has inspired an entire category of similar puzzles, commonly referred to as &quot;twisty puzzles&quot;, which includes the cubes of different sizes mentioned above, as well as various other geometric shapes. Some such shapes include the tetrahedron (Pyraminx), the octahedron (Skewb Diamond), the dodecahedron (Megaminx), and the icosahedron (Dogic). There are also puzzles that change shape such as Rubik&#x27;s Snake and the Square One.

In 2011, Guinness World Records awarded the &quot;largest order Rubiks magic cube&quot; to a 17×17×17 cube, made by Oskar van Deventer. On 2 December 2017, Grégoire Pfennig announced that he had broken this record, with a 33×33×33 cube, and that his claim had been submitted to Guinness for verification. On 8 April 2018, Grégoire Pfennig announced another world record, the 2x2x50 cube. Whether this is a replacement for the 33×33×33 record, or an additional record, remains to be seen.

Some puzzles have also been created in the shape of Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra, such as Alexander&#x27;s Star (a great dodecahedron). Grégoire Pfennig has also created at least one puzzle in the shape of a small stellated dodecahedron.

===Custom-built puzzles===
Puzzles have been built resembling Rubik&#x27;s Cube, or based on its inner workings. For example, a cuboid is a puzzle based on Rubik&#x27;s Cube, but with different functional dimensions, such as 2×2×4, 2×3×4, and 3×3×5.

Other Rubik&#x27;s Cube modifications include &quot;shape mods&quot;, cubes that have been extended or truncated to form a new shape. An example of this is the Trabjer&#x27;s Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3×3×3. Most shape modifications can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of Tony Fisher&#x27;s Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3×3×3, 4×4×4, 5×5×5, and 6×6×6 versions of the puzzle.

=== Rubik&#x27;s Cube software ===
Puzzles, like Rubik&#x27;s Cube, can be simulated by computer software to provide very large puzzles that are impractical to build, as well as virtual puzzles that cannot be physically built, such as many higher dimensional analogues of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.

===Chrome Cube Lab===
Google has released the Chrome Cube Lab in association with Ernő Rubik. The site has various interactive objects based on Rubik&#x27;s Cube. Customised versions of Rubik&#x27;s Cube can be created and uploaded.

==Exhibits and art==

Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Google designed an interactive exhibit based on the Rubik&#x27;s Cube. It opened in April 2014 in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Cube&#x27;s invention before traveling internationally for seven years. Exhibition elements include a 35-foot-tall rooftop cube made of lights that people can manipulate with their cellphones, a $2.5 million cube made of diamonds, a giant walk-in cube displaying the inner workings of the puzzle, and cube-solving robots.

Probably from the earliest days of the Rubik&#x27;s Cube craze in the 1980s people have assembled cubes to form simple art pieces, several early &#x27;Folk Artists&#x27; are noted for their work. Rubik&#x27;s Cubes have also been the subject of several pop art installations. Owing to their popularity as a children&#x27;s toy several artists and groups have created large Rubik&#x27;s Cubes.

Tony Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;Alamo&quot; (The &quot;Astor Place Cube&quot;) is a spinnable statue of a Cube standing in New York City. Once the cube was covered with coloured panels so that it resembled a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. Similarly, the University of Michigan students covered &quot;Endover&quot; creating a large Rubik&#x27;s Cube on the University of Michigan&#x27;s Central Campus for April Fool&#x27;s Day in 2008.

===Rubik&#x27;s Cubism===
Beyond the Folk Art of the 1980s and 1990s, and the simple replication of a Rubik&#x27;s Cube in oversized form, artists have developed a pointillist art style using the cubes. Rubik&#x27;s Cube Art a.k.a. Rubik&#x27;s Cubism or RubikCubism makes use of a standard Rubik&#x27;s Cube, a popular puzzle toy of the 1980s.

The earliest recorded artworks appear to have been created by Fred Holly, a legally blind man in his 60s in the mid-1980s. These early pieces focus on geometrics and colour patterns. There does not appear to be other recorded art pieces until the mid-1990s by cube aficionados involved in the puzzle and game industry.
The Folk art form reached another level of its evolution with the development and maturity into a Pop art form consisting of pointillist Cube Art renderings. The street artist who uses the alias &quot;Invader&quot; or &quot;Space Invader&quot; started exhibiting pointillist pieces, including one of a man behind a desk and Mario Bros, using Rubik&#x27;s Cube in June 2005 in an exhibition named &#x27;Rubik Cubism&#x27; at Sixspace in Los Angeles. Prior to this exhibition the artist had used Rubik&#x27;s Cubes to create giant Space Invaders. Another artist includes Robbie Mackinnon of Toronto Canada with earliest published work in 2007 who claims to have developed his pointillist Cube Art years earlier while being a teacher in China. Robbie Mackinnon&#x27;s work has been exhibited in Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not and focussed on using pop-art, while Space Invader has exhibited his Cube Art alongside mosaic Space Invaders in commercial and public galleries.

In 2010 artist Pete Fecteau created &quot;Dream Big&quot;, a tribute to &quot;Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; using 4,242 officially licensed Rubik&#x27;s Cubes. Fecteau also worked with the organization You Can Do The Rubik&#x27;s Cube to create two separate guides designed to teach school children how to create Rubik&#x27;s Cube mosaics from templates which he also created.

===Music===

Italian composer Maria Mannone created a cube called &quot;CubeHarmonic&quot; which has musical note names on its facets, creating different chord structures depending on its configuration.

<text>The Red Army Faction (, ; RAF ), also known as the Baader–Meinhof Group or Baader–Meinhof Gang ( ), was a West German far-left militant group founded in 1970 and active until 1998. The RAF described itself as a communist and anti-imperialist urban guerrilla group. It was engaged in armed resistance against what it considered a fascist state. Members of the RAF generally used the Marxist–Leninist term &quot;faction&quot; when they wrote in English. Early leadership included Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof, Gudrun Ensslin, and Horst Mahler. The West German government considered the RAF a terrorist organization.

The RAF engaged in a series of bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, bank robberies, and shootouts with police over the course of three decades. Its activities peaked in late 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as the &quot;German Autumn&quot;. The RAF has been held responsible for 34 deaths, including industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, the Dresdner Bank head Jürgen Ponto, federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback, police officers, American servicemen stationed in Germany, as well as many cases of collateral damage, such as chauffeurs and bodyguards, with many others injured throughout its almost thirty years of activity; 26 RAF members or supporters were killed. Although better-known, the RAF conducted fewer attacks than the Revolutionary Cells, which is held responsible for 296 bomb attacks, arson and other attacks between 1973 and 1995. The group was motivated by leftist political concerns and the perceived failure of their parents&#x27; generation to confront Germany&#x27;s Nazi past, and received support from Stasi and other Eastern Bloc security services.

Sometimes, the group is talked about in terms of generations:
* the &quot;first generation&quot;, which consisted of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof and others;
* the &quot;second generation&quot;, after the majority of the first generation was arrested in 1972.
* the &quot;third generation&quot;, which existed in the 1980s and 1990s up to 1998, after the first generation died in Stammheim maximum security prison in 1977.

On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency, signed &quot;RAF&quot; with the submachine-gun red star, declaring that the group had dissolved. In 1999, after a robbery in Duisburg, evidence pointing to Ernst-Volker Staub and Daniela Klette was found, causing an official investigation into a re-founding.

== Name ==
The usual translation into English is the &quot;Red Army Faction&quot;; however, the founders wanted it to reflect not a splinter group but rather an embryonic militant unit that was embedded, in or part of, a wider communist workers&#x27; movement, i.e., a &quot;fraction&quot; of a whole.

The group always called itself the , never the Baader–Meinhof Group or Baader–Meinhof Gang. The name refers to all incarnations of the organization: the &quot;first generation&quot; RAF, which consisted of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and others; the &quot;second generation&quot; RAF; and the &quot;third generation&quot; RAF, which existed in the 1980s and 90s. The terms &quot;Baader–Meinhof Gang&quot; and &quot;Baader–Meinhof Group&quot; were first used by the media and the government. The group never used these names to refer to itself, because it viewed itself as a co-founded group consisting of numerous members and not a group with two figureheads.

== Background ==

The origins of the group can be traced back to the 1968 student protest movement in West Germany. Industrialised nations in the late 1960s experienced social upheavals related to the maturing of the &quot;baby boomers&quot;, the Cold War, and the end of colonialism. Newly-found youth identity and issues such as racism, women&#x27;s liberation, and anti-imperialism were at the forefront of left-wing politics. Many young people were alienated from their parents and the institutions of the state. The historical legacy of Nazism drove a wedge between the generations and increased suspicion of authoritarian structures in society (some analysts see the same occurring in post-fascism Italy, giving rise to ).

In West Germany there was anger among leftist youth at the post-war denazification in West Germany and East Germany, a process which these leftists perceived as a failure or as ineffective, as former (actual and supposed) Nazis held positions in government and the economy. The Communist Party of Germany had been outlawed since 1956. Elected and appointed government positions down to the local level were often occupied by ex-Nazis. Konrad Adenauer, the first Federal Republic chancellor (in office 1949–1963), had even appointed former Nazi sympathiser Hans Globke as Director of the Federal Chancellery of West Germany (in office 1953–1963).

The radicals regarded the conservative media as biasedat the time conservatives such as Axel Springer, who was implacably opposed to student radicalism, owned and controlled the conservative media including all of the most influential mass-circulation tabloid newspapers. The emergence of the Grand Coalition between the two main parties, the SPD and CDU, with former Nazi Party member Kurt Georg Kiesinger as chancellor, occurred in 1966. This horrified many on the left and was viewed as a monolithic, political marriage of convenience with pro-NATO, pro-capitalist collusion on the part of the social democratic SPD. With about 90% of the Bundestag controlled by the coalition, an Extra-Parliamentary Opposition (APO) was formed with the intent of generating protest and political activity outside of government. In 1972 a law was passedthe that banned radicals or those with a &quot;questionable&quot; political persuasion from public sector jobs.

Student activists, who associated older generations of Germans with Nazism, argued against peaceful reconciliation:
The radicalized were, like many in the New Left, influenced by:
* Sociological developments, together with the background of counter-cultural movements.
* Post-war writings on class society and empire as well as contemporary Marxist critiques from many revolutionaries such as Frantz Fanon, Ho Chi Minh, and Che Guevara, as well as early Autonomism.
* Philosophers associated with the Frankfurt school (Jürgen Habermas, Herbert Marcuse, and Oskar Negt in particular) and associated Marxist philosophers.

RAF founder Ulrike Meinhof had a long history in the Communist Party. Holger Meins had studied film and was a veteran of the Berlin revolt; his short feature &quot;How To Produce A Molotov Cocktail&quot; was seen by huge audiences. Jan Carl Raspe lived at the Kommune 2; Horst Mahler was an established lawyer but also at the center of the anti-Springer revolt from the beginning. From their personal experiences and assessments of the socio-economic situation, they soon became more specifically influenced by Leninism and Maoism, calling themselves &quot;Marxist–Leninist&quot; though they effectively added to or updated this ideological tradition. RAF frequently cited Mao Zedong in its public statements, especially in its early years. One of the Maoist doctrines emphasized by the group was the importance of organizing political resistance to bourgeois society, and that armed struggle from the fringes of society will bring the revolution into mainstream society as well, with the bourgeois state revealing its oppressive apparatus by overreacting to fringe groups and their activities. A contemporaneous critique of the Red Army Faction&#x27;s view of the state, published in a pirate edition of , ascribed to it &quot;state-fetishism&quot;an ideologically obsessive misreading of bourgeois dynamics and the nature and role of the state in post-WWII societies, including West Germany.

It is claimed that property destruction during the Watts riots in the United States in 1965 influenced the practical and ideological approach of the RAF founders, as well as some of those in Situationist circles. According to one former RAF member, in meetings with KGB in Dresden the group was also met by Vladimir Putin, then KGB resident in East Germany. In these meetings RAF members would discuss weapons that were needed for their activities, and pass a &quot;shopping list&quot; to the KGB.

The writings of Antonio Gramsci and Herbert Marcuse were drawn upon. Gramsci wrote on power, cultural, and ideological conflicts in society and institutionsreal-time class struggles playing out in rapidly developing industrial nation states through interlinked areas of political behavior. Marcuse wrote on coercion and hegemony in that cultural indoctrination and ideological manipulation through the means of communication (&quot;repressive tolerance&quot;) dispensed with the need for complete brute force in modern &#x27;liberal democracies&#x27;. His &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot; was addressed to the restive students of the sixties. Marcuse argued that only marginal groups of students and poor alienated workers could effectively resist the system. Both Gramsci and Marcuse came to the conclusion that analyzing the ideological underpinnings and the &#x27;superstructure&#x27; of society was vitally important to understanding class control (and acquiescence). This Gramscian and Marcusian contribution could perhaps be seen as an extension of Marx&#x27;s work, as he did not cover this area in detail. , his mainly economic work, was meant to be one of a series of books which would have included one on society and one on the state, but his death prevented fulfillment of this.

Many of the radicals felt that Germany&#x27;s lawmakers were continuing authoritarian policies from the country’s past and that the public&#x27;s apparent acquiescence to these policies was a consequence of the indoctrination that the Nazis had pioneered and implemented in German society (). The Federal Republic was exporting arms to African dictatorships, which the radicals viewed as supporting the war in Southeast Asia and engineering the remilitarization of Germany with the U.S.-led entrenchment against the Warsaw Pact nations.

The ongoing events further catalyzed the situation. Protests turned into riots on 2 June 1967, when Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, visited West Berlin. There were protesters but also hundreds of supporters of the Shah, as well as a group of fake supporters armed with wooden staves, there to disturb the normal course of the visit. These extremists beat the protesters. After a day of angry protests by exiled Iranian radical Marxists, a group widely supported by German students, the Shah visited the Berlin Opera, where a crowd of German student protesters gathered. During the opera house demonstrations, German student Benno Ohnesorg was shot in the head by a police officer while attending his first protest rally. The officer, Karl-Heinz Kurras, was acquitted in a subsequent trial. It was later discovered that Kurras had been a member of the West Berlin communist party SEW and had also worked for the Stasi, though there is no indication that Kurras&#x27; killing of Ohnesorg was under anyone&#x27;s, including the Stasi&#x27;s, orders.

Along with perceptions of state and police brutality, and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War, Ohnesorg&#x27;s death galvanized many young Germans and became a rallying point for the West German New Left. The Berlin 2 June Movement, a militant-Anarchist group, later took its name to honor the date of Ohnesorg&#x27;s death.

On 2 April 1968, Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader, joined by Thorwald Proll and Horst Söhnlein, set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt as a protest against the Vietnam war. They were arrested two days later.

On 11 April 1968, Rudi Dutschke, a leading spokesman for protesting students, was shot in the head in an assassination attempt by the right-wing sympathizer Josef Bachmann. Although badly injured, Dutschke returned to political activism with the German Green Party before his death in a bathtub in 1979, as a consequence of his injuries.

Axel Springer&#x27;s populist newspaper , which had run headlines such as &quot;Stop Dutschke now!&quot;, was accused of being the chief culprit in inciting the shooting. Meinhof commented, &quot;If one sets a car on fire, that is a criminal offence. If one sets hundreds of cars on fire, that is political action.&quot;

== Formation ==


All four of the defendants charged with arson and endangering human life were convicted, for which they were sentenced to three years in prison. In June 1969, however, they were temporarily paroled under an amnesty for political prisoners, but in November of that year, the Federal Constitutional Court () demanded that they return to custody. Only Horst Söhnlein complied with the order; the rest went underground and made their way to France, where they stayed for a time in a house owned by prominent French journalist and revolutionary Régis Debray, famous for his friendship with Che Guevara and the theory of guerrilla warfare. Eventually they made their way to Italy, where the lawyer Mahler visited them and encouraged them to return to Germany with him to form an underground guerrilla group.

The Red Army Faction was formed with the intention of complementing the plethora of revolutionary and radical groups across West Germany and Europe, as a more class conscious and determined force compared with some of its contemporaries. The members and supporters were already associated with the &#x27;Revolutionary Cells&#x27; and 2 June Movement as well as radical currents and phenomena such as the Socialist Patients&#x27; Collective, , and the Situationists.

Baader was arrested again in April 1970, but on 14 May 1970 he was freed by Meinhof and others. Less than a month later, Gudrun Ensslin wrote an article in a West Berlin underground paper by the name of &quot;Agit883&quot; (&quot;Magazine for Agitation and Social Practice&quot;), demanding a call to arms and a building of the Red Army. The article ended with the words, &quot;Develop the class struggles. Organize the proletariat. Start the armed resistance!&quot; Baader, Ensslin, Mahler, and Meinhof then went to Jordan, where they trained with Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) guerrillas and looked to the Palestinian cause for inspiration and guidance. But RAF organization and outlook were also partly modeled on the Uruguayan Tupamaros movement, which had developed as an urban resistance movement, effectively inverting Che Guevara&#x27;s Mao-like concept of a peasant or rural-based guerrilla war and instead situating the struggle in the metropole or cities.

Many members of the RAF operated through a single contact or only knew others by their codenames. Actions were carried out by active units called &#x27;commandos&#x27;, with trained members being supplied by a quartermaster in order to carry out their mission. For more long-term or core cadre members, isolated cell-like organization was absent or took on a more flexible form.

In 1969 the Brazilian revolutionary Carlos Marighella published his &quot;Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla&quot;. He described the urban guerrilla as:
The importance of small arms training, sabotage, expropriation, and a substantial safehouse/support base among the urban population was stressed in Marighella&#x27;s guide. This publication was an antecedent to Meinhof&#x27;s &quot;The Urban Guerrilla Concept&quot; and has subsequently influenced many guerrilla and insurgent groups around the globe. Although some of the Red Army Faction&#x27;s supporters and operatives could be described as having an anarchist or libertarian communist slant, the group&#x27;s leading members professed a largely Marxist–Leninist ideology. That said, they shied away from overt collaboration with communist states, arguing along the lines of the Chinese side in the Sino-Soviet split that the Soviet Union and its European satellite states had become traitors to the communist cause by, in effect if not in rhetoric, giving the United States a free pass in their exploitation of Third World populations and support of &quot;useful&quot; Third World dictators. Nevertheless, RAF members did receive intermittent support and sanctuary over the border in East Germany during the 1980s.

=== Anti-imperialism and public support ===
When they returned to West Germany, they began what they called an &quot;anti-imperialistic struggle&quot;, with bank robberies to raise money and bomb attacks against U.S. military facilities, German police stations, and buildings belonging to the Axel Springer press empire. In 1970, a manifesto authored by Meinhof used the name &quot;RAF&quot; and the red star logo with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun for the first time.

After an intense manhunt, Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, Meins, and Raspe were eventually caught and arrested in June 1972.

== Custody and the Stammheim trial ==

After the arrest of the protagonists of the first generation of the RAF, they were held in solitary confinement in the newly constructed high security Stammheim Prison north of Stuttgart. When Ensslin devised an &quot;info system&quot; using aliases for each member (names deemed to have allegorical significance from &quot;Moby Dick&quot;), the four prisoners were able to communicate, circulating letters with the help of their defense counsel.

To protest against their treatment by authorities, they went on several coordinated hunger strikes; eventually, they were force-fed.
Holger Meins died of self-induced starvation on 9 November 1974. After public protests, their conditions were somewhat improved by the authorities.

The so-called second generation of the RAF emerged at that time, consisting of sympathizers independent of the inmates. On 27 February 1975, Peter Lorenz, the CDU candidate for mayor of Berlin, was kidnapped by the 2 June Movement as part of pressure to secure the release of several non-RAF detainees, alongside estranged member Horst Mahler (who declined to be freed). Since none of these were on trial for murder, the state agreed, and those inmates (and later Lorenz himself) were released.

According to Aust, the success of this operation led to the RAF themselves to attempt their own exchange: on 24 April 1975, the West German embassy in Stockholm was seized by members of the RAF; two of the hostages were murdered as the German government under Chancellor Helmut Schmidt refused to give in to their demands. Two of the hostage-takers died from injuries they suffered when the explosives they planted detonated later that night.

On 21 May 1975, the Stammheim trial of Baader, Ensslin, Meinhof, and Raspe began, named after the district in Stuttgart where it took place. The Bundestag had earlier changed the Code of Criminal Procedure so that several of the attorneys who were accused of serving as links between the inmates and the RAF&#x27;s second generation could be excluded.

On 9 May 1976, Ulrike Meinhof was found dead in her prison cell, hanging from a rope made from jail towels. An investigation concluded that she had hanged herself, a result hotly contested at the time, triggering a plethora of conspiracy theories. Alternative theories suggest that she took her life because she was being ostracized by the rest of the group. Her comrades consistently denied this hypothesis, repudiating alleged jailhouse recordings cited as evidence.

During the trial, more attacks took place. One of these was on 7 April 1977, when Federal Prosecutor Siegfried Buback, his driver, and his bodyguard were shot and killed by two RAF members while waiting at a red traffic light. Buback, who had been a Nazi member during WWII, was considered by RAF as one of the key persons for their trial. Among other things, two years earlier, while being interviewed by &quot;Stern&quot; magazine, he stated that &quot;Persons like Baader don&#x27;t deserve a fair trial.&quot; In February 1976, when interviewed by he stated that &quot;We do not need regulation of our jurisdiction, national security survives thanks to people like me and Herold [chief of BKA], who always find the right way&quot;.

Eventually, on 28 April 1977, the trial&#x27;s 192nd day, the three remaining defendants were convicted of several murders, more attempted murders, and of forming a terrorist organization; they were sentenced to life imprisonment.

=== Security measures ===
A new section of Stammheim Prison was built especially for the RAF and was considered one of the most secure prison blocks around the world at the time. The prisoners were transferred there in 1975 (three years after their arrest). The roof and the courtyard were covered with steel mesh. During the night, the precinct was illuminated by 54 spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special military forces, including snipers, guarded the roof. Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building. The mounted police officers rotated on a double shift. One hundred more GSG-9 tactical police officers reinforced the police during the trial while BKA detectives guarded the front of the court area. Finally, helicopters overflew the area.

During the trial, accredited media correspondents had to pass a police road block 400 meters from the court. The police noted their data and the number-plate and photographed their cars. After that they had to pass three verification audits, and finally they were undressed and two judicial officials thoroughly searched their bodies. They were allowed to keep only a pencil and a notepad inside the court. Their personal items including their identity papers were withheld by the authorities during the trial. Every journalist could attend the trial only twice (two days). &quot;The Times&quot; questioned the possibility whether a fair trial could be conducted under these circumstances which involved siege-like conditions. wondered whether that atmosphere anticipated &quot;the condemnation of the defendants who were allegedly responsible for the emergency measures&quot;.

While the trial progressed, the prisoners received visits from lawyers (and on rare occasions relatives; friends were not allowed). For those visits, three jailers were always present to observe the conversations between prisoners and visitors. The prisoners were not allowed to meet each other inside the prison, until late 1975 when a regular meeting time was established (30 minutes, twice per day), during which they were guarded.

=== Trial ===
The judges and their pasts are considered important by supporters of the accused. Judge Weiss (Mahler&#x27;s trial) had judged Joachim Raese (president of the Third Reich&#x27;s court) as innocent seven times. When he threatened Meinhof that she would be put into a glass cage she answered caustically, &quot;So you are threatening me with Eichmann&#x27;s cage, fascist?&quot; (Adolf Eichmann who was an in the SS, was held inside a glass cage during his trial in Israel.) Siegfried Buback, the RAF&#x27;s main trial judge in Stammheim, had been a Nazi Party member. Along with Federal Prosecutor Heinrich Wunder (who served as senior government official in the Ministry of Defense), Buback had ordered the arrest of Rudolf Augstein and other journalists regarding the affair in 1962. Theodor Prinzing was accused by defense attorney Otto Schily of having been appointed arbitrarily, displacing other judges.

At several points in the Stammheim trial, microphones were turned off while defendants were speaking. They were often expelled from the hall, and other actions were taken. It was later revealed that the conversation they had between themselves as well as with their attorneys were recorded. Finally it was reported by both the defendants&#x27; attorneys and some of the prison&#x27;s doctors that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they could not attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately. By the time the Stammheim trial began in early 1975, some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years.

Two former members of the RAF, Karl-Heinz Ruhland and Gerhard Müller, testified under BKA&#x27;s orders, as revealed later. Their statements were often contradictory, something that was also commented on in the newspapers. Ruhland himself later reported to that his deposition was prepared in cooperation with police. Müller was reported to &quot;break&quot; during the third hunger strike in the winter of 1974–1975 which lasted 145 days. The prosecution offered him immunity for the murder of officer Norbert Schmidt in Hamburg (1971), and blamed Baader, Meinhof, Ensslin, and Raspe instead. He was eventually freed and relocated to the US after getting a new identity and 500,000 Deutsche Marks.

==== Lawyers&#x27; arrests ====
The government hastily approved several special laws for use during the Stammheim trial. Lawyers were excluded from trial for the first time since 1945, after being accused of various inappropriate actions, such as helping to form criminal organizations (Section 129, Criminal Law). The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers&#x27; offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel boasted that no other Western state had such extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from a trial. Klaus Croissant, Hans-Christian Ströbele, Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years, were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June 1975, Croissant, Ströbele (who had already been expelled), and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys&#x27; offices and homes, seizing documents and files. Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for four and eight weeks respectively. Croissant had to pay 80,000 Deutsche Marks and report weekly to a police station, and his transport and identity papers were seized.

The defense lawyers and prisoners were not the only ones affected by measures adopted for the RAF trial. On 26 November 1974 an unprecedented mobilization by police and GSG-9 units arrested 23 suspected RAF members, invaded of dozens of homes, left-wing bookstores, and meeting places, and made arrests. No guerrillas were found. BKA&#x27;s chief, Horst Herold stated that despite the fact that &quot;large-scale operations usually don&#x27;t bring practical results, the impression of the crowd is always a considerable advantage&quot;.

On 16 February 1979 Croissant was arrested (on the accusation of supporting a criminal organization – section 129) after France denied his request for political asylum, and was sentenced to a prison term of two and half years to be served in Stammheim prison.

=== Defense strategy ===
The general approach by defendants and their attorneys was to highlight the political purpose and characteristics of the RAF.

On 13 and 14 January 1976 the defendants readied their testimony (about 200 pages), in which they analyzed the role of imperialism and its fight against the revolutionary movements in the countries of the &quot;third world&quot;. They also expounded the fascistization of West Germany and its role as an imperialistic state (in alliance with the U.S. over Vietnam). Finally they talked about the task of urban guerrillas and undertook the political responsibility for the bombing attacks. Finally their lawyers (following Ulrike Meinhof&#x27;s proposal) requested that the accused be officially regarded as prisoners of war.

On 4 May (five days before Meinhof&#x27;s death) the four defendants demanded to be allowed to provide data about the Vietnam War. They claimed that because the military intervention in Vietnam by the U.S. (and, indirectly, the FRG) had violated international law, the U.S. military bases in West Germany were justifiable targets of international retaliation. They requested several politicians (like Richard Nixon and Helmut Schmidt) as well as some former U.S. agents (who were willing to testify) to be called as witnesses.

Later when their requests were rejected, U.S. agents Barton Osbourne (ex-CIA, ex-member of the Phoenix Program), G. Peck (NSA), and Gary Thomas gave extensive interviews (organized by defense lawyers) on 23 June 1976 where they explained how FRG support was crucial for U.S. operations in Vietnam. Peck concluded that the RAF &quot;was the response to criminal aggression of the U.S. government in Indochina and the assistance of the German government. The real terrorist was my government.&quot; Thomas presented data about the joint operations of FRG and U.S. secret services in Eastern Europe. He had also observed the Stammheim trial and referred to a CIA instructor teaching them how to make a murder look like a suicide. These statements were confirmed by the CIA case officer Philip Agee.

== Criminal acts ==
The RAF has been associated with various serious criminal acts (including bombings, kidnappings and murder) since their founding. The first criminal act attributed to the group after the student Benno Ohnesorg had been killed by a policeman in 1967 was the bombing of the Kaufhaus Schneider department store. On 2 April 1968, affiliates of the group firebombed the store and caused an estimated US$200,000 in property damage. Prominent members of the bombing included Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, two of the founders of the RAF. The bombs detonated at midnight when no one was in the store and no one was injured. As the bombs ignited, Gudrun Ensslin was at a nearby payphone, yelling to the German Press Agency, &quot;This is a political act of revenge.&quot;

On 11 May 1972, the RAF placed three pipe bombs at a United States headquarters in Frankfurt. The bombing resulted in the death of a US officer and the injury of 13 other people. The stated reason for the bombing was a political statement in protest of US imperialism, specifically, a protest of US mining of North Vietnam harbours.

On 19 May 1972, members of the RAF armed five bombs in the Springer publishing house in Hamburg. Only three of the five bombs exploded, but 36 people were injured.

On 24 May 1972, two weeks after the bombing of the United States headquarters in Frankfurt, the group set off a car bomb at the IDHS (Intelligence Data Handling Service) Building at Campbell Barracks in Heidelberg. The bombing resulted in the deaths of three soldiers and the injury of five others.

On 10 November 1974, the group killed Günter von Drenkmann, the president of Germany&#x27;s superior court of justice. The killing occurred after a string of events that led to a failed kidnapping by the 2 June Movement, a group that splintered off the RAF after the death of Holger Meins by hunger strike in prison.

Starting in February 1975 and continuing through March 1975, the 2 June Movement kidnapped Peter Lorenz, who at the time was the Christian Democratic candidate in the race for the mayor of West Berlin. In exchange for the release of Lorenz, the group demanded that several RAF and 2 June Movement members that were imprisoned for reasons other than violence be released from jail. The government obliged and released several of these members for the safe release of Lorenz.

On 24 April 1975, six members affiliated with the RAF seized the West German Embassy in Stockholm. The group took hostages and set the building to explode. They demanded the release of several imprisoned members of the RAF. The government refused the request, which led to the murder of two of the hostages. A few of the bombs that were intended to blow up the embassy prematurely detonated, which resulted in the death of two of the six RAF affiliates. The other four members eventually surrendered to the authorities.

In May 1975, several British intelligence reports circulated that stated that the RAF had stolen mustard gas from a joint U.S. and British storage facility. The reports also indicated that the RAF had intended to use the stolen gas in German cities. It eventually turned out that the mustard gas canisters were merely misplaced; however, the RAF still successfully capitalized on the news by frightening several different agencies.

In the 1970&#x27;s, the RAF was involved in several raids, taking advantage of Switzerland’s loosely guarded military armories. According to the source, the group was involved in the theft of 200 Swiss rifles, 500 revolvers, and 400 large grenades.

During the early 1980s, German and French newspapers reported that the police had raided an RAF safe house in Paris and had found a makeshift laboratory that contained flasks full of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, which makes botulinum toxin. These reports were later found to be incorrect; no such lab was ever found.

== German Autumn ==

On 30 July 1977, Jürgen Ponto, the head of Dresdner Bank, was shot and killed in front of his house in Oberursel in a botched kidnapping. Those involved were Brigitte Mohnhaupt, Christian Klar, and Susanne Albrecht, the sister of Ponto&#x27;s goddaughter.

Following the convictions, Hanns Martin Schleyer, a former officer of the SS who was then President of the German Employers&#x27; Association (and thus one of the most powerful industrialists in West Germany), was abducted in a violent kidnapping. On 5 September 1977, Schleyer&#x27;s convoy was stopped by the kidnappers reversing a car into the path of Schleyer&#x27;s vehicle, causing the Mercedes in which he was being driven to crash. Once the convoy was stopped, five masked assailants immediately shot and killed three policemen and the driver and took Schleyer hostage. One of the group (Sieglinde Hofmann) produced her weapon from a pram she was pushing down the road.

A letter was then received by the federal government, demanding the release of eleven detainees, including those in Stammheim. A crisis committee was formed in Bonn, headed by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, which, instead of acceding, resolved to employ delaying tactics to give the police time to discover Schleyer&#x27;s location. At the same time, a total communication ban was imposed on the prison inmates, who were now allowed visits only from government officials and the prison chaplain.

The crisis dragged on for more than a month, while the Federal Criminal Police Office carried out its biggest investigation to date. Matters escalated when, on 13 October 1977, Lufthansa Flight 181 from Palma de Mallorca to Frankfurt was hijacked. A group of four PFLP members took control of the plane (which was named &quot;Landshut&quot;). The leader introduced himself to the passengers as &quot;Captain Mahmud&quot;, and was later identified as . When the plane landed in Rome for refueling, he issued the same demands as the Schleyer kidnappers, plus the release of two Palestinians held in Turkey and payment of US$15 million.

The Bonn crisis team again decided not to give in. The plane flew on via Larnaca, then Dubai, and then to Aden, where flight captain Jürgen Schumann, whom the hijackers deemed not cooperative enough, was brought before an improvised &quot;revolutionary tribunal&quot; and murdered on 16 October. His body was dumped on the runway. The aircraft again took off, flown by the co-pilot Jürgen Vietor, this time headed for Mogadishu, Somalia.

A high-risk rescue operation was led by Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski, then undersecretary in the chancellor&#x27;s office, who had been secretly flown in from Bonn. At five past midnight CET on 18 October, the plane was stormed in a seven-minute assault by GSG 9, an elite unit of the German federal police. All four hijackers were shot; three of them died on the spot. None of the passengers were seriously hurt and Wischnewski was able to phone Schmidt and tell the Bonn crisis team that the operation had been a success.

=== &quot;Stammheim Death Night&quot; ===
After the conclusion of the Landshut hostage crisis was announced in the late evening of 17 October, all the RAF members incarcerated in Stammheim committed suicide during the following night. Their lawyer, Arndt Müller, had smuggled pistols into the prison. Andreas Baader and Jan-Carl Raspe shot themselves with these weaponsBaader in the back of his head while Gudrun Ensslin hanged herself. Irmgard Möller tried to kill herself with a knife, but survived severely injured. The suicides went unnoticed until early next morning. Doctors were rushed in. Baader and Ensslin were already dead when found. Raspe was still alive and moved to the hospital where he died soon after. Möller recovered after being brought to a hospital. Authorities claimed that the prisonerswho had been held in isolation for weekslearned of the failure of the hijacking through smuggled radio equipment, and coordinated the group suicide over an improvised electronic communication system between their maximum-security cells, which had been under surveillance during previous hostage crises.

The coordinated attempt sparked numerous conspiracy theories. It was alleged that the RAF members did not kill themselves, but instead were killed by the German authorities, the BND, CIA, the United States and NATO. These theories were spread by RAF supporters and sympathizers, and some were taken up by the mainstream press. Available evidence shows that these suicides were planned and prepared for a long time by the RAF members.

On the very same day, Hanns-Martin Schleyer was shot to death by his captors en route to Mulhouse, France. On 19 October, Schleyer&#x27;s kidnappers announced that he had been &quot;executed&quot; and pinpointed his location. His body was recovered later that day in the trunk of a green Audi 100 on Rue Charles Péguy. The French newspaper received a letter declaring:
== RAF since the 1990s ==
The dissolution of the Soviet Union in late December 1991 was a serious blow to Leninist groups, but well into the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name RAF. Among these were the killing of Ernst Zimmermann, CEO of MTU Aero Engines, a German engineering company; another bombing at the US Air Force&#x27;s Rhein-Main Air Base (near Frankfurt), which targeted the base commander and killed two bystanders; a car bomb attack that killed Siemens executive Karl-Heinz Beckurts and his driver; and the shooting of Gerold von Braunmühl, a leading official at Germany&#x27;s foreign ministry.
On 30 November 1989, Deutsche Bank chairman Alfred Herrhausen was killed with a highly complex bomb when his car triggered a photo sensor in Bad Homburg. On 1 April 1991, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, leader of the government organization responsible for the privatization of the East German state economy, was shot and killed. The assassins of Zimmermann, von Braunmühl, Herrhausen, and Rohwedder were never reliably identified.

After German reunification in 1990, it was confirmed that the Stasi, the security and intelligence organization of East Germany, had been monitoring the RAF, and in the 1980s had provided ten ex-members shelter and new identities. This was already generally suspected at the time. In 1978 part of the group was exfiltrated through Yugoslavia to communist Poland to avoid a manhunt in Germany. Brigitte Mohnhaupt, Peter Boock, Rolf Wagner, and Sieglinde Hoffmann spent most of the year in facilities of the Polish Ministry of Public Security in Masuria, northeastern Poland, where they were also going through series of training programs along with others from Arab countries.

In 1992, the German government assessed that the RAF&#x27;s main field of engagement now was missions to release imprisoned RAF members. To weaken the organization further the government declared that some RAF inmates would be released if the RAF refrained from violent attacks in the future. Subsequently, the RAF announced their intention to &quot;de-escalate&quot; and refrain from significant activity.

The last action taken by the RAF took place in 1993 with a bombing of a newly-built prison in Weiterstadt by overcoming the officers on duty and planting explosives. Although no one was seriously injured, this operation caused property damage amounting to 123 million Deutsche Marks (over 50 million euros).

The last big action against the RAF took place on 27 June 1993. An agent of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (the West German domestic intelligence agency) named Klaus Steinmetz had infiltrated the RAF. As a result, Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams were arrested in Bad Kleinen. Grams and GSG 9 officer Michael Newrzella died during the mission. Due to a number of operational mistakes involving the various police services, German Minister of the Interior Rudolf Seiters took responsibility and resigned from his post.

Historians and the German authorities have much more clarity about the names and actions of the first and second generations of the RAF than is the case with the third generation. The lawyer and author Butz Peters describes the third generation of the RAF as a “black box”: The members have learned from the mistakes of the first and second generations. “You were up to date with the latest forensic technology” In addition, you were much more reserved in your actions. “The first generations had many supporters and many members who at some point became soft. The third generation learned from this that they lived very conspiratorially and insularly.”

=== Dissolution ===
On 20 April 1998, an eight-page typewritten letter in German was faxed to the Reuters news agency, signed &quot;RAF&quot; with the machine-gun red star, declaring the group dissolved:

In response to this statement, former BKA President Horst Herold said, &quot;With this statement the Red Army Faction has erected its own tombstone.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Horst Mahler, a founding RAF member, is now a vocal Neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier. In 2005, he was sentenced to six years in prison for incitement to racial hatred against Jews. He is on record as saying (&quot;The enemy is the same&quot;).

In 2007, amidst widespread media controversy, German president Horst Köhler considered pardoning RAF member Christian Klar, who had filed a pardon application several years before. On 7 May 2007, pardon was denied; regular parole was later granted on 24 November 2008. RAF member Brigitte Mohnhaupt was granted release on five-year parole by a German court on 12 February 2007 and Eva Haule was released 17 August 2007.

In 2011, the last imprisoned RAF member, Birgit Hogefeld, was released on parole.

Police in Europe investigating the whereabouts of Ernst-Volker Staub, Burkhard Garweg and Daniela Klette stated that a search had been made in Spain, France and Italy. This followed reports that they could be hiding in the Netherlands in 2017 after being suspected of masterminding robberies in supermarkets and cash transit vehicles in Wolfsburg, Bremen and Cremlingen between 2011 and 2016. On 26 February 2024, Daniela Klette was arrested in Berlin; according to coverage in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Klette&#x27;s arrest followed an investigative TV report about the missing trio, which sparked 250 independent tips to local police about their whereabouts.

According to scholarly research into Stasi documents, RAF members in East Germany were trained and assisted by personnel from the Stasi Arbeitsgruppe des Ministers S.

==In popular culture==
=== Films ===
Numerous West German film and TV productions have been made about the RAF. These include Klaus Lemke&#x27;s telefeature &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Arsonists&quot;, 1969); Volker Schloendorff and Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s co-directed &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (a 1975 adaptation of Heinrich Böll&#x27;s novel &quot;Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum&quot;); &quot;Germany in Autumn&quot; (1978), co-directed by 11 directors, including Alexander Kluge, Volker Schloendorff, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and Edgar Reitz; Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Die dritte Generation&quot; (&quot;The Third Generation&quot;, 1979); Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s &quot;Die bleierne Zeit&quot; (&quot;The German Sisters&quot;/&quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot;, 1981); and Reinhard Hauff&#x27;s &quot;Stammheim&quot; (1986). Post-reunification German films include Christian Petzold&#x27;s &quot;Die innere Sicherheit&quot; (&quot;The State I Am In&quot;, 2000); Kristina Konrad&#x27;s &quot;Grosse Freiheit, Kleine Freiheit&quot; (&quot;Greater Freedom, Lesser Freedom&quot;, 2000); and Christopher Roth&#x27;s &quot;Baader&quot; (2002).

Uli Edel&#x27;s 2008 &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot; (German: &quot;Der Baader Meinhof Komplex&quot;), based on the bestselling book by Stefan Aust, was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in both the 81st Academy Awards and 66th Golden Globe Awards.

Outside Germany, films include Swiss director Markus Imhoof&#x27;s &quot;Die Reise&quot; (&quot;The Journey&quot;) (1986). On TV, there was Heinrich Breloer&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Death Game&quot;) (1997), a two-part docu-drama, and Volker Schloendorff&#x27;s &quot;Die Stille nach dem Schuss&quot; (&quot;The Legend of Rita&quot;) (2000).

There have been several documentaries: &quot;Im Fadenkreuz – Deutschland &amp; die RAF&quot; (1997, several directors); Gerd Conradt&#x27;s &quot;Starbuck Holger Meins&quot; (2001); Andres Veiel&#x27;s &quot;Black Box BRD&quot; (2001); Klaus Stern&#x27;s &quot;Andreas Baader – Der Staatsfeind&quot; (&quot;Enemy of the State&quot;) (2003); Ben Lewis&#x27;s &quot;In Love With Terror&quot;, for BBC Four (2003); and &quot;Ulrike Meinhof – Wege in den Terror&quot; (&quot;Ways into Terror&quot;) (2006).

The 2010 feature documentary &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; tells Ulrike Meinhof&#x27;s story from the perspective of her daughter, journalist and historian Bettina Röhl, while Andres Veiel&#x27;s 2011 feature film &quot;If Not Us, Who?&quot; provides a context for the RAF&#x27;s origins through the perspective of Gudrun Ensslin&#x27;s partner Bernward Vesper. In 2015, Jean-Gabriel Périot released his feature-length, found-footage documentary &quot;A German Youth&quot; on the Red Army Faction.

The 2018 remake of &quot;Suspiria&quot; features a secondary character attempting to run away to join the Red Army Faction, serving as a catalyst for the later events of the film.

=== Fiction and art ===

* Heinrich Böll&#x27;s book &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; (1974) describes the political climate in West Germany during the active phase of the RAF in the seventies. Schlöndorff and Trotta (who knew the leading RAF cadre) filmed the book in 1975.
* Heldon, a French experimental electronic rock band, released a fundraising single entitled &quot;Soutien à la RAF&quot; &quot;(support to the RAF&quot;) with one track named &quot;Baader-Meinhof Blues&quot;
*Brian Eno released a single &#x27;B&#x27; side in 1978, entitled &quot;RAF&quot; (featuring a cut-up tape loop of German dialogue) named after the Red Army Faction.
* &quot;The Professionals&quot; 1978 episode &quot;Close Quarters&quot; features a German terrorist organization known as the &quot;Meyer-Helmut Group&quot;, and was possibly inspired by the RAF.
* Cabaret Voltaire, the industrial band from Sheffield, England, recorded &quot;Baader-Meinhof&quot; that pondered the group&#x27;s importance in history and their motivations.
* The Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum made a painting called &quot;The Murder of Andreas Baader&quot; in 1977–1978, that shows Nerdrum&#x27;s personal commentary to the events in the Stammheim prison.
* Gerhard Richter, a German painter whose series of works entitled &quot;18 October 1977&quot; (1988) repainted photographs of the Faction members and their deaths.
* In 1990, the album &quot;Slap!&quot; by the influential British anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba featured a song titled &quot;Ulrike&quot;, about Ulrike Meinhof and the RAF.
*Tom Clancy&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; features the arrest of RAF members in former Eastern Bloc countries with the cooperation of the democratized Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War as a major plot point. In the book, embittered RAF terrorists ally with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine to procure a lost Israeli atomic bomb to start a nuclear war. After the nuclear detonation on U.S soil, the RAF attempts to launch a ground war in Berlin with a battalion of commandeered tanks, but are wiped out in a matter of hours by the armed forces of a reunified Germany.
* Christoph Hein&#x27;s novel (&quot;In His Early Childhood, a Garden&quot;) deals with a fictionalized aftermath of the Grams shooting in 1993.
* Josef Žáček, a Czech painter, created a series of paintings entitled &quot;Searching in Lost Space 1993&quot; that were inspired by events that had occurred in 1993 in Bad Kleinen.
* In 1996, British singer songwriter Luke Haines released a 9-track album titled &quot;Baader Meinhof&quot;. In this concept album, all songs are a romanticized retelling of the RAF actions.
* Bruce LaBruce&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Raspberry Reich&quot; is an erotic satire of the RAF and of terrorist chic.
* In 2003, The Long Winters released the song &quot;Cinnamon&quot;, about the RAF.
* In 2004, Canadian singer–songwriter Neil Leyton composed and released a song entitled &quot;Ingrid Schubert&quot;.
* Australian–British playwright Van Badham&#x27;s play &quot;Black Hands/Dead Section&quot; provides a fictionalized account of the actions and lives of key members of the RAF. It won the Queensland Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards in 2005.
* The 2005 feature film &quot;See You at Regis Debray&quot;, written and directed by C. S. Leigh, tells the story of the time Andreas Baader spent hiding in the apartment of Régis Debray in Paris in 1969.
* The 2011 album &quot;Amok&quot; by German band Weena Morloch features the song (&quot;The Night of Blunt Knives&quot;, a play on the Night of the Long Knives) which deals with Andreas Baader&#x27;s and Gudrun Ensslin&#x27;s death in prison.

=== Science ===
* The Red Army Faction is the inspiration and namesake for the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, also known as the frequency illusion, a cognitive bias in which a person notices a specific concept, word, or product more frequently after recently becoming aware of it. The name was coined in a 1994 letter to the St. Paul Pioneer Press in which the writer described repeatedly noticing the name of the gang after mentioning it once.

<text>In 3D computer graphics, radiosity is an application of the finite element method to solving the rendering equation for scenes with surfaces that reflect light diffusely. Unlike rendering methods that use Monte Carlo algorithms (such as path tracing), which handle all types of light paths, typical radiosity only account for paths (represented by the code &quot;LD*E&quot;) which leave a light source and are reflected diffusely some number of times (possibly zero) before hitting the eye. Radiosity is a global illumination algorithm in the sense that the illumination arriving on a surface comes not just directly from the light sources, but also from other surfaces reflecting light. Radiosity is viewpoint independent, which increases the calculations involved, but makes them useful for all viewpoints.

Radiosity methods were first developed in about 1950 in the engineering field of heat transfer. They were later refined specifically for the problem of rendering computer graphics in 19841985 by researchers at Cornell University and Hiroshima University.

Notable commercial radiosity engines are Enlighten by Geomerics (used for games including Battlefield 3 and Need for Speed: The Run); 3ds Max; form•Z; LightWave 3D and the Electric Image Animation System.

== Visual characteristics ==

The inclusion of radiosity calculations in the rendering process often lends an added element of realism to the finished scene, because of the way it mimics real-world phenomena. Consider a simple room scene.

The image on the left was rendered with a typical direct illumination renderer. There are &quot;three types&quot; of lighting in this scene which have been specifically chosen and placed by the artist in an attempt to create realistic lighting: spot lighting with shadows (placed outside the window to create the light shining on the floor), ambient lighting (without which any part of the room not lit directly by a light source would be totally dark), and omnidirectional lighting without shadows (to reduce the flatness of the ambient lighting).

The image on the right was rendered using a radiosity algorithm. There is only one source of light: an image of the sky placed outside the window. The difference is marked. The room glows with light. Soft shadows are visible on the floor, and subtle lighting effects are noticeable around the room. Furthermore, the red color from the carpet has bled onto the grey walls, giving them a slightly warm appearance. None of these effects were specifically chosen or designed by the artist.

== Overview of the radiosity algorithm ==
The surfaces of the scene to be rendered are each divided up into one or more smaller surfaces (patches).
A view factor (also known as &quot;form factor&quot;) is computed for each pair of patches; it is a coefficient describing how well the patches can see each other. Patches that are far away from each other, or oriented at oblique angles relative to one another, will have smaller view factors. If other patches are in the way, the view factor will be reduced or zero, depending
on whether the occlusion is partial or total.

The view factors are used as coefficients in a linear system of rendering equations. Solving this system yields the radiosity, or brightness, of each patch, taking into account diffuse interreflections and soft shadows.

Progressive radiosity solves the system iteratively with intermediate radiosity values for the patch, corresponding to bounce levels. That is, after each iteration, we know how the scene looks after one light bounce, after two passes, two bounces, and so forth. This is useful for getting an interactive preview of the scene. Also, the user can stop the iterations once the image looks good enough, rather than wait for the computation to numerically converge.

Another common method for solving the radiosity equation is &quot;shooting radiosity,&quot; which iteratively solves the radiosity equation by &quot;shooting&quot; light from the patch with the most energy at each step. After the first pass, only those patches which are in direct line of sight of a light-emitting patch will be illuminated. After the second pass, more patches will become illuminated as the light begins to bounce around the scene. The scene continues to grow brighter and eventually reaches a steady state.

== Mathematical formulation ==
The basic radiosity method has its basis in the theory of thermal radiation, since radiosity relies on computing the amount of light energy transferred among surfaces. In order to simplify computations, the method assumes that all scattering is perfectly diffuse. Surfaces are typically discretized into quadrilateral or triangular elements over which a piecewise polynomial function is defined.

After this breakdown, the amount of light energy transfer can be computed by using the known reflectivity of the reflecting patch, combined with the view factor of the two patches. This dimensionless quantity is computed from the geometric orientation of two patches, and can be thought of as the fraction of the total possible emitting area of the first patch which is covered by the second.

More correctly, radiosity &quot;B&quot; is the energy per unit area leaving the patch surface per discrete time interval and is the combination of emitted and reflected energy:

:formula_1

where:
* &quot;B(x)&quot;i d&quot;A&quot;i is the total energy leaving a small area d&quot;A&quot;i around a point &quot;x&quot;.
* &quot;E(x)&quot;i d&quot;A&quot;i is the emitted energy.
* &quot;ρ(x)&quot; is the reflectivity of the point, giving reflected energy per unit area by multiplying by the incident energy per unit area (the total energy which arrives from other patches).
* &quot;S&quot; denotes that the integration variable &quot;x&#x27; &quot; runs over all the surfaces in the scene
* &quot;r&quot; is the distance between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&#x27; &quot;
* θx and θx&#x27; are the angles between the line joining &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&#x27; &quot; and vectors normal to the surface at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&#x27; &quot; respectively.
* Vis(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;x&#x27; &quot;) is a visibility function, defined to be 1 if the two points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&#x27; &quot; are visible from each other, and 0 if they are not.
If the surfaces are approximated by a finite number of planar patches, each of which is taken to have a constant radiosity &quot;Bi&quot; and reflectivity &quot;ρi&quot;, the above equation gives the discrete radiosity equation,

:formula_2

where &quot;Fij&quot; is the geometrical view factor for the radiation leaving &quot;j&quot; and hitting patch &quot;i&quot;.

This equation can then be applied to each patch. The equation is monochromatic, so color radiosity rendering requires calculation for each of the required colors.

=== Solution methods ===
The equation can formally be solved as matrix equation, to give the vector solution:
:formula_3
This gives the full &quot;infinite bounce&quot; solution for B directly. However the number of calculations to compute the matrix solution scales according to &quot;n&quot;3, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of patches. This becomes prohibitive for realistically large values of &quot;n&quot;.

Instead, the equation can more readily be solved iteratively, by repeatedly applying the single-bounce update formula above. Formally, this is a solution of the matrix equation by Jacobi iteration. Because the reflectivities ρi are less than 1, this scheme converges quickly, typically requiring only a handful of iterations to produce a reasonable solution. Other standard iterative methods for matrix equation solutions can also be used, for example the Gauss–Seidel method, where updated values for each patch are used in the calculation as soon as they are computed, rather than all being updated synchronously at the end of each sweep. The solution can also be tweaked to iterate over each of the sending elements in turn in its main outermost loop for each update, rather than each of the receiving patches. This is known as the &quot;shooting&quot; variant of the algorithm, as opposed to the &quot;gathering&quot; variant. Using the view factor reciprocity, &quot;A&quot;i &quot;F&quot;ij = &quot;A&quot;j &quot;F&quot;ji, the update equation can also be re-written in terms of the view factor &quot;F&quot;ji seen by each &quot;sending&quot; patch &quot;A&quot;j:
:formula_4
This is sometimes known as the &quot;power&quot; formulation, since it is now the total transmitted power of each element that is being updated, rather than its radiosity.

The view factor &quot;F&quot;ij itself can be calculated in a number of ways. Early methods used a &quot;hemicube&quot; (an imaginary cube centered upon the first surface to which the second surface was projected, devised by Michael F. Cohen and Donald P. Greenberg in 1985). The surface of the hemicube was divided into pixel-like squares, for each of which a view factor can be readily calculated analytically. The full form factor could then be approximated by adding up the contribution from each of the pixel-like squares. The projection onto the hemicube, which could be adapted from standard methods for determining the visibility of polygons, also solved the problem of intervening patches partially obscuring those behind.

However all this was quite computationally expensive, because ideally form factors must be derived for every possible pair of patches, leading to a quadratic increase in computation as the number of patches increased. This can be reduced somewhat by using a binary space partitioning tree to reduce the amount of time spent determining which patches are completely hidden from others in complex scenes; but even so, the time spent to determine the form factor still typically scales as &quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;. New methods include adaptive integration.

=== Sampling approaches ===
The form factors &quot;F&quot;ij themselves are not in fact explicitly needed in either of the update equations; neither to estimate the total intensity Σj &quot;F&quot;ij &quot;B&quot;j gathered from the whole view, nor to estimate how the power &quot;A&quot;j &quot;B&quot;j being radiated is distributed. Instead, these updates can be estimated by sampling methods, without ever having to calculate form factors explicitly. Since the mid 1990s such sampling approaches have been the methods most predominantly used for practical radiosity calculations.

The gathered intensity can be estimated by generating a set of samples in the unit circle, lifting these onto the hemisphere, and then seeing what was the radiosity of the element that a ray incoming in that direction would have originated on. The estimate for the total gathered intensity is then just the average of the radiosities discovered by each ray. Similarly, in the power formulation, power can be distributed by generating a set of rays from the radiating element in the same way, and spreading the power to be distributed equally between each element a ray hits.

This is essentially the same distribution that a path-tracing program would sample in tracing back one diffuse reflection step; or that a bidirectional ray-tracing program would sample to achieve one forward diffuse reflection step when light source mapping forwards. The sampling approach therefore to some extent represents a convergence between the two techniques, the key difference remaining that the radiosity technique aims to build up a sufficiently accurate map of the radiance of all the surfaces in the scene, rather than just a representation of the current view.

== Reducing computation time ==
Although in its basic form radiosity is assumed to have a quadratic increase in computation time with added geometry (surfaces and patches), this need not be the case. The radiosity problem can be rephrased as a problem of rendering a texture mapped scene. In this case, the computation time increases only linearly with the number of patches (ignoring complex issues like cache use).

Following the commercial enthusiasm for radiosity-enhanced imagery, but prior to the standardization of rapid radiosity calculation, many architects and graphic artists used a technique referred to loosely as false radiosity. By darkening areas of texture maps corresponding to corners, joints and recesses, and applying them via self-illumination or diffuse mapping, a radiosity-like effect of patch interaction could be created with a standard scanline renderer (cf. ambient occlusion).

Static, pre-computed radiosity may be displayed in realtime via Lightmaps on current desktop computers with standard graphics acceleration hardware.

== Advantages ==

One of the advantages of the Radiosity algorithm is that it is relatively simple to explain and implement. This makes it a useful algorithm for teaching students about global illumination algorithms. A typical direct illumination renderer already contains nearly all of the algorithms (perspective transformations, texture mapping, hidden surface removal) required to implement radiosity. A strong grasp of mathematics is not required to understand or implement this algorithm.

== Limitations ==
Typical radiosity methods only account for light paths of the form LD*E, i.e. paths which start at a light source and make multiple diffuse bounces before reaching the eye. Although there are several approaches to integrating other illumination effects such as specular and glossy reflections, radiosity-based methods are generally not used to solve the complete rendering equation.

Basic radiosity also has trouble resolving sudden changes in visibility (e.g. hard-edged shadows) because coarse, regular discretization into piecewise constant elements corresponds to a low-pass box filter of the spatial domain. Discontinuity meshing uses knowledge of visibility events to generate a more intelligent discretization.

== Confusion about terminology ==
Radiosity was perhaps the first rendering algorithm in widespread use which accounted for diffuse indirect lighting. Earlier rendering algorithms, such as Whitted-style ray tracing were capable of computing effects such as reflections, refractions, and shadows, but despite being highly global phenomena, these effects were not commonly referred to as &quot;global illumination.&quot; As a consequence, the terms &quot;diffuse interreflection&quot; and &quot;radiosity&quot; both became confused with &quot;global illumination&quot; in popular parlance. However, the three are distinct concepts.

The radiosity method, in the context of computer graphics, derives from (and is fundamentally the same as) the radiosity method in heat transfer. In this context, radiosity is the total radiative flux (both reflected and re-radiated) leaving a surface; this is also sometimes known as radiant exitance. Calculation of radiosity, rather than surface temperatures, is a key aspect of the radiosity method that permits linear matrix methods to be applied to the problem.

<doc id="25975" wikidata="Q193547" url="?curid=25975" title="Reign of Terror">
<text>The Reign of Terror () was a period of the French Revolution when, following the creation of the First Republic, a series of massacres and numerous public executions took place in response to the Federalist revolts, revolutionary fervour, anticlerical sentiment, and accusations of treason by the Committee of Public Safety. While terror was never formally instituted as a legal policy by the Convention, it was more often employed as a concept.

Historians disagree when exactly &quot;the Terror&quot; began. Some consider it to have begun in 1793, often giving the date as 5 September or 10 March, when the Revolutionary Tribunal came into existence. Others cite the earlier September Massacres in 1792, or even July 1789 when the first killing of the revolution occurred.

The Terror concluded with the fall of Maximilien Robespierre and his alleged allies in July 1794, in what is known as the Thermidorian Reaction. By then, 16,594 official death sentences had been dispensed throughout France since June 1793, of which 2,639 were in Paris alone. An additional 10,000 to 12,000 people had been executed without trial, and 10,000 had died in prison.
== Background ==
=== Enlightenment thought ===
Enlightenment thought emphasized the importance of rational thinking and began challenging legal and moral foundations of society, providing the leaders of the Reign of Terror with new ideas about the role and structure of government. Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Social Contract&quot; argues that each person was born with rights, and they would come together in forming a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the general will, which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions. Drawing from the idea of a general will, Robespierre felt that the French Revolution could result in a republic built for the general will but only once those who fought against this ideal were expelled. Those who resisted the government were deemed &quot;tyrants&quot; fighting against the virtue and honor of the general will. The leaders felt that their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the republic created from French Revolution.

The writings of Baron de Montesquieu, another Enlightenment thinker of the time, also greatly influenced Robespierre. Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue—described as &quot;the love of laws and of our country.&quot; In Robespierre&#x27;s speech to the National Convention on 5 February 1794, he regards virtue as being the &quot;fundamental principle of popular or democratic government.&quot; This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years prior. Robespierre believed the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to &quot;crush the enemies of the revolution…let the laws be executed…and let liberty be saved.&quot;

===Threats of foreign invasion===

At the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion. Though mostly ignored, Louis XVI was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (brother of Marie Antoinette) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On 27 August 1791, these foreign leaders made the Pillnitz Declaration, saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined. In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, France declared war on 20 April 1792. However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France.

Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty. In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French. There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed. This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France, pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen, not only to France but more importantly to the revolution.

While this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. In September 1792 the French won a critical victory at Valmy, preventing an Austro-Prussian invasion. While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its actions. It was not until after the execution of Louis XVI and the annexation of the Rhineland that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the First Coalition. The coalition, consisting of Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Holland, and Sardinia began attacking France from all directions, besieging and capturing ports and retaking ground lost to France. With so many similarities to the first days of the Revolutionary Wars for the French government, with threats on all sides, unification of the country became a top priority. As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by Albert Soboul, &quot;terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.&quot; The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the Terror, but the timely coincidence of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth.

=== Popular pressure ===
During the Reign of Terror, the &quot;sans-culottes—the urban workers of France—&quot;and the Hébertists put pressure on the National Convention delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the Montagnards and the Girondins. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes. Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. 

Moreover, the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The &quot;sans-culottes&quot; violently demonstrated, pushing their demands and creating constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform. They fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the they sent letters and petitions to the Committee of Public Safety urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality. The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new republic and achieving full political support critical.

=== Religious upheaval ===

The Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by views on reason and scientific thought. The radical revolutionaries and their supporters desired a cultural revolution that would rid the French state of all Christian influence. This process began with the fall of the monarchy, an event that effectively defrocked the state of its sanctification by the clergy via the doctrine of Divine Right and ushered in an era of reason.

Many long-held rights and powers were stripped from the Catholic Church and given to the state. In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed or forced to leave France. Later in 1792, &quot;refractory priests&quot; were targeted and replaced with their secular counterpart from the Jacobin club. Not all religions experienced equal aggression; the Jewish community, on the contrary, received admittance into French citizenship in 1791. A Festival of Reason was held in the Notre Dame Cathedral, which was renamed &quot;The Temple of Reason&quot;, and the traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one. The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. Robespierre used the event as a means to combat the &quot;moral counterrevolution&quot; taking place among his rivals. Additionally, he hoped to stem &quot;the monster atheism&quot; that was a result of the radical secularization in philosophical and social circles. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the &quot;justified&quot; use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.

== Terror of the day ==
In the summer of 1793, leading politicians in France felt a sense of emergency between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution. Bertrand Barère exclaimed on 5 September 1793 in the National Convention: &quot;Let&#x27;s make terror the order of the day!&quot; This quote has frequently been interpreted as the beginning of a supposed &quot;system of Terror&quot;, an interpretation no longer retained by historians today. Under the pressure of the radical &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the Convention agreed to institute a revolutionary army but refused to make terror the order of the day. According to French historian Jean-Clément Martin, there was no &quot;system of terror&quot; instated by the Convention between 1793 and 1794, despite the pressure from some of its members and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. The members of the Convention were determined to avoid street violence such as the September Massacres of 1792 by taking violence into their own hands as an instrument of government. The monarchist Jacques Cazotte who predicted the Terror was guillotined at the end of the month.

What Maximilien Robespierre called &quot;terror&quot; was the fear that the &quot;justice of exception&quot; would inspire the enemies of the French First Republic. He opposed the idea of terror as the order of the day, defending instead &quot;justice&quot; as the order of the day. In February 1794 in a speech he explains why this &quot;terror&quot; was necessary as a form of exceptional justice in the context of the revolutionary government:
Marxist historian Albert Mathiez argues that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances. Others suggest there were additional causes, including ideological and emotional.

== Major events ==

On 10 March 1793 the National Convention set up the Revolutionary Tribunal. Among those charged by the tribunal, initially, about half of those arrested were acquitted, but the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the Law of 22 Prairial on 10 June 1794. In March, rebellion broke out in the Vendée in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war. Discontent in the Vendée lasted—according to some accounts—until after the Terror.

On 6 April 1793 the National Convention established the Committee of Public Safety, which gradually became the &quot;de facto&quot; war-time government of France. The Committee oversaw the Reign of Terror. &quot;During the Reign of Terror, at least 300,000 suspects were arrested; 17,000 were officially executed, and perhaps 10,000 died in prison or without trial.&quot;

On 2 June the Parisian &quot;sans-culottes&quot; surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a fixed low price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral franchise to &quot;sans-culottes&quot; alone. With the backing of the national guard, they persuaded the Convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders. In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some 13 departments started the Federalist revolts against Convention, which were ultimately crushed. 

On 24 June the Convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the French Constitution of 1793. It was ratified by public referendum, but never put into force. On 13 July the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat—a Jacobin leader and journalist—resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. Georges Danton, the leader of the August 1792 uprising against the king, was removed from the Committee of Public Safety on 10 July. On 27 July Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.

On 23 August the National Convention decreed the &quot;levée en masse&quot;:
On 5 September on the proposal of Barère, the Convention was supposed to have declared by vote that &quot;terror is the order of the day&quot;. On that day&#x27;s session, the Convention, upon a proposal by Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and supported by Billaud and Danton, decided to form a revolutionary army of 6,000 men in Paris. Barère, representing the Committee of Public Safety, introduced a decree that was promptly passed, establishing a paid armed force of 6,000 men and 1,200 gunners &quot;tasked with crushing counter-revolutionaries, enforcing revolutionary laws and public safety measures decreed by the National Convention, and safeguarding provisions.&quot; This allowed the government to form &quot;revolutionary armies&quot; designed to force French citizens into compliance with Maximilian rule. These armies were also used to enforce &quot;the law of the General Maximum&quot;, which controlled the distribution and pricing of food. Addressing the Convention, Robespierre claimed that the &quot;weight and willpower&quot; of the people loyal to the republic would be used to oppress those who would turn &quot;political gatherings into gladiatorial arenas&quot;. The policy change unleashed a newfound military power in France, which was used to defend against the future coalitions formed by rival nations. The event also solidified Robespierre&#x27;s rise to power as president of the Committee of Public Safety earlier in July.

On 8 September banks and exchange offices were shuttered to curb the circulation of counterfeit &quot;assignats&quot; and the outflow of capital, with investments in foreign countries punishable by death. The following day, the extremists Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne were elected in the Committee of Public Safety. On 9 September the convention established paramilitary forces, the &quot;revolutionary armies&quot;, to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September the Law of Suspects was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined &quot;suspects&quot;. This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September the Convention extended price fixing from grain and bread to other essential goods and also fixed wages.

On 10 October the Convention decreed &quot;the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace.&quot; On 16 October Marie Antoinette was executed. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day; they were executed on 31 October in just over half an hour by Charles-Henri Sanson. Joseph Fouché and Collot d&#x27;Herbois suppressed the revolt of Lyon against the National Convention, while Jean-Baptiste Carrier ordered the drownings at Nantes. Jean-Lambert Tallien ensured the operation of the guillotine in Bordeaux, while Barras and Fréron addressed issues in Marseille and Toulon. Joseph Le Bon was sent to the Somme and Pas-de-Calais regions.

On 8 November, the director of the &quot;assignats&quot; manufacture, and Manon Roland were executed. On 13 November the Convention shut down the Paris Bourse and banned all commerce in precious metals, under penalties. Anti-clerical sentiments increased and a campaign of dechristianization occurred at the end of 1793. Eventually, Robespierre denounced the &quot;de-Christianisers&quot; as foreign enemies.

In early December, Robespierre accused Danton in the Jacobin Club of &quot;too often showing his vices and not his virtue&quot;. Camille Desmoulins defended Danton and warned Robespierre not to exaggerate the revolution. On 5 December the National Convention passed the Law of Frimaire, which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission. The Commune of Paris and the revolutionary committees in the sections had to obey the law, the two Committees, and the Convention. Desmoulins argued that the Revolution should return to its original ideas en vogue around 10 August 1792. A Committee of Grace had to be established. On 8 December, Madame du Barry was guillotined. On receiving notice that he was to appear on the next day before the Revolutionary Tribunal, Étienne Clavière committed suicide. American Thomas Paine lost his seat in the Convention, was arrested, and locked up for his association with the Girondins, as well as being a foreign national. By the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the revolutionary government: the Hébertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by Danton, who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both.

On 8 February 1794 Carrier was recalled from Nantes after a member of the Committee of Public Safety wrote to Robespierre with information about the atrocities being carried out, although Carrier was not put on trial. On 26 February and 3 March Louis Antoine de Saint-Just proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the Ventôse Decrees.

In March the major Hébertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. On 30 March the two committees decided to arrest Danton and Desmoulins after Saint-Just became uncharacteristically angry. The Dantonists were tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April. In mid-April it was decreed to centralise the investigation of court records and to bring all the political suspects in France to the Revolutionary Tribunal to Paris. Saint-Just and Philippe-François-Joseph Le Bas journeyed the Rhine Army to oversee the generals and punish officers for perceived treasonous timidity or lack of initiative. The two committees received the power to interrogate them immediately. A special police bureau inside the Comité de salut public was created, whose task was to monitor public servants, competing with both the Committee of General Security and the Committee of Public Safety. Foreigners were no longer allowed to travel through France or visit a Jacobin club; Dutch patriots who had fled to France before 1790 were excluded. 

On 22 April Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, Isaac René Guy le Chapelier, Jacques Guillaume Thouret were taken to the executed. Saint-Just and Le Bas left Paris at the end of the month for the army in the north. On 21 May the revolutionary government decided that the Terror would be centralised, with almost all 
the tribunals in the provinces closed and all the trials held in Paris. On 20 May Robespierre signed Theresa Cabarrus&#x27;s arrest warrant, and on 23 May, following an attempted assassination on d&#x27;Herbois. Cécile Renault was arrested near Robespierre&#x27;s residence with two penknives and a change of underwear claiming the fresh linen was for her execution. She was executed on 17 June.

On 10 June the National Convention passed a law proposed by Georges Couthon, known as the Law of 22 Prairial, which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the Revolutionary Tribunal. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period became known as &quot;The Great Terror&quot; (). Between 10 June and 27 July, another 1,366 were executed, causing fear among d&#x27;Herbois, Fouché and Tallien due to their past actions. Like Brissot, Madame Roland, Pétion, Hébert and Danton, Tallien was accused of participating in conspicuous dinners. On 18 June Pétion de Villeneuve and François Buzot committed suicide, and Joachim Vilate was arrested on 21 June.

On 26 June the French army won the Battle of Fleurus, which marked a turning point in France&#x27;s military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the revolutionary government. In early July about 60 individuals were arrested as &quot;enemies of the people&quot; and accused of conspiring against liberty. The total of death sentences in Paris in July was more than double the number in June, with two new mass graves dug at Picpus Cemetery by mid-July. There was widespread agreement among deputies that their parliamentary immunity, in place since 1 April 1793, had become perilous. On 14 July Robespierre had Fouché expelled. To evade arrest about 50 deputies avoided staying at home.

== Thermidorian Reaction ==

The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate&#x27;s own head at risk.

Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Charles-André Merda. A change in orientation might explain how Robespierre, sitting in a chair, got wounded from the upper right in the lower left jaw.) According to Bourdon, Méda then hit Couthon&#x27;s adjutant in his leg. Couthon was found lying at the bottom of a staircase in a corner, having fallen from the back of his adjutant. Saint-Just gave himself up without a word. According to Méda, Hanriot tried to escape by a concealed staircase to the third floor and his apartment. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound&#x27;s origin. A group of 15 to 20 conspirators were locked up in a room inside the Hôtel de Ville. In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day, together with Saint-Just, Couthon and his brother Augustin Robespierre. The day following his demise, approximately half of the Paris Commune (70 members) met their fate at the guillotine.

According to Barère, who just like Robespierre never went on mission: &quot;We did not deceive ourselves that Saint-Just, cut out as a more dictatorial boss, would have finished by overthrowing [Robespierre] to put himself in his place; we also knew that we who stood in the way of his projects, he would have us guillotined; we overthrew him.&quot;

<doc id="25976" wikidata="Q4348563" url="?curid=25976" title="Reliabilism">
<text>Reliabilism, a category of theories in the philosophical discipline of epistemology, has been advanced as a theory both of justification and of knowledge. Process reliabilism has been used as an argument against philosophical skepticism, such as the brain in a vat thought experiment.
Process reliabilism is a form of epistemic externalism.

==Overview==
A broadly reliabilist theory of knowledge is roughly as follows:

Given that &quot;p&quot; stands for any proposition (such as, &quot;the sky is blue&quot;), then one knows that &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is true, one believes that &quot;p&quot; is true, and one has arrived at the belief that &quot;p&quot; is true through some &quot;reliable process.&quot;

A broadly reliabilist theory of justified belief can be stated as follows:

One has a justified belief that &quot;p&quot; if, and only if, the belief is the result of a reliable process.

Moreover, a similar account can be given (and an elaborate version of this has been given by Alvin Plantinga) for such notions as &#x27;warranted belief&#x27; or &#x27;epistemically rational belief&#x27;.

Leading proponents of reliabilist theories of knowledge and justification have included Alvin Goldman, Marshall Swain, Kent Bach and more recently, Alvin Plantinga. Goldman&#x27;s article &quot;A Causal Theory of Knowing&quot; (&quot;Journal of Philosophy&quot;, 64 (1967), pp. 357–372) is generally credited as being the first full treatment of the theory, though D. M. Armstrong is also regarded as an important source, and (according to Hugh Mellor) Frank Ramsey was the very first to state the theory, albeit in passing.

One classical or traditional analysis of &#x27;knowledge&#x27; is &quot;justified true belief&quot;. In order to have a valid claim of knowledge for any proposition, one must be justified in believing &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot; must be true. Since Gettier proposed his counterexamples the traditional analysis has included the further claim that knowledge must be more than justified true belief. Reliabilist theories of knowledge are sometimes presented as an alternative to that theory: rather than justification, all that is required is that the belief be the product of a reliable process. But reliabilism need not be regarded as an alternative, but instead as a further explication of the traditional analysis. On this view, those who offer reliabilist theories of justification further analyze the &#x27;justification&#x27; part of the traditional analysis of &#x27;knowledge&#x27; in terms of reliable processes. Not all reliabilists agree with such accounts of justification, but some do.

==Objections==

Some find reliabilism of justification objectionable because it entails externalism, which is the view that one can have knowledge, or have a justified belief, despite not knowing (having &quot;access&quot; to) the evidence, or other circumstances, that make the belief justified. Most reliabilists maintain that a belief can be justified, or can constitute knowledge, &quot;even if&quot; the believer does not know about or understand the process that makes the belief reliable. In defending this view, reliabilists (and externalists generally) are apt to point to examples from simple acts of perception: if one sees a bird in the tree outside one&#x27;s window and thereby gains the belief that there is a bird in that tree, one might not at all understand the cognitive processes that account for one&#x27;s successful act of perception; nevertheless, it is the fact that the processes worked reliably that accounts for why one&#x27;s belief is justified. In short, one finds one holds a belief about the bird, and that belief is justified if any is, but one is not acquainted at all with the processes that led to the belief that justified one&#x27;s having it. 

Another of the most common objections to reliabilism, made first to Goldman&#x27;s reliable process theory of knowledge and later to other reliabilist theories, is the so-called generality problem. For any given justified belief (or instance of knowledge), one can easily identify many different (concurrently operating) &quot;processes&quot; from which the belief results. My belief that there is a bird in the tree outside my window might be accorded a result of the process of forming beliefs on the basis of sense-perception, of visual sense-perception, of visual sense-perception through non-opaque surfaces in daylight, and so forth, down to a variety of different very specifically described processes. Some of these processes might be statistically reliable, while others might not. It would no doubt be better to say, in any case, that we are choosing not which process to say resulted in the belief, but instead how to describe the process, out of the many different levels of generality on which it can be accurately described.

An objection in a similar line was formulated by Stephen Stich in &quot;The Fragmentation of Reason&quot;. Reliabilism usually considers that for generating justified beliefs a process needs to be reliable in a set of relevant possible scenarios. However, according to Stich, these scenarios are chosen in a culturally biased manner. Stich does not defend any alternative theory of knowledge or justification, but instead argues that all accounts of normative epistemic terms are culturally biased and instead only a pragmatic account can be given.

Another objection to reliabilism is called the &quot;new evil demon problem&quot;. The evil demon problem originally motivated skepticism, but can be repurposed to object to reliabilist accounts as follows: If our experiences are controlled by an evil demon, it may be the case that we believe ourselves to be doing things that we are not doing. However, these beliefs are clearly justified. Robert Brandom has called for a clarification of the role of belief in reliabilist theories. Brandom is concerned that unless the role of belief is stressed, reliabilism may attribute knowledge to things that would otherwise be considered incapable of possessing it. Brandom gives the example of a parrot that has been trained to consistently respond to red visual stimuli by saying &#x27;that&#x27;s red&#x27;. The proposition is true, the mechanism that produced it is reliable, but Brandom is reluctant to say that the parrot &quot;knows&quot; it is seeing red because he thinks it cannot &quot;believe&quot; that it is. For Brandom, beliefs pertain to concepts: without the latter there can be no former. Concepts are products of the &#x27;game of giving and asking for reasons&#x27;. Hence, only those entities capable of reasoning, through language in a social context, can for Brandom believe and thus have knowledge. Brandom may be regarded as hybridising externalism and internalism, allowing knowledge to be accounted for by reliable external process so long as a knower possess some internal understanding of why the belief is reliable.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in ring theory, an ideal of a ring is a special subset of its elements. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers, such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any integer (even or odd) results in an even number; these closure and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal. An ideal can be used to construct a quotient ring in a way similar to how, in group theory, a normal subgroup can be used to construct a quotient group.

Among the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the non-negative integers: in this ring, every ideal is a principal ideal consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may not correspond directly to the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the prime ideals of a ring are analogous to prime numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to ideals. There is a version of unique prime factorization for the ideals of a Dedekind domain (a type of ring important in number theory).

The related, but distinct, concept of an ideal in order theory is derived from the notion of ideal in ring theory. A fractional ideal is a generalization of an ideal, and the usual ideals are sometimes called integral ideals for clarity.

== History ==
Ernst Kummer invented the concept of ideal numbers to serve as the &quot;missing&quot; factors in number rings in which unique factorization fails; here the word &quot;ideal&quot; is in the sense of existing in imagination only, in analogy with &quot;ideal&quot; objects in geometry such as points at infinity.
In 1876, Richard Dedekind replaced Kummer&#x27;s undefined concept by concrete sets of numbers, sets that he called ideals, in the third edition of Dirichlet&#x27;s book &quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot;, to which Dedekind had added many supplements.
Later the notion was extended beyond number rings to the setting of polynomial rings and other commutative rings by David Hilbert and especially Emmy Noether.

== Definitions ==
Given a ring , a left ideal is a subset of that is a subgroup of the additive group of formula_1 that &quot;absorbs multiplication from the left by elements of &quot;; that is, formula_2 is a left ideal if it satisfies the following two conditions:
# formula_3 is a subgroup of ,
# For every formula_4 and every , the product formula_5 is in .

In other words, a left ideal is a left submodule of , considered as a left module over itself.

A right ideal is defined similarly, with the condition formula_6 replaced by . A two-sided ideal is a left ideal that is also a right ideal.

If the ring is commutative, the three definitions are the same, and one talks simply of an ideal. In the non-commutative case, &quot;ideal&quot; is often used instead of &quot;two-sided ideal&quot;.

If is a left, right or two-sided ideal, the relation formula_7 if and only if
:formula_8
is an equivalence relation on , and the set of equivalence classes forms a left, right or bi module denoted formula_9 and called the &quot;quotient&quot; of by . (It is an instance of a congruence relation and is a generalization of modular arithmetic.)

If the ideal is two-sided, formula_9 is a ring, and the function 
:formula_11 
that associates to each element of its equivalence class is a surjective ring homomorphism that has the ideal as its kernel. Conversely, the kernel of a ring homomorphism is a two-sided ideal. Therefore, &quot;the two-sided ideals are exactly the kernels of ring homomorphisms.&quot;

=== Note on convention ===
By convention, a ring has the multiplicative identity. But some authors do not require a ring to have the multiplicative identity; i.e., for them, a ring is a rng. For a rng , a left ideal is a subrng with the additional property that formula_12 is in for every formula_4 and every formula_14. (Right and two-sided ideals are defined similarly.) For a ring, an ideal (say a left ideal) is rarely a subring; since a subring shares the same multiplicative identity with the ambient ring , if were a subring, for every formula_4, we have formula_16 i.e., formula_17.

The notion of an ideal does not involve associativity; thus, an ideal is also defined for non-associative rings (often without the multiplicative identity) such as a Lie algebra.

== Examples and properties ==
(For the sake of brevity, some results are stated only for left ideals but are usually also true for right ideals with appropriate notation changes.)
* In a ring &quot;R&quot;, the set &quot;R&quot; itself forms a two-sided ideal of &quot;R&quot; called the unit ideal. It is often also denoted by formula_18 since it is precisely the two-sided ideal generated (see below) by the unity . Also, the set formula_19 consisting of only the additive identity 0&quot;R&quot; forms a two-sided ideal called the zero ideal and is denoted by . Every (left, right or two-sided) ideal contains the zero ideal and is contained in the unit ideal.
* An (left, right or two-sided) ideal that is not the unit ideal is called a proper ideal (as it is a proper subset). Note: a left ideal formula_20 is proper if and only if it does not contain a unit element, since if formula_21 is a unit element, then formula_22 for every . Typically there are plenty of proper ideals. In fact, if &quot;R&quot; is a skew-field, then formula_23 are its only ideals and conversely: that is, a nonzero ring &quot;R&quot; is a skew-field if formula_23 are the only left (or right) ideals. (Proof: if formula_25 is a nonzero element, then the principal left ideal formula_26 (see below) is nonzero and thus formula_27; i.e., formula_28 for some nonzero . Likewise, formula_29 for some nonzero formula_30. Then formula_31.)
* The even integers form an ideal in the ring formula_32 of all integers, since the sum of any two even integers is even, and the product of any integer with an even integer is also even; this ideal is usually denoted by . More generally, the set of all integers divisible by a fixed integer formula_33 is an ideal denoted . In fact, every non-zero ideal of the ring formula_32 is generated by its smallest positive element, as a consequence of Euclidean division, so formula_32 is a principal ideal domain.
* The set of all polynomials with real coefficients that are divisible by the polynomial formula_36 is an ideal in the ring of all real-coefficient polynomials .
* Take a ring formula_1 and positive integer . For each , the set of all formula_38 matrices with entries in formula_1 whose formula_40-th row is zero is a right ideal in the ring formula_41 of all formula_38 matrices with entries in . It is not a left ideal. Similarly, for each , the set of all formula_38 matrices whose formula_44-th &quot;column&quot; is zero is a left ideal but not a right ideal.
* The ring formula_45 of all continuous functions formula_46 from formula_47 to formula_47 under pointwise multiplication contains the ideal of all continuous functions formula_46 such that . Another ideal in formula_45 is given by those functions that vanish for large enough arguments, i.e. those continuous functions formula_46 for which there exists a number formula_52 such that formula_53 whenever .
* A ring is called a simple ring if it is nonzero and has no two-sided ideals other than . Thus, a skew-field is simple and a simple commutative ring is a field. The matrix ring over a skew-field is a simple ring.
* If formula_54 is a ring homomorphism, then the kernel formula_55 is a two-sided ideal of . By definition, , and thus if formula_56 is not the zero ring (so ), then formula_57 is a proper ideal. More generally, for each left ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;S&quot;, the pre-image formula_58 is a left ideal. If &quot;I&quot; is a left ideal of &quot;R&quot;, then formula_59 is a left ideal of the subring formula_60 of &quot;S&quot;: unless &quot;f&quot; is surjective, formula_59 need not be an ideal of &quot;S&quot;; see also #Extension and contraction of an ideal below.
* Ideal correspondence: Given a surjective ring homomorphism , there is a bijective order-preserving correspondence between the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of formula_1 containing the kernel of formula_46 and the left (resp. right, two-sided) ideals of formula_56: the correspondence is given by formula_65 and the pre-image . Moreover, for commutative rings, this bijective correspondence restricts to prime ideals, maximal ideals, and radical ideals (see the Types of ideals section for the definitions of these ideals).
* (For those who know modules) If &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module and formula_66 a subset, then the annihilator formula_67 of &quot;S&quot; is a left ideal. Given ideals formula_68 of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the &quot;R&quot;-annihilator of formula_69 is an ideal of &quot;R&quot; called the ideal quotient of formula_20 by formula_71 and is denoted by ; it is an instance of idealizer in commutative algebra.
* Let formula_72 be an ascending chain of left ideals in a ring &quot;R&quot;; i.e., formula_56 is a totally ordered set and formula_74 for each . Then the union formula_75 is a left ideal of &quot;R&quot;. (Note: this fact remains true even if &quot;R&quot; is without the unity 1.)
* The above fact together with Zorn&#x27;s lemma proves the following: if formula_76 is a possibly empty subset and formula_77 is a left ideal that is disjoint from &quot;E&quot;, then there is an ideal that is maximal among the ideals containing formula_78 and disjoint from &quot;E&quot;. (Again this is still valid if the ring &quot;R&quot; lacks the unity 1.) When formula_79, taking formula_80 and , in particular, there exists a left ideal that is maximal among proper left ideals (often simply called a maximal left ideal); see Krull&#x27;s theorem for more. 
*An arbitrary union of ideals need not be an ideal, but the following is still true: given a possibly empty subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, there is the smallest left ideal containing &quot;X&quot;, called the left ideal generated by &quot;X&quot; and is denoted by . Such an ideal exists since it is the intersection of all left ideals containing &quot;X&quot;. Equivalently, formula_81 is the set of all the (finite) left &quot;R&quot;-linear combinations of elements of &quot;X&quot; over &quot;R&quot;:
*: formula_82
: (since such a span is the smallest left ideal containing &quot;X&quot;.) A right (resp. two-sided) ideal generated by &quot;X&quot; is defined in the similar way. For &quot;two-sided&quot;, one has to use linear combinations from both sides; i.e.,
:: formula_83
* A left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by a single element &quot;x&quot; is called the principal left (resp. right, two-sided) ideal generated by &quot;x&quot; and is denoted by formula_26 (resp. ). The principal two-sided ideal formula_85 is often also denoted by . If formula_86 is a finite set, then formula_87 is also written as .
* There is a bijective correspondence between ideals and congruence relations (equivalence relations that respect the ring structure) on the ring: Given an ideal formula_2 of a ring , let formula_89 if . Then formula_90 is a congruence relation on . Conversely, given a congruence relation formula_90 on , let . Then formula_2 is an ideal of .

== Types of ideals ==
&quot;To simplify the description all rings are assumed to be commutative. The non-commutative case is discussed in detail in the respective articles.&quot;

Ideals are important because they appear as kernels of ring homomorphisms and allow one to define factor rings. Different types of ideals are studied because they can be used to construct different types of factor rings.
* Maximal ideal: A proper ideal is called a maximal ideal if there exists no other proper ideal with a proper subset of . The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a simple ring in general and is a field for commutative rings.
* Minimal ideal: A nonzero ideal is called minimal if it contains no other nonzero ideal.
* Zero ideal: the ideal formula_93.
* Unit ideal: the whole ring (being the ideal generated by formula_94).
* Prime ideal: A proper ideal formula_2 is called a prime ideal if for any formula_96 and formula_97 in , if formula_98 is in , then at least one of formula_96 and formula_97 is in . The factor ring of a prime ideal is a prime ring in general and is an integral domain for commutative rings.
* Radical ideal or semiprime ideal: A proper ideal is called radical or semiprime if for any in formula_1, if is in for some , then is in . The factor ring of a radical ideal is a semiprime ring for general rings, and is a reduced ring for commutative rings.
* Primary ideal: An ideal is called a primary ideal if for all and in , if is in , then at least one of and is in for some natural number . Every prime ideal is primary, but not conversely. A semiprime primary ideal is prime.
* Principal ideal: An ideal generated by &quot;one&quot; element.
* Finitely generated ideal: This type of ideal is finitely generated as a module.
* Primitive ideal: A left primitive ideal is the annihilator of a simple left module.
* Irreducible ideal: An ideal is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written as an intersection of ideals that properly contain it.
* Comaximal ideals: Two ideals , are said to be comaximal if formula_102 for some formula_14 and .
* Regular ideal: This term has multiple uses. See the article for a list.
* Nil ideal: An ideal is a nil ideal if each of its elements is nilpotent.
* Nilpotent ideal: Some power of it is zero.
* Parameter ideal: an ideal generated by a system of parameters.
* Perfect ideal: A proper ideal in a Noetherian ring formula_1 is called a perfect ideal if its grade equals the projective dimension of the associated quotient ring, . A perfect ideal is unmixed.
* Unmixed ideal: A proper ideal in a Noetherian ring formula_1 is called an unmixed ideal (in height) if the height of is equal to the height of every associated prime of formula_9. (This is stronger than saying that formula_9 is equidimensional. See also equidimensional ring.

Two other important terms using &quot;ideal&quot; are not always ideals of their ring. See their respective articles for details:
* Fractional ideal: This is usually defined when formula_1 is a commutative domain with quotient field formula_109. Despite their names, fractional ideals are formula_1 submodules of formula_109 with a special property. If the fractional ideal is contained entirely in formula_1, then it is truly an ideal of formula_1.
* Invertible ideal: Usually an invertible ideal is defined as a fractional ideal for which there is another fractional ideal such that . Some authors may also apply &quot;invertible ideal&quot; to ordinary ring ideals and with in rings other than domains.

== Ideal operations ==
The sum and product of ideals are defined as follows. For formula_20 and , left (resp. right) ideals of a ring &quot;R&quot;, their sum is
: formula_115,
which is a left (resp. right) ideal,
and, if formula_68 are two-sided,
: formula_117
i.e. the product is the ideal generated by all products of the form &quot;ab&quot; with &quot;a&quot; in formula_20 and &quot;b&quot; in .

Note formula_119 is the smallest left (resp. right) ideal containing both formula_20 and formula_71 (or the union ), while the product formula_122 is contained in the intersection of formula_20 and .

The distributive law holds for two-sided ideals ,
* .
If a product is replaced by an intersection, a partial distributive law holds:
: formula_124
where the equality holds if formula_20 contains formula_71 or formula_127.

Remark: The sum and the intersection of ideals is again an ideal; with these two operations as join and meet, the set of all ideals of a given ring forms a complete modular lattice. The lattice is not, in general, a distributive lattice. The three operations of intersection, sum (or join), and product make the set of ideals of a commutative ring into a quantale.

If formula_68 are ideals of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, then formula_129 in the following two cases (at least) 
* formula_130
* formula_20 is generated by elements that form a regular sequence modulo .
(More generally, the difference between a product and an intersection of ideals is measured by the Tor functor: .)

An integral domain is called a Dedekind domain if for each pair of ideals formula_132, there is an ideal formula_127 such that . It can then be shown that every nonzero ideal of a Dedekind domain can be uniquely written as a product of maximal ideals, a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

== Examples of ideal operations ==
In formula_32 we have
: formula_135
since formula_136 is the set of integers that are divisible by both formula_33 and .

Let formula_138 and let . Then,
* formula_139 and formula_140
* formula_141
* formula_142
* formula_143 while formula_144
In the first computation, we see the general pattern for taking the sum of two finitely generated ideals, it is the ideal generated by the union of their generators. In the last three we observe that products and intersections agree whenever the two ideals intersect in the zero ideal. These computations can be checked using Macaulay2.

== Radical of a ring ==
Ideals appear naturally in the study of modules, especially in the form of a radical.

: &quot;For simplicity, we work with commutative rings but, with some changes, the results are also true for non-commutative rings.&quot;

Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring. By definition, a primitive ideal of &quot;R&quot; is the annihilator of a (nonzero) simple &quot;R&quot;-module. The Jacobson radical formula_145 of &quot;R&quot; is the intersection of all primitive ideals. Equivalently,
: formula_146
Indeed, if formula_147 is a simple module and &quot;x&quot; is a nonzero element in &quot;M&quot;, then formula_148 and formula_149, meaning formula_150 is a maximal ideal. Conversely, if formula_151 is a maximal ideal, then formula_151 is the annihilator of the simple &quot;R&quot;-module . There is also another characterization (the proof is not hard):
: formula_153
For a not-necessarily-commutative ring, it is a general fact that formula_154 is a unit element if and only if formula_155 is (see the link) and so this last characterization shows that the radical can be defined both in terms of left and right primitive ideals.

The following simple but important fact (Nakayama&#x27;s lemma) is built-in to the definition of a Jacobson radical: if &quot;M&quot; is a module such that , then &quot;M&quot; does not admit a maximal submodule, since if there is a maximal submodule , formula_156 and so , a contradiction. Since a nonzero finitely generated module admits a maximal submodule, in particular, one has:
: If formula_157 and &quot;M&quot; is finitely generated, then .

A maximal ideal is a prime ideal and so one has
: formula_158
where the intersection on the left is called the nilradical of &quot;R&quot;. As it turns out, formula_159 is also the set of nilpotent elements of &quot;R&quot;.

If &quot;R&quot; is an Artinian ring, then formula_160 is nilpotent and . (Proof: first note the DCC implies formula_161 for some &quot;n&quot;. If (DCC) formula_162 is an ideal properly minimal over the latter, then formula_163. That is, , a contradiction.)

== Extension and contraction of an ideal ==

Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be two commutative rings, and let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; be a ring homomorphism. If formula_20 is an ideal in &quot;A&quot;, then formula_165 need not be an ideal in &quot;B&quot; (e.g. take &quot;f&quot; to be the inclusion of the ring of integers Z into the field of rationals Q). The extension formula_166 of formula_20 in &quot;B&quot; is defined to be the ideal in &quot;B&quot; generated by . Explicitly,
: formula_168

If formula_71 is an ideal of &quot;B&quot;, then formula_170 is always an ideal of &quot;A&quot;, called the contraction formula_171 of formula_71 to &quot;A&quot;.

Assuming &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a ring homomorphism, formula_20 is an ideal in &quot;A&quot;, formula_71 is an ideal in &quot;B&quot;, then:
* formula_71 is prime in &quot;B&quot; formula_176 formula_171 is prime in &quot;A&quot;.
* formula_178
* formula_179

It is false, in general, that formula_20 being prime (or maximal) in &quot;A&quot; implies that formula_166 is prime (or maximal) in &quot;B&quot;. Many classic examples of this stem from algebraic number theory. For example, embedding . In formula_182, the element 2 factors as formula_183 where (one can show) neither of formula_184 are units in &quot;B&quot;. So formula_185 is not prime in &quot;B&quot; (and therefore not maximal, as well). Indeed, formula_186 shows that , , and therefore .

On the other hand, if &quot;f&quot; is surjective and formula_187 then:
* formula_188 and .
* formula_20 is a prime ideal in &quot;A&quot; formula_190 formula_166 is a prime ideal in &quot;B&quot;.
* formula_20 is a maximal ideal in &quot;A&quot; formula_190 formula_166 is a maximal ideal in &quot;B&quot;.

Remark: Let &quot;K&quot; be a field extension of &quot;L&quot;, and let &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; be the rings of integers of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, respectively. Then &quot;B&quot; is an integral extension of &quot;A&quot;, and we let &quot;f&quot; be the inclusion map from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;. The behaviour of a prime ideal formula_195 of &quot;A&quot; under extension is one of the central problems of algebraic number theory.

The following is sometimes useful: a prime ideal formula_196 is a contraction of a prime ideal if and only if . (Proof: Assuming the latter, note formula_197 intersects , a contradiction. Now, the prime ideals of formula_198 correspond to those in &quot;B&quot; that are disjoint from . Hence, there is a prime ideal formula_199 of &quot;B&quot;, disjoint from , such that formula_200 is a maximal ideal containing . One then checks that formula_199 lies over . The converse is obvious.)

== Generalizations ==
Ideals can be generalized to any monoid object , where formula_1 is the object where the monoid structure has been forgotten. A left ideal of formula_1 is a subobject formula_2 that &quot;absorbs multiplication from the left by elements of &quot;; that is, formula_2 is a left ideal if it satisfies the following two conditions:
# formula_2 is a subobject of formula_1
# For every formula_208 and every , the product formula_209 is in .

A right ideal is defined with the condition &quot;&quot; replaced by &quot;&#x27;&quot;. A two-sided ideal is a left ideal that is also a right ideal, and is sometimes simply called an ideal. When formula_1 is a commutative monoid object respectively, the definitions of left, right, and two-sided ideal coincide, and the term ideal is used alone.

An ideal can also be thought of as a specific type of -module. If we consider formula_1 as a left formula_1-module (by left multiplication), then a left ideal formula_2 is really just a left sub-module of . In other words, formula_2 is a left (right) ideal of formula_1 if and only if it is a left (right) formula_1-module that is a subset of . formula_2 is a two-sided ideal if it is a sub-formula_1-bimodule of .

Example: If we let , an ideal of formula_32 is an abelian group that is a subset of , i.e. formula_220 for some . So these give all the ideals of .

<text>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8×8 uncheckered board. It was invented in 1883. Othello, a variant with a fixed initial setup of the board, was patented in 1971.

==Basics==
Two players compete, using 64 identical game pieces (&quot;disks&quot;) that are light on one side and dark on the other. Each player chooses one color to use throughout the game. Players take turns placing one disk on an empty square, with their assigned color facing up. After a play is made, any disks of the opponent&#x27;s color that lie in a straight line bounded by the one just played and another one in the current player&#x27;s color are turned over. When all playable empty squares are filled, the player with more disks showing in their own color wins the game.

== History ==
=== Original version ===
Englishmen Lewis Waterman and John W. Mollett both claim to have invented the game of reversi in 1883, each denouncing the other as a fraud. The game gained considerable popularity in England at the end of the 19th century. The game&#x27;s first reliable mention is in the 21 August 1886 edition of &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;. Later mention includes an 1895 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which describes reversi as &quot;something like Go Bang, [...] played with 64 pieces.&quot; In 1893, the German games publisher Ravensburger started producing the game as one of its first titles. Two 18th century continental European books dealing with a game that may or may not be reversi are mentioned on page fourteen of the Spring 1989 &quot;Othello Quarterly&quot;, and there has been speculation, so far without documentation, that the game has older origins.

A Japanese publication in 1907 titled &quot;World Games Rules Complete Collection&quot; (世界遊戯法大全) describes the board game reversi with the same rules as &quot;Othello&quot; where the first four pieces go in the center in a diagonal pattern and the player who cannot make a move simply passes.

=== &quot;Othello&quot; ===

The modern version of the game—the most regularly used rule-set, and the one used in international tournaments—is marketed and recognized as . It was patented in Japan in 1971 by Goro Hasegawa (legal name: Satoshi Hasegawa), then a 38-year-old salesman. Hasegawa initially explained that &quot;Othello&quot; was an improvement on reversi, but from around 2000, he began to claim that he invented it in Mito regardless of reversi. Hasegawa also claimed that the origin of reversi/&quot;Othello&quot; dates back 5,000 years.

Hasegawa established the Japan Othello Association in March 1973, and held the first national &quot;Othello&quot; championship on 4 April 1973 in Japan. The Japanese game company Tsukuda Original launched &quot;Othello&quot; in late April 1973 in Japan under Hasegawa&#x27;s license, which led to an immediate commercial success.

The name was selected by Hasegawa as a reference to the Shakespearean play &quot;Othello, the Moor of Venice&quot;, referring to the conflict between the Moor Othello and Iago, and to the unfolding drama between Othello, who is black, and Desdemona, who is white. The green color of the board is inspired by the image of the general Othello, valiantly leading his battle in a green field. It can also be likened to a jealousy competition (jealousy being the central theme in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, which popularized the term &quot;green-eyed monster&quot;), since players engulf the pieces of the opponent, thereby turning them to their possession.

&quot;Othello&quot; was first launched in the U.S. in 1975 by Gabriel Industries and it also enjoyed commercial success there. Sales have reportedly exceeded $600 million. More than 40 million classic games have been sold in over 100 countries.

Hasegawa&#x27;s &quot;How to play Othello (Osero No Uchikata)&quot; in Japan in 1974, was published in 1977 in an English translation entitled &quot;How to Win at Othello&quot;.

Kabushiki Kaisha Othello, which was owned by Hasegawa, registered the trademark &quot;OTHELLO&quot; for board games in Japan; Tsukuda Original registered the trademark in the rest of the world. All intellectual property regarding &quot;Othello&quot; outside Japan is now owned by MegaHouse, the Japanese toy company that acquired Tsukuda Original&#x27;s successor PalBox.

== Rules ==
Each of the disks&#x27; two sides corresponds to one player; they are referred to here as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; after the sides of &quot;Othello&quot; pieces, but any counters with distinctive faces are suitable. The game may for example be played with a chessboard and Scrabble pieces, with one player &quot;letters&quot; and the other &quot;backs&quot;.

The historical version of reversi starts with an empty board, and the first two moves made by each player are in the four central squares of the board. The players place their disks alternately with their colors facing up and no captures are made. A player may choose to not play both pieces on the same diagonal, different from the standard &quot;Othello&quot; opening. It is also possible to play variants of Reversi and &quot;Othello&quot; where the second player&#x27;s second move may or must flip one of the opposite-colored disks (as variants closest to the normal games).

For the specific game of &quot;Othello&quot;, the game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two facing light-side-up, two dark-side-up, so that the same-colored disks are on a diagonal. Convention has this such that the dark-side-up disks are to the north-east and south-west (from both players&#x27; perspectives), though this is only marginally consequential: where sequential openings&#x27; memorization is preferred, such players benefit from this. The dark player moves first.

Dark must place a piece (dark-side-up) on the board and so that there exists at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another dark piece, with one or more contiguous light pieces between them. For move one, dark has four options shown by translucently drawn pieces below:

Play always alternates unless one player has no legal move, in which case they pass. After placing a dark disk, dark turns over (flips to dark, captures) the single disk (or chain of light disks) on the line between the new piece and an anchoring dark piece. Multiple chains of disks may be captured in a single move. No player can look back to the previous status of disks when playing moves. A valid move is one where at least one piece is reversed (flipped over).

If dark decided to put a piece in the topmost location (all choices are strategically equivalent at this time), one piece gets turned over, so that the board appears thus:

Now light plays. This player operates under the same rules, with the roles reversed: light lays down a light piece, causing a dark piece to flip. Possibilities at this time appear thus (indicated by transparent pieces):

Light takes the bottom left option and reverses one piece:

Players take alternate turns. If one player cannot make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. The game ends when the grid has filled up or if neither player can make a valid move.

Examples where the game ends before the grid is completely filled:


The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins. The game is scored by counting the number of discs in each player&#x27;s color. If the game ended before the grid was completely filled, any empty squares are scored for the winner. However, if one player defaults by running out of time, that player&#x27;s opponent wins regardless of the board configuration. There are varying methods to determine the official score when a player defaults.

In common practice over the Internet, opponents agree upon a time-control of, typically, from one to thirty minutes per game per player. Standard time control in the World Championship is thirty minutes, and this or something close to it is common in over-the-board (as opposed to internet) tournament play generally. In time-defaulted games, where disk differential is used for tie-breaks in tournaments or for rating purposes, one common over-the-board procedure for the winner of defaulted contests to complete both sides&#x27; moves with the greater of the result thereby or one disk difference in the winner&#x27;s favor being the recorded score. Games in which both players have the same number of disks their color at the end (almost always with a full-board 32–32 score) are not very common, but also not rare, and these are designated as &#x27;ties&#x27; and scored as half of a win for each player in tournaments. The term &#x27;draw&#x27; for such may also be heard, but is somewhat frowned upon.

What are generally referred to as &quot;transcript sheets&quot; are generally in use in tournament over-the-board play, with both players obligated to record their game&#x27;s moves by placing the number of each move in an 8×8 grid. This both enables players to look up past games of note and tournament directors and players to resolve disputes (according to whatever specific rules are in place) where claims that an illegal move, flip or other anomaly are voiced. An alternative recording method not requiring a grid is also in use, where positions on a board are labeled left to right by letters &quot;a&quot; through &quot;h&quot; and top to bottom by digits &quot;1&quot; through &quot;8&quot;. Note that the numbers run in the opposite direction to the chess standard, and that the perspective may be that of either player (with no fixed standard). This alternate notational scheme is used primarily in verbal discussions or where a linear representation is desirable in print, but may also be permissible as during-game transcription by either or both players.

Tournament over-the-board play has various ways of handling illegal moves and incorrect flips. For example, one procedure that has been used is to permit either player to make corrections going back some fixed number of moves.

=== Anti-Reversi ===
&quot;Anti-Reversi&quot; or &quot;Reversed Reversi&quot; is a variant of the game where the player wins who has &quot;fewer&quot; own-colored disks at the end of the game; draw is also a possible result. To put a disk on the board, the same rules apply as in normal reversi.

=== Brightwell Quotient ===
Invented by the British mathematician and three times runner-up at the World Championship and five times British Champion Graham Brightwell, this is the tie-breaker that is now used in many tournaments including the W.O.C. If two players have the same number of points in the thirteen-round W.O.C. Swiss, the tie is resolved in favour of the player with the higher Brightwell Quotient.

The Brightwell Quotient (BQ) is calculated as follows:
# A constant &quot;c&quot; is calculated. It is the integer nearest to (number of squares on the board) divided by (number of rounds in the tournament).
# If any of the player&#x27;s opponents have withdrawn in the course of the tournament, or if a player has been paired against &quot;bye&quot;, ignore such games for the moment. 
# Calculate the total number of disks scored by the player in all games not covered by step 2 and add &quot;c&quot; times the sum of points scored by all of the player&#x27;s opponents, except those who have withdrawn.
# For each game against an opponent who has withdrawn, and each bye received, add half the number of squares on the board plus (&quot;c&quot; times the player&#x27;s own tournament score) to the result calculated in step 3. The number resulting is the player&#x27;s BQ.

== Computer opponents and research ==
Good Othello computer programs play very strongly against human opponents. This is mostly due to difficulties in human look-ahead peculiar to Othello: The interchangeability of the disks and therefore apparent strategic meaninglessness (as opposed to chess pieces for example) makes an evaluation of different moves much harder. This can be demonstrated with blindfold games, as the memorization of the board demands much more dedication from the players than in blindfold chess.

The first tournament pitting &quot;Othello&quot; computer programs against human opponents took place in 1980. In it, then world champion Hiroshi Inoue, although he would go on to win the tournament, lost a game against the computer program &quot;The Moor&quot;. In 1997, the computer &quot;Othello&quot; program Logistello defeated the reigning human champion, Takeshi Murakami, six games to zero.

Analysts have estimated the number of legal positions in &quot;Othello&quot; is at most 1028, and it has a game-tree complexity of approximately 1058. Mathematically, Othello is solved up to 8x8 board. On 4×4 and 6×6 boards under perfect play, the second player wins. On 8x8 board, the game results in draw under perfect play, according to an arXiv paper. The first of these proofs is relatively trivial, the second dates to around 1990, and the last one was done in 2023. When generalizing the game to play on an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; board, the problem of determining if the first player has a winning move in a given position is PSPACE-complete.

== World Othello Championship ==
The World Othello Championship (WOC), which started in 1977, was first organized by the Japan Othello Association. From 1978 until 2004, the World Othello Championship was organized by the Othello TD group and Anjar Co. In 2005, the World Othello Federation took over the responsibility for the WOC.

From 1977 to 1986, each country could send one player to participate in the WOC. From 1987, each country could send up to three players to participate. In 1987, the title WOC team championship started. In 2005, a female championship category was added to the WOC. From 2006, each World Othello Federation member could send a full team of up to four players. In 2016, a youth champion title was added to the WOC. The WOC was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Othello&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, noting that it was &quot;Based on the Victorian game of reversi&quot; and had achieved &quot;remarkable success in this country for an abstract game of strategy&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Othello, Tournament Set&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting that by that time &quot;Othello has become so popular that Gabriel now markets a computer version and a players&#x27; association publishes a quarterly magazine&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Othello&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, noting that &quot;Although the goal is to finish with the most pieces of your color up, the best strategy, paradoxically, is usually to limit your opponent&#x27;s options by flipping over as &quot;few&quot; of his discs as possible during the first two-thirds of the game.&quot;

<text>In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has also been called [[bucket sort]] and digital sort.

Radix sort can be applied to data that can be sorted lexicographically, be they integers, words, punch cards, playing cards, or the mail.

== History ==

Radix sort dates back as far as 1887 to the work of Herman Hollerith on tabulating machines. Radix sorting algorithms came into common use as a way to sort punched cards as early as 1923.

The first memory-efficient computer algorithm for this sorting method was developed in 1954 at MIT by Harold H. Seward. Computerized radix sorts had previously been dismissed as impractical because of the perceived need for variable allocation of buckets of unknown size. Seward&#x27;s innovation was to use a linear scan to determine the required bucket sizes and offsets beforehand, allowing for a single static allocation of auxiliary memory. The linear scan is closely related to Seward&#x27;s other algorithm — counting sort.

In the modern era, radix sorts are most commonly applied to collections of binary strings and integers. It has been shown in some benchmarks to be faster than other more general-purpose sorting algorithms, sometimes 50% to three times faster.

== Digit order ==

Radix sorts can be implemented to start at either the most significant digit (MSD) or least significant digit (LSD). For example, with 1234, one could start with 1 (MSD) or 4 (LSD).

LSD radix sorts typically use the following sorting order: short keys come before longer keys, and then keys of the same length are sorted lexicographically. This coincides with the normal order of integer representations, like the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. LSD sorts are generally stable sorts.

MSD radix sorts are most suitable for sorting strings or fixed-length integer representations. A sequence like [b, c, e, d, f, g, ba] would be sorted as [b, ba, c, d, e, f, g]. If lexicographic ordering is used to sort variable-length integers in base 10, then numbers from 1 to 10 would be output as [1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], as if the shorter keys were left-justified and padded on the right with blank characters to make the shorter keys as long as the longest key. MSD sorts are not necessarily stable if the original ordering of duplicate keys must always be maintained.

Other than the traversal order, MSD and LSD sorts differ in their handling of variable length input.
LSD sorts can group by length, radix sort each group, then concatenate the groups in size order. MSD sorts must effectively &#x27;extend&#x27; all shorter keys to the size of the largest key and sort them accordingly, which can be more complicated than the grouping required by LSD.

However, MSD sorts are more amenable to subdivision and recursion. Each bucket created by an MSD step can itself be radix sorted using the next most significant digit, without reference to any other buckets created in the previous step. Once the last digit is reached, concatenating the buckets is all that is required to complete the sort.

== Examples ==

=== Least significant digit ===
Input list:
:[170, 45, 75, 90, 2, 802, 2, 66]

Starting from the rightmost (last) digit, sort the numbers based on that digit:

:[{170, 90}, {2, 802, 2}, {45, 75}, {66}]

Sorting by the next left digit:

:[{&quot;0&quot;2, 802, &quot;0&quot;2}, {45}, {66}, {170, 75}, {90}]

And finally by the leftmost digit:

:[{&quot;00&quot;2, &quot;00&quot;2, &quot;0&quot;45, &quot;0&quot;66, &quot;0&quot;75, &quot;0&quot;90}, {170}, {802}]

Each step requires just a single pass over the data, since each item can be placed in its bucket without comparison with any other element.

Some radix sort implementations allocate space for buckets by first counting the number of keys that belong in each bucket before moving keys into those buckets. The number of times that each digit occurs is stored in an array.

Although it is always possible to pre-determine the bucket boundaries using counts, some implementations opt to use dynamic memory allocation instead.

=== Most significant digit, forward recursive ===

Input list, fixed width numeric strings with leading zeros:
:[170, 045, 075, 025, 002, 024, 802, 066]

First digit, with brackets indicating buckets:
:[{045, 075, 025, 002, 024, 066}, {170}, {802}]

Next digit:
:[{ {002}, {025, 024}, {045}, {066}, {075} }, 170, 802]

Final digit:
:[ 002, { {024}, {025} }, 045, 066, 075 , 170, 802]

All that remains is concatenation:
:[002, 024, 025, 045, 066, 075, 170, 802]

== Complexity and performance ==
Radix sort operates in formula_1 time, where formula_2 is the number of keys, and formula_3 is the key length. LSD variants can achieve a lower bound for formula_3 of &#x27;average key length&#x27; when splitting variable length keys into groups as discussed above.

Optimized radix sorts can be very fast when working in a domain that suits them.
They are constrained to lexicographic data, but for many practical applications this is not a limitation. Large key sizes can hinder LSD implementations when the induced number of passes becomes the bottleneck.

== Specialized variants ==

===In-place MSD radix sort implementations===
Binary MSD radix sort, also called binary quicksort, can be implemented in-place by splitting the input array into two bins - the 0s bin and the 1s bin. The 0s bin is grown from the beginning of the array, whereas the 1s bin is grown from the end of the array. The 0s bin boundary is placed before the first array element. The 1s bin boundary is placed after the last array element. The most significant bit of the first array element is examined. If this bit is a 1, then the first element is swapped with the element in front of the 1s bin boundary (the last element of the array), and the 1s bin is grown by one element by decrementing the 1s boundary array index. If this bit is a 0, then the first element remains at its current location, and the 0s bin is grown by one element. The next array element examined is the one in front of the 0s bin boundary (i.e. the first element that is not in the 0s bin or the 1s bin). This process continues until the 0s bin and the 1s bin reach each other. The 0s bin and the 1s bin are then sorted recursively based on the next bit of each array element. Recursive processing continues until the least significant bit has been used for sorting. Handling signed two&#x27;s complement integers requires treating the most significant bit with the opposite sense, followed by unsigned treatment of the rest of the bits.

In-place MSD binary-radix sort can be extended to larger radix and retain in-place capability. Counting sort is used to determine the size of each bin and their starting index. Swapping is used to place the current element into its bin, followed by expanding the bin boundary. As the array elements are scanned the bins are skipped over and only elements between bins are processed, until the entire array has been processed and all elements end up in their respective bins. The number of bins is the same as the radix used - e.g. 16 bins for 16-radix. Each pass is based on a single digit (e.g. 4-bits per digit in the case of 16-radix), starting from the most significant digit. Each bin is then processed recursively using the next digit, until all digits have been used for sorting.

Neither in-place binary-radix sort nor n-bit-radix sort, discussed in paragraphs above, are stable algorithms.

===Stable MSD radix sort implementations===
MSD radix sort can be implemented as a stable algorithm, but requires the use of a memory buffer of the same size as the input array. This extra memory allows the input buffer to be scanned from the first array element to last, and move the array elements to the destination bins in the same order. Thus, equal elements will be placed in the memory buffer in the same order they were in the input array. The MSD-based algorithm uses the extra memory buffer as the output on the first level of recursion, but swaps the input and output on the next level of recursion, to avoid the overhead of copying the output result back to the input buffer. Each of the bins are recursively processed, as is done for the in-place MSD radix sort. After the sort by the last digit has been completed, the output buffer is checked to see if it is the original input array, and if it&#x27;s not, then a single copy is performed. If the digit size is chosen such that the key size divided by the digit size is an even number, the copy at the end is avoided.

===Hybrid approaches===
Radix sort, such as the two-pass method where counting sort is used during the first pass of each level of recursion, has a large constant overhead. Thus, when the bins get small, other sorting algorithms should be used, such as insertion sort. A good implementation of insertion sort is fast for small arrays, stable, in-place, and can significantly speed up radix sort.

===Application to parallel computing===
This recursive sorting algorithm has particular application to parallel computing, as each of the bins can be sorted independently. In this case, each bin is passed to the next available processor. A single processor would be used at the start (the most significant digit). By the second or third digit, all available processors would likely be engaged. Ideally, as each subdivision is fully sorted, fewer and fewer processors would be utilized. In the worst case, all of the keys will be identical or nearly identical to each other, with the result that there will be little to no advantage to using parallel computing to sort the keys.

In the top level of recursion, opportunity for parallelism is in the counting sort portion of the algorithm. Counting is highly parallel, amenable to the parallel_reduce pattern, and splits the work well across multiple cores until reaching memory bandwidth limit. This portion of the algorithm has data-independent parallelism. Processing each bin in subsequent recursion levels is data-dependent, however. For example, if all keys were of the same value, then there would be only a single bin with any elements in it, and no parallelism would be available. For random inputs all bins would be near equally populated and a large amount of parallelism opportunity would be available.

There are faster parallel sorting algorithms available, for example optimal complexity O(log(&quot;n&quot;)) are those of the Three Hungarians and Richard Cole and Batcher&#x27;s bitonic merge sort has an algorithmic complexity of O(log2(&quot;n&quot;)), all of which have a lower algorithmic time complexity to radix sort on a CREW-PRAM. The fastest known PRAM sorts were described in 1991 by David M W Powers with a parallelized quicksort that can operate in O(log(n)) time on a CRCW-PRAM with &quot;n&quot; processors by performing partitioning implicitly, as well as a radixsort that operates using the same trick in O(&quot;k&quot;), where &quot;k&quot; is the maximum keylength. However, neither the PRAM architecture or a single sequential processor can actually be built in a way that will scale without the number of constant fan-out gate delays per cycle increasing as O(log(&quot;n&quot;)), so that in effect a pipelined version of Batcher&#x27;s bitonic mergesort and the O(log(&quot;n&quot;)) PRAM sorts are all O(log2(&quot;n&quot;)) in terms of clock cycles, with Powers acknowledging that Batcher&#x27;s would have lower constant in terms of gate delays than his Parallel quicksort and radix sort, or Cole&#x27;s merge sort, for a keylength-independent sorting network of O(nlog2(&quot;n&quot;)).

=== Tree-based radix sort ===
Radix sorting can also be accomplished by building a tree (or radix tree) from the input set, and doing a pre-order traversal. This is similar to the relationship between heapsort and the heap data structure. This can be useful for certain data types, see burstsort.

<text>Tug of war (also known as tug o&#x27; war, tug war, rope war, rope pulling, or tugging war) is a sport in which two teams compete by pulling on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal of bringing the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team&#x27;s pull. The sport has ancient origins and has been practiced in various cultures throughout history. It was included in the Summer Olympics from 1900 to 1920 but is no longer part of the Olympic program. Tug of war continues to be practiced in schools, community events, and organized competitions worldwide.

Tug of war typically involves teams of eight or more members, though the number can vary. The rope is marked with a centre line and two markers equidistant from the centre. The objective is to pull the opposing team’s marker across the centre line. Specific rules govern techniques, such as prohibiting touching the ground for extended periods of time or lowering one&#x27;s elbow below the knee during a pull. The sport requires both cooperation of team members and physical strength.

Internationally, tug of war is governed by the Tug of War International Federation (TWIF), which organizes World Championships for nation teams biannually, for both indoor and outdoor contests, and a similar competition for club teams. It is particularly popular in Europe, Asia, and the United States, where it is often featured in festivals and national competitions.

Tug of war features as an important ritual in many societies, holding religious, cultural and historical significance. The sport remains a popular activity in both competitive and informal settings.

==Terminology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says that the phrase &quot;tug of war&quot; originally meant &quot;the decisive contest; the real struggle or tussle; a severe contest for supremacy&quot;. Only in the 19th century was it used as a term for an athletic contest between two teams who haul at the opposite ends of a rope. Prior to that, &quot;French and English&quot; was the commonly used name for the game in the English-speaking world.

==Origin==

The origins of tug of war are uncertain, but this sport was practised in Cambodia, ancient Egypt, Greece, India, and China. According to a Tang dynasty book, &quot;The Notes of Feng&quot;, tug of war, under the name (), was used by the military commander of the State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period (8th to 5th centuries BC) to train warriors. During the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang promoted large-scale tug of war games, using ropes of up to with shorter ropes attached, and more than 500 people on each end of the rope. Each side also had its own team of drummers to encourage the participants.

In ancient Greece, the sport was called (Greek: ), () and (), which derives from (), meaning amongst others , all deriving from the verb (), . and seem to have been ordinary versions of tug of war, while had no rope, according to Julius Pollux. It is possible that the teams held hands when pulling, which would have increased difficulty, since handgrips are more difficult to sustain than a grip of a rope. Tug of war games in ancient Greece were among the most popular games used for strength and would help build strength needed for battle in full armor.

Archeological evidence shows that tug of war was also popular in India in the 12th century:


Tug of war stories about heroic champions from Scandinavia and Germany circulate Western Europe where Viking warriors pull on animal skins over open pits of fire in tests of strength and endurance, in preparation for battle and plunder.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, tug of war was popularised during tournaments in French châteaux gardens and later also in Great Britain.

In the 19th century, tug of war began a new tradition among seafaring men who were required to tug on lines to adjust sails while ships were under way and even in battle.

The Mohave people occasionally used tug-of-war matches as means of settling disputes.

==As a sport==

There are tug of war clubs in many countries, and both men and women participate.

The sport was part of the Olympic Games from 1900 until 1920, but has not been included since. The sport is part of the World Games. The Tug of War International Federation (TWIF), organises World Championships for nation teams biannually, for both indoor and outdoor contests, and a similar competition for club teams.

In England the sport was formally governed by the AAA until 1984, but is now catered for by the Tug of War Association (formed in 1958), and the Tug of War Federation of Great Britain (formed in 1984). In Scotland, the Scottish Tug of War Association was formed in 1980. The sport also features in Highland Games.

Between 1976 and 1988 Tug of War was a regular event during the television series &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. Teams of celebrities representing each major network competed in different sporting events culminating into the final event, the Tug of War. Lou Ferrigno&#x27;s epic tug of war performance in May 1979 is considered the greatest feat in &#x27;Battle&#x27; history.

Starting with the 2024 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL included a five on five Tug of War competition in their Pro Bowl games skills competition. 

==National organizations==

The sport is played almost in every country in the world. However, some countries have set up a national body to govern the sport. Most of these national bodies are associated with the international governing body: TWIF, The Tug of War International Federation. As of 2008 there are 53 countries associated with TWIF, among which are Scotland, Ireland, England, India, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, South Africa and the United States.

==Regional variations==

In Indonesia, is a popular sport held in many events, such as the Indonesian Independence Day celebration, school events, and scout events. The rope used is called , made from fibers of between two jousters. Two cinder blocks are placed a distance apart and the two jousters stand upon the blocks with a rope stretched between them. The objective for each jouster is to either a) cause their opponent to fall off their block, or b) to take their opponent&#x27;s end of the rope from them.

=== Japan ===

In Japan, the is a staple of school sports festivals. The tug of war is also a traditional way to pray for a plentiful harvest throughout Japan and is a popular ritual around the country. The Kariwano Tug of war in Daisen, Akita, is said to be more than 500 years old, and is also a national folklore cultural asset. The Underwater Tug of War Festival in Mihama, Fukui, is 380 years old, and takes place every January. The Sendai Great Tug of War in Satsumasendai, Kagoshima is known as or . Around 3,000 men pull a huge rope which is long. The event is said to have been started by feudal warlord Yoshihiro Shimadzu, with the aim of boosting the morale of his soldiers before the decisive Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Nanba Hachiman Jinja&#x27;s tug of war, which started in the Edo period, is Osaka&#x27;s folklore cultural asset. The Naha Tug-of-war in Okinawa is also famous.

=== Korea ===

 (, also ) is a traditional Korean sport similar to tug of war. It has a ritual and divinatory significance for many agricultural communities in the country and is performed at festivals and community gatherings. The sport uses two huge rice-straw ropes, connected by a central peg, which is pulled by teams representing the East and West sides of the village (the competition is often rigged in favor of the Western team). A number of religious and traditional rituals are performed before and after the actual competition.

=== New Zealand ===
A variant, originally brought to New Zealand by Boston whalers in the 1790s, is played with five-person teams lying down on cleated boards. The sport is played at two clubs in Te Awamutu and Hastings, supported by the New Zealand Tug of War Association. A four-person variant is played at the National Rover Scout Moot.

=== Peru ===
The Peruvian children&#x27;s series &quot;Nubeluz&quot; featured its own version of tug of war (called ), where each team battled 3-on-3 on platforms suspended over a pool of water. The object was simply to pull the other team into the pool.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, a version of tug of war is sometimes played using a dragon boat, where teams of six or eight attempt to row towards each other.

=== Basque Country ===
In the Basque Country, this sport is considered a popular rural sport, with many associations and clubs. In Basque, it is called &quot;Sokatira&quot;.

=== United States ===
In the United States, a form of tug of war using eight handles is used in competition at camps, schools, churches, and other events. The rope is called an &quot;Oct-O Pull&quot; and provides two-way, four-way and eight-way competition for 8 to 16 participants at one time.

==== Miami University ====

Puddle Pull is a biannual tug of war contest held at Miami University. The event is a timed, seated variation of tug of war in which fraternities and sororities compete. In addition to the seated participants, each team has a caller who coordinates the movements of the team.

Although the university hosted an unrelated freshman vs. sophomores tug of war event in the 1910s and 1920s, the first record of modern Puddle Pull is its appearance as a tug of war event in the school&#x27;s newspaper, The Miami Student, in May 1949. This fraternity event was created by Frank Dodd of the Miami chapter of Delta Upsilon. Originally, the event was held as a standing tug of war over the Tallawanda stream near the Oxford waterworks bridge in which the losers were pulled into the water. This first event was later seen as a driving force for creating interfraternity competitive activities (Greek Week) at Miami University. As a part of moving to a seated event, a new rule was created in 1966 to prohibit locks and created the event that is seen today with the exception of a large pit that was still being dug in between the two teams. The event is held in a level grass field and uses a diameter rope that is at least long is used for the event. Footholes or &quot;pits&quot; are dug for each participant at intervals. The pits are dug with a flat front and an angled back. Women began to compete sporadically starting in the 1960s and became regular participants as sorority teams in the mid-1980s.

==== Hope College ====
The Hope College Pull is an annual tug-of-war contest held across the Black River in Holland, Michigan on the fourth Saturday after Labor Day. Competitors are 40 members of the freshman and sophomore classes.

==Formal rules==

Two teams of eight, whose total mass must not exceed a maximum weight as determined for the class, align themselves at the end of a rope approximately in circumference. The rope must be free from knots and other &quot;holdings for the hands&quot;. The rope is marked with a &quot;centre line&quot; and two markings to either side of the centre line. The teams start with the rope&#x27;s centre line directly above a line marked on the ground, and once the contest (the &quot;pull&quot;) has commenced, attempt to pull the other team such that the marking on the rope closest to their opponent crosses the centre line, or the opponents commit a foul.

Lowering one&#x27;s elbow below the knee during a pull, known as &quot;locking&quot;, is a foul, as is touching the ground for extended periods of time. The rope must go under the arms; actions such as pulling the rope over the shoulders may be considered a foul. These rules apply in highly organized competitions such as the World Championships. However, in small or informal entertainment competitions, the rules are often arbitrarily interpreted and followed.

A contest may feature a moat in a neutral zone, usually of mud or softened ground, which eliminates players who cross the zone or fall into it.

==Tactics==

Aside from the raw muscle power needed for tug of war, it is also a technical sport. The cooperation or &quot;rhythm&quot; of team members is just as important as physical strength. To achieve this, a person called a &quot;driver&quot; is used to harmonize the team&#x27;s joint traction power. The driver moves up and down next to their team pulling on the rope, giving orders to them when to pull and when to rest (called &quot;hanging&quot;). If the driver spots the opposing team trying to pull the driver&#x27;s team away, the driver gives a &quot;hang&quot; command, each member will dig into the grass with their boots and movement of the rope is limited. When the opponents are played out, the driver shouts &quot;pull&quot; and rhythmically waves their hat or handkerchief for their team to pull together. Slowly but surely, the other team is forced into surrender by a runaway pull.

Another factor that affects the game is the players&#x27; weights. The heavier someone is, the more static friction their feet have to the ground, but if there is not enough friction and they weigh too little, even if they are pulling extremely hard, the force will not be transmitted to the rope. Their feet will simply slide along the ground if their opponent(s) have better static friction with the ground. In general, as long as one team has enough static friction and can pull hard enough to overcome the static friction of their opponent(s), that team can easily win the match.

==Injury risks==
In addition to injuries from falling and from back strains (some of which may be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur as a result of looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, or impact from snapback if the rope should break. This may cause permanent damage to the body, requiring finger, hand, or even arm amputations.

Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated and thus, may be unaware of the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. Injury is primarily due to the large amount of potential energy stored in the rope during the competition. As both sides pull, tension is placed on the rope causing it to stretch as described by Hooke&#x27;s law. If a rope exceeds its breaking point the potential energy is suddenly converted to kinetic energy and the broken ends of the rope will snapback at great speed, which can cause serious injuries. This phenomenon has been studied in ship operations as mooring ropes pose the same risk should they snap. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.

===Notable incidents===
== In popular culture ==
* The American game show &quot;Tug of Words&quot; uses a virtual tug of war as its central scoring mechanism.

<doc id="25983" wikidata="Q7309615" url="?curid=25983" title="Regular semantics">
<text>Regular semantics is a computer hardware consistency model. It describes a type of guarantee provided by a processor register that is shared by several processor cores in a parallel machine or in a network of computers working together. Regular semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These semantics are stronger than safe semantics but weaker than atomic semantics: they guarantee that there is a total order to the write operations consistent with real-time and that read operations return either the value of the last write completed before the read begins, or that of one of the writes which are concurrent with the read.

== Example ==

Regular semantics are weaker than linearizability. 
Consider the example shown below, where the horizontal axis represents time, and the arrows represent the interval during which a read or write operation takes place. According to a regular register&#x27;s definition, the first read may return 5 or 2, and so may the second read. The first read could return 2 and the second read could return 5 (also known as a new/old inversion). This behavior would not satisfy atomic semantics. Therefore, regular semantics is a weaker property than atomic semantics. On the other hand, Leslie Lamport proved that a linearizable register may be implemented from registers with safe semantics, which are weaker than regular registers.

== A Theorem from Regularity to Atomicity ==

A single-writer multi-reader (SWMR) atomic semantics is an SWMR regular register if any of its execution history H satisfies the following property:
r1 and r2 are any two read invocations: (r1 →H r2) ⇒ ¬π(r2) →H π(r1)

Before getting into the proof, first, it should be understood what the new/old inversion means. As it shown in the picture below, by looking at the execution it can be seen that the only difference between a regular execution and an atomic execution is when a = 0 and b = 1.In this execution, when considering the two read invocations R.read() → a 
followed by R.read() → b, our first value (new value) is a = 0 while the second value (old value) is b=1. This is actually the main difference between atomicity and regularity.

The theorem above states that a Single writer multi-reader regular register without new or old inversion
is an atomic register. From it, R.read() → a →H R.read() → b
and R.write(1) →H R.write(0), it is not possible to have π (R.read() → b) =R.write(1) and π (R.read() → a) = R.write(0) if the execution is atomic. 
To prove the theorem above, first it must be proven that the register is safe, regular and that it does not allow for new/old inversion which proves the atomicity. 
By the definition of the atomic register, a Single writer multiple reader atomic register is regular and satisfies the no new/old
inversion property. So, the only required proof is to show that a regular register with no new/old inversion is atomic.

Moreover, for any two read invocations (r1 and r2) when the register is regular and there is no new/old inversion 
(r1 →H r2) ⇒sn(π(r1)) ≤ sn(π(r2)). For any execution (M) there is a total order (S) which includes the same operation invocations. It can be stated that S is built as follow:
starting from the total order on the write operations and the read operations being inserted as follow: 
first: Read operation (r) is inserted after the associated write operation (π(r)). Second: If two read operations (r1,r2) have the same (sn(r1)=sn(r2)) then first insert the operation which starts first in the execution. 
S includes all the operation invocation of M, from which it follows that S and M are equivalent. Since all the operations are ordered based on their sequence numbers is slightly a total order. Furthermore, this total order is an execution of M only adds an order on operations that are overlapping in M. If there is no overlapping between a read and write operations, there is no difference between the regularity and atomicity. Finally, it can be stated that S is legal since each read operation gets the last written value that comes before it in the total order. Therefore, the corresponding history is linearizable. Since this reasoning does not rely on a particular
history H, it implies that the register is atomic. 
Since atomicity (linearizability) is a local property, it can stated that a set of SWMR regular registers behave atomically as soon as each of them satisfies the no new/old inversion property.

<doc id="25984" wikidata="Q298341" url="?curid=25984" title="Ray Kurzweil">
<text>Raymond Kurzweil ( ; born February 12, 1948) is an American computer scientist, author, entrepreneur, futurist, and inventor. He is involved in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition technology and electronic keyboard instruments. He has written books on health technology, artificial intelligence (AI), transhumanism, the technological singularity, and futurism. Kurzweil is a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements and gives public talks to share his optimistic outlook on life extension technologies and the future of nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology.

Kurzweil received the 1999 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the United States&#x27; highest honor in technology, from President Bill Clinton in a White House ceremony. He received the $500,000 Lemelson–MIT Prize in 2001. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2001 for the application of technology to improve human-machine communication. In 2002 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, established by the U.S. Patent Office. He has 21 honorary doctorates and honors from three U.S. presidents. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) included Kurzweil as one of 16 &quot;revolutionaries who made America&quot; along with other inventors of the past two centuries. &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine ranked him No. 8 among the &quot;most fascinating&quot; entrepreneurs in the United States and called him &quot;Edison&#x27;s rightful heir&quot;.

==Life, inventions, and business career==

===Early life===
Kurzweil grew up in Queens, New York City. He attended NYC Public Education Kingsbury Elementary School PS188. He was born to secular Jewish parents who had emigrated from Austria just before the onset of World War II. Through Unitarian Universalism he was exposed to a diversity of religious faiths during his upbringing. The Unitarian church has a philosophy that there are many paths to the truth: his religious education consisted of studying one religion for six months before moving on to another. His father, Fredric, was a concert pianist, a noted conductor and a music educator. His mother, Hannah, was a visual artist. He is the elder of two children; his sister Enid, an accountant in Santa Barbara, is six years his junior.

Ray Kurzweil decided at age five that he wanted to be an inventor. As a young boy, he had an inventory of parts from various construction toys he had been given and old electronic gadgets he had collected from neighbors. In his youth, Kurzweil was an avid reader of science fiction. At age eight, nine, and ten, he read the entire Tom Swift Jr. series. At age seven or eight, he built a robotic puppet theater and robotic game. He was involved with computers by age 12 (in 1960), when only a dozen computers existed in New York City, and built computing devices and statistical programs for the predecessor of Head Start. At 14, Kurzweil wrote a paper detailing his theory of the neocortex. His parents were involved with the arts, and he is quoted in the documentary &quot;Transcendent Man&quot; as saying that the household always discussed the future and technology.

Kurzweil attended Martin Van Buren High School. During class, he often held onto his class textbooks to seemingly participate while focusing on his own projects hidden behind the book. His uncle, an engineer at Bell Labs, taught Kurzweil the basics of computer science. In 1963, at 15, he wrote his first computer program. 

Kurzweil created pattern-recognition software that analyzed the works of classical composers, then synthesized its own songs in similar styles. In 1965 he was invited to appear on the CBS television program &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, where he performed a piano piece composed by a computer he had built. Later in the year, he won first prize in the International Science Fair for the invention; his submission to Westinghouse Talent Search of his first computer program alongside several other projects resulted in his being one of the contest&#x27;s national winners, for which President Lyndon B. Johnson personally congratulated him during a White House ceremony. The experiences impressed upon Kurzweil the belief that nearly any problem could be overcome.

===Midlife===

While in high school, Kurzweil had corresponded with Marvin Minsky and was invited to visit him at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he did. Kurzweil also visited Frank Rosenblatt, a psychologist at Cornell. He attended MIT to study with Minsky, obtaining a B.Sc. degree in computer science and literature in 1970. Kurzweil took all the computer programming courses (eight or nine) MIT offered in his first year and a half.

In 1968, during his second year at MIT, Kurzweil started a company that used a computer program to match high school students with colleges. The program, called the Select College Consulting Program, was designed by him and compared thousands of different criteria about each college with questionnaire answers each student applicant submitted. Around that time he sold the company to Harcourt, Brace &amp; World for $100,000 plus royalties. In 1974, he founded Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc., and led development of the first omni-font optical character recognition system, a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font. Before that time, scanners had been able to read text in only a few fonts. He decided that the technology&#x27;s best application would be to create a reading machine, which would allow blind people to understand text by having a computer read it to them aloud. But the device required the invention of two enabling technologies—the CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech synthesizer. Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions like Bell Labs, and on January 13, 1976, the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. Called the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the device was large and covered an entire tabletop. Stevie Wonder heard about the demonstration of this new machine on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and later became the user of the first production Kurzweil Reading Machine, beginning a long-term association with Kurzweil.

Kurzweil&#x27;s next major business venture began in 1978, when Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload paper legal and news documents to its nascent online databases. He sold Kurzweil Computer Products to Xerox, where it was first known as Xerox Imaging Systems and later as Scansoft; he was a consultant for Xerox until 1995. In 1999, Visioneer, Inc. acquired Scansoft from Xerox to form a new public company with Scansoft as the new company-wide name. Scansoft merged with Nuance Communications in 2005.

Kurzweil&#x27;s next business venture was in electronic music technology. After a 1982 meeting with Stevie Wonder, in which Wonder lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments, Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of synthesizers that could duplicate the sounds of real instruments. Kurzweil Music Systems was founded in the same year, and in 1984, the Kurzweil K250 was unveiled. The machine could imitate a number of instruments, and according to Kurzweil&#x27;s press packet, musicians could not tell the difference between the Kurzweil K250 on piano mode and a grand piano, though reviewers who actually attempted it questioned that. The machine&#x27;s recording and mixing abilities coupled with its ability to imitate different instruments made it possible for a single user to compose and play an entire orchestral piece.

South Korean musical instrument manufacturer Young Chang bought Kurzweil Music Systems in 1990. As with Xerox, Kurzweil remained as a consultant for several years. Hyundai acquired Young Chang in 2006, and in 2007 appointed Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems. Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems, he created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence (KAI) to develop computer speech recognition systems for commercial use. The first product, which debuted in 1987, was an early speech recognition program. KAI was sold to Lernout &amp; Hauspie in 1997.

===Later life===

Kurzweil started Kurzweil Educational Systems (KESI) in 1996 to develop new pattern-recognition-based computer technologies to help people with disabilities such as blindness, dyslexia, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school. Products include the Kurzweil 1000 text-to-speech converter software program, which enables a computer to read electronic and scanned text aloud to blind or visually impaired users, and the Kurzweil 3000 program, a multifaceted electronic learning system that helps with reading, writing, and study skills. Kurzweil sold KESI to Lernout &amp; Hauspie. After the legal and bankruptcy problems of the latter, he and other KESI employees bought back the company. KESI was eventually sold to Cambium Learning Group, Inc.

During the 1990s, Kurzweil founded the Medical Learning Company. In 1999, Kurzweil created a hedge fund called &quot;FatKat&quot; (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies), which began trading in 2006. He has said that the ultimate aim is to improve the performance of FatKat&#x27;s A.I. investment software program, enhancing its ability to recognize patterns in &quot;currency fluctuations and stock-ownership trends&quot;. In his 1999 book &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, Kurzweil predicted that computers would one day be better than humans at making profitable investment decisions. In June 2005, Kurzweil introduced the &quot;Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader&quot; (K-NFB Reader)—a pocket-sized device consisting of a digital camera and computer unit. Like the Kurzweil Reading Machine of almost 30 years before, the K-NFB Reader is designed to aid blind people by reading written text aloud. The newer machine is portable and scans text through digital camera images, while the older machine is large and scans text through flatbed scanning.

In December 2012, Google hired Kurzweil in a full-time position to &quot;work on new projects involving machine learning and language processing&quot;. Google co-founder Larry Page personally hired him. Page and Kurzweil agreed on a one-sentence job description: &quot;to bring natural language understanding to Google&quot;. Kurzweil received a Technical Grammy Award on February 8, 2015, specifically for his invention of the Kurzweil K250.

Kurzweil has joined the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonics company. After his death, he has a plan to be perfused with cryoprotectants, vitrified in liquid nitrogen, and stored at an Alcor facility in the hope that future medical technology will be able to revive him.

===Personal life===
Kurzweil is agnostic about the existence of a soul. Of the possibility of divine intelligence, Kurzweil has said: &quot;Does God exist? I would say &#x27;Not yet. He married Sonya Rosenwald Kurzweil in 1975. Sonya is a psychologist in private practice in Newton, Massachusetts; she works with women, children, parents, and families. She holds faculty appointments at Harvard Medical School and William James College in graduate education in psychology. Her research interests and publications are in psychotherapy practice. She also serves as an active overseer at Boston Children&#x27;s Museum. Ray and Sonya Kurzweil have a son, Ethan, a venture capitalist, and a daughter, Amy, a cartoonist.

===Creative approach===

Kurzweil has said: &quot;I realize that most inventions fail not because the R&amp;D department can&#x27;t get them to work, but because the timing is wrongnot all of the enabling factors are at play where they are needed. Inventing is a lot like surfing: you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment.&quot; For the past several decades, Kurzweil&#x27;s most effective and common approach to doing creative work has been conducted during a lucid dreamlike state immediately preceding his waking state. He claims to have constructed inventions, solved algorithmic, business strategy, organizational, and interpersonal problems, and written speeches in this state.

==Books==

Kurzweil&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot;, was published in 1990. It discusses the history of computer artificial intelligence (AI) and forecasts future developments. Other AI experts contribute heavily to the book in the form of essays. The Association of American Publishers named it the &quot;Most Outstanding Computer Science Book&quot; of 1990.

In 1993, Kurzweil published a book on nutrition, &quot;The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life&quot;. Its main idea is that high levels of fat intake are the cause of many health disorders common in the U.S., and thus that cutting fat consumption to 10% of total calories consumed is optimal for most people. In 1999, Kurzweil published &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, which further elucidates his theories of the future of technology, which stem from his analysis of long-term trends in biological and technological evolution. Much emphasis is on the likely course of AI development, along with the future of computer architecture. Kurzweil&#x27;s next book, &quot;Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever&quot; (2004), returns to human health and nutrition and is co-authored by Terry Grossman, a medical doctor and specialist in alternative medicine.

&quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot;, published in 2005, was made into a movie starring Pauley Perrette. In 2007, Ptolemaic Productions acquired the rights to &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot;, &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, including the rights to film Kurzweil&#x27;s life and ideas for the documentary film &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;, directed by Barry Ptolemy. &quot;Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever&quot;, a follow-up to &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, was released in 2009. Kurzweil&#x27;s book &quot;How to Create a Mind&quot; was released in 2012. In it he describes his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind, the theory that the neocortex is a hierarchical system of pattern recognizers, and argues that emulating this architecture in machines could lead to artificial superintelligence.

Kurzweil&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Danielle: Chronicles of a Superheroine&quot;, follows a girl who uses her intelligence and her friends&#x27; help to tackle real-world problems. It follows a structure akin to the scientific method. Chapters are organized as year-by-year episodes from Danielle&#x27;s childhood and adolescence. The book comes with companion materials, &quot;A Chronicle of Ideas&quot; and &quot;How You Can Be a Danielle&quot;, that provide real-world context. It was released in 2019.

Kurzweil&#x27;s latest book, &quot;The Singularity Is Nearer: When We Merge with AI&quot;, was published in 2024.

==Films==
In 2010, Kurzweil wrote and co-produced the film &quot;The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future&quot;, directed by Anthony Waller and based in part on the book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot;. Part fiction, part nonfiction, the film blends interviews with 20 big thinkers (such as Marvin Minsky) with a narrative story that illustrates some of Kurzweil&#x27;s key ideas, including a computer avatar (Ramona) who saves the world from self-replicating microscopic robots. An independent, feature-length documentary, &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;, was made about Kurzweil, his life, and his ideas. 

In 2010, an independent documentary film, &quot;Plug &amp; Pray&quot;, premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival, in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics, the late Joseph Weizenbaum, argue about the benefits of eternal life. Independent filmmaker Doug Wolens&#x27;s feature-length documentary film &quot;The Singularity&quot; (2012) showcases Kurzweil and has been acclaimed as &quot;a large-scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter-futurist ideas&quot; and &quot;the best documentary on the Singularity to date&quot;.

==Music==

===Our Lady Peace===

On December 12, 2000, Columbia Records released the Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace&#x27;s album &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. Although not initially so intended, the project evolved into a conceptual interpretation of Kurzweil&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;. The band emailed Kurzweil to ask permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil&#x27;s excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album. As a result, short tracks of spoken dialog by Kurzweil are interspersed among the album&#x27;s songs. The Kurzweil K250 keyboard is also used on the album.

===The Law of Accelerating Returns===
In his 1999 book &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, Kurzweil proposed &quot;The Law of Accelerating Returns&quot;, according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially. He further emphasized this issue in his 2001 essay &quot;The Law of Accelerating Returns&quot;, which proposes an extension of Moore&#x27;s law to a wide variety of technologies and argues in favor of John von Neumann&#x27;s concept of a technological singularity.

===Genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics===

Kurzweil was working with the Army Science Board in 2006 to develop a rapid response system to deal with the possible abuse of biotechnology. He suggested that a bioterrorist could use the same technologies that empower us to reprogram biology away from cancer and heart disease to reprogram a virus to be more deadly, communicable, and stealthy. But he suggests we have the scientific tools to defend against such an attack, much as we defend against computer software viruses. Kurzweil has testified before Congress on nanotechnology, saying that it has the potential to solve serious global problems such as poverty, disease, and climate change: &quot;Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill&quot;.

In media appearances, Kurzweil has stressed nanotechnology&#x27;s extreme potential dangers but argues that, in practice, progress cannot be stopped because that would require a totalitarian system, and any attempt to do so would drive dangerous technologies underground and deprive responsible scientists of the tools needed for defense. He suggests that the proper place of regulation is to ensure that technological progress proceeds safely and quickly but does not deprive the world of profound benefits. He said: &quot;To avoid dangers such as unrestrained nanobot replication, we need relinquishment at the right level and to place our highest priority on the continuing advance of defensive technologies, staying ahead of destructive technologies. An overall strategy should include a streamlined regulatory process, a global program of monitoring for unknown or evolving biological pathogens, temporary moratoriums, raising public awareness, international cooperation, software reconnaissance, and fostering values of liberty, tolerance, and respect for knowledge and diversity.&quot;

===Health and aging===

Kurzweil admits that he cared little for his health until age 35, when he was found to suffer from a glucose intolerance, an early form of type II diabetes (a major risk factor for heart disease). He then found a doctor, Terry Grossman, who shared his unconventional beliefs and helped him to develop an extreme regimen involving hundreds of pills, chemical intravenous treatments, red wine, and various other methods to attempt to extend his lifespan. In 2007, Kurzweil was ingesting &quot;250 supplements, eight to 10 glasses of alkaline water and 10 cups of green tea&quot; every day and drinking several glasses of red wine a week in an effort to &quot;reprogram&quot; his biochemistry. By 2008, he had reduced the number of supplement pills to 150. By 2015, Kurzweil further reduced his daily pill regimen to 100 pills.

Kurzweil asserts that in the future, everyone will live forever. In a 2013 interview, he said that in 15 years, medical technology could add more than a year to one&#x27;s remaining life expectancy for each year that passes, and we could then &quot;outrun our own deaths&quot;. Among other things, he has supported the SENS Research Foundation&#x27;s approach to finding a way to repair aging damage, and has encouraged the general public to hasten their research by donating.

===Futurism and transhumanism===

Kurzweil&#x27;s standing as a futurist and transhumanist has led to his involvement in several singularity-themed organizations. In 2004, he joined the advisory board of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. In 2005, he joined the scientific advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation. On May 13, 2006, Kurzweil was the first speaker at the Singularity Summit at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. In 2013, he was the keynote speaker at the Research, Innovation, Start-up and Employment (RISE) international conference in Seoul. In 2009, Kurzweil, Google, and the NASA Ames Research Center announced the creation of the Singularity University training center for corporate executives and government officials. The university&#x27;s self-described mission is to &quot;assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies and apply, focus and guide these tools to address humanity&#x27;s grand challenges&quot;. Using Vernor Vinge&#x27;s Singularity concept as a foundation, the university offered its first nine-week graduate program to 40 students in 2009.

Kurzweil views the human body as a system of thousands of &quot;programs&quot; and believes that understanding all their functions could be the key to building truly sentient AI.

=== Universal basic income ===
Kurzweil advocates universal basic income (UBI), arguing that progress in science and technology will lead to an abundance of virtually free resources, enabling every citizen to live without the need to work: &quot;We are clearly headed toward a situation where everyone can live very well&quot;. According to him, the major hurdle to introducing UBI is not its feasibility, but political will, which is slowly emerging. In a 2018 TED Talk, he predicted that &quot;in the early 2030s, we&#x27;ll have universal basic income in the developed world, and worldwide by the end of the 2030s. You&#x27;ll be able to live very well on that. The primary concern will be meaning and purpose.&quot;
=== Nuclear weapons ===
During a September 17, 2022, interview, Kurzweil explained his worries about technology being used for violence. When asked about nuclear armageddon and the Russo-Ukrainian War, Kurzweil said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think [nuclear war] is going to happen despite the terrors of that war. It is a possibility but it&#x27;s unlikely, even with the tensions we&#x27;ve had with the nuclear power plant that&#x27;s been taken over. It&#x27;s very tense but I don&#x27;t actually see a lot of people worrying that&#x27;s going to happen. I think we&#x27;ll avoid that. We had two nuclear bombs go off in [1945], so now we&#x27;re 77 years later... we&#x27;ve never had another one go off through anger... there are other dangers besides nuclear weapons.&quot;

==Predictions==

===Past predictions===

Kurzweil&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot;, presents his ideas about the future. Written from 1986 to 1989, it was published in 1990. Building on Ithiel de Sola Pool&#x27;s &quot;Technologies of Freedom&quot; (1983), Kurzweil claims to have forecast the dissolution of the Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control of the flow of information. In the book, Kurzweil also extrapolates trends in improving computer chess software performance, predicting that computers will beat the best human players &quot;by the year 2000&quot;. In May 1997, IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue computer defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a well-publicized match.

Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. When &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; was published, there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world, and the medium was unreliable, difficult to use, and deficient in content. He also said that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content, eventually granting users access &quot;to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services&quot;. Additionally, Kurzweil claims to have correctly foreseen that the preferred mode of Internet access would be through wireless systems, and estimated that this development would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century. In October 2010, Kurzweil released his report &quot;How My Predictions Are Faring&quot; in PDF format, analyzing the predictions he made in his books &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot;, &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, and &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot;. Of the 147 predictions, Kurzweil claimed that 115 were &quot;entirely correct&quot;, 12 were &quot;essentially correct&quot;, 17 were &quot;partially correct&quot;, and three were &quot;wrong&quot;. Combining the &quot;entirely&quot; and &quot;essentially&quot; correct, Kurzweil&#x27;s claimed accuracy rate comes to 86%.

In &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, Daniel Lyons criticized Kurzweil for some of his incorrect predictions for 2009, such as that the economy would continue to boom, that a U.S. company would have a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, that a supercomputer would achieve 20 petaflops, that speech recognition would be in widespread use, and that cars would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways. To the charge that a 20-petaflop supercomputer had not been produced, Kurzweil responded that he considered Google a giant supercomputer, and that it was indeed capable of 20 petaflops.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine claimed that Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions for 2009 were mostly inaccurate, with seven incorrect, four partially correct, and one correct. For example, Kurzweil predicted, &quot;The majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition&quot;, which was not the case.

===Future predictions===

In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book, &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;, which explains his futurist ideas in more depth. In it, he says that with radical life extension will come radical life enhancement. He says he is confident that within 10 years we will have the option to spend some of our time in 3D virtual environments that appear just as real as reality, but that they will not yet be able to directly interact with our nervous system. He expounds on his prediction about nanorobotics, claiming that within 20 years millions of blood-cell sized devices, called nanobots, will fight disease inside our bodies and improve our memory and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil also believes a machine will pass the Turing test by 2029. He says that humans will be a hybrid of biological and non-biological intelligence that becomes increasingly dominated by its non-biological component. In &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;, he writes, &quot;We humans are going to start linking with each other and become a metaconnection; we will all be connected and omnipresent, plugged into a global network that is connected to billions of people and filled with data.&quot;

In 2008, Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the National Academy of Engineering that solar power will scale up to produce all of humanity&#x27;s energy needs in 20 years. According to him, we need to capture only 1 part in 10,000 of the energy from the Sun that hits Earth&#x27;s surface to meet all of humanity&#x27;s energy needs.

==Reception==
===Praise===

Kurzweil was called &quot;the ultimate thinking machine&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 1998 and a &quot;restless genius&quot; by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1989. PBS included him as one of 16 &quot;revolutionaries who made America&quot;, along with other inventors of the past two centuries. &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine ranked Kurzweil eighth among the &quot;most fascinating&quot; entrepreneurs in the U.S. and called him &quot;Edison&#x27;s rightful heir&quot;. Bill Gates called him &quot;the best at predicting the future of artificial intelligence&quot;.

===Criticism===

Although technological singularity is a popular concept in science fiction, authors such as Neal Stephenson and Bruce Sterling have voiced skepticism about its real-world plausibility. Sterling expressed his view in a 2004 talk at the Long Now Foundation called &quot;The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole&quot;. Other prominent AI thinkers and computer scientists who have criticized Kurzweil&#x27;s projections include Daniel Dennett, Rodney Brooks, David Gelernter, and Paul Allen. 

In the December 2010 issue of &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot;, John Rennie criticized Kurzweil for several predictions that did not come true by the originally predicted date. Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy agrees with Kurzweil&#x27;s timeline of future progress, but thinks that technologies such as AI, nanotechnology, and advanced biotechnology will create a dystopian world. Lotus Development Corporation founder Mitch Kapor has called the notion of a technological singularity &quot;intelligent design for the IQ 140 people... This proposition that we&#x27;re heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably different—it&#x27;s fundamentally, in my view, driven by a religious impulse. And all of the frantic arm-waving can&#x27;t obscure that fact for me.&quot; Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has said of Kurzweil&#x27;s and Hans Moravec&#x27;s books: &quot;It&#x27;s an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas, and it&#x27;s very hard to disentangle the two, because these are smart people; they&#x27;re not stupid.&quot; VR pioneer Jaron Lanier has called Kurzweil&#x27;s ideas &quot;cybernetic totalism&quot; and outlined his view on the culture surrounding Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions in an essay for the Edge Foundation called &quot;One Half of a Manifesto&quot;. Physicist and futurist Theodore Modis claims that Kurzweil&#x27;s thesis of a technological singularity lacks scientific rigor.

<text>Robert Phelan Langlands, (; born October 6, 1936) is a Canadian mathematician. He is best known as the founder of the Langlands program, a vast web of conjectures and results connecting representation theory and automorphic forms to the study of Galois groups in number theory, for which he received the 2018 Abel Prize. He is emeritus professor and occupied Albert Einstein&#x27;s office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, until 2020 when he retired.

==Early life and career==
Langlands was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, in 1936 to Robert Langlands and Kathleen J Phelan. He has two younger sisters (Mary b. 1938; Sally b. 1941). In 1945, his family moved to White Rock, near the US border, where his parents had a building supply and construction business.

He graduated from Semiahmoo Secondary School and started enrolling at the University of British Columbia at the age of 16, receiving his undergraduate degree in mathematics in 1957; he continued at UBC to receive a M.Sc. in 1958. He then went to Yale University, where he received a Ph.D. in 1960.

His first academic position was at Princeton University from 1960 to 1967, where he worked as an associate professor. He spent a year in Turkey at METU during 1967–68 in an office next to Cahit Arf&#x27;s. He was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1964 to 1965, then was a professor at Yale University from 1967 to 1972. He was appointed Hermann Weyl Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, and became professor emeritus in January 2007.

==Research==
Langlands&#x27; Ph.D. thesis was on the analytical theory of Lie semigroups, but he soon moved into representation theory, adapting the methods of Harish-Chandra to the theory of automorphic forms. His first accomplishment in this field was a formula for the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms, in which particular types of Harish-Chandra&#x27;s discrete series appeared.

He next constructed an analytical theory of Eisenstein series for reductive groups of rank greater than one, thus extending work of Hans Maass, Walter Roelcke, and Atle Selberg from the early 1950s for rank one groups such as formula_1. This amounted to describing in general terms the continuous spectra of arithmetic quotients, and showing that all automorphic forms arise in terms of cusp forms and the residues of Eisenstein series induced from cusp forms on smaller subgroups. As a first application, he proved the Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers for the large class of arbitrary simply connected Chevalley groups defined over the rational numbers. Previously this had been known only in a few isolated cases and for certain classical groups where it could be shown by induction.

As a second application of this work, he was able to show meromorphic continuation for a large class of formula_2-functions arising in the theory of automorphic forms, not previously known to have them. These occurred in the constant terms of Eisenstein series, and meromorphicity as well as a weak functional equation were a consequence of functional equations for Eisenstein series. This work led in turn, in the winter of 1966–67, to the now well known conjectures making up what is often called the Langlands program. Very roughly speaking, they propose a huge generalization of previously known examples of reciprocity, including (a) classical class field theory, in which characters of local and arithmetic abelian Galois groups are identified with characters of local multiplicative groups and the idele quotient group, respectively; (b) earlier results of Martin Eichler and Goro Shimura in which the Hasse–Weil zeta functions of arithmetic quotients of the upper half plane are identified with formula_2-functions occurring in Hecke&#x27;s theory of holomorphic automorphic forms. These conjectures were first posed in relatively complete form in a famous letter to Weil, written in January 1967. It was in this letter that he introduced what has since become known as the formula_2-group and along with it, the notion of functoriality.

The book by Hervé Jacquet and Langlands on formula_5 presented a theory of automorphic forms for the general linear group formula_5, establishing among other things the Jacquet–Langlands correspondence showing that functoriality was capable of explaining very precisely how automorphic forms for formula_5 related to those for quaternion algebras. This book applied the adelic trace formula for formula_5 and quaternion algebras to do this. Subsequently, James Arthur, a student of Langlands while he was at Yale, successfully developed the trace formula for groups of higher rank. This has become a major tool in attacking functoriality in general, and in particular has been applied to demonstrating that the Hasse–Weil zeta functions of certain Shimura varieties are among the formula_2-functions arising from automorphic forms.

The functoriality conjecture is far from proven, but a special case (the octahedral Artin conjecture, proved by Langlands and Tunnell) was the starting point of Andrew Wiles&#x27; attack on the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture and Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

In the mid-1980s Langlands turned his attention to physics, particularly the problems of percolation and conformal invariance. In 1995, Langlands started a collaboration with Bill Casselman at the University of British Columbia with the aim of posting nearly all of his writings—including publications, preprints, as well as selected correspondence—on the Internet. The correspondence includes a copy of the original letter to Weil that introduced the formula_2-group. In recent years he has turned his attention back to automorphic forms, working in particular on a theme he calls &quot;beyond endoscopy&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Langlands has received the 1996 Wolf Prize (which he shared with Andrew Wiles), the 2005 AMS Steele Prize, the 1980 Jeffery–Williams Prize, the 1988 NAS Award in Mathematics from the National Academy of Sciences, the 2000 grande médaille de l&#x27;Académie des sciences de Paris, the 2006 Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences (with Richard Taylor) for his work on automorphic forms. In 2018, Langlands was awarded the Abel Prize for &quot;his visionary program connecting representation theory to number theory&quot;.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1972 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1981. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. Langlands was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. He was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1993 and a member of the American Philosophical Society 2004.

Among other honorary degrees, in 2003, Langlands received a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Université Laval.

In 2019, Langlands was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada.

On January 10, 2020, Langlands was honoured at Semiahmoo Secondary, which installed a mural to celebrate his contributions to mathematics.

==Personal life==
Langlands has been married to Charlotte Lorraine Cheverie (b 1935) since 1957. They have four children (2 daughters and 2 sons). He holds Canadian and American citizenships. 

Langlands spent a year in Turkey in 1967–68, where his office at the Middle East Technical University was next to that of Cahit Arf. In addition to his mathematical studies, Langlands likes to learn foreign languages, both for better understanding of foreign publications on his topic and just as a hobby. He speaks English, French, Turkish and German, and reads (but does not speak) Russian.

<text>Rickets, scientific nomenclature: rachitis (from Greek , meaning &#x27;in or of the spine&#x27;), is a condition that results in weak or soft bones in children and may have either dietary deficiency or genetic causes. Symptoms include bowed legs, stunted growth, bone pain, large forehead, and trouble sleeping. Complications may include bone deformities, bone pseudofractures and fractures, muscle spasms, or an abnormally curved spine. The analogous condition in adults is osteomalacia.
The most common cause of rickets is a vitamin D deficiency, although hereditary genetic forms also exist. This can result from eating a diet without enough vitamin D, dark skin, too little sun exposure, exclusive breastfeeding without vitamin D supplementation, celiac disease, and certain genetic conditions. Other factors may include not enough calcium or phosphorus. The underlying mechanism involves insufficient calcification of the growth plate. Diagnosis is generally based on blood tests finding a low calcium, low phosphorus, and a high alkaline phosphatase together with X-rays.
Prevention for exclusively breastfed babies is vitamin D supplements. Otherwise, treatment depends on the underlying cause. If due to a lack of vitamin D, treatment is usually with vitamin D and calcium. This generally results in improvements within a few weeks. Bone deformities may also improve over time. Occasionally surgery may be performed to correct bone deformities. Genetic forms of the disease typically require specialized treatment.
Rickets occurs relatively commonly in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It is generally uncommon in the United States and Europe, except among certain minority groups but rates have been increasing among some populations. It begins in childhood, typically between the ages of 3 and 18 months old. Rates of disease are equal in males and females. Cases of what is believed to have been rickets have been described since the 1st century, and the condition was widespread in the Roman Empire. The disease was common into the 20th century. Early treatments included the use of cod liver oil.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of dietary deficiency rickets can include bone tenderness, and a susceptibility for bone fractures, particularly greenstick fractures. Early skeletal deformities can arise in infants such as soft, thinned skull bones – a condition known as craniotabes, which is the first sign of rickets; skull bossing may be present and a delayed closure of the fontanelles.

Young children may have bowed legs and thickened ankles and wrists; older children may have knock knees. Spinal curvatures of kyphoscoliosis or lumbar lordosis may be present. The pelvic bones may be deformed. A condition known as rachitic rosary can result as the thickening caused by nodules forming on the costochondral joints. This appears as a visible bump in the middle of each rib in a line on each side of the body. This somewhat resembles a rosary, giving rise to its name. The deformity of a pigeon chest may result in the presence of Harrison&#x27;s groove.

Hypocalcemia, a low level of calcium in the blood can result in tetany – uncontrolled muscle spasms. Dental problems can also arise.

An X-ray or radiograph of an advanced patient with rickets tends to present in a classic way: the bowed legs (outward curve of long bone of the legs) and a deformed chest. Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive &quot;square headed&quot; appearance known as &quot;caput quadratum&quot;. These deformities persist into adult life if not treated. Long-term consequences include permanent curvatures or disfiguration of the long bones, and a curved back.

==Cause==
Maternal deficiencies may be the cause of overt bone disease from before birth and impairment of bone quality after birth. The primary cause of congenital rickets is vitamin D deficiency in the mother&#x27;s blood. Vitamin D ensures that serum phosphate and calcium levels are sufficient to facilitate the mineralization of bone. Congenital rickets may also be caused by other maternal diseases, including severe osteomalacia, untreated celiac disease, malabsorption, pre-eclampsia, and premature birth. Rickets in children is similar to osteoporosis in the elderly, with brittle bones. Pre-natal care includes checking vitamin levels and ensuring that any deficiencies are supplemented.

Exclusively breast-fed infants may require rickets prevention by vitamin D supplementation or an increased exposure to sunlight.

In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, there is sufficient endogenous vitamin D due to exposure to the sun. However, the disease occurs among older toddlers and children in these countries, which in these circumstances is attributed to low dietary calcium intakes due to a mainly cereal-based diet.

Those at higher risk for developing rickets include:
* Breast-fed infants whose mothers are not exposed to sunlight
* Breast-fed infants who are not exposed to sunlight
* Breast-fed babies who are exposed to little sunlight
* Adolescents, in particular when undergoing the pubertal growth spurt
* Any child whose diet does not contain enough vitamin D or calcium

Diseases causing soft bones in infants, like hypophosphatasia or hypophosphatemia, can also lead to rickets.

Strontium is allied with calcium uptake into bones; at excessive dietary levels strontium has a rachitogenic (rickets-producing) action.

===Sunlight===
Sunlight, especially ultraviolet light, lets human skin cells convert vitamin D from an inactive to active state. In the absence of vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in hypocalcaemia, leading to skeletal and dental deformities and neuromuscular symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella and shiitake mushrooms, and oily fishes such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare X-linked dominant form exists called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.

Cases have been reported in Britain in recent years of rickets in children of many social backgrounds caused by insufficient production in the body of vitamin D because the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet light was not reaching the skin due to use of strong sunblock, too much &quot;covering up&quot; in sunlight, or not getting out into the sun. Other cases have been reported among the children of some ethnic groups in which mothers avoid exposure to the sun for religious or cultural reasons, leading to a maternal shortage of vitamin D, and people with darker skin need more sunlight to maintain vitamin D levels.

Rickets had historically been a problem in London, especially during the Industrial Revolution. Persistent thick fog and heavy industrial smog permeating the city blocked out significant amounts of sunlight to such an extent that up to 80 percent of children at one time had varying degrees of rickets in one form or the other. It is sometimes known &quot;the English Disease&quot; in some foreign languages (e.g. German: , Dutch: , Hungarian: , Swedish: ).

===Skin color theory===
Rickets is often a result of vitamin D3 deficiency. The correlation between human skin color and latitude is thought to be the result of positive selection to varying levels of solar ultraviolet radiation. Northern latitudes have selection for lighter skin that allows UV rays to produce vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Conversely, latitudes near the equator have selection for darker skin that can block the majority of UV radiation to protect from toxic levels of vitamin D, as well as skin cancer.

An anecdote often cited to support this hypothesis is that Arctic populations whose skin is relatively darker for their latitude, such as the Inuit, have a diet that is historically rich in vitamin D. Since these people acquire vitamin D through their diet, there is not a positive selective force to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight.

Environment mismatch: vitamin D deficiency arises from a mismatch between an individual&#x27;s previous and current environment. This risk of mismatch increases with advances in transportation methods and increases in urban population size at high latitudes.

Similar to the environmental mismatch when dark-skinned people live at high latitudes, Rickets can also occur in religious communities that require long garments with hoods and veils. These hoods and veils act as sunlight barriers that prevent individuals from synthesizing vitamin D naturally from the sun.

In a study by Mithal et al., vitamin D insufficiency of various countries was measured by lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25(OH) D is an indicator of vitamin D insufficiency that can be easily measured. These percentages should be regarded as relative vitamin D levels, and not as predicting evidence for development of rickets.

Asian immigrants living in Europe have an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency was found in 40% of non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands, and in more than 80% of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants.

The Middle East, despite high rates of sun-exposure, has the highest rates of rickets worldwide. This can be explained by limited sun exposure due to cultural practices and lack of vitamin D supplementation for breast-feeding women. Up to 70% and 80% of adolescent girls in Iran and Saudi Arabia, respectively, have vitamin D insufficiency. Socioeconomic factors that limit a vitamin D rich diet also plays a role.
In the United States, vitamin D insufficiency varies dramatically by ethnicity. Among females aged 70 years and older, the prevalence of low serum 25(OH) D levels was 28.5% for non-Hispanic whites, 55% for Mexican Americans, and 68% for non-Hispanic blacks. Among males, the prevalence was 23%, 45%, and 58%, respectively.

A systematic review published in the Cochrane Library looked at children up to three years old in Turkey and China and found there was a beneficial association between vitamin D and rickets. In Turkey children getting vitamin D had only a 4% chance of developing rickets compared to children who received no medical intervention. In China, a combination of vitamin D, calcium and nutritional counseling was linked to a decreased risk of rickets.

Parents can supplement their nutritional intake with vitamin D enhanced beverages if they feel their child is at risk for vitamin D deficiency.

A recent review links rickets disease to exclusive consumption of Neocate baby formula.

==Diagnosis==
Rickets may be diagnosed with the help of:
* Blood tests:
** Serum calcium may show low levels of calcium, serum phosphorus may be low, and serum alkaline phosphatase may be high from bones or changes in the shape or structure of the bones. This can show enlarged limbs and joints.
* A bone density scan may be undertaken.
* Radiography typically show widening of the zones of provisional calcification of the metaphyses secondary to unmineralized osteoid. Cupping, fraying, and splaying of metaphyses typically appears with growth and continued weight bearing. These changes are seen predominantly at sites of rapid growth, including the proximal humerus, distal radius, distal femur and both the proximal and the distal tibia. Therefore, a skeletal survey for rickets can be accomplished with anteroposterior radiographs of the knees, wrists, and ankles.

In veterinary practice, rickets, osteodystrophy and mineral metabolism disorders are diagnosed using an ultrasound echosteometer in the design М.М. Orlov and А.V. Savinkov.

*** Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR)
*** Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR)
** Hypophosphatemia (typically secondary to malabsorption)
** Fanconi&#x27;s syndrome
* Secondary to other diseases
** Tumor-induced osteomalacia
** McCune–Albright syndrome
** Epidermal nevus syndrome
** Dent&#x27;s disease

===Differential diagnosis===
Osteochondrodysplasias, also known as genetic bone diseases, may mimic the clinical picture of rickets in regard to the features of bone deformities. The radiologic picture and the laboratory findings of serum calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase are important differentiating factors. Blount&#x27;s disease is an important differential diagnosis because it causes knee deformities in a similar fashion to rickets namely bow legs or genu varum. Infants with rickets can have bone fractures. This sometimes leads to child abuse allegations. This issue appears to be more common for solely nursing infants of black mothers, in winter in temperate climates, suffering poor nutrition and no vitamin D supplementation. People with darker skin produce less vitamin D than those with lighter skin, for the same amount of sunlight.

==Treatment==
===Diet and sunlight===
Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium, phosphates and vitamin D. Exposure to ultraviolet B light (most easily obtained when the sun is highest in the sky), cod liver oil, halibut-liver oil, and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D.

A sufficient amount of ultraviolet B light in sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets. Darker-skinned people need to be exposed longer to the ultraviolet rays. The replacement of vitamin D has been proven to correct rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light therapy and medicine.

Recommendations are for 400 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day for infants and children. Children who do not get adequate amounts of vitamin D are at increased risk of rickets. Vitamin D is essential for allowing the body to uptake calcium for use in proper bone calcification and maintenance.

===Supplementation===
Sufficient vitamin D levels can also be achieved through dietary supplementation and/or exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the preferred form since it is more readily absorbed than vitamin D2. Most dermatologists recommend vitamin D supplementation as an alternative to unprotected ultraviolet exposure due to the increased risk of skin cancer associated with sun exposure. Endogenous production with full body exposure to sunlight is approximately 250 μg (10,000 IU) per day.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), all infants, including those who are exclusively breast-fed, may need vitamin D supplementation until they start drinking at least of vitamin D-fortified milk or formula a day.

Despite this recommendation, a recent Cochrane systematic review has found limited evidence that vitamin D plus calcium, or calcium alone compared to vitamin D improves healing in children with nutritional rickets.

===Surgery===
Occasionally surgery is needed to correct severe and persistent deformities of the lower limbs, especially around the knees namely genu varum and genu valgum. Surgical correction of rachitic deformities can be achieved through osteotomies or guided growth surgery. Guided growth surgery has almost replaced the use of corrective osteotomies. The functional results of guided growth surgery in children with rickets are satisfactory. While bone osteotomies work through acute/immediate correction of the limb deformity, guided growth works through gradual correction.

==Epidemiology==
In developed countries, rickets is a rare disease (incidence of less than 1 in 200,000). Recently, cases of rickets have been reported among children who are not fed enough vitamin D.

In 2013/2014 there were fewer than 700 cases in England. In 2019 the number of cases hospitalised was said to be the highest in 50 years.

Rickets occurs relatively commonly in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

== History ==
Greek physician Soranus of Ephesus, one of the chief representatives of the Methodic school of medicine who practiced in Alexandria and subsequently in Rome, reported deformation of the bones in infants as early as the first and second centuries AD. The first use of the word &#x27;rickets&#x27; is the handwritten entry for 25 February 1632 in &#x27;Receipt Books&#x27; of the Fairfax Family which lists five remedies for &#x27;rickets in children&#x27;. The word ‘rickets&#x27; occured first in print in 1634 in the Annual Bill of Mortality of the City of London. Rickets was not defined as a specific medical condition until 1645, when an English physician Daniel Whistler gave the earliest known description of the disease. 

In 1650 a treatise on rickets was published by Francis Glisson, a physician at Caius College, Cambridge, who said it had first appeared about 30 years previously in the counties of Dorset and Somerset. 

In 1857, John Snow suggested rickets, then widespread in Britain, was being caused by the adulteration of bakers&#x27; bread with alum. 

German pediatrician Kurt Huldschinsky successfully demonstrated in the winter of 1918–1919 how rickets could be treated with ultraviolet lamps. 

Between 1918 and 1920, the role of diet in the development of rickets was determined by Edward Mellanby. 

In 1923, American physician Harry Steenbock demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. Steenbock&#x27;s irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, but most memorably for milk. 

By 1945, rickets had all but been eliminated in the United States. 

However, beginning around 2003, rickets reemerged as an issue in the US for some populations causing the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all infants have Vitamin D intake of 200 IU per day.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;rickets&quot; may be from the Old English word (&#x27;to twist&#x27;), although because this is conjectured, several major dictionaries simply say &quot;origin unknown&quot;. The name &quot;rickets&quot; is plural in form but usually singular in construction. The Greek word (, meaning &#x27;in or of the spine&#x27;) was later adopted as the scientific term for rickets, due chiefly to the words&#x27; similarity in sound.

<doc id="25989" wikidata="Q166194" url="?curid=25989" title="RGB color model">
<text>The RGB color model is an additive color model in which the red, green, and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography and colored lighting. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.

RGB is a &quot;device-dependent&quot; color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual red, green, and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same &quot;color&quot; across devices without some kind of color management.

Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, OLED, quantum dots, etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays and large screens such as the Jumbotron. Color printers, on the other hand, are not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices typically using the CMYK color model.

==Additive colors==

To form a color with RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed (for example by emission from a black screen or by reflection from a white screen). Each of the three beams is called a &quot;component&quot; of that color, and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.

The RGB color model is &quot;additive&quot; in the sense that if light beams of differing color (frequency) are superposed in space their light spectra adds up, wavelength for wavelength, to make up a resulting, total spectrum. This is in contrast to the subtractive color model, particularly the CMY Color Model, which applies to paints, inks, dyes and other substances whose color depends on &quot;reflecting&quot; certain components (frequencies) of the light under which we see them.

In the additive model, if the resulting spectrum, e.g. of superposing three colors, is flat, white color is perceived by the human eye upon direct incidence on the retina. This is in stark contrast to the subtractive model, where the perceived resulting spectrum is what reflecting surfaces, such as dyed surfaces, emit. A dye filters out all colors but its own; two blended dyes filter out all colors but the common color component between them, e.g. green as the common component between yellow and cyan, red as the common component between magenta and yellow, and blue-violet as the common component between magenta and cyan. There is no common color component among magenta, cyan and yellow, thus rendering a spectrum of zero intensity: black.

Zero intensity for each component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the &quot;black&quot;), and full intensity of each gives a white; the &quot;quality&quot; of this white depends on the nature of the primary light sources, but if they are properly balanced, the result is a neutral white matching the system&#x27;s white point. When the intensities for all the components are the same, the result is a shade of gray, darker, or lighter depending on the intensity. When the intensities are different, the result is a colorized hue, more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed.

When one of the components has the strongest intensity, the color is a hue near this primary color (red-ish, green-ish, or blue-ish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then the color is a hue of a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta, or yellow). A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is blue+red, and yellow is red+green. Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue. When all the primary colors are mixed in equal intensities, the result is white.

The RGB color model itself does not define what is meant by &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; colorimetrically, and so the results of mixing them are not specified as absolute, but relative to the primary colors. When the exact chromaticities of the red, green, and blue primaries are defined, the color model then becomes an absolute color space, such as sRGB or Adobe RGB.

==Physical principles for the choice of red, green, and blue==

The choice of primary colors is related to the physiology of the human eye; good primaries are stimuli that maximize the difference between the responses of the cone cells of the human retina to light of different wavelengths, and that thereby make a large color triangle.

The normal three kinds of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the human eye (cone cells) respond most to yellow (long wavelength or L), green (medium or M), and violet (short or S) light (peak wavelengths near 570 nm, 540 nm and 440 nm, respectively). The difference in the signals received from the three kinds allows the brain to differentiate a wide gamut of different colors, while being most sensitive (overall) to yellowish-green light and to differences between hues in the green-to-orange region.

As an example, suppose that light in the orange range of wavelengths (approximately 577 nm to 597 nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is the basis of our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.

Use of the three primary colors is not sufficient to reproduce &quot;all&quot; colors; only colors within the color triangle defined by the chromaticities of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing of non-negative amounts of those colors of light.
==History of RGB color model theory and usage==
The RGB color model is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and on James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s color triangle that elaborated that theory ().

The first experiments with RGB in early color photography were made in 1861 by Maxwell himself, and involved the process of combining three color-filtered separate takes. To reproduce the color photograph, three matching projections over a screen in a dark room were necessary.

The additive RGB model and variants such as orange–green–violet were also used in the Autochrome Lumière color plates and other screen-plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process in the early twentieth century. Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers, such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in the period 1909 through 1915. Such methods lasted until about 1960 using the expensive and extremely complex tri-color carbro Autotype process.

When employed, the reproduction of prints from three-plate photos was done by dyes or pigments using the complementary CMY model, by simply using the negative plates of the filtered takes: reverse red gives the cyan plate, and so on.

===Television===
Before the development of practical electronic TV, there were patents on mechanically scanned color systems as early as 1889 in Russia. The color TV pioneer John Logie Baird demonstrated the world&#x27;s first RGB color transmission in 1928, and also the world&#x27;s first color broadcast in 1938, in London. In his experiments, scanning and display were done mechanically by spinning colorized wheels.

The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) began an experimental RGB field-sequential color system in 1940. Images were scanned electrically, but the system still used a moving part: the transparent RGB color wheel rotating at above 1,200 rpm in synchronism with the vertical scan. The camera and the cathode-ray tube (CRT) were both monochromatic. Color was provided by color wheels in the camera and the receiver. More recently, color wheels have been used in field-sequential projection TV receivers based on the Texas Instruments monochrome DLP imager.

The modern RGB shadow mask technology for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in 1938.

===Personal computers===
Personal computers of the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the Apple II and VIC-20, use composite video. The Commodore 64 and the Atari 8-bit computers use S-Video derivatives. IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (4 bits—1 bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) for its IBM PC in 1981, later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphics card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, but it was not until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analog, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added true-color. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised true-color Super VGA hardware.

==RGB devices==
===RGB and displays===

One common application of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode-ray tube (CRT), liquid-crystal display (LCD), plasma display, or organic light emitting diode (OLED) display such as a television, a computer&#x27;s monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which the eye interprets as a given solid color. All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image.

During digital image processing each pixel can be represented in the computer memory or interface hardware (for example, a &quot;graphics card&quot;) as binary values for the red, green, and blue color components. When properly managed, these values are converted into intensities or voltages via gamma correction to correct the inherent nonlinearity of some devices, such that the intended intensities are reproduced on the display.

The Quattron released by Sharp uses RGB color and adds yellow as a sub-pixel, supposedly allowing an increase in the number of available colors.

====Video electronics====
RGB is also the term referring to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe since it is the best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals.

Outside Europe, RGB is not very popular as a video signal format; S-Video takes that spot in most non-European regions. However, almost all computer monitors around the world use RGB.

====Video framebuffer====
A framebuffer is a digital device for computers which stores data in the so-called &quot;video memory&quot; (comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips). This data goes either to three digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (for analog monitors), one per primary color or directly to digital monitors. Driven by software, the CPU (or other specialized chips) write the appropriate bytes into the video memory to define the image. Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting 8 bits to each of the R, G, and B components. RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color look-up table (CLUT) if indexed color graphic modes are used.

A CLUT is a specialized RAM that stores R, G, and B values that define specific colors. Each color has its own address (index)—consider it as a descriptive reference number that provides that specific color when the image needs it. The content of the CLUT is much like a palette of colors. Image data that uses indexed color specifies addresses within the CLUT to provide the required R, G, and B values for each specific pixel, one pixel at a time. Of course, before displaying, the CLUT has to be loaded with R, G, and B values that define the palette of colors required for each image to be rendered. Some video applications store such palettes in PAL files (&quot;Age of Empires&quot; game, for example, uses over half-a-dozen) and can combine CLUTs on screen.

;RGB24 and RGB32
This indirect scheme restricts the number of available colors in an image CLUT—typically 256-cubed (8 bits in three color channels with values of 0–255)—although each color in the RGB24 CLUT table has only 8 bits representing 256 codes for each of the R, G, and B primaries, making 16,777,216 possible colors. However, the advantage is that an indexed-color image file can be significantly smaller than it would be with only 8 bits per pixel for each primary.

Modern storage, however, is far less costly, greatly reducing the need to minimize image file size. By using an appropriate combination of red, green, and blue intensities, many colors can be displayed. Current typical display adapters use up to 24 bits of information for each pixel: 8-bit per component multiplied by three components (see the Numeric representations section below (24 bits = 2563, each primary value of 8 bits with values of 0–255). With this system, 16,777,216 (2563 or 224) discrete combinations of R, G, and B values are allowed, providing millions of different (though not necessarily distinguishable) hue, saturation and lightness shades. Increased shading has been implemented in various ways, some formats such as .png and .tga files among others using a fourth grayscale color channel as a masking layer, often called RGB32.

For images with a modest range of brightnesses from the darkest to the lightest, 8 bits per primary color provides good-quality images, but extreme images require more bits per primary color as well as the advanced display technology. For more information see High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging.

====Nonlinearity====
In classic CRT devices, the brightness of a given point over the fluorescent screen due to the impact of accelerated electrons is not proportional to the voltages applied to the electron gun control grids, but to an expansive function of that voltage. The amount of this deviation is known as its gamma value (formula_1), the argument for a power law function, which closely describes this behavior. A linear response is given by a gamma value of 1.0, but actual CRT nonlinearities have a gamma value around 2.0 to 2.5.

Similarly, the intensity of the output on TV and computer display devices is not directly proportional to the R, G, and B applied electric signals (or file data values which drive them through digital-to-analog converters). On a typical standard 2.2-gamma CRT display, an input intensity RGB value of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) only outputs about 22% of full brightness (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), instead of 50%. To obtain the correct response, a gamma correction is used in encoding the image data, and possibly further corrections as part of the color calibration process of the device. Gamma affects black-and-white TV as well as color. In standard color TV, broadcast signals are gamma corrected.

===RGB and cameras===
In color television and video cameras manufactured before the 1990s, the incoming light was separated by prisms and filters into the three RGB primary colors feeding each color into a separate video camera tube (or &quot;pickup tube&quot;). These tubes are a type of cathode-ray tube, not to be confused with that of CRT displays.

With the arrival of commercially viable charge-coupled device (CCD) technology in the 1980s, first, the pickup tubes were replaced with this kind of sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.

Photographic digital cameras that use a CMOS or CCD image sensor often operate with some variation of the RGB model. In a Bayer filter arrangement, green is given twice as many detectors as red and blue (ratio 1:2:1) in order to achieve higher luminance resolution than chrominance resolution. The sensor has a grid of red, green, and blue detectors arranged so that the first row is RGRGRGRG, the next is GBGBGBGB, and that sequence is repeated in subsequent rows. For every channel, missing pixels are obtained by interpolation in the demosaicing process to build up the complete image. Also, other processes used to be applied in order to map the camera RGB measurements into a standard color space as sRGB.

===RGB and scanners===
In computing, an image scanner is a device that optically scans images (printed text, handwriting, or an object) and converts it to a digital image which is transferred to a computer. Among other formats, flat, drum and film scanners exist, and most of them support RGB color. They can be considered the successors of early telephotography input devices, which were able to send consecutive scan lines as analog amplitude modulation signals through standard telephonic lines to appropriate receivers; such systems were in use in press since the 1920s to the mid-1990s. Color telephotographs were sent as three separated RGB filtered images consecutively.

Currently available scanners typically use CCD or contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.

==Numeric representations==


A color in the RGB color model is described by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. The color is expressed as an RGB triplet (&quot;r&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value. If all the components are at zero the result is black; if all are at maximum, the result is the brightest representable white.

These ranges may be quantified in several different ways:

* From 0 to 1, with any fractional value in between. This representation is used in theoretical analyses, and in systems that use floating point representations.
* Each color component value can also be written as a percentage, from 0% to 100%.
* In computers, the component values are often stored as unsigned integer numbers in the range 0 to 255, the range that a single 8-bit byte can offer. These are often represented as either decimal or hexadecimal numbers.
* High-end digital image equipment are often able to deal with larger integer ranges for each primary color, such as 0..1023 (10 bits), 0..65535 (16 bits) or even larger, by extending the 24 bits (three 8-bit values) to 32-bit, 48-bit, or 64-bit units (more or less independent from the particular computer&#x27;s word size).

For example, brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as:

In many environments, the component values within the ranges are not managed as linear (that is, the numbers are nonlinearly related to the intensities that they represent), as in digital cameras and TV broadcasting and receiving due to gamma correction, for example. Linear and nonlinear transformations are often dealt with via digital image processing. Representations with only 8 bits per component are considered sufficient if gamma correction is used.

Following is the mathematical relationship between RGB space to HSI space (hue, saturation, and intensity: HSI color space):

formula_2

If formula_3, then formula_4.

===Color depth===
The RGB color model is one of the most common ways to encode color in computing, and several different digital representations are in use. The main characteristic of all of them is the quantization of the possible values per component (technically a &quot;sample&quot;) by using only integer numbers within some range, usually from 0 to some power of two minus one (2&quot;n&quot; − 1) to fit them into some bit groupings. Encodings of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 16 bits per color are commonly found; the total number of bits used for an RGB color is typically called the color depth.

==Geometric representation==

Since colors are usually defined by three components, not only in the RGB model, but also in other color models such as CIELAB and Y&#x27;UV, among others, then a three-dimensional volume is described by treating the component values as ordinary Cartesian coordinates in a Euclidean space. For the RGB model, this is represented by a cube using non-negative values within a 0–1 range, assigning black to the origin at the vertex (0, 0, 0), and with increasing intensity values running along the three axes up to white at the vertex (1, 1, 1), diagonally opposite black.

An RGB triplet (&quot;r&quot;,&quot;g&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) represents the three-dimensional coordinate of the point of the given color within the cube or its faces or along its edges. This approach allows computations of the color similarity of two given RGB colors by simply calculating the distance between them: the shorter the distance, the higher the similarity. Out-of-gamut computations can also be performed this way.

==Colors in web-page design==
Initially, the limited color depth of most video hardware led to a limited color palette of 216 RGB colors, defined by the Netscape Color Cube. The web-safe color palette consists of the 216 (63) combinations of red, green, and blue where each color can take one of six values (in hexadecimal): #00, #33, #66, #99, #CC or #FF (based on the 0 to 255 range for each value discussed above). These hexadecimal values = 0, 51, 102, 153, 204, 255 in decimal, which = 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% in terms of intensity. This seems fine for splitting up 216 colors into a cube of dimension 6. However, lacking gamma correction, the perceived intensity on a standard 2.5 gamma CRT / LCD is only: 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, 100%. See the actual web safe color palette for a visual confirmation that the majority of the colors produced are very dark.

With the predominance of 24-bit displays, the use of the full 16.7 million colors of the HTML RGB color code no longer poses problems for most viewers. The sRGB color space (a &quot;device-independent&quot; color space) for HTML was formally adopted as an Internet standard in HTML 3.2, though it had been in use for some time before that. All images and colors are interpreted as being sRGB (unless another color space is specified) and all modern displays can display this color space (with color management being built in into browsers or operating systems).

The syntax in CSS is:

 rgb(#,#,#)

where # equals the proportion of red, green, and blue respectively. This syntax can be used after such selectors as &quot;background-color:&quot; or (for text) &quot;color:&quot;.

Wide gamut color is possible in modern CSS, being supported by all major browsers since 2023.

For example, a color on the DCI-P3 color space can be indicated as:

 color(display-p3 # # #)

where # equals the proportion of red, green, and blue in 0.0 to 1.0 respectively.

==Color management==
Proper reproduction of colors, especially in professional environments, requires color management of all the devices involved in the production process, many of them using RGB. Color management results in several transparent conversions between device-independent (sRGB, XYZ, L*a*b*) and device-dependent color spaces (RGB and others, as CMYK for color printing) during a typical production cycle, in order to ensure color consistency throughout the process. Along with the creative processing, such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail, especially where the gamut is reduced. Professional digital devices and software tools allow for 48 bpp (bits per pixel) images to be manipulated (16 bits per channel), to minimize any such damage.

ICC profile compliant applications, such as Adobe Photoshop, use either the Lab color space or the CIE 1931 color space as a &quot;Profile Connection Space&quot; when translating between color spaces.

==RGB model and luminance–chrominance formats relationship==
All luminance–chrominance formats used in the different TV and video standards such as YIQ for NTSC, YUV for PAL, YDBDR for SECAM, and YPBPR for component video use color difference signals, by which RGB color images can be encoded for broadcasting/recording and later decoded into RGB again to display them. These intermediate formats were needed for compatibility with pre-existent black-and-white TV formats. Also, those color difference signals need lower data bandwidth compared to full RGB signals.

Similarly, current high-efficiency digital color image data compression schemes such as JPEG and MPEG store RGB color internally in YCBCR format, a digital luminance–chrominance format based on YPBPR. The use of YCBCR also allows computers to perform lossy subsampling with the chrominance channels (typically to 4:2:2 or 4:1:1 ratios), which reduces the resultant file size.

<text>Richard Channing Garfield (born June 26, 1963) is an American mathematician, inventor and game designer. Garfield created &quot;&quot;, which is considered to be the first collectible card game (CCG). &quot;Magic&quot; debuted in 1993 and its success spawned many imitations. 

Garfield oversaw the successful growth of &quot;Magic&quot; and followed it with other game designs. Included in these are &quot;Keyforge&quot;, &quot;Netrunner&quot;, &quot;BattleTech(CCG)&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Trading Card Game&quot;, &quot;The Great Dalmuti&quot;, &quot;Artifact&quot; and the board game &quot;RoboRally&quot;. He also created a variation of the card game Hearts called Complex Hearts. Garfield first became passionate about games when he played the roleplaying game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, so he designed &quot;Magic&quot; decks to be customizable like roleplaying characters. Garfield and &quot;Magic&quot; are both in the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame.

==Early life, family and education==
Garfield was born in Philadelphia and spent his childhood in many locations throughout the world as a result of his father&#x27;s work in architecture. His family eventually settled in Oregon when he was twelve. Garfield is the great-great-grandson of U.S. President James A. Garfield and his grand-uncle Samuel Fay invented the paper clip. He is also the nephew of Fay Jones, who, already an established artist, illustrated one &quot;Magic&quot; card for him.

While Garfield always had an interest in puzzles and games, his passion was kick-started when he was introduced to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Garfield designed his first game when he was 13.

In 1985, Garfield received a Bachelor of Science degree in computational mathematics. After college, he joined Bell Laboratories, but soon after decided to continue his education and attended the University of Pennsylvania, studying combinatorial mathematics for his PhD. Garfield studied under Herbert Wilf and earned a Ph.D. in combinatorial mathematics from Penn in 1993. His thesis was &quot;On the Residue Classes of Combinatorial Families of Numbers&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he became a Visiting Professor of mathematics at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.

==Game design career==
===Precursors and development of &quot;Magic: the Gathering&quot;===
While searching for a publisher for &quot;RoboRally&quot;, which he designed in 1985, Wizards of the Coast began talking to Garfield through Mike Davis, but Wizards was still a new company and felt the game would be too expensive to produce. Peter Adkison of Wizards of the Coast expressed interest in a fast-playing game with minimal equipment, something that would be popular at a game convention. Adkison asked if Garfield could develop a game with lower production costs than &quot;RoboRally&quot;, with the idea of making such a game more portable and easy to bring to conventions; Garfield thought of an idea that came from combining a card game with collecting baseball cards and spent a week creating a full game from that rough idea.

Garfield had been creating card games since at least 1982, starting with a card game called &quot;Five Magics&quot; that was inspired by &quot;Cosmic Encounter&quot;, and his work with this new card game built on his existing older prototypes. Garfield thus combined ideas from two previous games to invent the first trading card game, &quot;&quot;. At first, Garfield and Adkison called the game &quot;Manaclash,&quot; and worked on it in secret during a lawsuit filed by Palladium Games against Wizards, and were able to protect the game&#x27;s intellectual property by using the shell company Garfield Games. Garfield began designing &quot;Magic&quot; as a Penn graduate student. Garfield&#x27;s playtesters were mostly fellow Penn students.

===Wizards of the Coast===
&quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; launched in 1993. Playtesters began independently developing expansion packs, which were then passed to Garfield for his final edit. In June 1994, Garfield left academia to join Wizards of the Coast as a full-time game designer. Garfield managed the hit game wisely, balancing player experience with business needs and allowing other designers to contribute creatively to the game. With his direction, Wizards established a robust tournament system for &quot;Magic&quot;, something that was new to hobby gaming.

Wizards finally released Garfield&#x27;s &quot;RoboRally&quot; in 1994. Wizards published Garfield&#x27;s &quot;&quot;-based CCG &quot;Jyhad&quot; in 1994, but changed the name to &quot;&quot; in 1995 to avoid offense to Muslims. &quot;Netrunner&quot; (1996) was Garfield&#x27;s CCG based on &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;, where he included an element that made it an asymmetrical game, so that the two players each had entirely different cards, abilities, and goals. Wizards published the &quot;BattleTech Collectible Card Game&quot; in 1996, based on a design by Garfield. Peter Adkison was developing a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; MMORPG based on a design from Garfield and Skaff Elias, but left Wizards in December 2000 after Hasbro sold the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; computer rights and cancelled the project.

In 1999, Garfield was inducted into the Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame alongside &quot;Magic&quot;. He was a primary play tester for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition bookset, released by Wizards in 2000. He eventually left Wizards to become an independent game designer.

===As an independent designer=== 
He still sporadically contributes to &quot;&quot;. More recently, he has created the board games &quot;Pecking Order&quot; (2006) and &quot;Rocketville&quot; (2006).

<text>The Roman legion (, ), the largest military unit of the Roman army, was composed of Roman citizens serving as legionaries. During the Roman Republic the manipular legion comprised 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. After the Marian reforms in 107 BC, the legions were formed of 5,200 men and were restructured around 10 cohorts, the first cohort being double strength. This structure persisted throughout the Principate and middle Empire, before further changes in the fourth century resulted in new formations of around 1,000 men.

== Size ==
The size of a typical legion varied throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements ranging from 4,200 legionaries and 300 &quot;equites&quot; (drawn from the wealthier classes – in early Rome all troops provided their own equipment) in the Republic, to 5,500 in the Imperial period, when most legions were led by a Roman Imperial Legate.

A legion had 4,800 legionaries (in 10 cohorts of 6 centuries of 80 legionaries) from the late republic to the time of Julius Caesar. It expanded to 5,280 men plus 120 auxiliaries in the Imperial period (split into 10 cohorts, nine of 480 men each, with the first cohort being almost double-strength at 800 men). These are typical field strengths while &quot;paper strength&quot; was slightly higher (e.g. 600 and 1,200 respectively for Imperial cohorts).

In the early Roman Kingdom the term &quot;legion&quot; may have meant the entire Roman army, but sources on this period are few and unreliable. The subsequent organisation of legions varied greatly over time but legions were typically composed of around five thousand soldiers. During much of the republican era, a legion was divided into three lines, each of ten maniples. In the late Republic and much of the imperial period (from about 100 BC), a legion was divided into ten cohorts, each of six (or five) centuries. Legions also included a small &quot;ala&quot;, or cavalry unit. By the third century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. In the fourth century AD, East Roman border guard legions (&quot;limitanei&quot;) may have become even smaller. In terms of organization and function, the republican era legion may have been influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian phalanx.

==Function and constitution ==
For most of the Roman Imperial period, the legions formed the Roman army&#x27;s elite heavy infantry, recruited exclusively from Roman citizens, while the remainder of the army consisted of auxiliaries, who provided additional infantry and the vast majority of the Roman cavalry (provincials who aspired to Roman citizenship gained it when honourably discharged from the auxiliaries). The Roman army, for most of the Imperial period, consisted mostly of auxiliaries rather than legions.

==Longevity ==
Many of the legions founded before 40 BC were still active until at least the fifth century, notably Legio V Macedonica, which was founded by Augustus in 43 BC and was in Egypt in the seventh century during the Islamic conquest of Egypt.

On the other hand, Legio XVII (&quot;Seventeenth Legion&quot;), Legio XVIII (&quot;Eighteenth Legion&quot;) and Legio XIX (&quot;Nineteenth Legion&quot;), founded by Augustus around 41 BC, were destroyed by a Germanic alliance led by Arminius in the Varian Disaster (September 9, AD 9) and never raised again by the Romans thereafter.
==Evolution ==
Almost nothing is known about the legion of the Roman Kingdom period that could have included 1000 men from each of the three original Roman tribes. The earliest surviving detailed description comes from Polybius, who was writing and his account most likely was influenced by the organization of the Roman army after the defeat of Hannibal in the Punic wars some 50 years earlier. 

The legions of the Republic were only conscripted in times of conflict and usually limited to four legions, two to be commanded by each consul, though more could be levied if needed. Legionaries lacked the opportunity of a military career; they were not paid well, their primary form of income being what they could loot from the battlefield, and were simply called upon when needed and returned to their civilian lives when they were no longer required. 

In terms of organization and function, the early Republican era military was inherited from the Etruscans and seemingly influenced by the ancient Greek and Macedonian phalanx.

After a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Allia, in 387 BC the military structure was reformed. Under the Camillan system the legions were initially structured based on social class, with the poorest being the first line of the formation. The legionaries most often fought with &quot;hastae&quot; (spears) and &quot;scuta&quot; (large rectangular shields) in a checkered maniple formation with assistance from skirmishers. The exception to this was the &quot;triarii&quot;, the final line of the formation who instead fought as hoplites, using Greek &quot;clipei&quot; and whose wealth could afford them &quot;gladii&quot; in the case of a broken spear. 

By the 3rd century BC, this system was seen to be inefficient. Under the new Polybian system the ranks were no longer structured by wealth, and instead by age and experience. All legionaries had their &quot;hastae&quot; replaced by &quot;gladii&quot;, along with two &quot;pila&quot;, which were used as an opening volley before melee. The former classes of poor legionaries, the &quot;accensi&quot;, &quot;rorarii,&quot; and &quot;leves&quot; were replaced by the &quot;velites&quot;. Unit sizes were also expanded. 

Non-citizens or &quot;peregrini&quot; were also offered a position in the military as auxiliaries. 

The Republican legion evolved from 3,000 men in the Roman Republic to over 5,200 men in the Roman Empire, consisting of centuries as the basic units. Until the middle of the first century AD, ten cohorts made up a Roman legion. This was later changed to nine cohorts of standard size (with six centuries at 80 men each) with the first cohort being of double strength (five double-strength centuries with 160 men each). 

By the fourth century AD, the legion was a much smaller unit of about 1,000 to 1,500 men, and there were more of them. This had come about as the large formation legion and auxiliary unit, 10,000 men, was broken down into smaller units – originally temporary detachments – to cover more territory. 

In the fourth century AD, East Roman border guard legions (&quot;limitanei&quot;) may have become even smaller.

==History==
=== Roman Kingdom ( to 509 BC) ===

In the period before the raising of the &quot;legio&quot; and the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Roman Republic, forces are described as being organised into &quot;centuriae&quot; of roughly one hundred men. These centuries were grouped together as required and answered to the leader who had hired or raised them. Such independent organisation persisted until the 2nd century BC amongst light infantry and cavalry, but was discarded completely in later periods with the supporting role taken instead by allied troops. The roles of century leader (later formalised as a centurion), second in command and standard bearer are referenced in this early period.

Rome&#x27;s early period is undocumented and shrouded in myths, but those myths tell that during the rule of Servius Tullius, the census (from Latin: &quot;censeō&quot; – accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organised into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or &quot;legio&quot; (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship; the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service. These individuals would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.

=== Mid Republic (509–107 BC) ===

At some point after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy the &quot;legio&quot; was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two consuls. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. In 494 BC, when three foreign threats emerged, the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus raised ten legions which Livy says was a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time.

Also, some warfare was still conducted by Roman forces outside the legionary structure, the most famous example being the campaign in 479 BC by the clan army of gens Fabia against the Etruscan city of Veii (in which the clan was annihilated). Legions became more formally organised in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions each.

In the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome&#x27;s Italian allies were required to provide approximately ten cohorts (auxilia were not organised into legions) to support each Roman Legion.

In the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:
* &quot;Equites&quot; (cavalry): the cavalry was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more lances. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of men (plus the &quot;velites&quot; that normally enlarged the number to about 4,200), the legion only had around 300 horsemen, divided into ten units (&quot;turmae&quot;) of 30 men. These men were commanded by decurions. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the &quot;hastati&quot; or the &quot;equites&quot;. In battle, they were used to disrupt and outflank enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement, they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before stirrups.
* &quot;Velites&quot; (light infantry): these were mainly poorer citizens who could not afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as skirmishers – javelin-throwers, who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the &quot;velites&quot; were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organisation or formation.
* Heavy infantry: this was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of a bronze helmet, shield, sword, armour and &quot;pilum&quot;, a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 metres. After the Second Punic War, the preferred weapon for the hastati and &quot;principes&quot; was the &quot;gladius&quot;, a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (&quot;caligae&quot;) were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:
** The &quot;hastati&quot; (: &quot;hastatus&quot;): these consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years&#x27; service. The Hastati were placed at the front for several reasons. One reason is the city of Rome could ill-afford to lose experienced soldiers, so they put the greenest soldiers at the front. If they survived, the &quot;hastati&quot; would gain invaluable experience. Another reason is if the newest soldiers succumbed to battle nerves and broke and tried to run, then there were experienced soldiers behind them to stiffen their resolve.
** The &quot;principes&quot; (: &quot;princeps&quot;): these were the more experienced soldiers, often better equipped than the &quot;hastati&quot;, and having more experience on the battlefield, they would take up the second line in the battle in the event the Hastati failed or fled. They were the second wave in an early Republican Legion.
** The &quot;triarii&quot; (: &quot;triarius&quot;): these were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The &quot;triarii&quot; served primarily as reserves or barrier troops designed to backstop the &quot;hastati&quot; and &quot;principes&quot;, and were equipped with long &quot;hastae&quot; (spears) rather than the &quot;pilum&quot; and &quot;gladius&quot; (the &quot;hastati&quot; and &quot;principes&quot; stopped using spears in 387 BC). Thus armed, they fought in a phalanx formation. The sight of an advancing armored formation of &quot;triarii&quot; legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating &quot;hastati&quot; and &quot;principes&quot; troops. &quot;Ad triarios redisse&quot; – &quot;To fall back upon the triarii&quot; – was a Roman idiom meaning to use one&#x27;s last resort.

Each of these three lines was subdivided into (usually ten) chief tactical units called maniples. A maniple consisted of two centuries and was commanded by the senior of the two centurions. At this time, each century of &quot;hastati&quot; and &quot;principes&quot; consisted of 60 men; a century of &quot;triarii&quot; was 30 men. These 3,000 men (twenty maniples of 120 men, and ten maniples of 60 men), together with about 1,200 velites and 300 cavalry gave the mid Republican (&quot;manipular&quot;) legion a nominal strength of about 4,500 men.

=== Late Republic (107–27 BC) ===


Each century had its own standard and was made up of ten units (&quot;contubernia&quot;) of eight men who shared a tent, a millstone, a mule and cooking pot.

Full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. At the same time, the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the &quot;principes&quot;: armed with two heavy javelins called &quot;pila&quot; (singular &quot;pilum&quot;), the short sword called &quot;gladius&quot;, chain mail (&quot;lorica hamata&quot;), helmet and rectangular shield (&quot;scutum&quot;).

The role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called &quot;auxilia&quot;. &quot;Auxilia&quot; contained &quot;immunes&quot; (specialist units), engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, light infantry or &quot;velites&quot;, and labourers. There was also a reconnaissance squad of ten or more light mounted infantry called &quot;speculatores&quot;, who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of military intelligence service.

A typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 11,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries. During the Later Roman Empire, the legion was reduced in size to 1,000 to allow for easier provisioning and to expand the regions under surveillance. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; Julius Caesar&#x27;s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.

Tactics were not very different from the past, but their effectiveness was largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.

Throughout the history of Rome&#x27;s Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC, the threat of the legions under a demagogue was recognised. Roman governors were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When Julius Caesar broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the Rubicon into Italy, he precipitated a constitutional crisis. This crisis and the civil wars which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the Empire under Augustus in 27 BC.

=== Early Empire (27 BC–AD 284) ===

Generals, during the recent Republican civil wars, had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. During this time, there was a high incidence of &quot;Gemina&quot; (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organisation (and was later made official and put under a &quot;legatus&quot; and six &quot;duces&quot;). At the end of the civil war against Mark Antony, Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions to 28 (which diminished to 25 after the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, in which three legions were completely destroyed by the Germanics).

Beside streamlining the army, Augustus also regulated the soldiers&#x27; pay. At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the Praetorian Guard along with a permanent Roman navy where served the &quot;liberti&quot;, or freed slaves.
The legions also became permanent at this time, and not recruited for particular campaigns. They were also allocated to static bases with permanent &quot;castra legionaria&quot; (legionary fortresses).

Augustus&#x27; military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions (hence the wry remark of the philosopher Favorinus that &quot;It is ill arguing with the master of 30 legions&quot;). With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops (according to Tacitus), the total force available to a legion commander during the Pax Romana probably ranged from 11,000 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. By the time of the emperor Severus, 193–211, the auxiliaries may have composed 55 to 60% of the army, 250,000 of 447,000. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000–16,000 or about the size of a modern division.

Throughout the Imperial era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a usurper or take it away. For example, the defeat of Vitellius in the Year of the Four Emperors was decided when the Danubian legions chose to support Vespasian.

In the Empire, the legion was standardised, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a &quot;legatus&quot; or &quot;legate&quot;. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three-year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected &quot;military tribunes&quot; – five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot; (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.

=== Later Empire (from 284 AD) ===


In the Later Roman Empire, the number of legions was increased and the Roman army expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the Tetrarchy, although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite &quot;legiones palatinae&quot; created by Diocletian and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old legions. The earliest &quot;legiones palatinae&quot; were the &quot;Lanciarii&quot;, &quot;Joviani&quot;, &quot;Herculiani&quot; and &quot;Divitenses&quot;.

The 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under Constantine II. In addition to the elite &quot;palatini&quot;, other legions called &quot;comitatenses&quot; and &quot;pseudocomitatenses&quot;, along with the &quot;auxilia palatina&quot;, provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists 25 &quot;legiones palatinae&quot;, 70 &quot;legiones comitatenses&quot;, 47 &quot;legiones pseudocomitatenses&quot; and 111 &quot;auxilia palatina&quot; in the field armies, and a further 47 &quot;legiones&quot; in the frontier armies. Legion names such as &quot;Honoriani&quot; and &quot;Gratianenses&quot; found in the &quot;Notitia&quot; suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from &quot;vexillationes&quot; or from old legions. In addition, there were 24 vexillationes palatini, 73 &quot;vexillationes comitatenses&quot;; 305 other units in the Eastern &quot;limitanei&quot; and 181 in the Western &quot;limitanei&quot;. A rare instance of apparent direct continuity between the legions of the early Empire and those of the post-6th century army was &quot;Legion V Macedonica&quot;; created in 43 BC, recorded in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; as a &quot;legione comitatense&quot; under the title of &quot;Quinta Macedonica&quot; and surviving in Egypt until the Arab conquest of 637 AD.

According to the late Roman writer Vegetius&#x27; &quot;De re militari&quot;, each century had a ballista and each cohort had an onager, giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 ballistae and 10 onagers, each manned by 10 &quot;libritors&quot; (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps (&quot;castra&quot;) as well. They would even be employed on occasion, especially in the later Empire, as field artillery during battles or in support of river crossings.

Despite a number of organisational changes, the legion system survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was continued within the Eastern Roman Empire until the 7th century, when reforms begun by Emperor Heraclius to supply the increasing need for soldiers resulted in the Theme system. Despite this, the Eastern Roman armies continued to be influenced by the earlier Roman legions, and were maintained with similar levels of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization.

==Legionary ranks==

Aside from the rank and file legionary (who received the base wage of 10 &quot;assēs&quot; a day or 225 &quot;denarii&quot; a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the late republic (100s BC) until the military reforms of Diocletian (). 

===Senior officers===
* &quot;Legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; (imperial legate): the commander of two or more legions. The imperial legate also served as the governor of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of senatorial rank, the imperial legate was appointed by the emperor and usually held command for 3 or 5 years. 
* &quot;Legatus legionis&quot; (legionary legate): the overall commander of the legion. The post was usually filled by a senator, appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a Roman province with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial governor. In such circumstances, the legatus was dual-hatted as both legionary legate and imperial legate. The legionary legate also served as commander of the auxiliary units attached to the legion, though they were not formally a part of the legion&#x27;s command structure. 
* &quot;Tribunus laticlavius&quot; (broad-band tribune): named for the broad-striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii. He served as second-in-command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience, he was not the actual second-in-command in battle. But if the legate died, he would take command of the legion.
* &quot;Praefectus castrorum&quot; (camp prefect): the camp prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally, he was a long-serving veteran from a lower social status than the &quot;tribunii&quot; whom he outranked, and who previously had served as &quot;primus pilus&quot; and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of auxiliaries.
* &quot;Tribuni angusticlavii&quot; (narrow-band tribunes): each legion had five lower-ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers. This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man&#x27;s political career (see &quot;cursus honorum&quot;).

===Centurions===

The rank of centurion was an officer grade that held much responsibility. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the &quot;primus pilus&quot; ( &quot;first maniple&quot;), who directly commanded the first century of the first cohort and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort&#x27;s first century was known as a &quot;pilus prior&quot; and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as &quot;primi ordines&quot;.

There is a story of one centurion, Petronius Fortunatus, making rank in four years, then spending the next forty-two years in twelve different legions never once serving in the &quot;primi ordines&quot;. 

The six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:
* The rear triarii (rear third line)
* The forward triarii (forward third line)
* The rear principes (rear principal line)
* The forward principes (forward principal line)
* The rear hastati (rear spears)
* The forward hastati (forward spears)

The centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier (each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal). Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.
* Primus pilus: the &quot;primus pilus&quot; was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a &quot;front spear&quot; and a &quot;back spear&quot; century.) The &quot;primus pilus&quot; had a chance of later becoming a &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot;. When the &quot;primus pilus&quot; retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. &quot;Primus pilus&quot; were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.
* Pilus prior: the &quot;front file&quot; centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the &quot;pilus prior&quot; was given command of their entire cohort. The &quot;primus pilus&quot; was also a &quot;pilus prior&quot;, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the &quot;primus pilus&quot;.
* Primi ordines: the &quot;ranks of the first [cohort]&quot; were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the &quot;primus pilus&quot;. They, excluding the &quot;primus pilus&quot;, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the &quot;primus pilus&quot; and &quot;pilus prior&quot;.
* Other centurions: each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the ten cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the &quot;primus pilus&quot;). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage.

=== Legionaries ===
The Roman army maintained a complex position and grading system for its soldiers that reflected the many and varied duties of the Roman army. There were three pay grades within the rank of legionary: standard, one and a half, and twice the basic pay rate. 

=== Standard duty positions ===
* &quot;Optio&quot;: one for each centurion (59–60), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were graded pay twice the basic wage.
* &quot;Tesserarius&quot; (guard commander): one for each century. They acted as seconds to the &quot;optios&quot; and were graded pay one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard.
* &quot;Decurion&quot;: commanded a cavalry unit (&quot;turma&quot;) of 10 to 30 &quot;eques legionis&quot;.
* &quot;Decanus&quot;: commanded a &quot;contubernium&quot; or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants. A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a &quot;quaternion&quot;.

===Special duty positions===
* &quot;Aquilifer&quot;: a single position within the legion. The &quot;aquilifer&quot; was the legion&#x27;s standard – or &quot;aquila&quot; (eagle) – bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the &quot;aquila&quot; was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was graded pay twice the basic wage.
* &quot;Signifer&quot;: each century had a &quot;signifer&quot; (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each cohort the 1st century&#x27;s &quot;signifer&quot; would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the &quot;centurial signum&quot;, a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the &quot;signum&quot;, the &quot;signifer&quot; also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries&#x27; banker. He was graded pay twice the basic wage.
* &quot;Cornicen&quot; (&quot;horn blower&quot;): worked hand in hand with the &quot;signifer&quot; drawing the attention of the men to the centurial &quot;signum&quot; and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was graded pay twice the basic wage.
* &quot;Imaginifer&quot;: a special position from the time of Augustus onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops&#x27; loyalty to him. He was graded pay twice the basic wage.
* &quot;Immunes&quot;: &quot;immunes&quot; were legionary soldiers who possessed specialised skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. Engineers, artillerymen, musicians, clerks, quartermasters, drill and weapons instructors, carpenters, hunters, medical staff and military police were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.
* &quot;Evocatus&quot;: a veteran of the Roman army who had earned his military diploma for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.

==Pay==
Legionaries received 225 &quot;denarii&quot; a year (equal to 900 &quot;sestertii&quot;) until Domitian, who increased it to 300 &quot;denarii&quot;. In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of Septimius Severus, who increased it to 500 &quot;denarii&quot; a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the prisoners of war and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.

All legionary soldiers would also receive a &quot;praemia&quot; (veterans&#x27; benefits) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 &quot;denarii&quot; from the time of Augustus) and/or a plot of good farmland (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under Caracalla, the &quot;praemia&quot; increased to 5,000 &quot;denarii&quot;.

=== Pay scales ===

* Caligati: a pay grade receiving standard pay
* Sesquiplicarii: a pay grade receiving one and a half standard pay
* &quot;Duplicarius&quot;: a pay grade receiving double the standard pay.

==Symbols==
From 104 BC onwards, each legion used an &quot;aquila&quot; (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as aquilifer, and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.

In &quot;Gallic War&quot; (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55 BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar&#x27;s troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the tenth legion threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, &#x27;with one accord, leapt down from the ship&#x27; and were followed by troops from the other ships.

With the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called &quot;imaginifer&quot;, whose role was to carry a pike with the &quot;imago&quot; (image, sculpture) of the emperor as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;.

Each legion, furthermore, had a &quot;vexillifer&quot; who carried a &quot;vexillum&quot; or &quot;signum&quot;, with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the &quot;vexillum&quot;, and not the &quot;aquila&quot;, and were called, therefore, &quot;vexillationes&quot;. A miniature &quot;vexillum&quot;, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.

Civilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an arrow without a head. This was considered a great honour and would bring the recipient much prestige.

==Discipline==

The military discipline of the legions was harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted. 

===Minor punishments===
* &quot;Castigatio&quot; – being hit by the centurion with his staff or &quot;animadversio fustium&quot; (Tac. Annals I, 23)
* Reduction of rations or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration
* &quot;Pecuniaria mulcta&quot; – reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance
* Flogging in front of the century, cohort or legion
* Whipping with the &quot;flagrum&quot; (&quot;flagellum&quot;, &quot;flagella&quot;), or &quot;short whip&quot; – a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The &quot;short whip&quot; was used by slave volunteers, &quot;volones&quot;, who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.
* &quot;Gradus deiectio&quot; – reduction in rank
* &quot;Missio ignominiosa&quot; – dishonourable discharge
* Loss of time in service advantages
* &quot;Militiae mutatio&quot; – relegation to inferior service or duties.
* &quot;Munerum indictio&quot; – additional duties

===Major punishments===
* &quot;Fustuarium&quot; – a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty, stealing, false witness, sexual misconduct and repeating three times a same offense. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by cudgels, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of &quot;fustuarium&quot; who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the tribune would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the &quot;fustuarium&quot;. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley.
* &quot;Decimation&quot; – according to 17th century belief (possibly folk etymology), the Romans practiced this punishment in which a sentence was carried out against an entire unit that had mutinied, deserted, or shown dereliction of duty. One out of every ten men, chosen by lots, would be beaten to death, usually by the other nine with their bare hands, who would be forced to live outside the camp and in some instances obliged to renew the military oath, the &quot;sacramentum&quot;.

== Factors in the legion&#x27;s success ==

Montesquieu wrote that &quot;the main reason for the Romans becoming masters of the world was that, having fought successively against all peoples, they always gave up their own practices as soon as they found better ones&quot;.

Examples of ideas that were copied and adapted include weapons like the &quot;gladius&quot; (Iberians) and warship design (cf. Carthaginians&#x27; quinquereme), as well as military units, such as heavy mounted cavalry and mounted archers (Numidians and Parthians).
* Roman organisation was more flexible than those of many opponents. Over time, the legions effectively handled challenges ranging from cavalry, to guerrillas, and to siege warfare.
* Roman discipline (cf. decimation), organization and systematization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, field fortification etc.
* The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents. Wars with Carthage and the Parthians and most notably, the campaigns against Pyrrhus of Epirus, illustrate this.
* Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.
* The influence of Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.
* Strict, and more importantly, uniform discipline made commanding, maintaining, and replacing Roman legionaries a much more consistent exercise.
* Roman military equipment (cf. Roman military personal equipment), particularly armor, was of better quality and far more ubiquitous, especially in the late Republican and Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.
* Roman engineering skills were second to none in ancient Europe, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications (cf. &quot;sudis&quot;, &quot;castra&quot;), was another major advantage for the Roman legions.
* Roman military training focused on the more effective thrusting of the sword rather than the slash.

<text>A reciprocating engine, more often known as a piston engine, is typically a heat engine that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert high temperature and high pressure into a rotating motion. This article describes the common features of all types. The main types are: the internal combustion engine, used extensively in motor vehicles; the steam engine, the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution; and the Stirling engine for niche applications. Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways: either a spark-ignition (SI) engine, where the spark plug initiates the combustion; or a compression-ignition (CI) engine, where the air within the cylinder is compressed, thus heating it, so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier.

==Common features in all types==

There may be one or more pistons. Each piston is inside a cylinder, into which a gas is introduced, either already under pressure (e.g. steam engine), or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture (internal combustion engine) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder (Stirling engine). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder. This position is also known as the bottom dead center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top (top dead center) (TDC) by a flywheel, the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a double acting cylinder) by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or &quot;exhausted&quot; gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke. The exception is the Stirling engine, which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.

In some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder, in which case it is said to be double-acting.

In most types, the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism. A flywheel is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle. The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has, generally, the more vibration-free (smoothly) it can operate. The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons&#x27; displacement.

A seal must be made between the sliding piston and the walls of the cylinder so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine. This seal is usually provided by one or more piston rings. These are rings made of a hard metal, and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head. The rings fit closely in the groove and press lightly against the cylinder wall to form a seal, and more heavily when higher combustion pressure moves around to their inner surfaces.

It is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of displacement of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres (cm3 or cc) or litres (l) or (L) (US: liter). For example, for internal combustion engines, single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as motorcycles, while automobiles typically have between four and eight, and locomotives and ships may have a dozen cylinders or more. Cylinder capacities may range from 10 cm3 or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships&#x27; engines.

The compression ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine. It is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder, when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.

The bore/stroke ratio is the ratio of the diameter of the piston, or &quot;bore&quot;, to the length of travel within the cylinder, or &quot;stroke&quot;. If this is around 1 the engine is said to be &quot;square&quot;. If it is greater than 1, i.e. the bore is larger than the stroke, it is &quot;oversquare&quot;. If it is less than 1, i.e. the stroke is larger than the bore, it is &quot;undersquare&quot;.

Cylinders may be aligned in line, in a V configuration, horizontally opposite each other, or radially around the crankshaft. Opposed-piston engines put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the Napier Deltic. Some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft, such as the rotary engine.

In some steam engines, the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam. This is then fed through one or more, increasingly larger bore cylinders successively, to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures. These engines are called compound engines.

Aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce, the mean effective pressure (MEP), can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size. The mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle. This is shown by:
: formula_1

where formula_2 is the total piston area of the engine, formula_3 is the stroke length of the pistons, and formula_4 is the total displacement volume of the engine. Therefore:
: formula_5

Whichever engine with the larger value of MEP produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently.

==Operations==

In steam engines and internal combustion engines, valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston&#x27;s cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by piston valve or poppet valve designs. In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder.

Internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder. These operations are repeated cyclically and an engine is said to be 2-stroke, 4-stroke or 6-stroke depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle.

The most common type is 4-stroke, which has following cycles.

# Intake: Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (TDC) and ends at bottom dead center (BDC). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston.
# Compression: This stroke begins at BDC, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at TDC In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage.
# Combustion: Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at TDC (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to BDC This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft.
# Exhaust: Also known as outlet. During the &quot;exhaust&quot; stroke, the piston, once again, returns from BDC to TDC while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.

==History==
The reciprocating engine developed in Europe during the 18th century, first as the atmospheric engine then later as the steam engine. These were followed by the Stirling engine and internal combustion engine in the 19th century. Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) and used to power motor vehicles and engine power plants.

One notable reciprocating engine from the World War II era was the 28-cylinder, Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engine. It powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward. It had a total engine capacity of , and a high power-to-weight ratio.

The largest reciprocating engine in production at present, but not the largest ever built, is the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by Wärtsilä. It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the Emma Mærsk. It is five stories high (), long, and weighs over in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than . Each cylinder has a capacity of , making a total capacity of for the largest versions.

== Engine capacity ==
For piston engines, an engine&#x27;s capacity is the engine displacement, in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement. It is generally measured in litres (l) or cubic inches (c.i.d., cu in, &quot;or&quot; in3) for larger engines, and cubic centimetres (abbreviated cc) for smaller engines. All else being equal, engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly (although this is not true of every reciprocating engine), although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement.

==Power==
Reciprocating engines can be characterized by their specific power, which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of engine displacement (in the U.S. also horsepower per cubic inch). The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine. This is not to be confused with fuel efficiency, since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel-air ratio, and thus lower power density. A modern high-performance car engine makes in excess of .

==Other modern non-internal combustion types==
Reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air, steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power. Most steam-driven applications use steam turbines, which are more efficient than piston engines.

The French-designed FlowAIR vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a local-pollution-free urban vehicle.

Torpedoes may use a working gas produced by high test peroxide or Otto fuel II, which pressurize without combustion. The Mark 46 torpedo, for example, can travel underwater at fuelled by Otto fuel without oxidant.

==Reciprocating quantum heat engine==
Quantum heat engines are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir.
The mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of quantum mechanics. 
Quantum refrigerators are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir.

In a reciprocating quantum heat engine, the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or a harmonic oscillator.
The Carnot cycle and Otto cycle are the ones most studied.
The quantum versions obey the laws of thermodynamics. In addition, these models can justify the assumptions of
endoreversible thermodynamics.
A theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom. This is an area for future research and could have applications in nanotechnology.
