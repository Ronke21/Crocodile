<text>Resurrection or anastasis is the concept of coming back to life after death. Reincarnation is a similar process hypothesized by other religions involving the same person or deity returning to another body. The disappearance of a body is another similar but distinct belief in some religions.

With the advent of written records, the earliest known recurrent theme of resurrection was in Egyptian and Canaanite religions, which had cults of dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Ancient Greek religion generally emphasised immortality, but in the mythos, a number of individuals were made physically immortal as they were resurrected from the dead.

The universal resurrection of the dead at the end of the world is a standard eschatological belief in the Abrahamic religions. As a religious concept, resurrection is used in two distinct respects:

# a belief in the &quot;individual resurrections&quot; of individual souls that is current and ongoing (e.g., Christian idealism, realized eschatology),
# a general bodily &quot;universal resurrection&quot; of all of the dead at the end of the world. Some believe the soul is the actual vehicle by which people are resurrected.

The death and resurrection of Jesus are a central focus of Christianity. While most Christians believe Jesus&#x27;s resurrection from the dead and ascension to Heaven was in a material body, some think it was only spiritual.

Like some forms of the Abrahamic religions, the Dharmic religions also include belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation. There are stories in Buddhism wherein the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in the Chan or Zen tradition. In Hinduism, the core belief in resurrection and/or reincarnation is known as &quot;saṃsāra&quot;.

Aside from religious belief, cryonics and other speculative resurrection technologies are practiced, but the resurrection of long-dead bodies is not considered possible at the current level of scientific knowledge.

==Etymology==
Resurrection, from the Latin noun &quot;resurrectio -onis&quot;, from the verb &quot;rego&quot;, &quot;to make straight, rule&quot; + preposition &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, altered to &quot;subrigo&quot; and contracted to &quot;surgo, surrexi, surrectum&quot; (&quot;to rise&quot;, &quot;get up&quot;, &quot;stand up&quot;) + preposition &quot;re-&quot;, &quot;again&quot;, thus literally &quot;a straightening from under again&quot;.

==Religion==

===Ancient religions in the Near East===

The concept of resurrection is found in the writings of some ancient non-Abrahamic religions in the Middle East. A few extant Egyptian and Canaanite writings allude to dying-and-rising gods such as Osiris and Baal. Sir James Frazer, in his book &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, relates to these dying-and-rising gods, but many of his examples, according to various scholars, distort the sources. Taking a more positive position, Tryggve Mettinger argues in his book that the category of &quot;rise and return to life&quot; is significant for Ugaritic Baal, Melqart, Adonis, Eshmun, Osiris and Dumuzi.

===Ancient Greek religion===
In ancient Greek religion, a number of men and women have been interpreted as being resurrected and made immortal. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother, Thetis, and brought to an immortal existence in Leuce, the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes are also among the figures interpreted to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, the seventh-century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. He would reappear alive years later. However, Greek attitudes toward resurrection were generally negative, and resurrection was considered neither desirable nor possible. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but, by his father Apollo&#x27;s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.

Many other figures, like a great part of those who fought in the Trojan War and Theban War, Menelaus, and the historical prizefighter Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also believed to have been made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. Alcestis undergoes something akin to a resurrection in her escape from the underworld,
but without achieving immortality.

Writing his &quot;Lives of Illustrious Men&quot; (Parallel Lives) in the first century, the Middle Platonic philosopher Plutarch in his chapter on Romulus gave an account of the king&#x27;s mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification, comparing it to Greek tales such as the physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the Proconnesian, &quot;for they say Aristeas died in a fuller&#x27;s work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton&quot;. Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in ancient Greek religion, writing, &quot;many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal.&quot; Likewise, he writes that while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens &quot;only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled.&quot;

The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on the early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued: &quot;When we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.&quot; (&quot;1 Apol.&quot; 21).

===Buddhism===

There are stories in Buddhism where the power of resurrection was allegedly demonstrated in Chan or Zen tradition. One is the legend of Bodhidharma, the Indian master who brought the Ekayana school of India that subsequently became Chan Buddhism to China.

The other is the passing of Chinese Chan master Puhua (Japanese: Jinshu Fuke), recounted in the Record of Linji (Japanese: Rinzai Gigen). Puhua was known for his unusual behavior and teaching style. Hence, it is no wonder that he is associated with an event that breaks the usual prohibition on displaying such powers. Here is the account from Irmgard Schloegl&#x27;s &quot;The Zen Teaching of Rinzai.&quot;

===Christianity===
In Christianity, resurrection most importantly concerns the resurrection of Jesus but also includes the resurrection of Judgment Day, known as the resurrection of the dead by those Christians who subscribe to the Nicene Creed (which is the majority of mainstream Christianity), as well as the resurrection miracles done by Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible).

====Resurrection miracles====
In the New Testament, Jesus is said to have raised several persons from death. These resurrections included the daughter of Jairus shortly after death, a young man in the midst of his own funeral procession, and Lazarus of Bethany, who had been buried for four days.

During the Ministry of Jesus on earth, before his death, Jesus commissioned his Twelve Apostles to, among other things, raise the dead.

Similar resurrections are credited to the apostles and Catholic saints. In the Acts of the Apostles, Saint Peter raised a woman named Dorcas (also called Tabitha), and Paul the Apostle revived a man named Eutychus who had fallen asleep and fell from a window to his death. According to the Gospel of Matthew, after Jesus&#x27;s resurrection, many of those previously dead came out of their tombs and entered Jerusalem, where they appeared to many. Following the Apostolic Age, many saints were said to resurrect the dead, as recorded in Orthodox Christian hagiographies. St. Columba supposedly raised a boy from the dead in the land of Picts and St. Nicholas is said to have resurrected pickled children from a brine barrel during a famine by making the sign of the cross.

====Resurrection of Jesus====
Christians regard the resurrection of Jesus as the central doctrine in Christianity. Others take the incarnation of Jesus to be more central; however, it is the miracles – and particularly his resurrection – which provide validation of his incarnation. According to Paul the Apostle, the entire Christian faith hinges upon the centrality of the resurrection of Jesus and the hope for life after death. Paul wrote in his first letter to the Corinthians:
====Resurrection of the dead====

Christianity started as a religious movement within 1st-century Judaism (late Second Temple Judaism), and it retains what the New Testament itself claims was the Pharisaic belief in the afterlife and resurrection of the dead. Whereas this belief was only one of many beliefs held about the world to come in Second Temple Judaism, it was notably rejected by the Sadducees but accepted by the Pharisees (Acts 23:6–8). Belief in the resurrection became dominant within Early Christianity, and already in the Gospels of Luke and John included an insistence on the resurrection of the flesh. Most modern Christian churches continue to uphold the belief that there will be a final resurrection of the dead and world to come.

Belief in the resurrection of the dead, and Jesus&#x27;s role as judge, is codified in the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the fundamental creed of Christian baptismal faith. The Book of Revelation also makes many references about the Judgment Day, when the dead will be raised.

=== Hinduism ===

There are folklore, stories, and extractions from Hindu holy texts that refer to resurrections. One major legend is that of Savitri saving her husband&#x27;s life from Yamraj. In the Ramayana, after Ravana was slain by Rama in a great battle between good and evil, Rama requests the king of Devas, Indra, to restore the lives of all the monkeys who died in the great battle Mahavatar Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya are also believed to have resurrected themselves.

===Islam===

Belief in the Day of Resurrection (&quot;yawm al-qiyāmah&quot;) is also crucial for Muslims. They believe the time of &quot;Qiyāmah&quot; is preordained by God but unknown to man. The trials and tribulations preceding and during the &quot;Qiyāmah&quot; are described in the Quran and the hadith, and also in the commentaries of scholars. The Quran emphasizes bodily resurrection, a break from the pre-Islamic Arabian understanding of death.

According to Nasir Khusraw (d. after 1070), an Ismaili thinker of the Fatimid era, the Resurrection (&quot;Qiyāma&quot;) will be ushered by the Lord of the Resurrection (&quot;Qāʾim al-Qiyāma&quot;), an individual symbolizing the purpose and pinnacle of creation from among the progeny of Muhammad and his Imams. Through this individual, the world will come out of darkness and ignorance and &quot;into the light of her Lord&quot; (Quran 39:69). His era, unlike that of the enunciators of the divine revelation (&quot;nāṭiqs&quot;) before him, is not one where God prescribes the people to work but instead one where God rewards them. Preceding the Lord of the Resurrection (&quot;Qāʾim&quot;) is his proof (&quot;ḥujjat&quot;). The Qur&#x27;anic verse stating that &quot;the night of power (&quot;laylat al-qadr&quot;) is better than a thousand months&quot; (Quran 97:3) is said to refer to this proof, whose knowledge is superior to that of a thousand Imams, though their rank, collectively, is one. Hakim Nasir also recognizes the successors of the Lord of the Resurrection to be his deputies (&quot;khulafāʾ&quot;).

===Judaism===

There are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:
* The prophet Elijah prays and God raises a young boy from death (1 Kings 17:17-24)
* Elisha raises the son of the Woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:32–37) whose birth he previously foretold (2 Kings 4:8–16)
* A dead man&#x27;s body that was thrown into the dead Elisha&#x27;s tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha&#x27;s bones (2 Kings 13:21)

According to Herbert C. Brichto, writing in Reform Judaism&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew Union College Annual&quot;, the family tomb is the central concept in understanding biblical views of the afterlife. Brichto states that it is &quot;not mere sentimental respect for the physical remains that is...the motivation for the practice, but rather an assumed connection between proper sepulture and the condition of happiness of the deceased in the afterlife&quot;.

According to Brichto, the early Israelites apparently believed that the graves of family, or tribe, united into one, and that this unified collectivity is to what the Biblical Hebrew term Sheol refers, the common grave of humans. Although not well defined in the Tanakh, Sheol in this view was a subterranean underworld where the souls of the dead went after the body died. The Babylonians had a similar underworld called Aralu, and the ancient Greeks had one known as Hades. According to Brichto, other biblical names for Sheol were Abaddon &quot;ruin&quot;, found in Psalm 88:11, Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11; Bor &quot;pit&quot;, found in Isaiah 14:15, 24:22, Ezekiel 26:20; and Shakhat &quot;corruption&quot;, found in Isaiah 38:17, Ezekiel 28:8.

During the Second Temple period, there developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in 2 Maccabees, according to which it will happen through re-creation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical Book of Enoch, 2 Baruch, and 2 Esdras. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism Philip R. Davies, there is &quot;little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead&quot; in the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls. C.D. Elledge, however, argues that some form of resurrection may be referred to in the Dead Sea texts 4Q521, Pseudo-Ezekiel, and 4QInstruction. Too, there is the Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones in the Book of Ezekiel, and the Book of Daniel, which mentions resurrection. As Professor Devorah Dimant notes on &quot;TheTorah.com&quot;, &quot;Originally an allegorical vision about the future return of Judeans to their land, Ezekiel&#x27;s vision (ch. 37) becomes one of the cornerstones for the Jewish belief in the resurrection of the dead. ... The only biblical passage that &quot;unambiguously&quot; refers to resurrection is found in the final chapter of the book of Daniel[.]&quot; 

Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife, but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will &quot;pass into other bodies,&quot; while &quot;the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.&quot; Paul the Apostle, who also was a Pharisee, said that at the resurrection what is &quot;sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body.&quot; The Book of Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.

== Philosophy ==
Anastasis or Ana-stasis is a concept in contemporary philosophy emerging from the works of Jean-Luc Nancy, Divya Dwivedi and Shaj Mohan. Nancy developed the concept through his interpretation of paintings depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Dwivedi and Mohan, referring to Nancy, defined Ana-stasis as coming over stasis, which is a method for philosophy to overcome its end as Martin Heidegger defined. This concept is noted to be linked in the works of Nancy, Dwivedi and Mohan to have a relation to Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;other beginning of philosophy&quot;. Kohan and Dwivdei that this &quot;overcoming&quot; would construct a new dimension in philosophy.

John Hick argues that the &quot;replica theory&quot; makes the religious doctrine of bodily resurrection somewhat plausible. For example, if a man disappears or dies in London and an exact &quot;replica&quot; suddenly re-appears in New York, both entities should be regarded as the same, especially if they share physical and psychological characteristics. Hick extends this theory to parallel universes, which occupy a different space to our own. He also distinguishes the theory from reincarnation, where a person lives in several successive bodies.

Other scholars reivse the replica theory with the &quot;counterpart theory&quot;, where it is believed that God creates a resurrection counterpart to one&#x27;s current body, which is new and improved. Although it is defined by one&#x27;s soul and history, it is not identical to the current body, which remains destroyed after death. A useful analogy is to imagine a soul as a programme, a body as a computer and the &quot;series of states&quot; that a soul undergoes as a person&#x27;s biography. They believe the theory has precedent in scriptures like the New Testament. In addition, it incentivizes people to care about their future.

== Technological resurrection ==
=== Cryonics ===
Cryonics is the low-temperature freezing (usually at ) of a human corpse or severed head, with the speculative hope that resurrection may be possible in the future. Cryonics is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community. It is generally viewed as a pseudoscience, and has been characterized as quackery.

=== Digital ghosts ===
In his 1988 book &quot;Mind Children&quot;, roboticist Hans Moravec proposed that a future supercomputer might be able to resurrect long-dead minds from the information that still survived. For example, such can include information in the form of memories, filmstrips, social media interactions, modeled personality traits, personal favourite things,&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1007/s42438-018-0007-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; personal notes and tasks, medical records, and genetic information.

Ray Kurzweil, American inventor and futurist, believes that when his concept of singularity comes to pass, it will be possible to resurrect the dead by digital recreation. Such is one approach in the concept of digital immortality, which could be described as resurrecting deceased as &quot;digital ghosts&quot; or &quot;digital avatars&quot;. In the context of knowledge management, &quot;virtual persona&quot; could &quot;aid in knowledge capture, retention, distribution, access and use&quot; and continue to learn. Issues include post-mortem privacy, and potential use of personalised digital twins and associated systems by big data firms and advertisers.

Related alternative approaches of digital immortality include gradually &quot;replacing&quot; neurons in the brain with advanced medical technology (such as nanobiotechnology) as a form of mind uploading (see also: wetware computer).

=== De-extinction ===
De-extinction, enabling an organism that either resembles or is an extinct species, is also known as &quot;resurrection biology&quot; and often described as working on &quot;resurrecting&quot; dead species.

=== Medical resuscitation ===
Modern medicine can, in some cases, revive patients who &quot;died&quot; by some definitions of death, or were declared dead. However, under most definitions of death (brain death), this would mean that the patient wasn&#x27;t truly dead.

Most advanced versions of such capabilities may include a method/system under development reported in 2019, &#x27;BrainEx&#x27;, that could partially revive (pig) brains hours after death (to the degree of brain circulation and cellular functions). It showed that &quot;the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process and that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed&quot;. A similar organ perfusion system under development, &#x27;OrganEx&#x27;, can restore – i.e. on the cellular level – multiple vital (pig) organs one hour after death (during which the body had prolonged warm ischaemia). It could be used to preserve donor organs but may also be developed to be useful for revival in medical emergencies by buying &quot;more time for doctors to treat people whose bodies were starved of oxygen, such as those who died from drowning or heart attacks&quot;.

There is research into what happens during and after death as well as how and to what extent patients could be revived by the use of science and technology. For example, one study showed that in the hours after humans die, &quot;certain cells in the human brain are still active&quot;. However, it is thought that at least &quot;without&quot; any life-support-like systems, death is permanent and irreversible after several hours – not days – even in cases when revival was still possible shortly after death.

A 2010 study notes that physicians are determining death &quot;test only for the permanent cessation of circulation and respiration because they know that irreversible cessation follows rapidly and inevitably once circulation no longer will restore itself spontaneously and will not be restored medically&quot;. Development of advanced live support measures &quot;including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and positive pressure ventilation (PPV)&quot; brought the interdependence of cessation of brain function and loss of respiration and circulation and &quot;the traditional definition of death into question&quot; and further developments upend more &quot;definitions of mortality&quot;.

=== Hypothetical speculations without existing technologies ===
Russian cosmist Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov advocated resurrection of the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research of the possibility of restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on &quot;knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world&quot;. The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person. For the traditional definition of resurrection, a restoration of the deceased&#x27;s personality, or their brain, would be necessary. Fedorov speculates about the idea of &quot;radial images&quot; that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man will learn to restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.

In his 1994 book &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;, American physicist Frank J. Tipler, an expert on the general theory of relativity, presented his Omega Point Theory which outlines how a resurrection of the dead could take place at the end of the cosmos. He posits that humans will evolve into robots which will turn the entire cosmos into a supercomputer which will, shortly before the Big Crunch, perform the resurrection within its cyberspace, reconstructing formerly dead humans (from information captured by the supercomputer from the past light cone of the cosmos) as avatars within its metaverse.

David Deutsch, British physicist and pioneer in the field of quantum computing, formerly agreed with Tipler&#x27;s Omega Point cosmology and the idea of resurrecting deceased people with the help of quantum computers but he is critical of Tipler&#x27;s theological views.

Italian physicist and computer scientist Giulio Prisco presented the idea of &quot;quantum archaeology&quot;, &quot;reconstructing the life, thoughts, memories, and feelings of any person in the past, up to any desired level of detail, and thus resurrecting the original person via &#x27;copying to the future&#x27;&quot;.

In their science fiction novel &quot;The Light of Other Days&quot;, Sir Arthur Clarke and Stephen Baxter imagine a future civilization resurrecting the dead of past ages by reaching into the past, through micro wormholes and with nanorobots, to download full snapshots of brain states and memories.

=== In religions ===
Both the Church of Perpetual Life and the Terasem Movement consider themselves transreligions and advocate for the use of technology to indefinitely extend the human lifespan.

==Zombies==

A zombie (Haitian French: &quot;&quot;, ) is a fictional undead being created through the reanimation of a human corpse. Zombies are most commonly found in horror and fantasy genre works. The term comes from Haitian folklore, where a &quot;zombie&quot; is a dead body reanimated through various methods, most commonly magic.

==Disappearances (as distinct from resurrection)==

As knowledge of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In ancient Greek religion, this was a way the gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as Cleitus, Ganymede, Menelaus, and Tithonus. After his death, Cycnus was changed into a swan and vanished. In his chapter on Romulus from Parallel Lives, Plutarch criticises the continuous belief in such disappearances, referring to the allegedly miraculous disappearance of the historical figures Romulus, Cleomedes of Astypalaea, and Croesus. In ancient times, Greek and Roman pagan similarities were explained by the early Christian writers, such as Justin Martyr, as the work of demons, with the intention of leading Christians astray.

In the Buddhist Epic of King Gesar, also spelled as Geser or Kesar, at the end, chants on a mountain top and his clothes fall empty to the ground. The body of the first Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Nanak Dev, is said to have disappeared and flowers left in place of his dead body.

Lord Raglan&#x27;s Hero Pattern lists many religious figures whose bodies disappear, or have more than one sepulchre. B. Traven, author of &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, wrote that the Inca Virococha arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he walked across the water and vanished. It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero&#x27;s human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero&#x27;s remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.

The first such case mentioned in the Bible is that of Enoch (son of Jared, great-grandfather of Noah, and father of Methuselah). Enoch is said to have lived a life where he &quot;walked with God&quot;, after which &quot;he was not, for God took him&quot; (Genesis 5:1–18). In Deuteronomy (34:6) Moses is secretly buried. Elijah vanishes in a whirlwind 2 Kings (2:11). In the Synoptic Gospels, after hundreds of years these two earlier Biblical heroes suddenly reappear, and are reportedly seen walking with Jesus, then again vanish. In the Gospel of Luke, the last time Jesus is seen (24:51) he leaves his disciples by ascending into the sky. This ascension of Jesus was a &quot;disappearance&quot; of sorts as recorded by Luke but was after the physical resurrection occurring several days before.

<text>Robert Ghormley Parr (September 22, 1921 – March 27, 2017) was an American theoretical chemist who was a professor of chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Career==
Parr received an A. B. degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Brown University in 1942, and then entered the University of Minnesota, receiving a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1947. He joined the faculty at Minnesota upon receiving his Ph.D. and remained there one year. In 1948 he moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, becoming a full professor in 1957. In 1962 he moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and in 1974 to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received appointment to an endowed professorship in 1990 and where he last taught.

==Achievements and awards==
Working with DuPont chemist Rudolph Pariser, Parr developed a method of computing approximate molecular orbitals for pi electron systems, published in 1953. Since an identical procedure was derived by John A. Pople the same year, it is generally referred to as the Pariser–Parr–Pople method or PPP method. The PPP method differed from existing structural chemistry thinking (which advocated &quot;maximum overlap principle&quot;) by advancing the concept of &quot;zero differential overlap approximation&quot;.

By 1978 Parr had realized that density functional theory (DFT) would be extremely useful in quantitative calculations of chemical and biological systems, especially those with high molecular weights. In 1988 Parr, Weitao Yang and Chengteh Lee produced an improved DFT method which could approximate the correlation energy of systems. The LYP (for Lee–Yang–Parr) functional theory is now one of the most cited papers in the chemical literature.

In 1963 Parr published &quot;Quantum Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure&quot;, one of the first books to apply quantum theory to chemical systems.

In 1989 he and Yang published &quot;Density Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules&quot;, now considered the basic textbook on DFT.

==Awards and honors==
*Member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science
*1967 - Co-founded (with 4 others) the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science
*1994 - Winner of American Chemical Society&#x27;s Irving Langmuir Award in Chemical Physics
*2004 - winner of United States National Academy of Sciences Award in Chemical Sciences
*2009 - winner of American Chemical Society&#x27;s Award in Theoretical Chemistry

<text>The Riesz representation theorem, sometimes called the Riesz–Fréchet representation theorem after Frigyes Riesz and Maurice René Fréchet, establishes an important connection between a Hilbert space and its continuous dual space. If the underlying field is the real numbers, the two are isometrically isomorphic; if the underlying field is the complex numbers, the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic. The (anti-) isomorphism is a particular natural isomorphism.

== Preliminaries and notation ==

Let formula_1 be a Hilbert space over a field formula_2 where formula_3 is either the real numbers formula_4 or the complex numbers formula_5 If formula_6 (resp. if formula_7) then formula_1 is called a (resp. a ). Every real Hilbert space can be extended to be a dense subset of a unique (up to bijective isometry) complex Hilbert space, called its complexification, which is why Hilbert spaces are often automatically assumed to be complex. Real and complex Hilbert spaces have in common many, but by no means all, properties and results/theorems. 

This article is intended for both mathematicians and physicists and will describe the theorem for both. 
In both mathematics and physics, if a Hilbert space is assumed to be real (that is, if formula_7) then this will usually be made clear. Often in mathematics, and especially in physics, unless indicated otherwise, &quot;Hilbert space&quot; is usually automatically assumed to mean &quot;complex Hilbert space.&quot; Depending on the author, in mathematics, &quot;Hilbert space&quot; usually means either (1) a complex Hilbert space, or (2) a real complex Hilbert space. 

=== Linear and antilinear maps ===

By definition, an  (also called a ) formula_10 is a map between vector spaces that is :
formula_11
and (also called or ):
formula_12
where formula_13 is the conjugate of the complex number formula_14, given by formula_15.

In contrast, a map formula_10 is linear if it is additive and : 
formula_17

Every constant formula_18 map is always both linear and antilinear. If formula_7 then the definitions of linear maps and antilinear maps are completely identical. A linear map from a Hilbert space into a Banach space (or more generally, from any Banach space into any topological vector space) is continuous if and only if it is bounded; the same is true of antilinear maps. The inverse of any antilinear (resp. linear) bijection is again an antilinear (resp. linear) bijection. The composition of two linear maps is a map. 

Continuous dual and anti-dual spaces

A on formula_1 is a function formula_21 whose codomain is the underlying scalar field formula_22 
Denote by formula_23 (resp. by formula_24 the set of all continuous linear (resp. continuous antilinear) functionals on formula_25 which is called the (resp. the ) of formula_26 
If formula_7 then linear functionals on formula_1 are the same as antilinear functionals and consequently, the same is true for such continuous maps: that is, formula_29 

One-to-one correspondence between linear and antilinear functionals

Given any functional formula_30 the is the functional 
formula_31

This assignment is most useful when formula_6 because if formula_7 then formula_34 and the assignment formula_35 reduces down to the identity map. 

The assignment formula_35 defines an antilinear bijective correspondence from the set of 
:all functionals (resp. all linear functionals, all continuous linear functionals formula_23) on formula_25 
onto the set of 
:all functionals (resp. all linear functionals, all continuous linear functionals formula_39) on formula_26

=== Mathematics vs. physics notations and definitions of inner product ===

The Hilbert space formula_1 has an associated inner product formula_42 valued in formula_1&#x27;s underlying scalar field formula_3 that is linear in one coordinate and antilinear in the other (as specified below).
If formula_1 is a complex Hilbert space (formula_6), then there is a crucial difference between the notations prevailing in mathematics versus physics, regarding which of the two variables is linear.
However, for real Hilbert spaces (formula_7), the inner product is a symmetric map that is linear in each coordinate (bilinear), so there can be no such confusion. 

In mathematics, the inner product on a Hilbert space formula_1 is often denoted by formula_49 or formula_50 while in physics, the bra–ket notation formula_51 or formula_52 is typically used. In this article, these two notations will be related by the equality:
formula_53These have the following properties:

In computations, one must consistently use either the mathematics notation formula_49, which is (linear, antilinear); or the physics notation formula_51, which is (antilinear | linear).

=== Canonical norm and inner product on the dual space and anti-dual space ===

If formula_56 then formula_57 is a non-negative real number and the map
formula_58 

defines a canonical norm on formula_1 that makes formula_1 into a normed space. 
As with all normed spaces, the (continuous) dual space formula_23 carries a canonical norm, called the , that is defined by
formula_62 

The canonical norm on the (continuous) anti-dual space formula_63 denoted by formula_64 is defined by using this same equation: 
formula_65 

This canonical norm on formula_23 satisfies the parallelogram law, which means that the polarization identity can be used to define a which this article will denote by the notations 
formula_67 
where this inner product turns formula_23 into a Hilbert space. There are now two ways of defining a norm on formula_69 the norm induced by this inner product (that is, the norm defined by formula_70) and the usual dual norm (defined as the supremum over the closed unit ball). These norms are the same; explicitly, this means that the following holds for every formula_71
formula_72 

As will be described later, the Riesz representation theorem can be used to give an equivalent definition of the canonical norm and the canonical inner product on formula_73 

The same equations that were used above can also be used to define a norm and inner product on formula_1&#x27;s anti-dual space formula_75 

Canonical isometry between the dual and antidual

The complex conjugate formula_76 of a functional formula_77 which was defined above, satisfies 
formula_78
for every formula_79 and every formula_80 
This says exactly that the canonical antilinear bijection defined by
formula_81
as well as its inverse formula_82 are antilinear isometries and consequently also homeomorphisms. 
The inner products on the dual space formula_23 and the anti-dual space formula_63 denoted respectively by formula_85 and formula_86 are related by
formula_87
and
formula_88

If formula_7 then formula_90 and this canonical map formula_91 reduces down to the identity map.

== Riesz representation theorem ==

Two vectors formula_92 and formula_93 are if formula_94 which happens if and only if formula_95 for all scalars formula_96 The orthogonal complement of a subset formula_97 is 
formula_98
which is always a closed vector subspace of formula_26 
The Hilbert projection theorem guarantees that for any nonempty closed convex subset formula_100 of a Hilbert space there exists a unique vector formula_101 such that formula_102 that is, formula_101 is the (unique) global minimum point of the function formula_104 defined by formula_105

===Statement===

Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to Riesz and Fréchet in 1907 (see references). 
Let formula_3 denote the underlying scalar field of formula_26 

Fix formula_108 
Define formula_109 by formula_110 which is a linear functional on formula_1 since formula_112 is in the linear argument. 
By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, 
formula_113
which shows that formula_114 is bounded (equivalently, continuous) and that formula_115 
It remains to show that formula_116 
By using formula_93 in place of formula_118 it follows that 
formula_119
(the equality formula_120 holds because formula_121 is real and non-negative). 
Thus that formula_122 
formula_123

The proof above did not use the fact that formula_1 is complete, which shows that the formula for the norm formula_125 holds more generally for all inner product spaces. 


Suppose formula_126 are such that formula_127 and formula_128 for all formula_129 
Then 
formula_130
which shows that formula_131 is the constant formula_18 linear functional. 
Consequently formula_133 which implies that formula_134 
formula_123


Let formula_136 
If formula_137 (or equivalently, if formula_138) then taking formula_139 completes the proof so assume that formula_140 and formula_141 
The continuity of formula_142 implies that formula_143 is a closed subspace of formula_1 (because formula_145 and formula_146 is a closed subset of formula_3). 
Let 
formula_148 
denote the orthogonal complement of formula_143 in formula_26
Because formula_143 is closed and formula_1 is a Hilbert space, formula_1 can be written as the direct sum formula_154 (a proof of this is given in the article on the Hilbert projection theorem). 
Because formula_155 there exists some non-zero formula_156 
For any formula_157
formula_158
which shows that formula_159 where now formula_160 implies 
formula_161 
Solving for formula_162 shows that 
formula_163
which proves that the vector formula_164 satisfies 
formula_165 

Applying the norm formula that was proved above with formula_166 shows that formula_167 
Also, the vector formula_168 has norm formula_169 and satisfies formula_170 
formula_123

It can now be deduced that formula_172 is formula_173-dimensional when formula_141 
Let formula_175 be any non-zero vector. Replacing formula_176 with formula_177 in the proof above shows that the vector formula_178 satisfies formula_179 for every formula_180 The uniqueness of the (non-zero) vector formula_181 representing formula_142 implies that formula_183 which in turn implies that formula_184 and formula_185 Thus every vector in formula_172 is a scalar multiple of formula_187 formula_123

The formulas for the inner products follow from the polarization identity. 

=== Observations ===

If formula_189 then 
formula_190 
So in particular, formula_191 is always real and furthermore, formula_192 if and only if formula_193 if and only if formula_194 

Linear functionals as affine hyperplanes

A non-trivial continuous linear functional formula_142 is often interpreted geometrically by identifying it with the affine hyperplane formula_196 (the kernel formula_197 is also often visualized alongside formula_196 although knowing formula_199 is enough to reconstruct formula_200 because if formula_201 then formula_202 and otherwise formula_203). In particular, the norm of formula_142 should somehow be interpretable as the &quot;norm of the hyperplane formula_199&quot;. When formula_206 then the Riesz representation theorem provides such an interpretation of formula_207 in terms of the affine hyperplane 
formula_196 as follows: using the notation from the theorem&#x27;s statement, from formula_209 it follows that formula_210 and so formula_211 implies formula_212 and thus formula_213 
This can also be seen by applying the Hilbert projection theorem to formula_199 and concluding that the global minimum point of the map formula_215 defined by formula_216 is formula_217 
The formulas 
formula_218
provide the promised interpretation of the linear functional&#x27;s norm formula_207 entirely in terms of its associated affine hyperplane formula_220 (because with this formula, knowing only the formula_199 is enough to describe the norm of its associated linear ). Defining formula_222 the infimum formula 
formula_223
will also hold when formula_194 
When the supremum is taken in formula_4 (as is typically assumed), then the supremum of the empty set is formula_226 but if the supremum is taken in the non-negative reals formula_227 (which is the image/range of the norm formula_228 when formula_229) then this supremum is instead formula_230 in which case the supremum formula formula_231 will also hold when formula_138 (although the atypical equality formula_233 is usually unexpected and so risks causing confusion).

=== Constructions of the representing vector ===

Using the notation from the theorem above, several ways of constructing formula_181 from formula_189 are now described. 
If formula_138 then formula_139; in other words, 
formula_238

This special case of formula_138 is henceforth assumed to be known, which is why some of the constructions given below start by assuming formula_141 

Orthogonal complement of kernel

If formula_206 then for any formula_242 
formula_243

If formula_244 is a unit vector (meaning formula_169) then 
formula_246
(this is true even if formula_138 because in this case formula_248). 
If formula_249 is a unit vector satisfying the above condition then the same is true of formula_250 which is also a unit vector in formula_251 However, formula_252 so both these vectors result in the same formula_187

Orthogonal projection onto kernel

If formula_254 is such that formula_255 and if formula_256 is the orthogonal projection of formula_92 onto formula_258 then
formula_259

Orthonormal basis

Given an orthonormal basis formula_260 of formula_1 and a continuous linear functional formula_262 the vector formula_263 can be constructed uniquely by 
formula_264 
where all but at most countably many formula_265 will be equal to formula_18 and where the value of formula_181 does not actually depend on choice of orthonormal basis (that is, using any other orthonormal basis for formula_1 will result in the same vector). 
If formula_269 is written as formula_270 then 
formula_271
and
formula_272

If the orthonormal basis formula_273 is a sequence then this becomes 
formula_274 
and if formula_269 is written as formula_276 then 
formula_277

==== Example in finite dimensions using matrix transformations ====

Consider the special case of formula_278 (where formula_279 is an integer) with the standard inner product 
formula_280 
where formula_281 are represented as column matrices formula_282 and formula_283 with respect to the standard orthonormal basis formula_284 on formula_1 (here, formula_286 is formula_173 at its formula_288th coordinate and formula_18 everywhere else; as usual, formula_23 will now be associated with the dual basis) and where formula_291 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_292 
Let formula_189 be any linear functional and let formula_294 be the unique scalars such that 
formula_295 
where it can be shown that formula_296 for all formula_297 
Then the Riesz representation of formula_142 is the vector 
formula_299
To see why, identify every vector formula_300 in formula_1 with the column matrix 
formula_282 
so that formula_181 is identified with formula_304 
As usual, also identify the linear functional formula_142 with its transformation matrix, which is the row matrix formula_306 so that formula_307 and the function formula_142 is the assignment formula_309 where the right hand side is matrix multiplication. Then for all formula_310
formula_311
which shows that formula_181 satisfies the defining condition of the Riesz representation of formula_313 
The bijective antilinear isometry formula_314 defined in the corollary to the Riesz representation theorem is the assignment that sends formula_315 to the linear functional formula_316 on formula_1 defined by 
formula_318 
where under the identification of vectors in formula_1 with column matrices and vector in formula_23 with row matrices, formula_321 is just the assignment 
formula_322 
As described in the corollary, formula_321&#x27;s inverse formula_324 is the antilinear isometry formula_325 which was just shown above to be: 
formula_326 
where in terms of matrices, formula_327 is the assignment 
formula_328 
Thus in terms of matrices, each of formula_314 and formula_324 is just the operation of conjugate transposition formula_331 (although between different spaces of matrices: if formula_1 is identified with the space of all column (respectively, row) matrices then formula_23 is identified with the space of all row (respectively, column matrices). 

This example used the standard inner product, which is the map formula_334 but if a different inner product is used, such as formula_335 where formula_336 is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix, or if a different orthonormal basis is used then the transformation matrices, and thus also the above formulas, will be different.

=== Relationship with the associated real Hilbert space ===
Assume that formula_1 is a complex Hilbert space with inner product formula_338 
When the Hilbert space formula_1 is reinterpreted as a real Hilbert space then it will be denoted by formula_340 where the (real) inner-product on formula_341 is the real part of formula_1&#x27;s inner product; that is: 
formula_343 

The norm on formula_341 induced by formula_345 is equal to the original norm on formula_1 and the continuous dual space of formula_341 is the set of all -valued bounded formula_4-linear functionals on formula_341 (see the article about the polarization identity for additional details about this relationship). 
Let formula_350 and formula_351 denote the real and imaginary parts of a linear functional formula_352 so that formula_353 
The formula expressing a linear functional in terms of its real part is
formula_354
where formula_355 for all formula_180 
It follows that formula_357 and that formula_358 if and only if formula_359 
It can also be shown that formula_360 where formula_361 and formula_362 are the usual operator norms. 
In particular, a linear functional formula_363 is bounded if and only if its real part formula_364 is bounded. 

Representing a functional and its real part

The Riesz representation of a continuous linear function formula_142 on a complex Hilbert space is equal to the Riesz representation of its real part formula_366 on its associated real Hilbert space. 

Explicitly, let formula_189 and as above, let formula_368 be the Riesz representation of formula_142 obtained in formula_370 so it is the unique vector that satisfies formula_371 for all formula_372 
The real part of formula_142 is a continuous real linear functional on formula_341 and so the Riesz representation theorem may be applied to formula_375 and the associated real Hilbert space formula_376 to produce its Riesz representation, which will be denoted by formula_377 
That is, formula_378 is the unique vector in formula_341 that satisfies formula_380 for all formula_372 
The conclusion is formula_382 
This follows from the main theorem because formula_383 and if formula_254 then 
formula_385 
and consequently, if formula_386 then formula_387 which shows that formula_388 
Moreover, formula_389 being a real number implies that formula_390
In other words, in the theorem and constructions above, if formula_1 is replaced with its real Hilbert space counterpart formula_341 and if formula_142 is replaced with formula_366 then formula_395 This means that vector formula_181 obtained by using formula_376 and the real linear functional formula_366 is the equal to the vector obtained by using the origin complex Hilbert space formula_399 and original complex linear functional formula_142 (with identical norm values as well). 

Furthermore, if formula_206 then formula_181 is perpendicular to formula_403 with respect to formula_404 where the kernel of formula_142 is be a &quot;proper&quot; subspace of the kernel of its real part formula_406 Assume now that formula_141 
Then formula_408 because formula_409 and formula_258 is a proper subset of formula_411 The vector subspace formula_200 has real codimension formula_173 in formula_414 while formula_403 has codimension formula_173 in formula_340 and formula_418 That is, formula_181 is perpendicular to formula_403 with respect to formula_421

=== Canonical injections into the dual and anti-dual ===

Induced linear map into anti-dual

The map defined by placing formula_93 into the coordinate of the inner product and letting the variable formula_423 vary over the coordinate results in an functional:
formula_424

This map is an element of formula_63 which is the continuous anti-dual space of formula_26 
The formula_39 is the operator 
formula_428
which is also an injective isometry. 
The Fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces, which is related to Riesz representation theorem, states that this map is surjective (and thus bijective). Consequently, every antilinear functional on formula_1 can be written (uniquely) in this form. 

If formula_91 is the canonical linear bijective isometry formula_35 that was defined above, then the following equality holds:
formula_432

== Extending the bra–ket notation to bras and kets ==

Let formula_433 be a Hilbert space and as before, let formula_434 
Let 
formula_435
which is a bijective antilinear isometry that satisfies
formula_436

Bras

Given a vector formula_157 let formula_438 denote the continuous linear functional formula_439; that is, 
formula_440 
so that this functional formula_438 is defined by formula_442 This map was denoted by formula_443 earlier in this article. 

The assignment formula_444 is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism formula_445 which is why formula_446 holds for all formula_447 and all scalars formula_448 
The result of plugging some given formula_449 into the functional formula_438 is the scalar formula_451 which may be denoted by formula_452 

Bra of a linear functional

Given a continuous linear functional formula_453 let formula_454 denote the vector formula_455; that is, 
formula_456 

The assignment formula_457 is just the isometric antilinear isomorphism formula_458 which is why formula_459 holds for all formula_460 and all scalars formula_448 

The defining condition of the vector formula_462 is the technically correct but unsightly equality
formula_463
which is why the notation formula_464 is used in place of formula_465 With this notation, the defining condition becomes
formula_466

Kets

For any given vector formula_467 the notation formula_468 is used to denote formula_469; that is, 
formula_470 

The assignment formula_471 is just the identity map formula_472 which is why formula_473 holds for all formula_447 and all scalars formula_448 

The notation formula_476 and formula_477 is used in place of formula_478 and formula_479 respectively. As expected, formula_480 and formula_481 really is just the scalar formula_482

== Adjoints and transposes ==

Let formula_483 be a continuous linear operator between Hilbert spaces formula_484 and formula_485 As before, let formula_486 and formula_487 

Denote by
formula_488
the usual bijective antilinear isometries that satisfy:
formula_489

=== Definition of the adjoint ===

For every formula_490 the scalar-valued map formula_491 on formula_1 defined by 
formula_493 

is a continuous linear functional on formula_1 and so by the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a unique vector in formula_25 denoted by formula_496 such that formula_497 or equivalently, such that 
formula_498 

The assignment formula_499 thus induces a function formula_500 called the of formula_483 whose defining condition is 
formula_502 
The adjoint formula_500 is necessarily a continuous (equivalently, a bounded) linear operator. 

If formula_1 is finite dimensional with the standard inner product and if formula_336 is the transformation matrix of formula_199 with respect to the standard orthonormal basis then formula_336&#x27;s conjugate transpose formula_508 is the transformation matrix of the adjoint formula_509 

=== Adjoints are transposes ===


It is also possible to define the or of formula_510 which is the map formula_511 defined by sending a continuous linear functionals formula_512 to 
formula_513 
where the composition formula_514 is always a continuous linear functional on formula_1 and it satisfies formula_516 (this is true more generally, when formula_1 and formula_518 are merely normed spaces). 

So for example, if formula_519 then formula_520 sends the continuous linear functional formula_521 (defined on formula_518 by formula_523) to the continuous linear functional formula_524 (defined on formula_1 by formula_526); 
using bra-ket notation, this can be written as formula_527 where the juxtaposition of formula_528 with formula_199 on the right hand side denotes function composition: formula_530 

The adjoint formula_500 is actually just to the transpose formula_511 when the Riesz representation theorem is used to identify formula_518 with formula_534 and formula_1 with formula_73 

Explicitly, the relationship between the adjoint and transpose is:

which can be rewritten as:
formula_537

Alternatively, the value of the left and right hand sides of () at any given formula_519 can be rewritten in terms of the inner products as: 
formula_539
so that formula_540 holds if and only if formula_541 holds; but the equality on the right holds by definition of formula_542 
The defining condition of formula_543 can also be written
formula_544 
if bra-ket notation is used.

===Descriptions of self-adjoint, normal, and unitary operators===

Assume formula_545 and let formula_546 
Let formula_547 be a continuous (that is, bounded) linear operator. 

Whether or not formula_547 is self-adjoint, normal, or unitary depends entirely on whether or not formula_199 satisfies certain defining conditions related to its adjoint, which was shown by () to essentially be just the transpose formula_550 
Because the transpose of formula_199 is a map between continuous linear functionals, these defining conditions can consequently be re-expressed entirely in terms of linear functionals, as the remainder of subsection will now describe in detail. 
The linear functionals that are involved are the simplest possible continuous linear functionals on formula_1 that can be defined entirely in terms of formula_553 the inner product formula_554 on formula_25 and some given vector formula_180 
Specifically, these are formula_557 and formula_558 where 
formula_559 

Self-adjoint operators

A continuous linear operator formula_547 is called self-adjoint if it is equal to its own adjoint; that is, if formula_561 Using (), this happens if and only if:
formula_562
where this equality can be rewritten in the following two equivalent forms:
formula_563

Unraveling notation and definitions produces the following characterization of self-adjoint operators in terms of the aforementioned continuous linear functionals: formula_199 is self-adjoint if and only if for all formula_565 the linear functional formula_566 is equal to the linear functional formula_567; that is, if and only if

where if bra-ket notation is used, this is
formula_568 

Normal operators

A continuous linear operator formula_547 is called normal if formula_570 which happens if and only if for all formula_571 
formula_572 

Using () and unraveling notation and definitions produces the following characterization of normal operators in terms of inner products of continuous linear functionals: formula_199 is a normal operator if and only if 
where the left hand side is also equal to formula_574 
The left hand side of this characterization involves &quot;only&quot; linear functionals of the form formula_575 while the right hand side involves &quot;only&quot; linear functions of the form formula_576 (defined as above). 
So in plain English, characterization () says that an operator is &quot;normal&quot; when the inner product of any two linear functions of the first form is equal to the inner product of their second form (using the same vectors formula_577 for both forms).
In other words, if it happens to be the case (and when formula_199 is injective or self-adjoint, it is) that the assignment of linear functionals formula_579 is well-defined (or alternatively, if formula_580 is well-defined) where formula_581 ranges over formula_25 then formula_199 is a normal operator if and only if this assignment preserves the inner product on formula_73 

The fact that every self-adjoint bounded linear operator is normal follows readily by direct substitution of formula_585 into either side of formula_586 
This same fact also follows immediately from the direct substitution of the equalities () into either side of (). 

Alternatively, for a complex Hilbert space, the continuous linear operator formula_199 is a normal operator if and only if formula_588 for every formula_565 which happens if and only if 
formula_590

Unitary operators

An invertible bounded linear operator formula_547 is said to be unitary if its inverse is its adjoint: formula_592 
By using (), this is seen to be equivalent to formula_593 
Unraveling notation and definitions, it follows that formula_199 is unitary if and only if 
formula_595

The fact that a bounded invertible linear operator formula_547 is unitary if and only if formula_597 (or equivalently, formula_598) produces another (well-known) characterization: an invertible bounded linear map formula_199 is unitary if and only if
formula_600

Because formula_547 is invertible (and so in particular a bijection), this is also true of the transpose formula_550 This fact also allows the vector formula_603 in the above characterizations to be replaced with formula_604 or formula_605 thereby producing many more equalities. Similarly, formula_606 can be replaced with formula_607 or formula_608

<text>Romano Scarpa (27 September 1927 – 23 April 2005) was one of the most famous Italian creators of Disney comics.

==Biography==
Growing up in Venice he developed a particular love for American cartoons and Disney comics, that, at the time, were published in the big format of the Topolino giornale which was then printing now classic Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s stories. In the 1940s he opened an Animation Studio in Venice in which he produced his first works: some commercials, a short titled &quot;E poi venne il diluvio&quot; and another one titled &quot;La piccola fiammiferaia&quot; (1953, based on Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;), distributed in Italy together with Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Attack!&quot; (1956).

Right after that he stopped working in animation for a while and dedicated wholly to creating Disney comics. When in 1956 Italian editors had no more new Floyd Gottfredson&#x27;s stories to reprint, he was given the responsibility to continue Gottfredson&#x27;s stories about Mickey Mouse. Also influenced by Carl Barks in the late 1950s and up to about 1963 he wrote and penciled stories like &quot;Topolino e la collana Chirikawa&quot; (1960) or &quot;The Flying Scot&quot; (1957) that have, later, been translated in many different languages throughout the world. Many of these stories have their backgrounds in movies, for example &quot;Topolino nel favoloso regno di Shan Grillà&quot; (1961) is based upon Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937); not to talk about all the stories starring Snow White or the Seven Dwarfs, obviously based on &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). Sometimes the exact opposite happened; the Italian movie &quot;Riusciranno i nostri eroi a ritrovare l&#x27;amico misteriosamente scomparso in Africa?&quot; (1968) is based on Scarpa&#x27;s story &quot;Topolino e il Pippotarzan&quot; (1957).

Around 1963, Scarpa stopped writing for 6 or 7 years. In the 1970s, he moved to Spain and started working for a different publisher. Among the last things he made while he was still in Italy, at the end of the 1980s and at beginning of the 1990s, there are the so-called &quot;Paperolimpiadi&quot; (a long story about the 1988 Seoul Olympic games) and some strip stories, the same kind of stories that he loved when he was a child. One of these, &quot;Topolino e l&#x27;enigma di Brigaboom&quot; (1989) was partially based on &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954).

In the meanwhile he has had time enough for some more animation, so we have &quot;Aihnoo degli Icebergs&quot; (1972), &quot;The Fourth King&quot; (1977) and a new TV series, &quot;The Adventures of Marco and Gina&quot; (&quot;Sopra i tetti di Venezia&quot;) (2001).

Scarpa mainly worked on Disney comics, but he was also able to work on non-Disney material once in a while, so he did one (Rolf Kauka&#x27;s) &quot;Lupo&quot; story and one (Hannah and Barbera&#x27;s) &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; story. In the 1950s he also drew some &quot;Angelino&quot; stories, and Italian character.

Since 1988 some of his comic stories have been published in the US by Gladstone Publishing; it was the first time that this happened to an Italian Disney author. Later, when Disney Comics took Gladstone&#x27;s place; they published some more of his stories, and in 2003, the same happened with Gemstone Publishing, that is publishing his stories in the US at the moment.

He has influenced many younger creators (Giorgio Cavazzano was his inker during the Sixties) and many have attempted to imitate his style.

==Disney characters created by Romano Scarpa==
In his career Scarpa created many Disney characters that are now accepted by some as part of the Disney Universe. Those include, but are not limited to:

*Ellroy (Italian: Bruto), Ellsworth&#x27;s adopted son;
*Dickie Duck (Italian: Paperetta Yé-Yé), a dynamic female teenage duck who was introduced as the granddaughter of &quot;Glittering&quot; Goldie O&#x27;Gilt;
*Gideon McDuck (Italian: Gedeone de&#x27; Paperoni), a newspaper editor and Scrooge&#x27;s brother;
*Jubal Pomp (Italian: Filo Sganga), an unlucky wanna-be businessman always trying to imitate Scrooge and failing miserably;
*Kildare Coot (Italian: Sgrizzo Papero), a crazy cousin of Donald Duck&#x27;s;
*Portis (Italian: Plottigat), Black Pete&#x27;s cousin, a genius of crime;
*Trudy Van Tubb, Black Pete&#x27;s mate and accomplice in crime.

<text>Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an American activist in the civil rights movement, best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. The United States Congress has honored her as &quot;the first lady of civil rights&quot; and &quot;the mother of the freedom movement&quot;.

Parks became an NAACP activist in 1943, participating in several high-profile civil rights campaigns. On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake&#x27;s order to vacate a row of four seats in the &quot;colored&quot; section in favor of a white female passenger who had complained to the driver, once the &quot;white&quot; section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws, and she helped inspire the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Parks&#x27;s act of defiance and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the movement. She became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation, and organized and collaborated with civil rights leaders, including Edgar Nixon and Martin Luther King Jr. At the time, Parks was employed as a seamstress at a local department store and was secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. She had recently attended the Highlander Folk School, a Tennessee center for training activists for workers&#x27; rights and racial equality. Although widely honored in later years, she also suffered for her act; she was fired from her job and received death threats for years afterwards. Shortly after the boycott, she moved to Detroit, where she briefly found similar work. From 1965 to 1988, she served as secretary and receptionist to John Conyers, an African-American US Representative. She was also active in the black power movement and the support of political prisoners in the US.

After retirement, Parks wrote her autobiography and continued to insist that there was more work to be done in the struggle for justice. She received national recognition, including the NAACP&#x27;s 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. California and Missouri commemorate Rosa Parks Day on her birthday, February 4, while Ohio, Oregon, and Texas commemorate the anniversary of her arrest, December 1.

==Early life==
Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913. Her mother, Leona (), was a teacher from Pine Level, Alabama. Her father, James McCauley, was a carpenter and mason from Abbeville, Alabama. Her name was a portmanteau of her maternal and paternal grandmothers&#x27; names: Rose and Louisa. In addition to her African ancestry, one of her great-grandfathers was of Scotch-Irish descent, and one of her great-grandmothers was of partial Native American ancestry. Her maternal grandfather, Sylvester Edwards, was born as a result of the rape of an enslaved woman by a plantation owner&#x27;s son.

As an infant, Parks moved with her mother to her grandparents&#x27; farm outside Pine Level, where her younger brother Sylvester was born. To supplement the family&#x27;s income, she worked on the plantation of Moses Hudson, who paid Black children 50 cents a day to pick cotton. Parks also learned quilting and sewing from her mother, completing her first quilt at age ten and her first dress at eleven. She attended the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, a century-old independent Black denomination founded by free Blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early nineteenth century. Baptized at age two, she remained a member of the church throughout her life.

Alabama and other southern states began implementing segregationist policies during the 1870s and 1880s, culminating in a 1901 constitutional convention that formally codified Jim Crow segregation into law. This system enforced racial separation in nearly all aspects of life, including financial institutions, healthcare, religious facilities, burial grounds, and public transportation. Acts of racist violence were also widespread, with the Ku Klux Klan intensifying its activity in Pine Level after the end of World War I. Parks later recalled that she &quot;heard of a lot of black people being found dead&quot; under mysterious circumstances during her childhood.

Parks initially attended school in a one-room schoolhouse at the local Mount Zion AME church. Because she suffered from chronic tonsilitis, she often missed school during the academic year, causing her mother to enroll her in summer school. When she was nine, she received a tonsillectomy from a doctor in Montgomery, Alabama, which improved her health. When she was eleven or twelve, she began attending the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls, where she received vocational training. After the school closed in 1928, she transferred to Booker T. Washington Junior High School. She then attended a laboratory school set up by the Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes, but dropped out to care for her ailing grandmother and mother.

After dropping out of school, Parks worked on her family&#x27;s farm and as a domestic worker in white households. Black women in Alabama who worked as domestic workers often experienced sexual violence, as exemplified by the rape of Murdus Dixon, a 12-year-old girl who was threatened at knifepoint and raped in Birmingham, Alabama. During the 1950s or 60s, Parks wrote an account of an incident where a white man named &quot;Mr. Charlie&quot; attempted to sexually assault her. In her account, she verbally resists Mr. Charlie&#x27;s advances and denounces his racism. The account concludes with her attempting to read a newspaper while ignoring him. While the account may have been partially or entirely fictionalized, biographer Jeanne Theoharis notes that many of the elements of the account &quot;correspond to Parks&#x27;s life&quot;, speculating that Parks &quot;wrote [the account] as an allegory to suggest larger themes of domination and resistance&quot;, or that, &quot;given that more than twenty-five years had passed before she wrote [the account] down, she augmented what she said to Charlie that evening with all the points that she had wished to make as she resisted his advances&quot;.

In 1931, Rosa was introduced to her future husband, Raymond Parks, by a mutual friend. She was initially &quot;[not] very interested in him&quot; because of &quot;some unhappy romantic experiences&quot; and because of his light skin. However, Raymond eventually persuaded Rosa to ride with him in his car. At the time, automobile ownership was rare among Black men in Alabama. Rosa described Raymond as the &quot;first real activist&quot; she had met, admiring his opposition to racial prejudice. The two married on December 18, 1932, at Rosa&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house.

===Early activism===
Following their marriage, Raymond and Rosa became involved in the Scottsboro Boys case, concerning a group of nine Black boys who were falsely accused of raping two white women on a train in Paint Rock, Alabama. The Scottsboro Boys faced trial in Scottsboro, Alabama, where they were sentenced to death by electrocution. To raise support for their defense, Rosa and Raymond hosted fundraising meetings and gatherings for Scottsboro legal defenders at their Montgomery residence. According to historian Robin Kelley, the couple also attended meetings of the Communist Party USA, who helped bring attention to the Scottsboro Boys case. The Supreme Court of the United States ultimately overturned the Scottsboro Boys&#x27; convictions in &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot;, citing insufficient legal representation. They were released in 1950.

In 1933, Rosa completed her high school education with encouragement from Raymond. At the time in Alabama, only 7% of Black people held a high school diploma. Subsequently, she worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide at St. Margaret&#x27;s Hospital, sewing to supplement her income. In 1941, she began working at Maxwell Air Force Base, a training facility for air force cadets. The base was fully integrated, and Parks was able to take public transit alongside her white coworkers on-base. However, when she returned home, she was required to use segregated buses, which frustrated her. According to Parks, her time at Maxwell &quot;opened her eyes up&quot;, providing an &quot;alternative reality to the ugly racial policies of Jim Crow&quot;.

Parks began attending meetings of the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1943 after seeing a picture of a former classmate of hers, Johnnie Carr, at a meeting. In December 1943, was elected secretary of the chapter. Parks later explained that she accepted the role, considered a woman&#x27;s position at the time, because &quot;[she] was the only woman there, and they needed a secretary, and [she] was too timid to say no&quot;. She and Raymond were also members of the Voter&#x27;s League, a local organization focused on increasing Black voter registration. There were numerous obstacles preventing Black people from registering to vote in Alabama during this period, including poll taxes, literacy tests, intrusive questions on voter registration applications, and retaliation by employers. As of 1940, less than 0.1% of Black Montgomerians were registered to vote. Encouraged by NAACP activist E. D. Nixon, Parks attempted to register three times beginning in 1943, finally succeeding in 1945. 

In her capacity as secretary, Parks began investigating the gang rape of Recy Taylor, a Black woman from Abbeville, in 1944. After a grand jury failed to indict the perpetrators, Parks and other civil rights activists organized &quot;The Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor&quot;, launching &quot;the strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade&quot;, according to &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;. The campaign, which received nationwide attention, put pressure on Governor Chauncey Sparks to take steps to prosecute Taylor&#x27;s assailants. Sparks ultimately promised to investigate the case. However, the state failed to secure indictments for the assailants after a second grand jury hearing in 1945. Despite this, historian Danielle L. McGuire describes the movement for justice in the Recy Taylor case as &quot;the largest and best organized of many efforts to draw attention to the ruthless heart of the racial caste system&quot;, claiming that it &quot;brought the building blocks of the Montgomery bus boycott together a decade earlier and kept them in place until it became Rosa Parks&#x27;s turn to testify&quot;. Parks also organized support for Jeremiah Reeves, who was accused of raping a white woman in 1952. Reeves was ultimately executed in 1957.

Beginning in 1954, Parks began working as a seamstress for Clifford and Virginia Durr, a white couple. Politically liberal and opposed to segregation, the Durrs became her friends. They encouraged, and eventually helped sponsor, Parks to attend the Highlanender Folk School, an activist training center in Monteagle, Tennessee, in the summer of 1955. There, Parks was mentored by the veteran organizer Septima Clark. Parks later reflected that her experience at Highlander provided her with a vision of a unified, integrated society, marking the first time in her adult life that she witnessed &quot;people of all races and backgrounds&quot; interacting harmoniously. Later, in August 1955, she attended a Montgomery meeting concerning the lynching of Emmett Till. According to Theoharis, Parks was &quot;heartened by the attention that people managed to get to the [Till] case&quot;, since the custom was to &quot;keep things covered up&quot;.

==Arrest and bus boycott==
===Montgomery buses: law and prevailing customs===
Montgomery passed a city ordinance segregating bus passengers by race in 1900, before statewide segregation was implemented. Montgomery&#x27;s Black residents conducted boycotts against segregated streetcars between 1900 and 1902, coinciding with similar boycotts and protests in other southern cities. The boycotts resulted in an amendment to the city ordinance, which stipulated that &quot;no rider had to surrender a seat unless another was available&quot;. However, many drivers failed to follow the ordinance. Altercations between bus drivers and Black passengers were frequent. According to historian Cheryl Phibbs, &quot;bus drivers were given policeman-like authority to determine where racial divisions were enforced&quot;. They were also generally armed.

Black people constituted a majority of bus riders in Montgomery. According to the Women&#x27;s Political Council, a Montgomery-based advocacy group, &quot;three-fourths of the riders&quot; on Montgomery buses were Black. Despite this, the first ten rows on each Montgomery bus were reserved for white passengers, while the last ten rows were designated for Black passengers. Segregation in the middle rows was enforced at the driver&#x27;s discretion. While city ordinances did not require patrons to give up their seats, bus drivers frequently demanded Black passengers relinquish their seats to accommodate white riders. Furthermore, Black passengers were sometimes required to pay their fares at the front of the bus, then exit and re-board through the back door.

In 1943, bus driver James F. Blake confronted Parks when she tried to take her seat from the front of the bus, insisting that she re-board in the back. Parks refused, telling Blake that she was &quot;already on the bus and didn&#x27;t see the need of getting off and getting back on when people were standing in the stepwell&quot;. After Blake grasped her sleeve, Parks moved to the front of the bus, sitting in the one of the rows reserved for white passengers, where she dropped her purse. Blake told her to &quot;get off [his] bus&quot;, appearing poised to assault her. Parks admonished Blake, saying that he &quot;better not hit [her]&quot;. She then exited the bus without re-boarding. Following this encounter, she typically avoided riding on Blake&#x27;s bus.

===Refusal to move===
After working all day, Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines, around 6 pm, Thursday, December 1, 1955, in downtown Montgomery. She paid her fare and sat in an empty seat in the first row of back seats reserved for blacks in the &quot;colored&quot; section. Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers.

Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded. Blake noted that two or three white passengers were standing, as the front of the bus had filled to capacity.

The bus driver moved the &quot;colored&quot; section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, &quot;When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night.&quot;

By Parks&#x27;s account, Blake said, &quot;Y&#x27;all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats.&quot; Three of them complied. Parks said, &quot;The driver wanted us to stand up, the four of us. We didn&#x27;t move at the beginning, but he says, &#x27;Let me have these seats.&#x27; And the other three people moved, but I didn&#x27;t.&quot; The black man sitting next to her gave up his seat.

Parks moved, but toward the window seat; she did not get up to move to the redesignated colored section. Parks later said about being asked to move to the rear of the bus, &quot;I thought of Emmett Till—a 14-year-old African American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after being accused of offending a white woman in her family&#x27;s grocery store, whose killers were tried and acquitted—and I just couldn&#x27;t go back.&quot;

Blake said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stand up?&quot; Parks responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I should have to stand up.&quot; Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the incident for &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot;, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, &quot;When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up, and I said, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m not.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Well, if you don&#x27;t stand up, I&#x27;m going to have to call the police and have you arrested.&#x27; I said, &#x27;You may do that.

During a 1956 radio interview with Sydney Rogers in West Oakland several months after her arrest, Parks said she had decided, &quot;I would have to know for once and for all what rights I had as a human being and a citizen.&quot;

In her autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, she said:

When Parks refused to give up her seat, a police officer arrested her. As the officer took her away, she recalled that she asked, &quot;Why do you push us around?&quot; She remembered him saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but the law&#x27;s the law, and you&#x27;re under arrest.&quot; She later said, &quot;I only knew that, as I was being arrested, that it was the very last time that I would ever ride in humiliation of this kind. ... &quot;

Parks was charged with a violation of Chapter 6, Section 11, segregation law of the Montgomery City code, although technically she had not taken a white-only seat; she had been in a colored section. Edgar Nixon, president of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP and leader of the Pullman Porters Union, and her friend Clifford Durr bailed Parks out of jail that evening.

Parks did not originate the idea of protesting segregation with a bus sit-in. Those preceding her included Bayard Rustin in 1942, Irene Morgan in 1946, Lillie Mae Bradford in 1951, Sarah Louise Keys in 1952, and the members of the ultimately successful &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; 1956 lawsuit (Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith) who were arrested in Montgomery for not giving up their bus seats months before Parks.

===Montgomery bus boycott===

Nixon conferred with Jo Ann Robinson, an Alabama State College professor and member of the Women&#x27;s Political Council (WPC), about the Parks case. Robinson believed it important to seize the opportunity and stayed up all night mimeographing over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. The Women&#x27;s Political Council was the first group to officially endorse the boycott.

On Sunday, December 4, 1955, plans for the Montgomery bus boycott were announced at black churches in the area, and a front-page article in the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; helped spread the word. At a church rally that night, those attending agreed unanimously to continue the boycott until they were treated with the level of courtesy they expected, until black drivers were hired, and until seating in the middle of the bus was handled on a first-come basis.

The next day, Parks was tried on charges of disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. The trial lasted 30 minutes. After being found guilty and fined $10, plus $4 in court costs (a total of $161.11 as of March 12, 2024), Parks appealed her conviction and formally challenged the legality of racial segregation. In a 1992 interview with National Public Radio&#x27;s Lynn Neary, Parks recalled:

On the day of Parks&#x27;s trial—December 5, 1955—the WPC distributed the 35,000 leaflets. The handbill read,

We are ... asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial ... You can afford to stay out of school for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don&#x27;t ride the bus at all on Monday. Please stay off the buses Monday.

It rained that day, but the black community persevered in their boycott. Some rode in carpools, while others traveled in black-operated cabs that charged the same fare as the bus, 10 cents (). Most of the remainder of the 40,000 black commuters walked, some as far as .

That evening after the success of the one-day boycott, a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion AME Zion Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time, Parks was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; when she asked if she should say something, the reply was, &quot;Why, you&#x27;ve said enough.&quot; This movement also sparked riots leading up to the 1956 Sugar Bowl.

The group agreed that a new organization was needed to lead the boycott effort if it were to continue. Rev. Ralph Abernathy suggested the name &quot;Montgomery Improvement Association&quot; (MIA). The name was adopted, and the MIA was formed. Its members elected as their president Martin Luther King Jr., a relative newcomer to Montgomery, who was a young and mostly unknown minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.

That Monday night, 50 leaders of the African-American community gathered to discuss actions to respond to Parks&#x27;s arrest. Edgar Nixon, the president of the NAACP, said, &quot;My God, look what segregation has put in my hands!&quot; Parks was considered the ideal plaintiff for a test case against city and state segregation laws, as she was seen as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation. She was securely married and employed, was regarded as possessing a quiet and dignified demeanor, and was politically savvy. King said that Parks was regarded as &quot;one of the finest citizens of Montgomery—not one of the finest Negro citizens, but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery&quot;.

Parks&#x27;s court case was being slowed down in appeals through the Alabama courts on their way to a Federal appeal and the process could have taken years. Holding together a boycott for that length of time would have been a great strain. In the end, black residents of Montgomery continued the boycott for 381 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company&#x27;s finances, until the city repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; that it was unconstitutional. Parks was not included as a plaintiff in the Browder decision because the attorney Fred Gray concluded the courts would perceive they were attempting to circumvent her prosecution on her charges working their way through the Alabama state court system.

Parks played an important part in raising international awareness of the plight of African Americans and the civil rights struggle. King wrote in his 1958 book &quot;Stride Toward Freedom&quot; that Parks&#x27;s arrest was the catalyst rather than the cause of the protest: &quot;The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices.&quot; He wrote, &quot;Actually, no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, &#x27;I can take it no longer.&#x27;&quot;

==Detroit years==

===1960s===
After her arrest, Parks became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement but suffered hardships as a result. Due to economic sanctions used against activists, she lost her job at the department store. Her husband lost his job as a barber at Maxwell Air Force Base after his boss forbade him to talk about his wife or the legal case. Parks traveled and spoke about the issues.

In 1957, Raymond and Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Hampton, Virginia; mostly because she was unable to find work. She also disagreed with King and other leaders of Montgomery&#x27;s struggling civil rights movement about how to proceed, and was constantly receiving death threats. In Hampton, she found a job as a hostess in an inn at Hampton Institute, a historically Black college.

Later that year, at the urging of her brother and sister-in-law in Detroit, Sylvester and Daisy McCauley, Rosa and Raymond Parks and her mother moved north to join them. The City of Detroit attempted to cultivate a progressive reputation, but Parks encountered numerous signs of discrimination against African-Americans. Schools were effectively segregated, and services in Black neighborhoods substandard. In 1964, Parks told an interviewer that, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel a great deal of difference here ... Housing segregation is just as bad, and it seems more noticeable in the larger cities.&quot; She regularly participated in the movement for open and fair housing.

Parks rendered crucial assistance in the first campaign for Congress by John Conyers. She persuaded Martin Luther King, who was generally reluctant to endorse local candidates, to appear with Conyers, thereby boosting the novice candidate&#x27;s profile. When Conyers was elected, he hired her as a secretary and receptionist for his congressional office in Detroit. She held this position until she retired in 1988. In a telephone interview with CNN on October 24, 2005, Conyers recalled, &quot;You treated her with deference because she was so quiet, so serene—just a very special person ... There was only one Rosa Parks.&quot; Doing much of the daily constituent work for Conyers, Parks often focused on socio-economic issues including welfare, education, job discrimination, and affordable housing. She visited schools, hospitals, senior citizen facilities, and other community meetings and kept Conyers grounded in community concerns and activism.

Parks participated in activism nationally during the mid-1960s, traveling to support the Selma-to-Montgomery Marches, the Freedom Now Party, and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization. She also befriended Malcolm X, who she regarded as a personal hero.

Like many Detroit Blacks, Parks remained particularly concerned about housing issues. She herself lived in a neighborhood, Virginia Park, which had been compromised by highway construction and urban renewal. By 1962, these policies had destroyed 10,000 structures in Detroit, displacing 43,096 people, 70 percent of them African-American. Parks lived just a mile from the center of the riot that took place in Detroit in 1967, and she considered housing discrimination a major factor that provoked the disorder.

In the aftermath Parks collaborated with members of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers and the Republic of New Afrika in raising awareness of police abuse during the conflict. She served on a &quot;people&#x27;s tribunal&quot; on August 30, 1967, investigating the killing of three young men by police during the 1967 Detroit uprising, in what came to be known as the Algiers Motel incident. She also helped form the Virginia Park district council to help rebuild the area. The council facilitated the building of the only Black-owned shopping center in the country. Parks took part in the Black power movement, attending the Philadelphia Black Power conference, and the Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana. She also supported and visited the Black Panther school in Oakland.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Parks organized for the freedom of political prisoners in the United States, particularly cases involving issues of self-defense. She helped found the Detroit chapter of the Joanne Little Defense Committee, and also worked in support of the Wilmington 10, the RNA 11, and Gary Tyler. When Angela Davis was acquitted, Parks introduced her to an audience of 12,000 as a &quot;dear sister who has suffered so much persecution&quot;. Following national outcry around her case, Little succeeded in her defense that she used deadly force to resist sexual assault and was acquitted. Tyler was finally released in April 2016 after 41 years in prison.

The 1970s were a decade of loss for Parks in her personal life. Her family was plagued with illness; she and her husband had suffered stomach ulcers for years and both required hospitalization. In spite of her fame and constant speaking engagements, Parks was not a wealthy woman. She donated most of the money from speaking to civil rights causes, and lived on her staff salary and her husband&#x27;s pension. Medical bills and time missed from work caused financial strain that required her to accept assistance from church groups and admirers.

Her husband died of throat cancer on August 19, 1977, and her brother, her only sibling, died of cancer that November. Her personal ordeals caused her to become removed from the civil rights movement. She learned from a newspaper of the death of Fannie Lou Hamer, once a close friend. Parks suffered two broken bones in a fall on an icy sidewalk, an injury which caused considerable and recurring pain. She decided to move with her mother into an apartment for senior citizens. There she nursed her mother Leona through the final stages of cancer and geriatric dementia until she died in 1979 at the age of 92.

===1980s===
In 1980, Parks—widowed and without immediate family—rededicated herself to civil rights and educational organizations. She co-founded the Rosa L. Parks Scholarship Foundation for college-bound high school seniors, to which she donated most of her speaker fees. In February 1987, she co-founded, with Elaine Eason Steele, the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, an institute that runs the &quot;Pathways to Freedom&quot; bus tours which introduce young people to important civil rights and Underground Railroad sites throughout the country. Parks also served on the Board of Advocates of Planned Parenthood.

Though her health declined as she entered her seventies, Parks continued to make many appearances and devoted considerable energy to these causes. Unrelated to her activism, Parks loaned quilts of her own making to an exhibit at Michigan State University of quilts by African-American residents of Michigan.

===1990s===
In 1992, Parks published &quot;Rosa Parks: My Story&quot;, an autobiography aimed at younger readers, which recounts her life leading to her decision to keep her seat on the bus. A few years later, she published &quot;Quiet Strength&quot; (1995), her memoir, which focuses on her faith.

At age 81, Parks was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit on August 30, 1994. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper&#x27;s capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for facial injuries and swelling on the right side of her face. Parks said about the attack on her by the African-American man, &quot;Many gains have been made ... But as you can see, at this time we still have a long way to go.&quot; Skipper was sentenced to 8 to 15 years and was transferred to prison in another state for his own safety.

Suffering anxiety upon returning to her small central Detroit house following the ordeal, Parks moved into Riverfront Towers, a secure high-rise apartment building. Learning of Parks&#x27;s move, Little Caesars owner Mike Ilitch offered to pay for her housing expenses for as long as necessary.

In 1994, the Ku Klux Klan applied to sponsor a portion of United States Interstate 55 in St. Louis County and Jefferson County, Missouri, near St. Louis, for cleanup (which allowed them to have signs stating that this section of highway was maintained by the organization). Since the state could not refuse the KKK&#x27;s sponsorship, the Missouri legislature voted to name the highway section the &quot;Rosa Parks Highway&quot;. When asked how she felt about this honor, she is reported to have commented, &quot;It is always nice to be thought of.&quot;

In 1999, Parks filmed a cameo appearance for the television series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. It was her last appearance on screen; Parks began to suffer from health problems due to old age.

===2000s===
In 2002, Parks received an eviction notice from her $1,800 per month () apartment for non-payment of rent. Parks was incapable of managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was highly publicized in 2004, executives of the ownership company announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent-free in the building for the remainder of her life. Elaine Steele, manager of the nonprofit Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, defended Parks&#x27;s care and stated that the eviction notices were sent in error. Several of Parks&#x27;s family members alleged that her financial affairs had been mismanaged.

In 2016, Parks&#x27;s former residence in Detroit was threatened with demolition. A Berlin-based American artist, Ryan Mendoza, arranged to have the house disassembled, moved to his garden in Germany, and partly restored. It served as a museum honoring Rosa Parks. In 2018, the house was moved back to the United States. Brown University was planning to exhibit the house, but the display was cancelled. The house was exhibited during part of 2018 in an arts centre in Providence, Rhode Island.

==Death and funeral==
Parks died of natural causes on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92, in her apartment on the east side of Detroit. She and her husband never had children and she outlived her only sibling. She was survived by her sister-in-law (Raymond&#x27;s sister), 13 nieces and nephews and their families, and several cousins, most of them residents of Michigan or Alabama.
City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral. Parks&#x27; coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, where she lay in repose at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess. A memorial service was held there the following morning. One of the speakers, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said that if it had not been for Parks, she would probably have never become the Secretary of State. In the evening the casket was transported to Washington, D.C., and transported by a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest, to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol.

Parks was the 31st person, the first American who had not been a U.S. government official, and the second private person (after the French planner Pierre L&#x27;Enfant) to be honored in this way. She was the first woman and the second black person to lie in honor in the Capitol. An estimated 50,000 people viewed the casket there, and the event was broadcast on television on October 31, 2005. A memorial service was held that afternoon at Metropolitan AME Church in Washington, D.C.

With her body and casket returned to Detroit, for two days, Parks lay in repose at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Her funeral service was seven hours long and was held on November 2, 2005, at the Greater Grace Temple Church in Detroit. After the service, an honor guard from the Michigan National Guard draped the U.S. flag over the casket and carried it to a horse-drawn hearse, which was intended to carry it, in daylight, to the cemetery. As the hearse passed the thousands of people who were viewing the procession, many clapped, cheered loudly and released white balloons. Parks was interred between her husband and mother at Detroit&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery in the chapel&#x27;s mausoleum. The chapel was renamed the Rosa L. Parks Freedom Chapel in her honor.

==In popular culture==
===Film and television===
The documentary &quot;Mighty Times: The Legacy of Rosa Parks&quot; (2001) received a 2002 nomination for Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject. &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; (2002) starred Angela Bassett; film scholar Delphine Letort argued that in the work, &quot;the historical narrative of the civil rights movement is simplified into a story that reproduces stereotypes popularized by both race melodramas and mainstream media.&quot; The film &quot;Barbershop&quot; (2002) featured a barber, played by Cedric the Entertainer, arguing with others that other African Americans before Parks had been active in bus integration, but she was renowned as an NAACP secretary. The activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton launched a boycott against the film, contending it was &quot;disrespectful&quot;, but NAACP president Kweisi Mfume stated he thought the controversy was &quot;overblown&quot;. Parks was offended and boycotted the NAACP 2003 Image Awards ceremony, which Cedric hosted.

In 2013, Parks was portrayed by Llewella Gideon in the first series of the Sky Arts comedy series &quot;Psychobitches.&quot; The 2018 episode &quot;Rosa&quot;, of the science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, centers on Rosa Parks, as portrayed by Vinette Robinson. The UK children&#x27;s historical show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; included a song about Parks in its fifth series.

In 2022, the documentary &quot;The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks&quot; was released on Peacock; it is the first full-length documentary about Parks. Also that year, a major motion film &quot;Bowl Game Armageddon&quot; was announced, which will spotlight Rosa Parks and Emmett Till leading up to the 1956 Sugar Bowl and Atlanta riots

===Music===
In March 1999, Parks filed a lawsuit (&quot;Rosa Parks v. LaFace Records&quot;) against American hip-hop duo OutKast and their record company, claiming that the duo&#x27;s song &quot;Rosa Parks&quot;, the most successful radio single of their 1998 album &quot;Aquemini&quot;, had used her name without permission. The lawsuit was settled on April 15, 2005 (six months and nine days before Parks&#x27;s death); OutKast, their producer and record labels paid Parks an undisclosed cash settlement. They also agreed to work with the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute to create educational programs about the life of Rosa Parks. The record label and OutKast admitted no wrongdoing. Responsibility for the payment of legal fees was not disclosed.

In 2020, rapper Nicki Minaj incorporated Rosa Parks into her song &quot;Yikes&quot; where she rapped, &quot;All you bitches Rosa Park, uh-oh, get your ass up&quot; in reference to the Montgomery bus boycott.

===Other===
In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Parks&#x27;s name and picture. She is card No. 27 in the set. In 2019, Mattel released a Barbie doll in Parks&#x27;s likeness as part of their &quot;Inspiring Women&quot; series.

<doc id="26459" wikidata="Q7335034" url="?curid=26459" title="Ringworld (role-playing game)">
<text>The Ringworld science fiction role-playing game was published by Chaosium in 1984, using the Basic Role-Playing system for its rules and Larry Niven&#x27;s &quot;Ringworld&quot; novels as a setting.

==Setting==
The setting is a distant future based on extrapolation of as much hard science as Niven had available. Specifically, it&#x27;s the 29th century. &quot;Known Space&quot; (also the commonly used title for Larry Niven&#x27;s future history science fiction series) is about 80 light years in diameter with 10,000 stars, including Human Space (40 light years diameter, 524 stars in 357 systems, 30 billion humans, ⅔ on Earth), as well as neighbouring Alien civilisations. Important Alien civilisations include the Puppeteers, paranoid pacifist herbivore centaurs, and the Kzinti, carnivorous warlike felines, who fought multiple wars over hundreds of years against the Humans, being defeated each time. Human allies include intelligent dolphins and orcas.

&quot;Known Space&quot; only serves as a background for the game. The game is intended to be set on the Ringworld itself, an enormous single world discovered at the far reaches of Known Space, a ring around a sun at approximately the orbit of the Earth. It is 997,000 miles wide, about 125 Earth-diameters. The total inner surface of the ring is equal to that of 3 million Earths. The ring is spun at a speed to provide 0.992G of gravity on the innerside, while 20 giant shadow squares at about the orbit of Mercury occlude the Sun to provide night. It was constructed by the Pak Protectors, now mostly extinct, who had a common origin with humans. The Ringworld is home to some 30 trillion sentient inhabitants from up to 2000 hominid species. The world is described in a series of novels by Niven, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;, and, after the game&#x27;s publication, &quot;The Ringworld Throne&quot; and &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot;.

Information from the RPG, along with notes composed by RPG author Hewitt with Niven, were later used to form the &quot;Bible&quot; given to authors writing in the &quot;Man-Kzin Wars&quot; series. Niven himself recommended that Hewitt write one of the stories for the original two MKW books, although this never came to pass.

==Gameplay==
The players initially play explorers from Known Space, sent as scouts to the Ringworld. They can be anthropologists, artists, doctors, police, or even zealots, who will explore the mysteries of this huge artificial world and its inhabitants. Basic characters can be humans from a dozen planets of Human Space, Puppeteers, or Kzin. Later play can see characters from Ringworld species, such as the (so-called) Ghouls, Vampires, Giants, Sea People, and others.

This Ringworld focus has been a criticism of the game. The &quot;Ringworld&quot; role-playing game is not a &#x27;full&#x27; science fiction RPG, like &quot;Traveller&quot;, including, for example, rules for starship construction, space combat, travel to different planets and systems, and so forth. Instead, the game and rules focused on parties of characters exploring the Ringworld itself, and, despite its vast size (with a surface area larger than that of all of Known Space&#x27;s inhabited planets put together), many who bought the game felt limited by this one world setting.

==Game system==
A character is initially defined by his species or world of origin, which affects characteristics (for example, by determining the gravity to which it is accustomed). Then the players roll randomly for a certain number of defects, character age, and characteristics. The system used is Chaosium&#x27;s Basic Role-Playing, with eight basic characteristics: Strength, Constitution, Mass (equivalent to Size in other BRP games), Intelligence, Power, Dexterity, Appearance and Education determining secondary attributes such damage modifiers, hit points, and skill rolls.

At creation, each character gets to spend a number of points (based mainly on age, Education, and Intelligence) on skills determined by interests or career choice. Each of the three playable races has specific tables for the creation of characters. Character Skills are based on percentages. To succeed in a skill, the player must roll under the relevant skill with modifiers on percentile dice. 

Another critique of the game system has been the large effect of character age on skills, usually considered the most important character attributes. In Niven&#x27;s future world, the deterioration of age has been largely reversed, so humans live hundreds of years. Therefore, a 200-year-old character will have vastly more skill points than a 20-year-old, with little compensatory advantages for the younger one.

==Publications==
Only two publications were published, the &quot;Ringworld&quot; role-playing game box set itself, and the &quot;Ringworld Companion&quot;, both in 1984 by Chaosium. The magazine &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, issue 37, featured a &quot;Ringworld&quot; adventure, &quot;Louis Wu &amp; His Motley Crew.&quot; The article &quot;The Dolphins of Known Space: A new race for the Ringworld Game&quot; appeared in &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; issue 95.

===&quot;Ringworld&quot; Box Set===
The &quot;Ringworld&quot; role-playing game box set was titled &quot;Larry Niven&#x27;s Ringworld: Roleplaying Adventure Beneath the Great Arch&quot;, referring to the way the Ringworld looked from its interior surface. The authors are credited as Greg Stafford, John Hewitt, Sherman Kahn, Lynn Willis, Sandy Petersen, Rudy Kraft, Charlie Krank, Ed Gore, and Jeff Okamoto. It came in a box set with four books: the Explorer Book, Technology Book, Gamemasters Book, and Creatures Book, a sheet of cardboard miniatures, reference and character sheets, and a set of dice: 2d20 (actually dice with two sets of digits 0 to 9), 1d8, and 2d6.

====Explorer Book====
This book begins with a character sheet. It introduces role-playing games, then covers character creation, skill use, and combat. It presents a detailed history of humanity between the 20th and 29th centuries. It then describes eleven human worlds: Belt (the asteroid belt), Canyon, Down, Gummidgy, Home, Jinx, Margrave, Plateau, Silvereyes, &quot;We Made It&quot; and Wunderland. Finally, it gives rules for non-human, Kzin or Puppeteer, player characters, and a glossary.

====Gamemaster Book====
The Gamemaster Book begins with technical essays on the Ringworld, from physical construction, to life on the ring, with diagrams. There is a section on the &quot;City Builders&quot;—a Ringworld race that dominated the Ringworld, built floating cities, and sent spaceships to explore other worlds, until a mysterious technological virus destroyed their empire. Another section lists unanswered questions about the Ringworld. There are suggestions for creating scenarios and campaigns, and information on technology of various humanoid species of the Ringworld, and additional rules, including gravity, Credit Rating, and psionics. There is also an introductory scenario (&quot;The Journey of the Catseye&quot;) intended to begin a Ringworld campaign. The characters are hired by Captain Gregor Lopez, famous explorer, for a journey to the Ringworld that does not go completely as planned.

====Technology Book====
The Technology Book gives rules and descriptions of the equipment employed by the explorers of the 29th century, categorized into generators, computers, medical equipment, tools, vehicles, weapons and defenses.

====Creature Book====
The Creature Book gives rules and descriptions for creatures, divided into Aliens, Humanoids, Animals and Plants. Many races get specialized hit location tables, characteristic maxima and minima, skills and traits.

===&quot;Ringworld Companion&quot;===

This supplement was published not long after the box set. The authors are credited as Greg Stafford, John Hewitt, Sherman Kahn, Lynn Willis, Sandy Petersen, Rudy Kraft, and Charlie Krank.

The book starts with a diagram of the Ringworld and its star, EC-1752, new humanoids, aliens, plants and animals, technological objects, and original errata. There is some information on spaceships (Human and City Builder), hyperspace, a map of Human Space, and statistics for vehicles used on the Ringworld. Then there is a new race, the &quot;Agamans&quot;, desert nomads, and a scenario involving them, &quot;The Sand Eaters&quot;. Finally, there is a three part scenario named &quot;The Kaladians&quot;, about the defense of travelling merchants. Both scenarios can be integrated into the campaign given in the basic set. None of these three additional races appear in any of the &quot;Ringworld&quot; novels.

==Reception==
Phil Masters reviewed &quot;Ringworld&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #59, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that &quot;This game takes a superb background idea, applies a good system of mechanics to it, and comes back with a disappointing result.&quot;

Steve Peterson reviewed &quot;Ringworld&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 71. Peterson commented that &quot;Niven fans should buy it for the essays and background materials. Role-players should be prepared to do some work on scenarios; but if you do, you&#x27;ll have some terrific roleplaying in a beautifully detailed world. Science-fiction gamers who want to use it for source material probably won&#x27;t get their money&#x27;s worth.&quot;

In Issue 4 of the French games magazine &quot;Casus Belli &quot;, Jean Balcezak commented, &quot;Without being extremely complex, this game is nevertheless aimed at experienced players eager to discover new settings.&quot; Balcezak was quite taken with the game, writing, &quot;&quot;Ringworld&quot; is set to become a &#x27;must&#x27; that every serious role player should have in their game library.&quot;

Steve Nutt reviewed &quot;Ringworld&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Altogether, Ringworld&#x27;s advantages and disadvantages stem from its campaign setting. The actual mechanics of the game are top quality, yet background and atmosphere are what make or break a campaign, and in Ringworld this aspect could be somewhat daunting to the uninitiated.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this &quot;a terrific setting, but only a so-so game.&quot; Swan felt &quot;Though the game systems are adequate, they&#x27;re nothing out of the ordinary.&quot; Swan also pointed out that although there was a lot of background material, &quot;there&#x27;s not much help of any kind for the &quot;Ringworld&quot; referee; not only does he have his hands full managing a planet roughly the size of 3 million Earths, the game presumes he has a basic understanding of physics, embryology, and other sciences. And unless he is familiar with the original novel, it&#x27;s unlikely that the referee will have a clue as to how to stage an adventure.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4.

James Davis Nicoll in 2020 for &quot;Black Gate&quot; said &quot;Production values were very high, as was the price [...] Yes, that&#x27;s a Ralph McQuarrie cover. &quot;LNRW: RABtGA&quot; was also doomed, because scarcely had the game come out before Niven made a lucrative media deal and yanked the rights back from Chaosium. &quot;LNRW: RABtGA&quot; is very much out of print.&quot;

<text>Risus: The Anything RPG is a rules-light generic role-playing game (RPG) written, designed and illustrated by S. John Ross of Cumberland Games &amp; Diversions. &quot;Risus&quot; is available free on the web. It was first published online in 1993. Earlier versions of the game were titled GUCS: The Generic Universal Comedy System (a parody of &quot;GURPS&quot;) and were distributed privately beginning in 1989.

== History ==
&quot;Risus&quot; (Latin for “laughter”) is a comedy game (often described by its creator as a &quot;joke game&quot;) and uses a cliché (character class) system inspired by the broad &quot;career scale&quot; skills in Greg Gorden&#x27;s &quot;DC Heroes RPG&quot; (Mayfair Games), and later influenced by Atlas Games&#x27; &quot;Over the Edge&quot;. The core systems of &quot;Risus&quot; owe their largest debt to the &quot;Ghostbusters RPG&quot; published by West End Games, and to &quot;Tunnels and Trolls&quot; by Ken St. Andre. The game itself also cites &quot;GURPS&quot; as an influence, along with &quot;FUDGE&quot;, another free RPG released to the web a year earlier. Several more recent games have been, in turn, influenced by &quot;Risus.&quot;

Despite the game&#x27;s small size and admittedly joking nature, there are more than 30 fan-authored websites devoted to &quot;Risus,&quot; some including several rules variants, simple worldbooks, and wholly rewritten adaptations of the game. &quot;Risus&quot; itself has been translated into Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. In December, 2003, Cumberland Games began to support the free game with commercial supplements, beginning with the &quot;Risus Companion&quot; and the founding of the International Order of Risus. An example of another commercial product is &quot;A Kringle in Time&quot;, &quot;an adventure about saving Christmas from ancient evil.&quot;

&quot;New Risus&quot; won the 2001 inaugural RPGnet award for &quot;Best Free RPG&quot;.

==&quot;Risus Companion&quot;==

&quot;The Risus Companion&quot; is the first commercial supplement of &quot;Risus&quot;. S. John Ross wrote and published the &quot;Risus Companion&quot; on the 10th anniversary of &quot;Risus&quot; on the World Wide Web, in order to provide a foundation for &quot;Risus&quot; as a commercial venture. &quot;Risus&quot; itself remains free of charge, allowing &quot;Risus&quot; fans the option to support &quot;Risus&quot; if they choose and be materially rewarded for doing so.

In a review of &quot;Risus&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Ryan Harvey said &quot;I can enthusiastically recommend &quot;Risus&quot; to anybody with an imagination, regardless of his or her experience with those funny-sided dice. Not only are the rules so slim that they fit onto six pages (with two dedicated to optional rules), but the system runs entirely on clichés that any one who has seen a movie, read a book, or gotten around more than St. Symeon the Stylite, will recognize and know how to act out.&quot;

<text>Rigel is a blue supergiant star in the constellation of Orion. It has the Bayer designation β Orionis, which is Latinized to Beta Orionis and abbreviated Beta Ori or β Ori. Rigel is the brightest and most massive componentand the eponymof a star system of at least four stars that appear as a single blue-white point of light to the naked eye. This system is located at a distance of approximately .

A star of spectral type B8Ia, Rigel is calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times as massive, depending on the method and assumptions used. Its radius is more than seventy times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is . Due to its stellar wind, Rigel&#x27;s mass-loss is estimated to be ten million times that of the Sun. With an estimated age of seven to nine million years, Rigel has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded, and cooled to become a supergiant. It is expected to end its life as a typeII supernova, leaving a neutron star or a black hole as a final remnant, depending on the initial mass of the star.

Rigel varies slightly in brightness, its apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable due to the amplitude and periodicity of its brightness variation, as well as its spectral type. Its intrinsic variability is caused by pulsations in its unstable atmosphere. Rigel is generally the seventh-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by Betelgeuse, which varies over a larger range.

A triple-star system is separated from Rigel by an angle of . It has an apparent magnitude of 6.7, making it 1/400th as bright as Rigel. Two stars in the system can be seen by large telescopes, and the brighter of the two is a spectroscopic binary. These three stars are all blue-white main-sequence stars, each three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel and the triple system orbit a common center of gravity with a period estimated to be 24,000 years. The inner stars of the triple system orbit each other every 10 days, and the outer star orbits the inner pair every 63 years. A much fainter star, separated from Rigel and the others by nearly an arc minute, may be part of the same star system.

== Nomenclature ==
In 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) included the name &quot;Rigel&quot; in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. The system is listed variously in historical astronomical catalogs as HII33, Σ668, β555, or ADS3823. For simplicity, Rigel&#x27;s companions are referred to as Rigel B, C, and D; the IAU describes such names as &quot;useful nicknames&quot; that are &quot;unofficial&quot;. In modern comprehensive catalogs, the whole multiple star system is known as WDS 05145-0812 or CCDM 05145–0812.

The designation of Rigel as β Orionis (Latinized to Beta Orionis) was made by Johann Bayer in 1603. The &quot;beta&quot; designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than α Orionis (Betelgeuse). Astronomer James B. Kaler has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated &quot;alpha&quot; and Rigel designated &quot;beta&quot;. Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness, instead grouping them by magnitude. Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south. Rigel is included in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, but since it already has a Bayer designation it has no separate variable star designation.

Rigel has many other stellar designations taken from various catalogs, including the Flamsteed designation 19Orionis (19 Ori), the Bright Star Catalogue entry HR1713, and the Henry Draper Catalogue number HD34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature, but rarely in popular writing.

== Observation ==

Rigel is an intrinsic variable star with an apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is typically the seventh-brightest star in the celestial sphere, excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse. It is fainter than Capella, which may also vary slightly in brightness. Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a B-V color index of −0.06. It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.

Culminating every year at midnight on 12 December, and at 9:00pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere and on summer evenings in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises. Correspondingly, it is also the first star of Orion to set in most of the Northern Hemisphere. The star is a vertex of the &quot;Winter Hexagon&quot;, an asterism that includes Aldebaran, Capella, Pollux, Procyon, and Sirius. Rigel is a prominent equatorial navigation star, being easily located and readily visible in all the world&#x27;s oceans (the exception is the area north of the 82nd parallel north).

=== Spectroscopy ===

Rigel&#x27;s spectral type is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants. The overall spectrum is typical for a late B class star, with strong absorption lines of the hydrogen Balmer series as well as neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium. The luminosity class for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the bright supergiant class Ia. Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.

As early as 1888, the heliocentric radial velocity of Rigel, as estimated from the Doppler shifts of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days. The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about around a mean of .

In 1933, the Hα line in Rigel&#x27;s spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow emission spike about to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line. This is now known as a P Cygni profile after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with mass loss where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.

The unusual Hα line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. It is a normal absorption line around a third of the time. About a quarter of the time, it is a double-peaked line, that is, an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time, the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission Hα line. The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large looping structures arising from the photosphere and driven by magnetic fields.

=== Variability ===

Rigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel&#x27;s brightness variation requires photoelectric or CCD photometry to be reliably detected. This brightness variation has no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel&#x27;s color index varies slightly, but this is not significantly correlated with its brightness variations.

From analysis of &quot;Hipparcos&quot; satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the Alpha Cygni class of variable stars, defined as &quot;non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep–AepIa spectral types&quot;. In those spectral types, the &#x27;e&#x27; indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the &#x27;p&#x27; means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular or have quasi-periods. Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry, which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days. Rigel was observed with the Canadian MOST satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.
=== Mass loss ===

From observations of the variable Hα spectral line, Rigel&#x27;s mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be solar masses per year (/yr)—about ten million times more than the mass-loss rate from the Sun. More detailed optical and Kband infrared spectroscopic observations, together with VLTI interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the Hα and Hγ line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel&#x27;s stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the Hγ line give in 2006-7 and in 2009–10. Calculations using the Hα line give lower results, around . The terminal wind velocity is . It is estimated that Rigel has lost about three solar masses () since beginning life as a star of seven to nine million years ago.

== Distance ==
Rigel&#x27;s distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, different estimates being obtained by different methods. Old estimates placed it 166 parsecs (or 541 light years) away from the Sun. The 2007 Hipparcos new reduction of Rigel&#x27;s parallax is , giving a distance of with a margin of error of about 9%. Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a Gaia Data Release 3 parallax of , suggesting a distance around . However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.

Indirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of nebulosity, its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5°-long IC 2118 (Witch Head Nebula), located at an angular separation of 2.5° from the star, or a projected distance of away. From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC2118&#x27;s distance is estimated to be .

Rigel is an outlying member of the Orion OB1 association, which is located at a distance of up to from Earth. It is a member of the loosely defined Taurus-Orion R1 Association, somewhat closer at . Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the Orion Nebula. Betelgeuse and Saiph lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a runaway star with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.

== Stellar system ==



Hierarchical scheme for Rigel&#x27;s components

The star system of which Rigel is a part has at least four components. Rigel (sometimes called Rigel A to distinguish from the other components) has a visual companion, which is likely a close triple-star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might be a fifth component of the Rigel system.

William Herschel discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the &quot;second class of double stars&quot; in his Catalogue of Double Stars, usually abbreviated to HII33, or as H233 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue. Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as Σ 668. The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or β Orionis B. The angular separation of Rigel B from Rigel A is 9.5 arc seconds to its south along position angle 204°. Although not particularly faint at visual magnitude 6.7, the overall difference in brightness from Rigel A (about 6.6 magnitudes or 440 times fainter) makes it a challenging target for telescope apertures smaller than .

At Rigel&#x27;s estimated distance, Rigel B&#x27;s projected separation from Rigel A is over 2,200astronomical units (AU). Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar common proper motion. The pair would have an estimated orbital period of 24,000years. Gaia Data Release 2(DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about , further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.

In 1871, Sherburne Wesley Burnham suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components. This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than to around . In 2009, speckle interferometry showed the two almost identical components separated by , with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6, respectively. Their estimated orbital period is 63years. Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as β555 in his double star catalog or BU555 in modern use.

Component B is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system, which shows two sets of spectral lines combined within its single stellar spectrum. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple-star system, although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum, which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.

In 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of β555, although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment. Its 2017 separation from Rigel was , almost due north at a position angle of 1°. Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star at approximately the same distance as Rigel. Likely a K-type main-sequence star, this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.

A spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.

== Physical characteristics ==
Rigel is a blue supergiant that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the main sequence across the upper part of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. When it was on the main sequence, its effective temperature would have been around . Rigel&#x27;s complex variability at visual wavelengths is caused by stellar pulsations similar to those of Deneb. Further observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.

Estimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical stellar evolution models. Its effective temperature can be estimated from the spectral type and color to be around . A mass of at an age of million years has been estimated by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modeling from the spectrum gives a mass of .

Although Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun, its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of , the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun (), but another recently published distance of suggests an even higher luminosity of . Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel&#x27;s atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between and , while summing the spectral energy distribution from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as . A 2018 study using the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer measured the angular diameter as . After correcting for limb darkening, the angular diameter is found to be , yielding a radius of . An older measurement of the angular diameter gives , equivalent to a radius of at . These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of ; adopting a distance of leads to a significantly larger size. Older distance estimates were mostly far lower than modern estimates, leading to lower radius estimates; a 1922 estimate by John Stanley Plaskett gave Rigel a diameter of 25 million miles, or approximately , smaller than its neighbor Aldebaran.

Due to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot B-type main-sequence stars that are three to four times as massive as the Sun.

== Evolution ==

Stellar evolution models suggest the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a red supergiant phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant. This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.

Rigel is likely to be fusing helium in its core. Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now. The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modeled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the Ledoux Criteria.

Rigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II supernova. It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth, and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets). The supernova would leave behind either a black hole or a neutron star.

== Etymology and cultural significance ==
The earliest known recording of the name &quot;Rigel&quot; is in the &quot;Alfonsine tables&quot; of 1521. It is derived from the Arabic name &#x27;, &quot;the left leg (foot) of Jauzah&quot; (i.e. &quot;rijl&quot; meaning &quot;leg, foot&quot;), which can be traced to the 10th century. &quot;Jauzah&quot; was a proper name for Orion; an alternative Arabic name was &#x27;, &quot;the foot of the great one&quot;, from which stems the rarely used variant names &quot;Algebar&quot; or &quot;Elgebar&quot;. The &quot;Alphonsine tables&quot; saw its name split into &quot;Rigel&quot; and &quot;Algebar&quot;, with the note, &quot;et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.&quot; Alternate spellings from the 17th century include &quot;Regel&quot; by Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli, &quot;Riglon&quot; by German astronomer Wilhelm Schickard, and &quot;Rigel Algeuze&quot; or &quot;Algibbar&quot; by English scholar Edmund Chilmead.

With the constellation representing the mythological Greek huntsman Orion, Rigel is his knee or (as its name suggests) foot; with the nearby star Beta Eridani marking Orion&#x27;s footstool. Rigel is presumably the star known as &quot;Aurvandil&#x27;s toe&quot; in Norse mythology. In the Caribbean, Rigel represented the severed leg of the folkloric figure &quot;Trois Rois&quot;, himself represented by the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt. The leg had been severed with a cutlass by the maiden &quot;Bįhi&quot; (Sirius). The Lacandon people of southern Mexico knew it as &quot;tunsel&quot; (&quot;little woodpecker&quot;).

Rigel was known as &quot;Yerrerdet-kurrk&quot; to the Wotjobaluk koori of southeastern Australia, and held to be the mother-in-law of &quot;Totyerguil&quot; (Altair). The distance between them signified the taboo preventing a man from approaching his mother-in-law. The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria named Rigel as &quot;Collowgullouric Warepil&quot;. The Wardaman people of northern Australia know Rigel as the Red Kangaroo Leader &quot;Unumburrgu&quot; and chief conductor of ceremonies in a songline when Orion is high in the sky. Eridanus, the river, marks a line of stars in the sky leading to it, and the other stars of Orion are his ceremonial tools and entourage. Betelgeuse is &quot;Ya-jungin&quot; &quot;Owl Eyes Flicking&quot;, watching the ceremonies.

The Māori people of New Zealand named Rigel as &quot;Puanga&quot;, said to be a daughter of &quot;Rehua&quot; (Antares), the chief of all-stars. Its heliacal rising presages the appearance of &quot;Matariki&quot; (the Pleiades) in the dawn sky, marking the Māori New Year in late May or early June. The Moriori people of the Chatham Islands, as well as some Maori groups in New Zealand, mark the start of their New Year with Rigel rather than the Pleiades. &quot;Puaka&quot; is a southern name variant used in the South Island.

In Japan, the Minamoto or Genji clan chose Rigel and its white color as its symbol, calling the star &quot;Genji-boshi&quot; (), while the Taira or Heike clan adopted Betelgeuse and its red color. The two powerful families fought the Genpei War; the stars were seen as facing off against each other and kept apart only by the three stars of Orion&#x27;s Belt.

== In modern culture ==

The MS &quot;Rigel&quot; was originally a Norwegian ship, built in Copenhagen in 1924. It was requisitioned by the Germans during World War II and sunk in 1944 while being used to transport prisoners of war. Two US Navy ships have borne the name USS &quot;Rigel&quot;. The SSM-N-6 Rigel was a cruise missile program for the US Navy that was cancelled in 1953 before reaching deployment.

The Rigel Skerries are a chain of small islands in Antarctica, renamed after originally being called Utskjera. They were given their current name as Rigel was used as an astrofix. Mount Rigel, elevation , is also in Antarctica.

<doc id="26464" wikidata="Q10952572" url="?curid=26464" title="Afghan Civil War (1928–1929)">
<text>The Afghan Civil War of 1928–1929 was fought from 14 November 1928 to 13 October 1929. Rebelling, and subsequently governing Saqqawist (&quot;Saqāwīhā&quot;) forces under Habibullāh Kalakāni fought against various opposing tribes and rival monarchs in the Kingdom of Afghanistan, among whom Mohammed Nādir Khān eventually achieved a preponderant role. Despite early successes, such as the capture of Kabul and defeat of Amanullah Khan on 17 January 1929 or the capture of Kandahar on 3 June, the Saqqawists were eventually deposed by anti-Saqqawist forces led by Nadir on 13 October 1929, leading to Nadir&#x27;s ascension as King of Afghanistan. He ruled until his assassination on 3 November 1933.

The war began when the Shinwari tribe revolted in Jalalabad and drew up a manifesto of 10 grievances, 5 of which related to Amanullah&#x27;s meddling with the status of women. Although this revolt was quelled by a force led by Ali Ahmad Khan, a concurrent Saqqawist uprising in the north managed to capture the besieged city of Jabal al-Siraj, before attacking Kabul on 14 December 1928. Although the first Saqqawist assault on Kabul was repulsed, the second Saqqawist assault succeeded at capturing Kabul on 17 January 1929. The government at that time was focused on social reforms, such as the expansion of women&#x27;s rights and the adoption of a military draft, which had earlier led to the unsuccessful Alizai rebellion and Khost rebellion. Kalakani denounced his opponents as kuffar, while his forces committed acts of rape and looting.

After capturing Kabul, the Saqqawists defeated a rival government in Jalalabad led by Ali Ahmad Khan on 9 February. Despite a setback in the Battle of Shaykhabad in early March, the Saqqawists managed to extend their control to Kandahar in June after a short siege. However, they were unable to defeat Nadir Khan in the Logar valley, who had entered the area together with Amanullah in March, although the latter left the country on 23 May. After a months-long stalemate, Nadir Khan eventually managed to force the Saqqawists to retreat into Kabul in October 1929, and subsequently into the Arg. The capture of the Arg on 13 October 1929 marked the end of the civil war, although Saqqawist activity continued until 1931, with the fall of their final holdout, Herat. The civil war was fought concurrently with a Soviet operation in northern Afghanistan to fight the Basmachi movement.

Both sides suffered around 7500 combat deaths during the civil war. During the anti-Saqqawist capture of Kabul, Nadir&#x27;s forces sacked the city against his orders. After the civil war, Nadir did not cede control of the Afghan throne back to Amanullah, and this led to several rebellions, including the Shinwari rebellion, the Kuhistan rebellion, the Ghilzai rebellion, and Mazrak&#x27;s revolt. During World War II, Amanullah would unsuccessfully try to regain the throne with Axis help.

==Background==
Amānullāh Khān reigned in Afghanistan from 1919, achieving full independence from the British Empire shortly afterwards. Before the Treaty of Rawalpindi was concluded in 1921, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy, including diplomatic relations with the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries.

The second round of Anglo–Afghan negotiations for final peace were inconclusive. Both sides were prepared to agree on Afghan independence in foreign affairs, as provided for in the previous agreement. The two nations disagreed, however, on the issue that had plagued Anglo-Afghan relations for decades and would continue to cause friction for many more — authority over Pashtun tribes on both sides of the Durand Line. The British refused to concede Afghan control over the tribes on the British side of the line while the Afghans insisted on it. The Afghans regarded the 1921 agreement as only an informal one.

The rivalry of the great powers in the region might have remained subdued had it not been for the dramatic change in government in Moscow brought about by the Russian Revolution of 1917. In their efforts to placate Muslims within their borders, the new Soviet leaders were eager to establish cordial relations with neighboring Muslim states. In the case of Afghanistan, the Soviets could achieve a dual purpose: by strengthening relations with the leadership in Kabul, they could also threaten Britain, which was one of the Western states supporting counter-revolution in the Soviet Union. In his attempts to end British control of Afghan foreign policy, Amanullah sent an emissary to Moscow in 1919; Vladimir Lenin received the envoy warmly and responded by sending a Soviet representative to Kabul to offer aid to Amānullāh&#x27;s government.

Throughout Amānullāh&#x27;s reign, Soviet-Afghan relations fluctuated according to Afghanistan&#x27;s value to the Soviet leadership at a given time; Afghanistan was either viewed as a tool for dealing with Soviet Muslim minorities or for threatening the British. Whereas the Soviets sought Amanullah&#x27;s assistance in suppressing anti-Bolshevik elements in Central Asia in return for help against the British, the Afghans were more interested in regaining lands across the Amu Darya lost to Russia in the nineteenth century. Afghan attempts to regain the oases of Merv and Panjdeh were easily subdued by the Soviet Red Army.

In May 1921, the Afghans and the Soviets signed a Treaty of Friendship, Afghanistan&#x27;s first international agreement since gaining full independence in 1919. The Soviets provided Amanullah with aid in the form of cash, technology and military equipment. Despite this, Amanullah grew increasingly disillusioned with the Soviets, especially as he witnessed the widening oppression of his fellow Muslims across the border.

Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fear of an Afghan-Soviet friendship, especially with the introduction of a few Soviet planes into Afghanistan. British unease increased when Amanullah maintained contacts with Indian nationalists and gave them asylum in Kabul, and also when he sought to stir up unrest among the Pashtun tribes across the border. The British responded by refusing to address Amanullah as &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; and imposing restrictions on the transit of goods through India.

Amānullāh&#x27;s domestic reforms were no less dramatic than his foreign policy initiatives, but those reforms could not match his achievement of complete, lasting independence. Mahmud Tarzi, Amanullah&#x27;s father-in-law and Foreign Minister, encouraged the monarch&#x27;s interest in social and political reform but urged that it be gradually built upon the basis of a strong central government, as had occurred in Turkey under Kemal Atatürk. Socially, Amanullah enjoyed many of Mahmud Tarzi&#x27;s thoughts at the time, such as giving women more rights and allowing freedom of press through publishing. Tarzi, being heavily influenced by the West, brought this influence to Afghanistan – Amanullah enjoyed Western dress and etiquette. His wife, Queen Soraya Tarzi, became the face of Amanullah Khan&#x27;s reforms in regard to women.

Amānullāh&#x27;s reforms touched on many areas of Afghan life. In 1921 he established an air force, albeit with only a few Soviet planes and pilots; Afghan personnel later received training in France, Italy and Turkey. Although he came to power with army support, Amanullah alienated many army personnel by reducing both their pay and size of the forces and by altering recruiting patterns to prevent tribal leaders from controlling who joined the service. Amanullah&#x27;s Turkish advisers suggested the king retire the older officers, men who were set in their ways and might resist the formation of a more professional army. Amanullah&#x27;s minister of war, General Muhammad Nadir Khan, a member of the Musahiban branch of the royal family, opposed these changes, preferring instead to recognize tribal sensitivities. The king rejected Nadir Khan&#x27;s advice and an anti-Turkish faction took root in the army; in 1924 Nadir Khan left the government to become ambassador to France.

If fully enacted, Amānullāh&#x27;s reforms would have totally transformed Afghanistan. Most of his proposals, however, died with his abdication. His transforming social and educational reforms included: adopting the solar calendar, requiring Western dress in parts of Kabul and elsewhere, discouraging the veiling and seclusion of women, abolishing slavery and forced labor, introducing secular education (for girls as well as boys); adult-education classes and educating nomads. His economic reforms included restructuring, reorganizing and rationalizing the entire tax structure, anti-smuggling and anti-corruption campaigns, a livestock census for taxation purposes, the first budget (in 1922), implementing the metric system (which did not take hold), establishing the Bank-i-Melli (National Bank) in 1928, and introducing the Afghani as the new unit of currency in 1923. The political and judicial reforms Amānullāh proposed were equally radical for the time and included the creation of Afghanistan&#x27;s first constitution (in 1923), the guarantee of civil rights (first by decree and later constitutionally), national registration and identity cards for the citizenry, the establishment of a legislative assembly, a court system to enforce new secular penal, civil and commercial codes, prohibition of blood money, and abolition of subsidies and privileges for tribal chiefs and the royal family.

Although sharia (Islamic law) was to be the residual source of law, it regained prominence after the Khost rebellion of 1924–25. Religious leaders, who had gained influence under Habibullah Khan, were unhappy with Amānullāh&#x27;s extensive religious reforms. Conventional wisdom holds that the tribal revolt that overthrew Amanullah grew out of opposition to his reform program, although those people most affected by his reforms were urban dwellers not universally opposed to his policies, rather than the tribes. Nevertheless, the king had managed to alienate religious leaders and army members.

== Foreign involvement ==

=== British Empire ===
According to a later British ambassador in Afghanistan, William Kerr Fraser-Tytler, the British Empire, though officially neutral, was very concerned about the situation in Afghanistan and they &quot;made up a set of rules to govern the situation. It was unneutral to refuse an Afghan entry into Afghanistan, but once he was in he became a contestant, and it would be unneutral to allow him to recross the border, seeking a brief asylum before plunging again into the fray. And so in a mixture of the rules of cricket and football it was ordained that a player might go on the field once, and play for the crown. But if he was forced into touch, and recrossed the line, whether voluntarily or not, he was &#x27;out&#x27; and the referee would not let him back into the game.&quot;

Numerous commentators, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, claimed that British intelligence played a part in the fall of Amanullah; a theory which was prominent amongst Soviet historiography. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, 

=== Soviet Union ===

After coming to power in Afghanistan, the Saqqawists allowed Basmachi insurgents to operate in northern Afghanistan, who then had established themselves in parts of Kunduz, Takhar and Badakshshan provinces by March 1929. Repeated Basmachi incursions into Soviet territory eventually prompted the start of a Soviet operation in Afghanistan.

=== Iran ===
The Iranian military attache, Colonel Ali Khan, was under instruction by Reza Shah to protect the Shiite community of Afghanistan to the greatest possible extent that would not invite a Saqqawist attack on Iran.

=== Germany ===
While Germany itself was uninvolved in the war, the Afghan-German Trading Company was requested by Kalakani to assassinate Amanullah Khan on 15 April 1929, and were promised a large reward if they did so. However, this assassination never materialized. Ultimately, DACOM was forced out of business due to economic difficulties relating to the 1928-1929 Afghan civil war.

==Course of the war==

=== War begins (November – December 1928) ===

====Shinwari revolt====
The unraveling began when Shinwari Pashtun tribesmen revolted and besieged Jalalabad on 14 November 1928, cutting telegraph wires and cutting the road to the capital, after which they drew a manifesto of ten grievances, five of which related to what they saw as Amanullah&#x27;s unsupportable meddling with the status of women. However, during the Shinwari rebellion two years later, the Shinwari claimed that this revolt was &quot;not so much anti-Amanullah as against the local tax-collectors at Jelalabad&quot;. The initial response of the government was to send a small contingent to relieve Jalalabad, which was halted at Nimla, west of Jalalabad, before that force found itself surrounded and destroyed shortly after. Thereafter, Amanullah sent two representatives to suppress the uprising – his foreign minister, Ghulam Siddiq Khan, and the head of the National Council, Shayr Ahmad Khan. However, In late November, they had a falling out, and according to Fayz Muhammad, were negotiating separately with the tribes. Ghulam Siddiq is said to have incited some of the Shinwari to attack Shayr Ahmad Khan, the main consequence of which was that the Shinwari burned the Emir&#x27;s winter palace in Jalalabad to the ground.

On 3 December 1928, Amanullah then decided to send his brother-in-law, Ali Ahmad Khan Luynab, to deal with the problem, and sent him off with regular troops, militia levies, and a sizable treasury with which to conciliate the tribal leaders. Ghulam Siddiq and Shayr Ahmad were ordered back to Kabul.

In the meantime, calls had gone out for tribal levies to assist the regular army in dealing with the Shinwari uprising, and armed tribesmen from the east, south and west, which included Waziri, Wardak, Ghilzai and Tajik tribesmen, but also more recently the Mangal tribesmen (who recently were at war with Amanullah&#x27;s government) trickled into the capital to help. These men had no particular loyalty to the government and saw the situation simply as an opportunity for enrichment. As it turned out, there was no need to send them to Jalalabad, Ali Ahmad managed to conciliate the Shinwari leaders and put an end to the uprising, but as it took a while for this news to spread through the countryside, the levy tribesmen continued to arrive in the capital.

====Siege of Jabal al-Siraj====
Amanullah presumably welcomed the news of the reconciliation. However, any feeling of relief would have been very temporary – forces led by a Tajik leader, Habibullah Kalakani, were moving toward Kabul from the north. Kalakani was a native of Kalakan, a village thirty kilometers north of Kabul. In late November, they besieged Jabal al-Siraj, north of Kabul, and on either 11 or 12 December, after 18 days of siege, Ahmad Ali Lodi peacefully surrendered the citadel, handing over all government funds as well as 18 machine guns, and an unspecified number of heavy weapons and rifles.

==== First Battle of Kabul ====
Emboldened by the victory, Kalakani attacked Kabul with 2000 men (only 200 of which were armed with rifles, and the rest armed with sticks and axes) on 14 December 1928. He and his forces entered the Murad Beg Fort on the northern slopes of the Kuh-i Kutal, nearby the village of Khayr Khanah. The rebels, feeling that deposing an emir would be against the shariah, performed a ritual and declared Kalakani the new emir, and then passed through the village of Dih-i Kupak at 3:00 PM. Around 3:15 PM, they reached the Bagh-i Bala park. They also occupied Bagh-i Bala palace, formerly the summer residence of Abdur Rahman Khan, which had now been turned into a military hospital for the Emir&#x27;s personal guard and the residence of a Turkish physician, Bahjet Beg. After disarming and dismissing the guards and the embassy, they stationed their own guards, reassuring the employees of the embassy that they were guests of the nation and as such no harm would come to them.

The rebels also managed to enter the house and fortress tower of Shahr Ara, which was defended by Shawkat Beg, a Turkish officer who was the son of Muhammad Akbar Khan. His small force, as well as a group of cavalry officers, managed to prevent the Rebels from entering the old city.

As the battle continued, the whole city was filled the sounds of artillery and gunfire. However, only the cavalry of the Emir&#x27;s personal guard and a few other loyal soldiers actually put up a fight against Kalakani&#x27;s forces. The rest of the army was in a mutinous mood, as their officers had been appropriating the soldier&#x27;s rations. Holding their commanders rather than the rebels to blame for the trouble, when ordered to shoot, the soldiers simply fired their weapons in the air. Tumult and confusion were now widespread. The emir was furious when he heard of the mutiny, and ordered all the weapons to be distributed to the residents of Kabul and to the tribesmen who had come into the city but had not yet left for Jalalabad to fight the Shinwari. However, the near-universal loathing of the Afghans for Amanullah led to the majority of them refusing to take up arms against Kalakani. To make matters worse for Amanullah, Some Waziri, Mangal and Ahmadzai tribesmen defected to Kalakani, took up positions on the Asmai Hill in the center of Kabul, and fired on the Emir&#x27;s troops.

Ghulam Ghaws, Whose father, Malik Jahandad Ahmadzai, had been executed following a rebellion, headed towards his hometown costs, carrying with him more than 300 rifles, armed the people there, and rose up against the government. Other tribes acted similarly because there was no control over the distribution of weapons.

The battle took a drastic turn on 25 December, when Kalakani was wounded in the shoulder from an aerial bomb, causing him to retreat 20 kilometers north, to Murad Beg Fort, in the Kuhdaman region.

=== Fall of Amanullah&#x27;s government (January 1929) ===
====Siege of Murad Beg Fort====
Kalakani&#x27;s retreat gave Amanullah a chance to regroup. In late December, he began shelling Murad Beg Fort, and this shelling lasted until 13 January. However, the shelling failed to provide any results, and this disheartened the king. In the early morning of 14 January, Amanullah abdicated the throne to his oldest brother, Inayatullah Khan, who ruled for only three days before escaping into exile in British-India. Amanullah&#x27;s efforts to recover power by leading a small, ill-equipped force toward Kabul failed. The deposed king crossed the border into British-India and went into exile in Italy and remained in Europe until his 1960 death in Zürich, Switzerland. At the time of his abdication, Amanullah&#x27;s troops were fighting in the Khayr Khanah (Khirskhanah) pass, north of Kabul.

==== Second Battle of Kabul ====

After ascending to the Afghan throne, Inayatullah Khan sent a peace envoy to Kalakani. The envoy informed Kalakani that Inayatullah&#x27;s accession had been illegal in accordance to the shariah, since Kalakani had ascended the throne in the Islamic month of Rajab, and Inayatullah&#x27;s accession had taken place in the Islamic month of Sha&#x27;ban. Rejoiced, Kalakani and 28 armed men, accompanied by a group of unarmed Kuhdamanis passed through the village of Dih-i Afghanan and attacked the capital, shouting &quot;ya chahar yar&quot; slogans and firing guns at the air. On the very first day of his reign, Inayatullah was forced to barricade himself in the Arg with several of his ministers.

On the 16th of January, while 80 Hazaras from Bihsud were defending the Qalah-i Buland Fortress, as well as the arsenal at Kulula Pasha, some officials declared their allegiance to Kalakani. These included Shayr Ahmad, head of the national council, Fayz Muhammad Khan, former minister of trade, Abd al-Hadi Khan, the minister of finance, and the sons of Abdur Rahman Khan: Mir Hashim, Sardar Amin Allah Khan, Muhammad Umar Khan, as well as a number of deputy ministers and heads of state bureaus.

On the 17th of January, Inayatullah, unnerved by the lack of support from the Kabulis, surrendered to Kalakani and abdicated the throne. Kalakani allowed him to peacefully leave Kabul with his family and 3000 rupees.

=== Kalakani rules Kabul, Saqqawist offensives (February – August 1929) ===
Having become King of Afghanistan, Kalakani appointed a number of people into office, including:
* Shayr Jan, former cavalry commander, as Minister of Court.
* Ata al-Haqq as foreign minister.
* Abd al-Ghafur Khan, son of Muhammad Shah Tarabi of the Safi tribe, as Minister of the interior.
* Malik Muhsin as governor-general of the Central Province.
* Sayyid Husayn as Minister of Defense.
* Purdil Khan as field marshal of the Army.
* Abd al-Wakil Khan as field marshal of the Army alongside Purdil Khan.
* Hamid Allah as &quot;honorary sardar&quot;.
* Sayyid Muhammad as commander of the Arg.
* Mirza Mujtaba Khan as minister of finance.
* Muhammad Mahfuz as war minister.
* Kaka Muhsin of the Kacharlu clan as governor of Hazarahjat (centered on Bihsud).
* Muhammad Karim Khan as governor of Ghazni.
* Khwajah Mir Alam as governor of Mazar-i-Sharif.
* Ghulam Muhammad Khan of governor of Tagab.
* Chighil Khan as governor of Charikar.
* Nadir Ali as governor of Jaghuri and Malistan.

On 9 May, Kalakani passed a decree in Kabul which forbade citizens of Kabul from moving out of the city without permission, even into the government-controlled Bandar-i Arghandah, Charasya, Bini Hisar, Butkhak, Kutal-i Pay Manar, Kutal-i Khayr Khanah, Maydan, Jalriz, Logar, Khurd Kabul, Tangi Gharu or Dih Sabz.

On 31 May, Kalakani paid a visit to the shrine at Mazar-i Khwajah Musafir, which lies near the village of Chihil Tan above the village of Shaykh Muhammad Riza-yi Khurasani which lies in the Paghman District, west of Kabul

====Kalakani versus Ali Ahmad Khan====

Following his takeover, Kalakani, fearful of a counterattack by the Amanullah loyalists, swiftly moved the treasury to Kudhaman.

The first concerted opposition to Kalakani came from Ali Ahmad Khan, who was still stationed in Jalalabad after suppressing the Shinwari revolt. There, the locals proclaimed Ali as the new Emir upon receiving the news of Kalakani&#x27;s accession. Ali then marched his troops on Samucha-i Mulla Omar, Tangi Khurd Kabul, and Chanri, and took up positions there. At the head of a 2,000 men strong army and a tribal militia, he marched to Jagdalak, where he waited for a force of Mohmands who had promised to join him. Over the course of 23 to 29 January, Ali sent out proclamations of his new emirate to Kabul, Logar, the Hazarahjat, the Southern province, and elsewhere, and called on people to join him.

Malik Qays of the Khugyani tribe, who had initially allied himself with Ali, defected to Kalakani, captured Ali and brought Ali to Kalakani in exchange for 17,000 rupees and the rank of lieutenant general, ending Ali&#x27;s reign on 9 February.

====Kalakani versus anti-Saqqawist tribes====
Sometime before 13 March, the Battle of Shaykhabad took place, from Kabul and halfway across the Kabul-Ghazni road.

It was here where Karim Khan Wardak, who refused to pledge allegiance to Kalakani, had made defensive preparations. Around this time, Abd al-Wakil Khan, who had earlier been appointed field marshal by Kalakani, was dispatched to Ghazni and Qandahar with a force of 3,000 men. When Abd al-Wakil reached the village of Bini Badam and Qalah-i Durrani, from Kabul, he halted there to deal with Karim Khan Wardak&#x27;s forces, only then to proceed. But Karim Khan, along with Wazir and Hazara leaders who had gathered in support of Aman Allah, sent a joint message to the field marshal that said:

Abd al-Wakil accepted this message at face value, and he sent the Model Battalion, which at the time numbered 1,800 men and was stationed at Qal ah-yi Durrani, to march on Shaykhabad along with 400 royal cavalry and 800 Kuhistani and Kuhdamani infantry militia which had halted near the village of Bini Badam. After an exhausting march through snow-covered hills, Abd al-Wakil&#x27;s forces were ambushed near Zarani, at the edge of the Daht-i Tup waste land by Wardak tribesmen, who came thundering down the hills after a soldier&#x27;s shot at a bird alerted them that Kalakani&#x27;s troops were nearby. Many of Abd al-Wakil&#x27;s troops were killed in the ambush; only 20 of 400 cavalrymen survived.

The people of Maydan, Jalriz and Sanglakh refused to offer allegiance to Kalakani, and formed an alliance with the Wardak and surrounded Kalakani&#x27;s armies in Maydan, and defeated them in Qalah-i Durrani, before advancing to Arghandah, west of Kabul, where some Kalakani&#x27;s forced decided to retreat toward Qalah-i Qazi, Chardihi and Kuhdaman.

On 5:30 on 22 March, Kalakani personally headed from Kabul to Arghandah to bolster the spirits of his soldiers and managed to convince the soldiers to advance on Kutal-i Shaykh, a small village near the intersection with the road west to the Unay Pass. They accepted, and the battle of Kutal-i Shaykh lasted until the evening with a victory for Kalakani.

In the morning of 23 March, Kalakani ordered 500 militiamen to be brought back to Kabul from Najrab, because they had been fighting against the Tagabis and Kalakani was worried that Najrab might defect. On 24 March, Kalakani ordered some Kuhdamanis, Kuhistanis, and people from the villages of Dih-i Nur, Maydan and Arghandah to cover the army rear which was then at Qalah-i Durrani and Pul-i Maydan and so deny those awaiting its defeat the chance to march on Chardihi and Kuhdaman. Later that same day, Kalakani&#x27;s Field Marshall, Purdil Khan (who had since been named as Minister of Defense) shelled Maydan, which strengthened the resolve among the Maydan, Arghandah and Sanglakjh to fight Kalakani. On the 25th, Purdil Khan managed to capture Maydan, but the great casualties inflicted prevented him from advancing towards Wardak and Ghazni, and he withdrew to Arghandah and Qalah the following day.

===== Kalakani versus the returned Amanullah =====
At this time, Amanullah had supposedly returned to Afghanistan and was marching from Qandahar with an army made of Durrani, Khattak, Ghilzai, and Hazara fighters. Four days after entering Afghanistan, Amanullah learnt of a Saqqawist uprising in Herat. On 27 March, Habibullah Kalakani ordered his brother, Hamid Allah Kalakani, to lead a force of Panjshiris backed by 14 siege guns, to Maydan. At Kutal-i Shaykh, this force won a major victory which allowed it to continue advancing towards Maydan, where it took 25 prisoners and destroyed several forts. On the night of the 28th, anti-Saqqawist tribesmen ambushed Hamid Allah&#x27;s force, and while they were able to deal vast casualties and capture many field guns and rifles, they were unable to dislodge Hamid from his position. On the 30th, the anti-Saqqawist tribes renewed the battle, and this time they managed to almost completely expel Hamid Allah&#x27;s forces from Maydan, except for a few detachments which were surrounded in the fortress known as Qalah-i Abd al-Ghani Khan Beg Samandi, about west of Shaykhabad. A large part of Hamid&#x27;s defeated army retreated to Arghandah and Qalah-i Qazi.

On the 31st, Kalakani started another offensive on Maydan and made some progress. On 2 April, a force from Bihsuf occupied the Unay Pass and reached an agreement with the militias of the Surkh-i Parsa, Turkman, Bamyan, Balkhab and Shaykh Ali Hazarah for them to attack Kuhistan and Kuhdaman via the Ghurband Valley road while it simultaneously attacks Kabul via the road through Maydan. On 3 April, Kalakani&#x27;s forces clashed in Shash Gaw, north of Ghazni. On 7 April they were defeated while advancing along the road not so far from Ghazni near Shiniz in Wardak. On 7 April, they clashed at Shiniz, and on the 9th they clashed in Shaykhabad and Jaghatu, northwest of Ghazni. Fayz Muhammed reports that Kalakani suffered a major defeat near Ghazni on 9 April and that his forces fled to Qalah-i Durrani, but historian Robert D. McChesney believes this to be false. By the 12th, there were rumours in Kabul that Ghazni was surrounded by anti-Saqqawist forces. In mid-March, Mohammed Nadir Shah, who had departed from France in January, arrived in Jalalabad to centralize the opposition to Kalakani. It was reported on 16 April that Ghazni had fallen to anti-Saqqawist forces, and that Kalakani&#x27;s forces had been defeated at Shaykh Amir, near the Majid Pass. By the 20th, there were reports that anti-Saqqawist forces were on the doorstep of Paghman, just west of Kabul, and that Hazarah forces from Bihsud crossed the Unay pass and were heading on their way to Ghurband, while another force occupied positions there to prevent Kalakani from using it to cross to Hazarahjat. The force sent to Ghazni retreated to Shiniz-i Wardak. On the 21st, soldiers loyal to Kalakani left Kabul to reinforce Ghazni. At this time, Kalakani decided to reinforce the Qalah-i Durrani fort to prevent rebel tribes from advancing past it. On the 24th, Kalakani&#x27;s forces were clashing in Shash Gaw, northwest of Ghazni. On the 26th, while laying siege to Ghazni, Amanullah had inexplicably given the order to retreat to Qandahar. On the 28th, it was reported that Kalakani&#x27;s army had captured Ghazni. On 30 April, anti-Saqqawist forces re-entered Ghazni, renewing the battle. The same day, a large anti-Saqqawist offensive managed to dislodge Kalakani&#x27;s forces from positions in Shaykhabad, Takiya and Shash Gaw, forcing some of them to retreat towards Daht-i Tup. On 1 May, anti-Saqqawist forces continued their offensive, clashing in Dasht-i Tup and Shaykhabad, and on 2 May fighting was taking place in Shaykhabad, Dasht-i Tup and Qalah-yi Durrani. On 7 May, units were sent from Kabul to Mahtab and Arghandah to prepare defenses there. On 8 May, while there was fighting in Dasht-i Tup and Bini Badam, Saqqawist forces under Purdil Khan departed for Charikar. One of Kalakani&#x27;s generals, Muhammad Unar Khan, died on 14 May. The next day, Kalakani sent units to Kuh-i Asmai and Shayr Darwazah. On the 19th, Amanullah was rumoured to be besieged at Kalat, north of Qandahar. On the 23rd, Amanullah Khan fled Afghanistan into the British Raj, leaving his brother Inayatullah Khan in charge of anti-Saqqawist resistance. By that time, Kalakani held control of the entire Ghazni region, and the road south of Ghazni as open. By 1 June, anti-Saqqawist forces who at this time were at Qarabagh decided to retreat Qandahar, while Kalakani&#x27;s armies were able to take Kalat and had surrounded the city of Qandahar, which duly fell on 3 June or 31 May.

=====Kalakani versus Nadir=====
On 8 March, Nadir Khan crossed into Afghanistan just east of Matun in the Kurram Valley. On 16 March, Kalakani dispatched troops in two directions: along the route to Maydan through Qalah-i Mahtab Bagh, Qalah-i Durrani, Qalah-i Qazi, and Arghandah, and via Charasya and Musai to Logar. 129 troops were also dispatched by Kalakani to the Logar Valley, which were defeated at Waghjan Gorge (Between Kushi in Kulangar and Shikar Qalah), forcing them to retreat to Rishkhur, south of Kabul. On 23 March, heavy fighting was occurring in Najrab, north of Kabul. The next day, 500 of Kalakani&#x27;s troops who were marching from Charasya to Kulangar were ambushed, with many killed or wounded.
By 31 March, there were some reversals for Kalakani on the Maydan front. On 23 March, 6000 Mangal tribesmen joined Nadir Khan at Khost. Four days later, he left for Urgun, which he reached on 5 April. A few days later, he took Baladah, and on the 15th he captured Gardez. On the 23rd, Nadir was residing in Safid Qalah, at the southern entrance of the Altamur (or Tirah) pass. On the 24th, he continued through the pass to Charkh, where he was confronted by a force sent by Kalakani. After initial success in capturing the village of Dabar in Charkh, he was ultimately forced to retreat to Sijinak, east of Gardiz on the 27th. On the 22nd, Kalakani sent troops to Logar to defend it against Nadir, whose forces captured Dubandi and the village of Kushi that same day. On the 23rd there were rumours in Kabul that Kalakani&#x27;s armies had been defeated and forced to retreat to Qalah-i Durrani on the Maydan-Ghazni road. On the 23rd, Nadir reached the Waghjan Gorge. On the 24th, there were rumours in Kabul that Nadir&#x27;s forces had entered the village of Aghujan, south of Kabul. On the 25th, Nadir reached Hisarak in the Logar valley, and on that same day it was rumoured that he had suffered a defeat in a battle at Tirah Pass. On 1 May, while a battle in the Southern province had been going on for three days, Kalakani&#x27;s forces carried out a raid on Khushi in Logar and plundered its inhabitants. By 3 May, Nadir had established a fort at Surkhab and was harassing Kalakani&#x27;s troops to prevent Kalakani from advancing into the Southern province. On the sixth, Kalakani sent new troops to Charikar. On the 11th there were rumours that Nadir arrived in Charkh in Logar. Robert D. McChesney believes this to be false, and says this was just wishful thinking. On 8 May, Hashim (Nadir Khan&#x27;s brother) persuaded tribes of the Eastern province to unite against Kalakani, who agreed to raise 40,000 troops who would advance in three formations through Tagab, Tangi Gharu, Ghakari and Lataband to attack Kuhdaman, Kuhistan and Kabul. That same day, Nadir&#x27;s forces reached the region of Pul-i Hashim Khayl in Gandamak and at Tagab made plans to continue further down the road. On 11 May pro-Nadir tribes moved on Kabul but were stopped by Saqqawist Shinwari at Surkhrud. On 12 May there were rumours that Nadir had inflicted a defeat upon Kalakani at Bidak. On 15 May Nadir crossed the Tirah Pass and began an incursion into the Logar valley, which continued the 16th, when Nadir pursued the local Saqqawist forces as far as Kulangar, Kutti Khayl and Muhammad Aghah, and was fighting over control of the Ghurband Valley. Also on the 16th, Nadir reached Khak-i Jabbar via the road through Hisarak. On the 23rd, when peace negotiations were ongoing, Kalakani sent a force of 300 men to Logar. On 26 June, Kalakani&#x27;s forces recaptured Gardiz.

On 14 July, Nadir Khan&#x27;s forces entered the Logar valley, won a victory at Padkhwab-i Rughani and from there, advanced on Surkhab where they surrounded and besieged one of Kalakani&#x27;s forces at Kariz-i Darwish, which surrendered the next day. On 18 July, Kalakani&#x27;s forces fought a battle with the Khugyani near Khurd Kabul. In order to get the upper hand in the battle, Kalakani confiscated all automobiles and horse carriages in Kabul, so that reinforcements could arrive more quickly. This plan worked, and on 19 July the situation was stabilized. On 18 August, Nadir moved his headquarters to Ali Khayl with the Jaji tribe, which had assured him of their unswerving loyalty.

===== The Tagab Front =====
Sometime before 17 March, anti-Saqqawist tribes from Tagab launched a surprise attack on Sarubi and Gugamandan, opening what Robert D. McChesney labels &quot;The Tagab Front&quot;. This attack took the local garrisons by surprise and allowed the Tagabis to capture two cannons, weaponry and other military supplies. After this success, the Tagabis planned a northward assault on Jamal Afgha in Kuhistan, which was successfully undertaken on the 18th. On 23 March, people of Durnama, Sujnan and Bulaghin attacked the Tagabis, defeated them, and occupied their positions, which stabilized the Tagab Front. On 1 April, prisoners arrived from Tagab.

On 2 August, the Tagab front was re-opened following a local uprising. On 12 August, after days of skirmishes, Kalakani&#x27;s forces launched a large counteroffensive and forced the Tagabis to surrender the next day. This ended the Tagab front.

===== The Ghurband Front =====
On 2 April, there were rumours in Kabul that anti-Saqqawist Hazaras had occupied positions in Balkh, while others were able to march on Aqchah, Andkhuy, Maymanah and Mazar-i Sharif. On the 7th, anti-Saqqawist forces arrived in Siyahgird in Ghurband. On the 17th, Sayyid Hussayn had left for Charikar. anti-Saqqawist forces closed the road in the Ghurband valley leading to Kuhistan and Kuhdaman, and on the 18th they had reportedly reached Ghurband. On the 19th, a counteroffensive by Ghulam Rasul Khan against the Hazaras was called off by Kalakani, who wanted instead to focus on Charikar, which was reportedly under attack by local anti-Saqqawist partisans. On the 20th, Sayyid Husayn left for Charikar, where he ambushed and killed Ata Muhammed, whose fiancée Sayyid had taken as a wife in the years prior, for which Ata Muhammed had sworn to kill him. On the 26th, word spread in Kabul that Hazara units had reached Katan mountain, west of Shakar Dara, and from there captured the Khudamani villages of Shakar Darra, Farza, Ghaza, Saray Khwajah, and Charikar. On the 27th, anti-Saqqawist Hazaras reportedly attacked Farza, Shakar Darra and Istalif (towns in Kuhdaman). That same day, in response to Hazara advances, Kalakani sent Hamid Allah on a counteroffensive which succeeded forcing the Hazaras to pull back. However, the situation remained dire for Kalakani and on 3 May he withdrew troops and munitions from other fronts to reinforce the Ghurband front. On 4 May, on the same day which Amanullah withdrew from Wardak, there were rumours in Kabul that Sayyid Husayn, one of Kalakani&#x27;s generals, had made a breakthrough in Ghurband, and on the next day he reportedly was marching on Mazar-i Sharif via the road through Qunduz. Before this march on Mazar-i Sharif, the city had earlier been the site of a mutiny by Kuhistani and Kuhdamani forces, which began in January after Kalakani captured Kabul, and was ended on 30 April by anti-Saqqawist forces. It&#x27;s after this point that sources disagree – Faiz Mohammad records the mutineers of Mazar-i Sharif retreating to Herat and capturing it sometime before 15 May, while Ademec says that Herat was captured sometime after Saqqawist forces captured Mazar-i Sharif in June, after Amanullah left Afghanistan for the British Raj, and then gradually extended their control to Maymanah and then Herat.

On 10 May, word had spread in Kabul that Ghulam Jalani Khan had occupied Andarab and Khanabad in Qataghan and the governor of Qataghan-Badakhshan Province, Mir Baba Sahib Charikari had been killed. On 9 or 10 May, Sayyid Husayn suffered a severe setback in the Battle of Shibar Pass, where his 12,000-man strong army was routed by a local Hazara militia which sought revenge for destruction of cattle, which ended Sayyid&#x27;s hopes of taking Mazar-i Sharif. On May 12, Sayyid found himself besieged in Kuhistan and was reportedly wounded. On that same day, one of Kalakani&#x27;s generals, Abd Al-Wakil Khan captured Fayzabad in Badakhshan while some of his units reached Farjaghan (at the head of the Alishang Valley near Tagab and Najrab). Also on 12 May anti-Saqqawist forces won a victory in a battle near Pul-i Matak after marching on Tagab. On 13 May 900 men from Kalakani&#x27;s army were captured in Ghurband after a brief battle. On the 14th, another 2000 Saqqawist soldiers were defeated and their weapons, materiel and ammunition was seized.

On the 15th, Sayyid Husayn began another offensive against anti-Saqqawist forces, but after taking the Pansjir Valley on the 15th he was stopped at the Khawak Pass on the 16th. On the 19th, there were rumours in Kabul that Sayyid Husayn had died and that anti-Saqqawist forces had marched on Charikar, which Robert D. McChesney believes to be either highly exaggerated or completely false. On the 26th, Sayyid Husayn returned to Kabul alive and well, dispelling rumours about his death, and by the beginning of June, the routes via the Ghurband Valley and the Salang and Khawak Passes were firmly in the hands of Kalakani. On 29 May, 2300 men were sent north to reinforce the Ghurband front. On 31 May, Kalakani&#x27;s army, which had advanced as far as Bamyan en route to Mazar-i Sharif had been routed and forced to retreat to Jabal al-Siraj. On 11 April, Nadir arrived in Khushi in the Logar valley. On 20 April, the son of Abd Allah Khan Tukhi, whose brother, Ata Muhammad, had raised a rebellion in Mazar-i Sharif against Kalakani, was hanged in Kabul. On 7 May 12,000 anti-Saqqawist forces occupied the Unay Pass and the Safidkhak Pass, while others were positioned on the lower slopes of the Paghman and Shakar Darrah. At this time, various anti-Saqqawist tribes planned a coordinated assault on Kabul. However, ethnic differences and poor communications led the attack to never materialize. On 2 June, Kalakani sent troops to Sar-i Chashmah, where they were ordered not to fire on anyone who swears allegiance as long as they were unarmed. On 23 May, Amanullah left Afghanistan for a last time, never to return. That same day, Kalakani sent 6500 men to conquer the Hazarahjat. Sometime before 19 June, Kalakani&#x27;s forces won a victory at Bamyan, where they at first found themselves encircled, before the commander of the besieging Hazara forces was bribed to retreat. As of 23 June, anti-Saqqawist forces continued to occupy the Unay pass. As of 27 June, anti-Saqqawist forces had advanced from the Unay Pass towards Sar-i Chashmah. On 28 June, Kalakani&#x27;s forces fought an offensive battle against Hazara militias at Qalah-i Karim. After capturing the village and burning it to the ground, they were ambushed by Hazaras who were subsequently driven off with artillery fire and forced to retreat into the mountains. After this victory, Kalakani&#x27;s forces took control of the Unay Pass. On 29 June, Kalakani&#x27;s forces advanced on Qalah-i Yurt. On 30 June, Kalakani&#x27;s forces advanced toward Qalah-i Yurt after getting as far as Jawqul. On 1 July, Kalakani&#x27;s forces looted homes in Takana, Jalriz and Kuhnah Khumar. On 2 July, Kalakani&#x27;s forces suffered a defeat at Jawqul and were forced to retreat to Sar-i Chashmah, and then to Chandawul through Bazar-i Sar-i Chawk, Baghban Kuchan and Chandawul. On 3 July, Hamid Allah renewed the offensive, but was beaten back after being surrounded by Hazara militias, and was then pursued on his retreat as far as Sar-i Chashmah. As of 8 July, the Hazaras continued to fight Kalakani&#x27;s forces and attacked a 5,000-man regiment, forcing them to retreat to Jalriz. However, the Hazarahs did not follow up this victory with an attack on Kabul – Robert D. McChesney points out that politics in Afghanistan tend to be extremely local, and once the Hazarahs secured control of their own regions, they had little interest in fighting for more territory.

On 10 July, Umar Khan promised to Kalakani that he would take upon himself the task of either forcing the Hazara&#x27;s submission or crushing them. Faiz Mohammad quotes him as saying &quot;Purdil Khan has taken Ghazni and captured Qandahar; Major General Muhammad Siddiq and Abd al-Qayyum Ibrahim Khayl Paghmani have advanced toward the Southern Province; and Muhammad Umar General Sur-i Satranj has defeated the opposition in numerous battles. I don&#x27;t want to lose ground to my peers here. I should be able to make short work of the Hazarahs and extract their submission.&quot; He set off for Jalriz and linked up with soldiers who had been recently been skirmishing with Hazaras, won a victory at Sar-i Chasmah and conducted operations as far as Takana. However, success soon stalled, and after being wounded in the leg, Umar was forced to retreat, leaving the Hazaras to re-occupy all lost territory.

On 17 July, Hazara militias attacked Saqqawist forces in the Unay Pass and Qalah-i Safid, routing them and pursuing them to Takana and Jalriz. From 25 to 29 July, fighting took place in Jalriz, however on 30 July the Hazaras withdrew from Jalriz back to the Hazarahjat after they heard that Nadir suffered setbacks in the eastern province, which, for the time being, ended the Hazara&#x27;s hopes of joining Nadir in a multi-pronged offensive toward Kabul. On 1 August the Hazaras began another offensive, attacking Qalah-i Majid (near Siyah Baghal) and Qalah-i Safid, a fort in the Unay Pass, chasing Kalakani&#x27;s forces as far as Jalriz once again. On 3 August, Kalakani&#x27;s forces were reportedly defeated at Jalriz once again. On 15 August, Hazara militias launched an offensive against Turkmen tribes who had pledged allegiance to Kalakani on 31 July, occupying positions in Darrah-i Suf, Kuh-i Shadyan and Marmal, and besieged fort Dih Dadi (a garrison village midway between the site of ancient balkh and Mazar-i Sharif).

=== Saqqawist collapse, end of the Civil War (August – October 1929) ===

On 18 August, an anti-Saqqawist uprising took place in Bamyan, Ghuri and Baghlan, blocking Kalakani&#x27;s force&#x27;s route to Turkistan and forcing them to retreat to Ghurband. On 21 August, the Sayyid of Shaykh Ali launched an offensive against Kalakani, advancing as far as Khanabad, Andarab and Ghurband. On 26 August, there were rumours in Kabul that Hazara settlers successfully attacked Mazar-i Sharif. In early September, the Saqqawists won their last victory by taking Jalalabad. On 23 September, a pro-Nadir uprising in Kandahar succeeded at driving out Kalakani&#x27;s forces from the city. On 29 September, a pro-Nadir force under Shah Wali crossed the Durand Line and occupied Khushi. On the 30th, he sent a 1000-man force ahead to Tangi Waghjan, the gorge on the road to the Logar Valley. On 3 October, after an intense battle, anti-Saqqawist forces captured the town of Muhammad Aghah, placing themselves within striking distance of Kabul.

Kalakani himself took part in this battle, trying to lift his soldier&#x27;s spirits, to no avail. anti-Saqqawist forces continued to slowly push towards Kabul, seizing Charasya, Chihil Tan and Chihil Sutun on 5 October. By 7 October, Kalakani&#x27;s forces had retreated from almost all territory outside Kabul, and prepared for their last stand. On 9 October, after dozens of hours of street fighting in Kabul, the Arg was put under siege. On 13 October, after several days of bombardment, Nadir&#x27;s forces entered the Arg, and after a short but fierce battle, captured it, ending the civil war. Upon hearing this news, a small contingent of Kalakani&#x27;s army which was besieged at Jabal al-Siraj resolved to surrender that same day.

== Aftermath ==
On 15 October, Mohammed Nadir Shah arrived in Kabul after hearing word of Kalakani&#x27;s defeat. On the 16th, Nadir entered the Dilkusha Palace, expressing his gratitude to those who had backed him. He acknowledged Amanullah Khan’s contributions to the country and, citing his own poor health, made it clear that he had no personal ambition for the throne. Instead, he pledged to support whoever the national Jerga (tribal council) selected as the next ruler. However, the assembled tribal leaders were adamant that Nader himself should take the crown. Raising their rifles, they warned that if he refused, they would abandon Kabul. Faced with their unwavering insistence, Nader Khan ultimately accepted the responsibility and became the king of Afghanistan.

Nadir considered pardoning Kalakani, but pressure from loyal tribes led him to execute Kalakani on 1 November 1929. Kalakani, his brother, and 9 others were lined up against the west wall of the Arg and shot. During the reign of Nadir, the Saqqawists attempted another uprising, the Kuhistan rebellion (July 1930), which was crushed within a week. Saqqawist activity continued until 1931, when Nadir led a campaign to conquer their final holdout, Herat.

As king, Nadir realized that his earlier opposition to Amanullah&#x27;s reforms had been vindicated by the civil war. Instead of reinstating the reforms that Kalakani had repealed, Nadir worked to complete the abolition of Amanullah&#x27;s reforms, strengthening the power of tribal leaders and clerics.

Pro-Amanullah factions in Afghanistan felt betrayed by Nadir&#x27;s assumption of power, having fought the Saqqawists under the presumption that Amanullah would retake the throne upon their victory. Nadir&#x27;s strengthening of Anglo-Afghan ties (which included support for British sovereignty over Pashtuns east of the Durand line, and lack of support for the Afridi Redshirt Rebellion) was also a sore point for Afghanistan&#x27;s Amanites. Hafizullah Emadi (2010) describes the Amanullah loyalists as nationalist and progressive forces. They led several rebellions: The first of these, the Shinwari rebellion and the Kuhistan rebellion (February–April 1930), occurred in 1930. In 1938, there was also the Ghilzai rebellion.

In the 1940s, Mohammed Zahir Shah faced several tribal revolts, and the leader of the Zadran revolt, Mazrak Zadran, sought to restore Amanullah. During World War II, western press reported that Amanullah Khan was working as an agent for Nazi Germany in Berlin. It is believed he was involved in plans to regain his throne with Axis help.

According to &quot;Resort to war: a data guide to inter-state, extra-state, intra-state, and non-state wars, 1816–2007&quot;, both sides suffered 7500 combat deaths during the civil war.

== Human rights abuses ==

=== By the Saqqawists ===
During the Afghan Civil War, there were incidents of rape and looting among Saqqawist troops. One such incident took place on 28 June 1929, when Saqqawists attacked the Hazara settlement of Qalah-i Karim, looting anything movable and driving off livestock. Another incident, which took place on 23 July 1929, was described by contemporary Afghan historian Fayz Muhammad as follows:

=== By the anti-Saqqawists ===
Following the anti-Saqqawist capture of Kabul in October 1929, Kabul was sacked by Nadir&#x27;s forces. Some sources state that this sacking had been authorized by Nadir, but this is contested by historian Vartan Gregorian.

<text>In mathematical logic and computer science, a general recursive function, partial recursive function, or μ-recursive function is a partial function from natural numbers to natural numbers that is &quot;computable&quot; in an intuitive sense – as well as in a formal one. If the function is total, it is also called a total recursive function (sometimes shortened to recursive function). In computability theory, it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines (this is one of the theorems that supports the Church–Turing thesis). The μ-recursive functions are closely related to primitive recursive functions, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every total recursive function is a primitive recursive function—the most famous example is the Ackermann function.

Other equivalent classes of functions are the functions of lambda calculus and the functions that can be computed by Markov algorithms.

The subset of all &quot;total&quot; recursive functions with values in is known in computational complexity theory as the complexity class R.

==Definition==

The μ-recursive functions (or general recursive functions) are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number. They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the initial functions and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the minimization operator.

The smallest class of functions including the initial functions and closed under composition and primitive recursion (i.e. without minimisation) is the class of primitive recursive functions. While all primitive recursive functions are total, this is not true of partial recursive functions; for example, the minimisation of the successor function is undefined. The primitive recursive functions are a subset of the total recursive functions, which are a subset of the partial recursive functions. For example, the Ackermann function can be proven to be total recursive, and to be non-primitive.

Primitive or &quot;basic&quot; functions:
#&quot;Constant functions &quot;: For each natural number and every 
#::formula_1
#:Alternative definitions use instead a &quot;zero function&quot; as a primitive function that always returns zero, and build the constant functions from the zero function, the successor function and the composition operator.
# &quot;Successor function S:&quot;
#::formula_2
# &quot;Projection function&quot; formula_3 (also called the &quot;Identity function&quot;): For all natural numbers formula_4 such that formula_5:
#::formula_6

Operators (the domain of a function defined by an operator is the set of the values of the arguments such that every function application that must be done during the computation provides a well-defined result):
# &quot;Composition operator&quot; formula_7 (also called the &quot;substitution operator&quot;): Given an m-ary function formula_8 and m k-ary functions formula_9:
#::formula_10
#:This means that formula_11 is defined only if formula_12 and formula_13 are all defined.
# &quot;Primitive recursion operator&quot; : Given the &quot;k&quot;-ary function formula_14 and &quot;k&quot;+2 -ary function formula_15:
#::formula_16
#:This means that formula_17 is defined only if formula_18 and formula_19 are defined for all formula_20
#&quot;Minimization operator&quot; : Given a (&quot;k&quot;+1)-ary function formula_21, the &quot;k&quot;-ary function formula_22 is defined by:
#::formula_23
Intuitively, minimisation seeks—beginning the search from 0 and proceeding upwards—the smallest argument that causes the function to return zero; if there is no such argument, or if one encounters an argument for which is not defined, then the search never terminates, and formula_24 is not defined for the argument formula_25

While some textbooks use the μ-operator as defined here, others demand that the μ-operator is applied to &quot;total&quot; functions only. Although this restricts the μ-operator as compared to the definition given here, the class of μ-recursive functions remains the same, which follows from Kleene&#x27;s Normal Form Theorem (see below). The only difference is, that it becomes undecidable whether a specific function definition defines a μ-recursive function, as it is undecidable whether a computable (i.e. μ-recursive) function is total.

The &quot;strong equality&quot; relation formula_26 can be used to compare partial μ-recursive functions. This is defined for all partial functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; so that
:formula_27 
holds if and only if for any choice of arguments either both functions are defined and their values are equal or both functions are undefined.

==Examples==
Examples not involving the minimization operator can be found at Primitive recursive function#Examples.

The following examples are intended just to demonstrate the use of the minimization operator; they could also be defined without it, albeit in a more complicated way, since they are all primitive recursive.

The following examples define general recursive functions that are not primitive recursive; hence they cannot avoid using the minimization operator.
== Total recursive function ==
A general recursive function is called total recursive function if it is defined for every input, or, equivalently, if it can be computed by a total Turing machine. There is no way to computably tell if a given general recursive function is total - see &quot;Halting problem&quot;.

== Equivalence with other models of computability ==

In the equivalence of models of computability, a parallel is drawn between Turing machines that do not terminate for certain inputs and an undefined result for that input in the corresponding partial recursive function.
The unbounded search operator is not definable by the rules of primitive recursion as those do not provide a mechanism for &quot;infinite loops&quot; (undefined values).

== Normal form theorem ==

A normal form theorem due to Kleene says that for each &quot;k&quot; there are primitive recursive functions formula_28 and formula_29 such that for any μ-recursive function formula_30 with &quot;k&quot; free variables there is an &quot;e&quot; such that
:formula_31.
The number &quot;e&quot; is called an &quot;index&quot; or &quot;Gödel number&quot; for the function &quot;f&quot;. A consequence of this result is that any μ-recursive function can be defined using a single instance of the μ operator applied to a (total) primitive recursive function.

Minsky observes the formula_32 defined above is in essence the μ-recursive equivalent of the universal Turing machine:
== Symbolism ==
A number of different symbolisms are used in the literature. An advantage to using the symbolism is a derivation of a function by &quot;nesting&quot; of the operators one inside the other is easier to write in a compact form. In the following the string of parameters x1, ..., xn is abbreviated as x:
* &quot;Constant function&quot;: Kleene uses &quot; C(x) = q &quot; and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (B-B-J) use the abbreviation &quot; constn( x) = n &quot;: 
:: e.g. C ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13
:: e.g. const13 ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13

* &quot;Successor function&quot;: Kleene uses x&#x27; and S for &quot;Successor&quot;. As &quot;successor&quot; is considered to be primitive, most texts use the apostrophe as follows: 
:: S(a) = a +1 =def a&#x27;, where 1 =def 0&#x27;, 2 =def 0 &#x27; &#x27;, etc.

* &quot;Identity function&quot;: Kleene (1952) uses &quot; U &quot; to indicate the identity function over the variables xi; B-B-J use the identity function id over the variables x1 to xn:
: U( x ) = id( x ) = xi 
: e.g. U = id ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = t

* &quot;Composition (Substitution) operator&quot;: Kleene uses a bold-face S (not to be confused with his S for &quot;successor&quot; ! ). The superscript &quot;m&quot; refers to the mth of function &quot;fm&quot;, whereas the subscript &quot;n&quot; refers to the nth variable &quot;xn&quot;:
:If we are given h( x )= g( f1(x), ... , fm(x) )
:: h(x) = S(g, f1, ... , fm )

:In a similar manner, but without the sub- and superscripts, B-B-J write: 
:: h(&quot;x)= Cn[g, f1 ..., fm](x&quot;&#x27;)

* &quot;Primitive Recursion&quot;: Kleene uses the symbol &quot; Rn(base step, induction step) &quot; where n indicates the number of variables, B-B-J use &quot; Pr(base step, induction step)(x)&quot;. Given:
:* base step: h( 0, x )= f( x ), and
:* induction step: h( y+1, x ) = g( y, h(y, x),x )
: Example: primitive recursion definition of a + b:
::* base step: f( 0, a ) = a = U(a)
::* induction step: f( b&#x27; , a ) = ( f ( b, a ) )&#x27; = g( b, f( b, a), a ) = g( b, c, a ) = c&#x27; = S(U( b, c, a ))
::: R2 { U(a), S [ (U( b, c, a ) ] }
::: Pr{ U(a), S[ (U( b, c, a ) ] }

&quot;Example&quot;: Kleene gives an example of how to perform the recursive derivation of f(b, a) = b + a (notice reversal of variables a and b). He starts with 3 initial functions 
:# S(a) = a&#x27;
:# U(a) = a
:# U( b, c, a ) = c
:# g(b, c, a) = S(U( b, c, a )) = c&#x27;
:# base step: h( 0, a ) = U(a)
:: induction step: h( b&#x27;, a ) = g( b, h( b, a ), a )

He arrives at:
:: a+b = R2[ U, S(S, U) ]

<doc id="26470" wikidata="Q1750696" url="?curid=26470" title="Rex Ingram (director)">
<text>Rex Ingram (born Reginald Ingram Montgomery Hitchcock; 15 January 1893 – 21 July 1950) was an Irish film director, producer, writer, and actor. Director Erich von Stroheim once called him &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest director&quot;.

==Early life==
Born 15 January 1893 in 58 Grosvenor Square, Rathmines, Dublin, Ireland, (where a plaque commemorates his birth), Ingram was educated at Saint Columba&#x27;s College, near Rathfarnham, County Dublin. He spent much of his adolescence living in the Old Rectory, Kinnitty, Birr, County Offaly, where his father, Reverend Francis Hitchcock, was the Church of Ireland rector. Ingram emigrated to the United States in 1911.

His brother Francis joined the British Army and fought during World War I, during which he was awarded the Military Cross.

==Career==
Ingram studied sculpture at the Yale University School of Art, where he contributed to campus humour magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. He soon moved into film, first taking acting work in 1913 and then writing, producing and directing. His first work as producer-director was in 1916 on the romantic drama &quot;The Great Problem&quot;. He worked for Edison Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Vitagraph Studios, and then MGM, directing mainly action or supernatural films.

He moved to Metro in 1920, where he was under the supervision of executive June Mathis. Mathis and Ingram would go on to make four films together: &quot;Hearts Are Trumps&quot;, &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;The Conquering Power&quot;, and &quot;Turn to the Right&quot;. It is believed the two were romantically involved. Ingram and Mathis had begun to grow distant when her new find, Rudolph Valentino, began to overshadow Ingram&#x27;s own fame. Their relationship ended when Ingram eloped with Alice Terry in 1921.

Ingram married twice, first to actress Doris Pawn in 1917; this ended in divorce in 1920. He then married Alice Terry in 1921, with whom he remained for the rest of his life. Both marriages were childless. He and Terry relocated to the French Riviera in 1923. They formed a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy, for MGM and others.

Among those who worked for Ingram at MGM on the Riviera during this period was the young Michael Powell, who later directed (with Emeric Pressburger) &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and other classics, and technician Leonti Planskoy. By Powell&#x27;s own account, Ingram was a major influence on him, especially in regard to the themes of illusion, dreaming, magic and the surreal. David Lean said he was indebted to Ingram. MGM studio chief Dore Schary listed the top creative people in Hollywood as D. W. Griffith, Ingram, Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim (in declining order of importance).

Carlos Clarens writes: &quot;As Rex Ingram&#x27;s films became more esoteric, his career declined. The coming of sound forced him to relinquish his studios in Nice. Rather than equip them for talking pictures, he chose instead to travel and pursue a writing career.&quot;

Ingram made only one sound film: &quot;Baroud&quot;, filmed for Gaumont British Pictures in Morocco. The film was not a commercial success; he then left the movie business, returning to Los Angeles to work as a sculptor and writer.

Ingram converted to Islam in 1933, having held an interested in the religion as early as 1927.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1651 Vine Street.

==Death==
Ingram died of a cerebral hemorrhage in North Hollywood on 21 July 1950, aged 58. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
Critic Carlos Clarens wrote of Ingram: &quot;A full-blown Irishman fascinated by the bizarre and the grotesque (he once employed a dwarf as a valet), Ingram was also a writer of some talent. Frequently pedestrian and pretentious, Ingram&#x27;s films nevertheless contain splendid flashes of macabre fantasy, such as the ride of the Four Horsemen in the Valentino epic, or the &#x27;ghoul visions&#x27; that bring about the death of the miser in &quot;The Conquering Power&quot;. His more or less mystical bent was apparent in &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; and &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;, which he filmed in the Mediterranean and North Africa, respectively.&quot;

<text>Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents. Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus &quot;Rattus&quot;. Other rat genera include &quot;Neotoma&quot; (pack rats), &quot;Bandicota&quot; (bandicoot rats) and &quot;Dipodomys&quot; (kangaroo rats).

Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Usually the common name of a large muroid rodent will include the word &quot;rat&quot;, while a smaller muroid&#x27;s name will include &quot;mouse&quot;. The common terms &quot;rat&quot; and &quot;mouse&quot; are not taxonomically specific. There are 56 known species of rats in the world.

==Species and description==

The best-known rat species are the black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) and the brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;). This group, generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over in the wild.

The term &quot;rat&quot; is also used in the names of other small mammals that are not true rats. Examples include the North American pack rats (aka wood rats) and a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats. Rats such as the bandicoot rat (&quot;Bandicota bengalensis&quot;) are murine rodents related to true rats but are not members of the genus &quot;Rattus&quot;.

Male rats are called &quot;bucks&quot;; unmated females, &quot;does&quot;, pregnant or parent females, &quot;dams&quot;; and infants, &quot;kittens&quot; or &quot;pups&quot;. A group of rats is referred to as a &quot;mischief&quot;.

The common species are opportunistic survivors and often live with and near humans; therefore, they are known as commensals. They may cause substantial food losses, especially in developing countries. However, the widely distributed and problematic commensal species of rats are a minority in this diverse genus. Many species of rats are island endemics, some of which have become endangered due to habitat loss or competition with the brown, black, or Polynesian rat.

Wild rodents, including rats, can carry many different zoonotic pathogens, such as &quot;Leptospira&quot;, &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, and &quot;Campylobacter&quot;. The Black Death is traditionally believed to have been caused by the microorganism &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, carried by the tropical rat flea (&quot;Xenopsylla cheopis&quot;), which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another zoonotic disease linked to the rat is foot-and-mouth disease.

Rats become sexually mature at age 6 weeks, but reach social maturity at about 5 to 6 months of age. The average lifespan of rats varies by species, but many only live about a year due to predation.

The black and brown rats diverged from other Old World rats in the forests of Asia during the beginning of the Pleistocene.

==Rat tails==

The characteristic long tail of most rodents is a feature that has been extensively studied in various rat species models, which suggest three primary functions of this structure: thermoregulation, minor proprioception, and a nocifensive-mediated degloving response. Rodent tails—particularly in rat models—have been implicated with a thermoregulation function that follows from its anatomical construction. This particular tail morphology is evident across the family Muridae, in contrast to the bushier tails of Sciuridae, the squirrel family. The tail is hairless and thin skinned but highly vascularized, thus allowing for efficient countercurrent heat exchange with the environment. The high muscular and connective tissue densities of the tail, along with ample muscle attachment sites along its plentiful caudal vertebrae, facilitate specific proprioceptive senses to help orient the rodent in a three-dimensional environment. Murids have evolved a unique defense mechanism termed &quot;degloving&quot; that allows for escape from predation through the loss of the outermost integumentary layer on the tail. However, this mechanism is associated with multiple pathologies that have been the subject of investigation.

Multiple studies have explored the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to varying levels of physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals&#x27; tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat&#x27;s tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, as well as its higher surface-area-to-volume ratio, which directly relates to heat&#x27;s ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.
On the other hand, the tail&#x27;s ability to function as a proprioceptive sensor and modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated flexion and extension of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism&#x27;s center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat&#x27;s tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.
The characteristic tail of murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as &quot;degloving&quot; in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal&#x27;s escape from a predator. This evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment. Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure. The degloving response is a response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.

==As pets==

Specially bred rats have been kept as pets at least since the late 19th century. Pet rats are typically variants of the species brown rat, but black rats and giant pouched rats are also sometimes kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they have been kept as pets. Pet rats do not pose any more of a risk of zoonotic diseases than pets such as cats or dogs. Tamed rats are generally friendly and can be taught to perform selected behaviors.

Selective breeding has brought about different color and marking varieties in rats. Genetic mutations have also created different fur types, such as rex and hairless. Congenital malformation in selective breeding have created the dumbo rat, a popular pet choice due to their low, saucer-shaped ears. A breeding standard exists for rat fanciers wishing to breed and show their rat at a rat show.

==As subjects for scientific research==

In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, established a population of domestic albino brown rats to study the effects of diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, adding to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the health and wellbeing of humankind.

The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, nonplanar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.

The rat&#x27;s larynx has been used in experimentations that involve inhalation toxicity, allograft rejection, and irradiation responses. One experiment described four features of the rat&#x27;s larynx. The first being the location and attachments of the thyroarytenoid muscle, the alar cricoarytenoid muscle, and the superior cricoarytenoid muscle, the other of the newly named muscle that ran from the arytenoid to a midline tubercle on the cricoid. The newly named muscles were not seen in the human larynx. In addition, the location and configuration of the laryngeal alar cartilage was described. The second feature was that the way the newly named muscles appear to be familiar to those in the human larynx. The third feature was that a clear understanding of how MEPs are distributed in each of the laryngeal muscles was helpful in understanding the effects of botulinum toxin injection. The MEPs in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, lateral cricoarytenoid muscle, cricothyroid muscle, and superior cricoarytenoid muscle were focused mostly at the midbelly. In addition, the medial thyroarytenoid muscle were focused at the midbelly while the lateral thyroarytenoid muscle MEPs were focused at the anterior third of the belly. The fourth and final feature that was cleared up was how the MEPs were distributed in the thyroarytenoid muscle.

Laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes (Barnett 2002), as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding (with the work of John B. Calhoun on behavioral sink). A 2007 study found rats to possess metacognition, a mental ability previously only documented in humans and some primates.

Domestic rats differ from wild rats in many ways. They are calmer and less likely to bite; they can tolerate greater crowding; they breed earlier and produce more offspring; and their brains, livers, kidneys, adrenal glands, and hearts are smaller (Barnett 2002).

Brown rats are often used as model organisms for scientific research. Since the publication of the rat genome sequence, and other advances, such as the creation of a rat SNP chip, and the production of knockout rats, the laboratory rat has become a useful genetic tool, although not as popular as mice. Entirely new breeds or &quot;lines&quot; of brown rats, such as the Wistar rat, have been bred for use in laboratories. Much of the genome of &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot; has been sequenced.

When it comes to conducting tests related to intelligence, learning, and drug abuse, rats are a popular choice due to their high intelligence, ingenuity, aggressiveness, and adaptability. Their psychology seems in many ways similar to that of humans. Inspired by B.F. Skinner’s famous box which dispensed food pellets when rats pushed a lever, photographer Augustin Lignier gave two rats periodic, unpredictable rewards for pressing a button. He likened their repeated button-pressing behaviors to people’s fascinations with digital and social media.

===General intelligence===

Early studies found evidence both for and against measurable intelligence using the &quot;g factor&quot; in rats. Part of the difficulty of understanding animal cognition, generally, is determining what to measure. One aspect of intelligence is the ability to learn, which can be measured using a maze like the T-maze. Experiments done in the 1920s showed that some rats performed better than others in maze tests, and if these rats were selectively bred, their offspring also performed better, suggesting that in rats an ability to learn was heritable in some way.

==As food==

Rat meat is a food that, while taboo in some cultures, is a dietary staple in others.

==Working rats==

Rats have been used as working animals. Tasks for working rats include the sniffing of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy. Rats have a keen sense of smell and are easy to train. These characteristics have been employed, for example, by the Belgian non-governmental organization APOPO, which trains rats (specifically African giant pouched rats) to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis through smell.

==As pests==
Rats have long been considered deadly pests. Once considered a modern myth, the rat flood in India occurs every fifty years, as armies of bamboo rats descend upon rural areas and devour everything in their path. Rats have long been held up as the chief villain in the spread of the Bubonic Plague; however, recent studies show that rats alone could not account for the rapid spread of the disease through Europe in the Middle Ages. Still, the Centers for Disease Control does list nearly a dozen diseases directly linked to rats.

Most urban areas battle rat infestations. A 2015 study by the American Housing Survey (AHS) found that eighteen percent of homes in Philadelphia showed evidence of rodents. Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., also demonstrated significant rodent infestations. Indeed, rats in New York City are famous for their size and prevalence. The urban legend that the rat population in Manhattan equals that of its human population was definitively refuted by Robert Sullivan in his book &quot;Rats&quot; but illustrates New Yorkers&#x27; awareness of the presence, and on occasion boldness and cleverness, of the rodents. New York has specific regulations for eradicating rats; multifamily residences and commercial businesses must use a specially trained and licensed rat catcher.

Chicago was declared the &quot;rattiest city&quot; in the US by the pest control company Orkin in 2020, for the sixth consecutive time. It&#x27;s followed by Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco. To help combat the problem, a Chicago animal shelter has placed more than 1000 feral cats (sterilized and vaccinated) outside of homes and businesses since 2012, where they hunt and catch rats while also providing a deterrent simply by their presence.

Rats have the ability to swim up sewer pipes into toilets. Rats will infest any area that provides shelter and easy access to sources of food and water, including under sinks, near garbage, and inside walls or cabinets.

===In the spread of disease===
Rats can serve as zoonotic vectors for certain pathogens and thus spread disease, such as bubonic plague, Lassa fever, leptospirosis, and Hantavirus infection. Researchers studying New York City wastewater have also cited rats as the potential source of &quot;cryptic&quot; SARS-CoV-2 lineages, due to unknown viral RNA fragments in sewage matching mutations previously shown to make SARS-CoV-2 more adept at rodent-based transmission.

Rats are also associated with human dermatitis because they are frequently infested with blood feeding rodent mites such as the tropical rat mite (&quot;Ornithonyssus bacoti&quot;) and spiny rat mite (&quot;Laelaps echidnina&quot;), which will opportunistically bite and feed on humans, where the condition is known as rat mite dermatitis&quot;.&quot;

==As invasive species==
When introduced into locations where rats previously did not exist, they can wreak an enormous degree of environmental degradation. &quot;Rattus rattus&quot;, the black rat, is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s worst invasive species. Also known as the ship rat, it has been carried worldwide as a stowaway on seagoing vessels for millennia and has usually accompanied men to any new area visited or settled by human beings by sea. Rats first got to countries such as America and Australia by stowing away on ships. The similar species &quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;, the brown rat or wharf rat, has also been carried worldwide by ships in recent centuries.

The ship or wharf rat has contributed to the extinction of many species of wildlife, including birds, small mammals, reptiles, invertebrates, and plants, especially on islands. True rats are omnivorous, capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods, and have a very high birth rate. When introduced to a new area, they quickly reproduce to take advantage of the new food supply. In particular, they prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, which on isolated islands often have no other predators and thus have no fear of predators. Some experts believe that rats are to blame for between forty percent and sixty percent of all seabird and reptile extinctions, with ninety percent of those occurring on islands. Thus man has indirectly caused the extinction of many species by accidentally introducing rats to new areas.

==Rat-free areas==

Rats are found in nearly all areas of Earth which are inhabited by human beings. The only rat-free continent is Antarctica, which is too cold for rat survival outdoors, and its lack of human habitation does not provide buildings to shelter them from the weather. However, rats have been introduced to many of the islands near Antarctica, and because of their destructive effect on native flora and fauna, efforts to eradicate them are ongoing. In particular, Bird Island (just off rat-infested South Georgia Island), where breeding seabirds could be badly affected if rats were introduced, is subject to special measures and regularly monitored for rat invasions.

As part of island restoration, some islands&#x27; rat populations have been eradicated to protect or restore the ecology. Hawadax Island, Alaska was declared rat free after 229 years and Campbell Island, New Zealand after almost 200 years. Breaksea Island in New Zealand was declared rat free in 1988 after an eradication campaign based on a successful trial on the smaller Hawea Island nearby.

In January 2015, an international &quot;Rat Team&quot; (organized by the South Georgia Heritage Trust) set sail from the Falkland Islands for the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands on board a ship carrying three helicopters and 100 tons of rat poison with the objective of &quot;reclaiming the island for its seabirds&quot;. Rats had wiped out more than 90% of the seabirds on South Georgia, and the sponsors hoped that once the rats were gone, it would regain its former status as home to the greatest concentration of seabirds in the world.

The Canadian province of Alberta is notable for being the largest inhabited area on Earth which is free of true rats due to very aggressive government rat control policies. It has large numbers of native pack rats, also called bushy-tailed wood rats, but they are forest-dwelling vegetarians which are much less destructive than true rats.

Alberta was settled by Europeans relatively late in North American history and only became a province in 1905. Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people and in their structures to survive the winters. There are numerous predators in Canada&#x27;s vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, so it took until 1950 for invading rats to make their way over land from Eastern Canada. Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further. A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a control zone about long and wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province. Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats. Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process. Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.

Forceful government control measures, strong public support and enthusiastic citizen participation continue to keep rat infestations to a minimum. The effectiveness has been aided by a similar but newer program in Saskatchewan which prevents rats from even reaching the Alberta border. Alberta still employs an armed rat patrol to control rats along Alberta&#x27;s borders. About ten single rats are found and killed per year, and occasionally a large localized infestation has to be dug out with heavy machinery, but the number of permanent rat infestations is zero.

==In culture==

Ancient Romans did not generally differentiate between rats and mice, instead referring to the former as &quot;mus maximus&quot; (big mouse) and the latter as &quot;mus minimus&quot; (little mouse).

On the Isle of Man, there is a taboo against the word &quot;rat&quot;.

===Asian cultures===


The rat (sometimes referred to as a mouse) is the first of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac. People born in this year are expected to possess qualities associated with rats, including creativity, intelligence, honesty, generosity, ambition, a quick temper and wastefulness. People born in a year of the rat are said to get along well with &quot;monkeys&quot; and &quot;dragons&quot;, and to get along poorly with &quot;horses&quot;.
In Indian tradition, rats are seen as the vehicle of Ganesha, and a rat&#x27;s statue is always found in a temple of Ganesh. In the northwestern Indian city of Deshnoke, the rats at the Karni Mata Temple are held to be destined for reincarnation as Sadhus (Hindu holy men). The attending priests feed milk and grain to the rats, of which the pilgrims also partake.

===European cultures===
European associations with the rat are generally negative. For instance, &quot;Rats!&quot; is used as a substitute for various vulgar interjections in the English language. These associations do not draw, &quot;per se&quot;, from any biological or behavioral trait of the rat, but possibly from the association of rats (and fleas) with the 14th-century medieval plague called the Black Death. Rats are seen as vicious, unclean, parasitic animals that steal food and spread disease. In 1522, the rats in Autun, France were charged and put on trial for destroying crops. However, some people in European cultures keep rats as pets and conversely find them to be tame, clean, intelligent, and playful.

Rats are often used in scientific experiments; animal rights activists allege the treatment of rats in this context is cruel. The term &quot;lab rat&quot; is used, typically in a self-effacing manner, to describe a person whose job function requires them to spend a majority of their work time engaged in bench-level research (such as postgraduate students in the sciences).

====Terminology====
Rats are frequently blamed for damaging food supplies and other goods, or spreading disease. Their reputation has carried into common parlance: in the English language, &quot;rat&quot; is often an insult or is generally used to signify an unscrupulous character; it is also used, as a synonym for the term &quot;&quot;, to mean an individual who works as a police informant or who has turned state&#x27;s evidence. Writer/director Preston Sturges created the humorous alias &quot;Ratskywatsky&quot; for a soldier who seduced, impregnated, and abandoned the heroine of his 1944 film, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;. It is a term (noun and verb) in criminal slang for an informant – &quot;to rat on someone&quot; is to betray them by informing the authorities of a crime or misdeed they committed. Describing a person as &quot;rat-like&quot; usually implies he or she is unattractive and suspicious.

Among trade unions, the word &quot;rat&quot; is also a term for nonunion employers or breakers of union contracts, and this is why unions use inflatable rats.

===Fiction===
Depictions of rats in fiction are historically inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings may be of actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.

The actual portrayals of rats vary from negative to positive with a majority in the negative and ambiguous. The rat plays a villain in several mouse societies; from Brian Jacques&#x27;s &quot;Redwall&quot; and Robin Jarvis&#x27;s &quot;The Deptford Mice&quot;, to the roles of Disney&#x27;s Professor Ratigan and Kate DiCamillo&#x27;s Roscuro and Botticelli. They have often been used as a mechanism in horror; being the titular evil in stories like &quot;The Rats&quot; or H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; and in films like &quot;Willard&quot; and &quot;Ben&quot;. Another terrifying use of rats is as a method of torture, for instance in Room 101 in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; or &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe.

Selfish helpfulness —those willing to help for a price— has also been attributed to fictional rats. Templeton, from E. B. White&#x27;s &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;, repeatedly reminds the other characters that he is only involved because it means more food for him, and the cellar-rat of John Masefield&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Folk&quot; requires bribery to be of any assistance.

By contrast, the rats appearing in the Doctor Dolittle books tend to be highly positive and likeable characters, many of whom tell their remarkable life stories in the Mouse and Rat Club established by the animal-loving doctor.

Some fictional works use rats as the main characters. Notable examples include the society created by O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot;, and others include &quot;Doctor Rat&quot;, and Rizzo the Rat from The Muppets. Pixar&#x27;s 2007 animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; is about a rat described by Roger Ebert as &quot;earnest... lovable, determined, [and] gifted&quot; who lives with a Parisian garbage-boy-turned-chef.

&quot;Mon oncle d&#x27;Amérique&quot; (&quot;My American Uncle&quot;), a 1980 French film, illustrates Henri Laborit&#x27;s theories on evolutionary psychology and human behaviors by using short sequences in the storyline showing lab rat experiments.

In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, humans unintentionally introduce rats to the ecology at the home world of an alien race which previously invaded Earth and introduced some of its own fauna into its environment. A. Bertram Chandler pitted the space-bound protagonist of a long series of novels, Commodore Grimes, against giant, intelligent rats who took over several stellar systems and enslaved their human inhabitants. &quot;The Stainless Steel Rat&quot; is nickname of the (human) protagonist of a series of humorous science fiction novels written by Harry Harrison.

Wererats, therianthropic creatures able to take the shape of a rat, have appeared in the fantasy or horror genre since the 1970s. The term is a neologism coined in analogy to werewolf. The concept has since become common in role playing games like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and fantasy fiction like the &quot;Anita Blake&quot; series.

====The Pied Piper====

One of the oldest and most historic stories about rats is &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot;, in which a rat-catcher leads away an infestation with enchanted music. The piper is later refused payment, so he in turn leads away the town&#x27;s children. This tale, traced to Germany around the late 13th century, has inspired adaptations in film, theatre, literature, and even opera. The subject of much research, some theories have intertwined the tale with events related to the Black Plague, in which black rats played an important role. Fictional works based on the tale that focus heavily on the rat aspect include Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot;, and Belgian graphic novel &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Ball of the Dead Rat&quot;). Furthermore, a linguistic phenomenon when a wh-expression drags with it an entire encompassing phrase to the front of the clause has been named pied-piping after &quot;Pied Piper of Hamlin&quot; (see also pied-piping with inversion).

<text>Adobe RoboHelp is a help authoring tool (HAT) developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows. RoboHelp was created by Gen Kiyooka, and Blue Sky Software released version 1.0 in January 1992.

Blue Sky Software was founded in 1990 and changed its name to eHelp Corporation on 4 April 2000. Macromedia acquired eHelp Corporation on 24 October 2003. Macromedia was, in turn, acquired by Adobe Systems on 3 December 2005. Adobe Systems has developed and released nine successive versions of RoboHelp since 2007.

== Features ==
Adobe RoboHelp can generate help files in the following file formats:

== Revision history ==
The version numbering systems used by Blue Sky Software/eHelp Corporation, Macromedia, and Adobe Systems induced some head-scratching, especially among longtime RoboHelp users. For example, the first version of RoboHelp released by Adobe Systems in January 2007 was the 14th version of the software, but Adobe Systems decided to continue the numbering convention from Macromedia and thus gave this version the number 6...and dropped the X used in the previous version, RoboHelp X5. This decision caused confusion because Blue Sky Software released RoboHelp 6.0 in 1998. Adobe Systems continued with that numbering system and used versions 7 through 11 for successive versions of RoboHelp released from September 2007 to January 2014. With the introduction of Adobe RoboHelp 2015 in June 2015, Adobe Systems used a new numbering system with the release year instead of a version number and continues to use this convention with successive versions. This new version numbering system has removed any uncertainty about which version is the most recent. The current version, Adobe RoboHelp 2019, is the 22nd version of the software released in RoboHelp&#x27;s 26-year history.
== Other RoboHelp tools ==

* RoboHelp Classic is the classic version of the help authoring tool (HAT) developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows. RoboHelp Classic was first distributed in the Technical Communication Suite version 2019.
* RoboHelp Server (formerly RoboSource Control) provides version control for and deployment of online help systems on a network. The current version of Adobe RoboHelp Server, version 10, was released on 12 April 2016.
* RoboScreenCapture is a screen capture tool that can be used for capturing and editing images.

<doc id="26473" wikidata="Q3174429" url="?curid=26473" title="Replicant">
<text>A replicant is a fictional bioengineered humanoid featured in the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the 2017 sequel &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; which is physically indistinguishable from an adult human and often possesses superhuman strength and intelligence. A replicant can be detected by means of the fictional Voight-Kampff test in which emotional responses are provoked; a replicant&#x27;s nonverbal responses differ from those of a human. Failing the test leads to execution, which is euphemistically referred to as &quot;retiring&quot;.

Several models of replicant were produced. The first seen model, the Nexus-6, has a four-year lifespan. The successor model, the Nexus-7, were limited experimental models with the ability to procreate. Nexus-8 and Nexus-9 replicants also have open-ended lifespans, but the Nexus-9 line was incapable of disobeying human orders.

==Term origin==
In his novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (the inspiration for &quot;Blade Runner&quot;), Philip K. Dick used the term android (or &quot;andy&quot;), but director Ridley Scott wanted a new term to avoid audience preconceptions. As David Peoples was re-writing the screenplay, he consulted his daughter, who was involved in microbiology and biochemistry, who suggested the term &quot;replicating&quot;, the biological process of a cell making a copy of itself. From that, either Peoples or Scott came up with &quot;replicant&quot;, and it was inserted into Hampton Fancher&#x27;s screenplay.

==Fictional history==
=== &quot;Blade Runner&quot; ===
Prior to the events of the film, replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody off-world mutiny. Six replicants escaped the off-world colonies, killing 23 people and taking a shuttle to Earth; the film focuses on the pursuit of the replicants by Rick Deckard, a type of fictional police officer called a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, who investigates, tests, and executes replicants.

Escaped replicants (all Nexus-6 models):
* Roy Batty (played by Rutger Hauer), a self-sufficient combat model for the colonization defence program
* Pris Stratton (played by Daryl Hannah), a &quot;basic pleasure model&quot; for military personnel
* Zhora Salome (played by Joanna Cassidy), &quot;trained for an off-world kick murder squad&quot;
* Leon Kowalski (played by Brion James), a combat model or loader of nuclear fission materials
* An unnamed replicant—&quot;Hodge&quot; in early versions of the screenplay—killed in an electrical field at the Tyrell Corporation
* The sixth replicant was named &quot;Mary&quot; in early versions of the screenplay. The only mention of this replicant occurs in the 2007 &quot;Final Cut&quot; version — Captain Bryant&#x27;s dialogue has been fixed to say that two replicants were killed by an electric field at the Tyrell Corporation; in previous versions of the film, he states it was only one replicant.

Other replicants:
* Rachael, (played by Sean Young) is a prototype replicant, with implanted memories from Eldon Tyrell&#x27;s niece. The sequel film further elaborates on this by revealing she was designed as a test run for a replicant that can become pregnant.

While Deckard discusses Rachael with Tyrell, Tyrell states that to better control replicants he started to implant false memories to give them the years of experiences that humans take for granted, creating a &quot;cushion or pillow for their emotions.&quot;

Nexus-6 units were designed to have a four-year lifespan to avoid emotional development, and all attempts to increase a replicant&#x27;s lifespan have resulted in death. According to Deckard, a normal replicant can usually be discovered using the Voight-Kampff test within 20–30 questions, though Rachael answers over one hundred questions before Deckard determines she is a replicant.

The second film further develops Rachael&#x27;s origin, and gives significantly more details about her radical design. It revealed that she was an experimental model of replicant with a high percentage of human organs, including human reproductive organs, and that Rachael conceived a child with Deckard. As Rachael died during childbirth, her possible survival beyond the four years was undetermined.

=== &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; ===
The sequel, &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, is set thirty years after the original. In the intervening 30 years, several new replicant lines were introduced.

The sequel retroactively establishes that Rachael was part of a short-lived prototype line of replicants designated Nexus-7, which was not only intended as a test to make replicants more mentally stable with implanted memories, but also to develop replicants capable of procreation. Rachael died in childbirth in 2021, and the child was hidden by the replicant underground. Tyrell was killed during the events of the first film in November 2019, and the secret of producing replicants capable of procreation died with him. 

In 2020, the Tyrell Corporation introduced the Nexus-8 replicant, whose lifespans were not limited to four years. The Nexus-8 went into mass production, but a new wave of replicant rebellions occurred, culminating in rogue Nexus-8 replicants detonating a nuclear weapon in orbit over the western United States to create an electromagnetic pulse. The pulse destroyed most records about replicants, making it difficult for humans to track them down on Earth, but the attack led to mass purges and complete shutdown of Nexus-8 production (though many existing units were able to go into hiding in the chaos). 

In 2036, genetic engineer Niander Wallace designed a new line of Nexus-9 replicants. They also have an open lifespan, but were designed to be unable to resist orders given by a human. The demonstrated effectiveness of Nexus-9 programming, combined with the solving of a global food crisis, allowed for a successful push for the ban on replicant production to be lifted. 

By 2049, Nexus-9 replicants are extensively used across Earth and the off-world colonies. Special police units are tasked with tracking down any that might go rogue, as well as any remaining Nexus-8s still in hiding (Nexus-7 was never mass-produced, and all the Nexus-6 models died of old age decades before). These police units are once again called Blade Runners, but are now composed of self-aware replicants with implanted memories, though they are fully aware that they are replicants and that their memories are artificial.

==Ambiguity over Deckard&#x27;s humanity==

A primary element of the Blade Runner film is the ambiguity over whether the protagonist, Deckard, is a human or a replicant. This ties into one of the central themes of the film: the nature of humanity. Ultimately, the important point is not whether Deckard is a replicant but that the ambiguity blurs the line between humans and replicants.

=== Creator opinions ===
Harrison Ford, who played Deckard in the film, has said that he did not think Deckard is a replicant, and that he and director Ridley Scott had discussions that ended in the agreement that the character was human. 

According to several interviews with director Ridley Scott, Deckard is a replicant. When asked in October 2012 about the possibility of a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; sequel, Scott said, &quot;It&#x27;s not a rumor—it&#x27;s happening. With Harrison Ford? I don&#x27;t know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6, so we don&#x27;t know how long he can live. And that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say at this stage.&quot; 

Author Will Brooker has written that the unicorn dream may not be unique to Deckard and that it may be a personal touch added to some or all of the Nexus-6 replicants&#x27; brains. From this, one might also infer that Gaff is a replicant and shares the same embedded memory.

Paul Sammon, author of &quot;Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner&quot;, has suggested in interviews that Deckard may be a Nexus-7 model, which possesses no superhuman strength or intelligence but does have neurological features that complete the illusion of humanity. Sammon also suggests that Nexus-7 replicants may not have a set lifespan (i.e., they could be immortal, ruling out the lifespan as a determining trait). He goes on to propose that Scott thought it would be more provocative to imply that Deckard is a replicant.

=== In-universe evidence ===
In &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, Deckard was subjected to the Voight-Kampff test and passed, marking as a human, though Rachael&#x27;s near-passing the test casts doubt on its infallibility. He collects photographs, yet has no obvious family beyond a reference to his ex-wife (who called him a &quot;cold fish&quot;). The film&#x27;s Supervising Editor Terry Rawlings remembers that Scott &quot;purposefully put Harrison in the background of the shot, and slightly out of focus, so that you&#x27;d only notice his eyes were glowing if you were paying attention... Ridley himself may have definitely felt that Deckard is a replicant, but still, by the end of the picture, he intended to leave it up to the viewer.&quot;

The sequel, &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, revisited the question while leaving the answer deliberately ambiguous. The film reveals that Deckard was able to conceive a child with Rachael, and this was possible because she was an experimental prototype (designated Nexus-7), the first and only attempt to design a replicant model capable of procreation. Niander Wallace, CEO of the company that produced replicants, captures Deckard and muses that his falling in love with Rachael seemed too perfect, suggesting that Deckard was designed to fall in love with Rachael as part of Tyrell&#x27;s experiment to develop replicants that can procreate, but with Tyrell dead and the records destroyed, he will never know.

<text>Roman Osipovich Jakobson (, ; 18 July 1982) was a Russian linguist and literary theorist.

A pioneer of structural linguistics, Jakobson was one of the most celebrated and influential linguists of the twentieth century. With Nikolai Trubetzkoy, he developed revolutionary new techniques for the analysis of linguistic sound systems, in effect founding the modern discipline of phonology. Jakobson went on to extend similar principles and techniques to the study of other aspects of language such as syntax, morphology and semantics. He made numerous contributions to Slavic linguistics, most notably two studies of Russian case and an analysis of the categories of the Russian verb. Drawing on insights from C. S. Peirce&#x27;s semiotics, as well as from communication theory and cybernetics, he proposed methods for the investigation of poetry, music, and the visual arts including cinema.

Through his decisive influence on Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, among others, Jakobson became a pivotal figure in the adaptation of structural analysis to disciplines beyond linguistics, including philosophy, anthropology and literary theory; his development of the approach pioneered by Ferdinand de Saussure, known as &quot;structuralism&quot;, became a major post-war intellectual movement in Europe and the United States. Meanwhile, though the influence of structuralism declined during the 1970s, Jakobson&#x27;s work has continued to receive attention in linguistic anthropology, especially through the ethnography of communication developed by Dell Hymes and the semiotics of culture developed by Jakobson&#x27;s former student Michael Silverstein. Jakobson&#x27;s concept of underlying linguistic universals, particularly his celebrated theory of distinctive features, decisively influenced the early thinking of Noam Chomsky, who became the dominant figure in theoretical linguistics during the second half of the twentieth century.

==Life and work==
Jakobson was born in Moscow on to well-to-do parents of Jewish descent, the industrialist Osip Jakobson and chemist Anna Volpert Jakobson, and he developed a fascination with language at a very young age. He studied at the Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages and then at the Historical-Philological Faculty of Moscow University. As a student he was a leading figure of the Moscow linguistic circle and took part in Moscow&#x27;s active world of avant-garde art and poetry; he was especially interested in Russian Futurism, the Russian incarnation of Italian Futurism. Under the pseudonym &#x27;Aliagrov&#x27;, he published books of zaum poetry and befriended the Futurists Vladimir Mayakovsky, Kazimir Malevich, Aleksei Kruchyonykh and others. It was the poetry of his contemporaries that partly inspired him to become a linguist.

The linguistics of the time was overwhelmingly neogrammarian and insisted that the only scientific study of language was to study the history and development of words across time (the approach, in Saussure&#x27;s terms). Jakobson, on the other hand, had come into contact with the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, and developed an approach focused on the way in which language&#x27;s structure served its basic function ( approach) – to communicate information between speakers. Jakobson was also well known for his critique of the emergence of sound in film. Jakobson received a master&#x27;s degree from Moscow University in 1918.

===In Czechoslovakia===
Although he was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik revolution, Jakobson soon became disillusioned as his early hopes for an explosion of creativity in the arts fell victim to increasing state conservatism and hostility. He left Moscow for Prague in 1920, where he worked as a member of the Soviet diplomatic mission while continuing with his doctoral studies. Living in Czechoslovakia meant that Jakobson was physically close to the linguist who would be his most important collaborator during the 1920s and 1930s, Prince Nikolai Trubetzkoy, who fled Russia at the time of the Revolution and took up a chair at Vienna in 1922. In 1926 the Prague school of linguistic theory was established by the professor of English at Charles University, Vilém Mathesius, with Jakobson as a founding member and a prime intellectual force (other members included Nikolai Trubetzkoy, René Wellek and Jan Mukařovský). Jakobson immersed himself in both the academic and cultural life of pre-World War II Czechoslovakia and established close relationships with a number of Czech poets and literary figures. Jakobson received his Ph.D. from Charles University in 1930. He became a professor at Masaryk University in Brno in 1933. He also made an impression on Czech academics with his studies of Czech verse.

Roman Jakobson proposed the Atlas Linguarum Europae in the late 1930s, but World War II disrupted this plan and it laid dormant until being revived by Mario Alinei in 1965.

===Escapes before the war===
Jakobson escaped from Prague in early March 1939 via Berlin for Denmark, where he was associated with the Copenhagen linguistic circle, and such intellectuals as Louis Hjelmslev. He fled to Norway on 1 September 1939, and in 1940 walked across the border to Sweden, where he continued his work at the Karolinska Hospital (with works on aphasia and language competence). When Swedish colleagues feared a possible German occupation, he managed to leave on a cargo ship, together with Ernst Cassirer (the former rector of Hamburg University) to New York City in 1941 to become part of the wider community of intellectual émigrés who fled there.

===Career in the United States and later life ===

In New York, he began teaching at The New School, still closely associated with the Czech émigré community during that period. At the École libre des hautes études, a sort of Francophone university-in-exile, he met and collaborated with Claude Lévi-Strauss, who would also become a key exponent of structuralism. He also made the acquaintance of many American linguists and anthropologists, such as Franz Boas, Benjamin Whorf, and Leonard Bloomfield. When the American authorities considered &quot;repatriating&quot; him to Europe, it was Franz Boas who actually saved his life. After the war, he became a consultant to the International Auxiliary Language Association, which would present Interlingua in 1951.

In 1949 Jakobson moved to Harvard University, where he remained until his retirement in 1967. His universalizing structuralist theory of phonology, based on a markedness hierarchy of distinctive features, achieved its canonical exposition in a book published in the United States in 1951, jointly authored by Roman Jakobson, C. Gunnar Fant and Morris Halle. In the same year, Jakobson&#x27;s theory of &#x27;distinctive features&#x27; made a profound impression on the thinking of young Noam Chomsky, in this way also influencing generative linguistics. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960.

In his last decade, Jakobson maintained an office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was an honorary professor emeritus. In the early 1960s, Jakobson shifted his emphasis to a more comprehensive view of language and began writing about communication sciences as a whole. He converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity in 1975.

Jakobson died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 18 July 1982. His widow died in 1986. His first wife, who was born in 1908, died in 2000.

== Intellectual contributions ==
According to Jakobson&#x27;s own personal reminiscences, the most decisive stage in the development of his thinking was the period of revolutionary anticipation and upheaval in Russia between 1912 and 1920, when, as a young student, he fell under the spell of the celebrated Russian futurist wordsmith and linguistic thinker Velimir Khlebnikov.
Offering a slightly different picture, the preface to the second edition of &quot;The Sound Shape of Language&quot; argues that this book represents the fourth stage in &quot;Jakobson&#x27;s quest to uncover the function and structure of sound in language.&quot; The first stage was roughly the 1920s to 1930s where he collaborated with Trubetzkoy, in which they developed the concept of the phoneme, and elucidated the structure of phonological systems. The second stage, from roughly the late 1930s to the 1940s, during which he developed the notion that &quot;binary distinctive features&quot; were the foundational element in language, and that such distinctiveness is &quot;mere otherness&quot; or differentiation. In the third stage in Jakobson&#x27;s work, from the 1950s to 1960s, he worked with the acoustician C. Gunnar Fant and Morris Halle (a student of Jakobson&#x27;s) to consider the acoustic aspects of distinctive features.

===The communication functions===

Influenced by the Organon-Model by Karl Bühler, Jakobson distinguishes six communication functions, each associated with a dimension or factor of the communication process [n.b. – Elements from Bühler&#x27;s theory appear in the diagram below in yellow and pink, Jakobson&#x27;s elaborations in blue]:
*Functions
#referential (: contextual information)
#aesthetic/poetic (: auto-reflection)
#emotive (: self-expression)
#conative (: vocative or imperative addressing of receiver)
#phatic (: checking channel working)
#metalingual (: checking code working)

One of the six functions is always the dominant function in a text and usually related to the type of text. In poetry, the dominant function is the poetic function: the focus is on the message itself. The true hallmark of poetry is according to Jakobson &quot;the projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection to the axis of combination&quot;. Very broadly speaking, it implies that poetry successfully combines and integrates form and function, that poetry turns the poetry of grammar into the grammar of poetry, so to speak. Jakobson&#x27;s theory of communicative functions was first published in &quot;Closing Statements: Linguistics and Poetics&quot; (in Thomas A. Sebeok, &quot;Style in Language&quot;, Cambridge Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1960, pp. 350–377). Despite its wide adoption, the six-functions model has been criticized for lacking specific interest in the &quot;play function&quot; of language that, according to an early review by Georges Mounin, is &quot;not enough studied in general by linguistics researchers&quot;.

===Political dimension of his work===
As a Russophile, in his &quot;Remarques sur l&#x27;évolution phonologique du russe comparée a celle des autres langues slaves&quot; (&quot;Remarks on the phonological evolution of the Russian language in comparison with other Slavic languages&quot;, 1929) and similarly in &quot;Slavische Sprachfragen in der Sovjetunion&quot; (&quot;Slavic Language Questions in the Soviet Union&quot;, 1934, an attack on the policy of Ukrainization and its proponents) he presented the phonological development in Slavic languages as motivated only in Russian and Serbo-Croatian languages, while all other Slavic languages, including Ukrainian, are considered as devoid of independent development, subject only to Russian and Serbo-Croatian tendencies. In the same spirit, in his article about the Ukrainian imperative (1965), Jacobson tried to downplay the peculiarities of this form in the Ukrainian language.

==Legacy==
Jakobson&#x27;s three principal ideas in linguistics play a major role in the field to this day: linguistic typology, markedness, and linguistic universals. The three concepts are tightly intertwined: typology is the classification of languages in terms of shared grammatical features (as opposed to shared origin), markedness is (very roughly) a study of how certain forms of grammatical organization are more &quot;optimized&quot; than others, and linguistic universals is the study of the general features of languages in the world. He also influenced Nicolas Ruwet&#x27;s paradigmatic analysis.

Jakobson has also influenced Friedemann Schulz von Thun&#x27;s four sides model, as well as Michael Silverstein&#x27;s metapragmatics, Dell Hymes&#x27;s ethnography of communication and ethnopoetics, the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, and philosophy of Giorgio Agamben.

Jakobson&#x27;s legacy among researchers specializing in Slavics, and especially Slavic linguistics in North America, has been enormous, for example, Olga Yokoyama.

<text>Rudolph Israel Pariser (December 8, 1923 – February 2, 2021) was an American physical and polymer chemist. 

==Biography==
Rudolph Israel Pariser was born in Harbin, China to merchant parents, Ludwig Jacob Pariser and Lia Rubinstein. He attended the Von Hindenburg Schule in Harbin, an American Missionary School in Beijing and American School in Japan in Tokyo. He left for the United States just before World War II broke out.

Pariser received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1944, and his Ph. D. degree from the University of Minnesota in physical chemistry in 1950. From 1944 to 1946, during World War II and shortly afterward, he served in the United States Army. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944.

Pariser spent most of his career as a polymer chemist working for DuPont in the Central Research Department at the Experimental Station. He rose to the level of Director of Polymer Sciences, leading it during a time of great innovation. After retiring from DuPont, he formed his own consulting company.

Pariser is best known for his work with Robert G. Parr on the method of molecular orbital computation now known (because it was independently developed by John A. Pople) as the Pariser–Parr–Pople method (PPP method), published both by Pariser and Parr and by Pople in almost simultaneous papers in 1953.

On July 31, 1972, Pariser married Margaret Louise Marsh. He died on February 2, 2021, at the age of 97.

<doc id="26476" wikidata="Q741222" url="?curid=26476" title="Rendezvous with Rama">
<text>Rendezvous with Rama is a 1973 science fiction novel by British writer Arthur C. Clarke. Set in the 2130s, the story involves a cylindrical alien starship that enters the Solar System. The story is told from the point of view of a group of human explorers who intercept the ship in an attempt to unlock its mysteries. The novel won both the Hugo and Nebula awards upon its release, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones in Clarke&#x27;s bibliography. The concept was later extended with several sequels, written by Clarke and Gentry Lee.

==Plot==
An asteroid strikes Italy in 2077, prompting the creation of the Spaceguard system to track potentially hazardous objects in space. In 2131, Spaceguard detects an interstellar object entering the Solar System, designating it &quot;31/439&quot; before naming it Rama after the Hindu god. A space probe reveals that Rama is a perfectly smooth cylinder long and in diameter, indicating that it was constructed by intelligent beings.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; is sent to study Rama, being the only ship close enough to do so. The crew navigates through a triple airlock system and descends one of three identical staircases. Inside Rama, they discover two plains that stretch across the interior circumference, divided by a frozen body of water they name the Cylindrical Sea. They identify several city-sized clusters of geometric structures, which they name after major cities on Earth. The United Planets follows their progress closely, and scientists are assembled to form a Rama Committee that considers theories and advises Commander Norton.

As Rama drifts closer to the sun, the Cylindrical Sea melts, the temperature shift causes a storm, and three massive lights activate on each plain to illuminate the world. Boris Rodrigo, a crewman who adheres to a space-inspired sect of Christianity, suggests that Rama is a new Noah&#x27;s Ark that will change course to begin orbiting the sun. The crew floats across the Cylindrical Sea on a raft to reach an island they name New York, and a sample of the water reveals the presence of microorganisms. The structures in New York are positioned in patterns of three, without any openings, and their purpose is unidentifiable.

The crewman Jimmy Pak approaches Norton to admit that he smuggled a sky-bike onto their ship and offers to fly it above a cliff to reach the southern plain. He flies to the other end of Rama, which is defined by a large spike several kilometers in length and surrounded by smaller spikes. Pak realizes that a static field is building around the spikes, which then emits a concussion that knocks his sky-bike out of the air and destroys it, stranding him in the southern plain. As he recovers from the crash, a crab-like creature arrives to disassemble the sky-bike and dispose of its parts. Pak is unable to determine whether the creature is biological or robotic.

Pak explores the patchwork terrain of the southern plain while he waits for rescue. He finds a single alien flower, which he takes. A rescue crew arrives on the raft, and Pak jumps from the cliff into the Cylindrical Sea so they can pull him aboard. A course change by Rama triggers a series of large waves, but Sergeant Ruby Barnes navigates them to safety. They see a damaged starfish-like creature emerge from the sea, and shark-like creatures arrive to disassemble it.

After returning to their camp, a spider-like creature with three eyes and three legs studies all of their equipment. More arrive, and one falls from a higher platform to its destruction. Ernst takes the opportunity to dissect the creature and finds that it is both biological and robotic, so they conclude that the creatures were designed by the Ramans and begin referring to them as biots. The government of Mercury, having decided that Rama is too dangerous, launches a nuclear weapon to destroy it. Rodrigo intercepts the missile and disarms it, taking advantage of the 12-minute time lag for radio communication between it and Mercury.

The crew prepares to evacuate as Rama gets too close to the sun. For their final expedition, they visit a city with a laser and cut a hole into the side of a structure. Inside they find a collection of holograms that provide details on various Raman artefacts, including a suit designed for a three-legged humanoid. As they leave, the biots return to the sea to be disassembled and the lights begin to dim. The crew boards &quot;Endeavour&quot; and leaves Rama. Rama changes course to move directly toward the sun and moves alongside it to gather energy. It then activates a space drive to propel itself out of the Solar System in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud. After Rama leaves, a member of the Rama Committee considers that the Ramans do everything in threes.

==Reception==
John Leonard of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, while finding Clarke &quot;benignly indifferent to the niceties of characterization&quot;, praised the novel for conveying &quot;that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes sci-fi at its most technically imaginative&quot;. Other reviewers have also commented on Clarke&#x27;s lack of character development and overemphasis on realism.

===Awards and nominations===
The novel received the following awards:
*Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1973
*British Science Fiction Association Award in 1973
*Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1974
*Jupiter Award for Best Novel in 1974
*John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1974
*Locus Award for Best Novel in 1974
*Seiun Award for Best Foreign Language Novel in 1980

==Design and geography of Rama==

The interior of Rama is essentially a large cylindrical landscape, dubbed &quot;The Central Plain&quot; by the crew, 16 kilometres in diameter and nearly 50 long, with artificial gravity provided by its 0.25 rpm spin. It is split into the &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern&quot; plains, divided in the middle by a 10-km wide expanse of water the astronauts dub the &quot;Cylindrical Sea&quot;. In the center of the Cylindrical Sea is an island of unknown purpose covered in tall, skyscraper-like structures, which the astronauts name &quot;New York&quot; due to an imagined similarity to Manhattan. At each end of the ship are North and South &quot;Poles&quot;. The North Pole is effectively the bow and the South Pole the stern, as Rama accelerates in the direction of the north pole and its drive system is at the South Pole.

The North Pole contains Rama&#x27;s airlocks, and is where the &quot;Endeavour&quot; lands. The airlocks open into the hub of the massive bowl shaped cap at the North Pole, with three 8-kilometre long stair systems, called Alpha, Beta, and Gamma by the crew, leading to the plain.

The Northern plain contains several small &quot;towns&quot; interconnected by roads, dubbed London, Paris, Peking, Tokyo, Rome, and Moscow. The South Pole has a giant cone-shaped protrusion (&quot;Big Horn&quot;) surrounded by six smaller ones (&quot;Little Horns&quot;), which are thought to be part of Rama&#x27;s reactionless space drive.

Both ends of Rama are lit by giant trenches (three in the northern plain and three in the south), equidistantly placed around the cylinder, effectively functioning as giant strip lighting.

==Books in the series==
Clarke paired up with Gentry Lee for the remainder of the series. Lee wrote while Clarke read and made editing suggestions. The focus and style of the last three novels are quite different from those of the original with an increased emphasis on characterisation and clearly-portrayed heroes and villains, rather than Clarke&#x27;s dedicated professionals. These later books did not receive the same critical acclaim and awards as the original.

* &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; (1973) &quot;&quot;
* &quot;Rama II&quot; (1989) &quot;&quot;
* &quot;The Garden of Rama&quot; (1991) &quot;&quot;
* &quot;Rama Revealed &quot; (1993) &quot;&quot;

Gentry Lee also wrote two further novels set in the same &quot;Rama&quot; Universe.

*&quot;Bright Messengers&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Double Full Moon Night&quot; (1999)

==Adaptations==

===Video games===
A graphic adventure computer game of the same name with a text parser based on the book was made in 1984 by Trillium and ported to other systems such as the Apple II, Commodore 64. Despite its primitive graphics, it had highly detailed descriptions, and it followed the book very closely along with having puzzles to solve during the game.

In Spain there was an official adaptation for the 2nd generation MSX computers called &quot;Cita con Rama&quot; that took advantage of the MSX&#x27;s ability to produce (at the time) high-quality graphics. It was adapted from the Clarke novel in 1983 by Ron Martinez, who went on to design the massively multiplayer online game &quot;10Six&quot;, also known as &quot;Project Visitor&quot;.

Sierra Entertainment created &quot;Rama&quot; in 1996 as a point and click adventure game in the style of &quot;Myst&quot;. Along with highly detailed graphics, Arthur C. Clarke also appeared in the game as the guide for the player. This game featured characters from the sequel book &quot;Rama II&quot;.

===Radio adaptation===

In 2009, BBC Radio 4 produced a two-part radio adaptation of the book as part of a science-fiction season. It was adapted by Mike Walker, and was broadcast on 1 March 2009 (Part 1) and 8 March 2009 (Part 2).

===Film===
In the early 2000s, actor Morgan Freeman expressed his desire to produce a film based on &quot;Rendezvous with Rama.&quot; The film has been stuck in &quot;development hell&quot; for many years. In 2003, after initial problems procuring funding, it appeared the project would go into production. The film was to be produced by Freeman&#x27;s production company, Revelations Entertainment. David Fincher, touted on Revelations&#x27; &quot;Rama&quot; web page as far back as 2001, stated in a late 2007 interview that he was still attached to helm.

By late 2008, David Fincher stated the movie was unlikely to be made. &quot;It looks like it&#x27;s not going to happen. There&#x27;s no script and as you know, Morgan Freeman&#x27;s not in the best of health right now. We&#x27;ve been trying to do it but it&#x27;s probably not going to happen.&quot;

In 2010, Freeman stated in an interview that he was still planning to make the project but that it has been difficult to find the right script. He also stated that it should be made in 3D. In January 2011, Fincher stated in an interview with MTV that he was still planning to make the film after he had completed work on his planned remake of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (which was scheduled to begin production in 2012 but has since been scrapped). He also reiterated Freeman&#x27;s concerns about the difficulty of finding the right script.

In an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson in February 2012, Freeman indicated an interest in playing the role of Commander Norton for the film, stating that &quot;my fantasy of commanding a starship is commanding Endeavour&quot;. Tyson then asked, &quot;So is this a pitch to be ... that person if they ever make that movie?&quot; to which Freeman reaffirmed, &quot;We &quot;are&quot; going to make that movie.&quot; In response to a plea to &quot;make that come out sooner rather than later&quot;, Freeman reiterated that difficulty in authoring a high quality script is the primary barrier for the film, stating &quot;... the only task you have that&#x27;s really really hard in making movies, harder than getting money, is getting a script ... a good script&quot;.

In December 2021, it was announced that the film was in development at Alcon Entertainment with Denis Villeneuve set to direct. Morgan Freeman and Lori McCreary are on the production team because their Revelations Entertainment previously owned the rights. Alcon co-CEOs Broderick Johnson and Andrew Kosove will produce. As of February 2024, Villeneuve was in the process of writing the script.

==Non-fictional aspects==
Clarke created the space study program which detects Rama, Project Spaceguard, as a method of identifying near-Earth objects on Earth-impact trajectories; in the novel it was initiated in 2077. A real project named Spaceguard was initiated in 1992, named after Clarke&#x27;s fictional project and &quot;with the permission and encouragement of Clarke&quot;. After interest in the dangers of asteroid strikes was heightened by a series of Hollywood disaster films, the United States Congress gave NASA authorisation and funding to support Spaceguard. By 2017, there were a number of different efforts to detect potentially dangerous asteroids.

On 19 October 2017 an incoming interstellar object was discovered by Pan-STARRS, a system similar to Spaceguard. Like Rama, the object had an unusually elongated shape. Before the official Hawaiian name ʻOumuamua was selected by the International Astronomical Union, a popular choice was &quot;Rama&quot;.

<text>Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron(III) oxides (Fe2O3·nH2O) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3), and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron.

Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. &quot;Rusting&quot; is the common term for corrosion of elemental iron and its alloys such as steel. Many other metals undergo similar corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called &quot;rust&quot;.

Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Other forms of rust include the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen. Rebar used in underwater concrete pillars, which generates green rust, is an example. Although rusting is generally a negative aspect of iron, a particular form of rusting, known as &quot;stable rust&quot;, causes the object to have a thin coating of rust over the top. If kept in low relative humidity, it makes the &quot;stable&quot; layer protective to the iron below, but not to the extent of other oxides such as aluminium oxide on aluminium.

==History==
It was assumed that rust, made by dissolved oxygen with iron in the oceans, began to sink beneath the seafloor, forming banded iron formations from 2.5 to 2.2 billion years ago. Afterwards, rust soon uplifted iron metals toward the ocean surface. They would subsequently transform into foundations of iron and steel, which effectively fuelled the Industrial Revolution.

== Chemical reactions ==

Rust is a general name for a complex of oxides and hydroxides of iron, which occur when iron or some alloys that contain iron are exposed to oxygen and moisture for a long period of time. Over time, the oxygen combines with the metal, forming new compounds collectively called rust, in a process called rusting. Rusting is an oxidation reaction specifically occurring with iron. Other metals also corrode via similar oxidation, but such corrosion is not called rusting.

The main catalyst for the rusting process is water. Iron or steel structures might appear to be solid, but water molecules can penetrate the microscopic pits and cracks in any exposed metal. The hydrogen atoms present in water molecules can combine with other elements to form acids, which will eventually cause more metal to be exposed. If chloride ions are present, as is the case with saltwater, the corrosion is likely to occur more quickly. Meanwhile, the oxygen atoms combine with metallic atoms to form the destructive oxide compound. These iron compounds are brittle and crumbly and replace strong metallic iron, reducing the strength of the object.

===Oxidation of iron===

When iron is in contact with water and oxygen, it rusts. If salt is present, for example in seawater or salt spray, the iron tends to rust more quickly, as a result of chemical reactions. Iron metal is relatively unaffected by pure water or by dry oxygen. As with other metals, like aluminium, a tightly adhering oxide coating, a passivation layer, protects the bulk iron from further oxidation. The conversion of the passivating ferrous oxide layer to rust results from the combined action of two agents, usually oxygen and water.

Other degrading solutions are sulfur dioxide in water and carbon dioxide in water. Under these corrosive conditions, iron hydroxide species are formed. Unlike ferrous oxides, the hydroxides do not adhere to the bulk metal. As they form and flake off from the surface, fresh iron is exposed, and the corrosion process continues until either all of the iron is consumed or all of the oxygen, water, carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide in the system are removed or consumed.

When iron rusts, the oxides take up more volume than the original metal; this expansion can generate enormous forces, damaging structures made with iron. See &quot;economic effect&quot; for more details.

=== Associated reactions ===

The rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that begins with the transfer of electrons from iron to oxygen. The iron is the reducing agent (gives up electrons) while the oxygen is the oxidizing agent (gains electrons). The rate of corrosion is affected by water and accelerated by electrolytes, as illustrated by the effects of road salt on the corrosion of automobiles. The key reaction is the reduction of oxygen:
:O2 + 4  + 2  → 4 
Because it forms hydroxide ions, this process is strongly affected by the presence of acid. Likewise, the corrosion of most metals by oxygen is accelerated at low pH. Providing the electrons for the above reaction is the oxidation of iron that may be described as follows:
:Fe → Fe2+ + 2 

The following redox reaction also occurs in the presence of water and is crucial to the formation of rust:
:4 Fe2+ + O2 → 4 Fe3+ + 2 O2−

In addition, the following multistep acid–base reactions affect the course of rust formation:

:Fe2+ + 2 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)2 + 2 
:Fe3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 

as do the following dehydration equilibria:
:Fe(OH)2 ⇌ FeO + 
:Fe(OH)3 ⇌ FeO(OH) + 
:2 FeO(OH) ⇌ Fe2O3 + 

From the above equations, it is also seen that the corrosion products are dictated by the availability of water and oxygen. With limited dissolved oxygen, iron(II)-containing materials are favoured, including FeO and black lodestone or magnetite (Fe3O4). High oxygen concentrations favour ferric materials with the nominal formulae Fe(OH)3−&quot;x&quot;O. The nature of rust changes with time, reflecting the slow rates of the reactions of solids.

Furthermore, these complex processes are affected by the presence of other ions, such as Ca2+, which serve as electrolytes which accelerate rust formation, or combine with the hydroxides and oxides of iron to precipitate a variety of Ca, Fe, O, OH species.

The onset of rusting can also be detected in the laboratory with the use of ferroxyl indicator solution. The solution detects both Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions. Formation of Fe2+ ions and hydroxyl ions are indicated by blue and pink patches respectively.

== Prevention ==
Because of the widespread use and importance of iron and steel products, the prevention or slowing of rust is the basis of major economic activities in a number of specialized technologies. A brief overview of methods is presented here; for detailed coverage, see the cross-referenced articles.
Rust is permeable to air and water, therefore the interior metallic iron beneath a rust layer continues to corrode. Rust prevention thus requires coatings that preclude rust formation.

=== Rust-resistant alloys ===

Stainless steel forms a passivation layer of chromium(III) oxide. Similar passivation behavior occurs with magnesium, titanium, zinc, zinc oxides, aluminium, polyaniline, and other electroactive conductive polymers.

Special &quot;weathering steel&quot; alloys such as Cor-Ten rust at a much slower rate than normal, because the rust adheres to the surface of the metal in a protective layer. Designs using this material must include measures that avoid worst-case exposures since the material still continues to rust slowly even under near-ideal conditions.
=== Galvanization ===

Galvanization consists of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the zinc layer. In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective zinc layer is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.

More modern coatings add aluminium to the coating as &quot;zinc-alume&quot;; aluminium will migrate to cover scratches and thus provide protection for a longer period. These approaches rely on the aluminium and zinc oxides protecting a once-scratched surface, rather than oxidizing as a sacrificial anode as in traditional galvanized coatings. In some cases, such as very aggressive environments or long design life, both zinc and a coating are applied to provide enhanced corrosion protection.

Typical galvanization of steel products that are to be subjected to normal day-to-day weathering in an outside environment consists of a hot-dipped 85 μm zinc coating. Under normal weather conditions, this will deteriorate at a rate of 1 μm per year, giving approximately 85 years of protection.

=== Cathodic protection ===
Cathodic protection is a technique used to inhibit corrosion on buried or immersed structures by supplying an electrical charge that suppresses the electrochemical reaction. If correctly applied, corrosion can be stopped completely. In its simplest form, it is achieved by attaching a sacrificial anode, thereby making the iron or steel the cathode in the cell formed. The sacrificial anode must be made from something with a more negative electrode potential than the iron or steel, commonly zinc, aluminium, or magnesium. The sacrificial anode will eventually corrode away, ceasing its protective action unless it is replaced in a timely manner.

Cathodic protection can also be provided by using an applied electrical current. This would then be known as ICCP Impressed Current Cathodic Protection.

=== Coatings and painting ===

Rust formation can be controlled with coatings, such as paint, lacquer, varnish, or wax tapes that isolate the iron from the environment. Large structures with enclosed box sections, such as ships and modern automobiles, often have a wax-based product (technically a &quot;slushing oil&quot;) injected into these sections. Such treatments usually also contain rust inhibitors. Covering steel with concrete can provide some protection to steel because of the alkaline pH environment at the steel–concrete interface. However, rusting of steel in concrete can still be a problem, as expanding rust can fracture concrete from within.

As a closely related example, iron clamps were used to join marble blocks during a restoration attempt of the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, in 1898, but caused extensive damage to the marble by the rusting and swelling of unprotected iron. The ancient Greek builders had used a similar fastening system for the marble blocks during construction, however, they also poured molten lead over the iron joints for protection from seismic shocks as well as from corrosion. This method was successful for the 2500-year-old structure, but in less than a century the crude repairs were in imminent danger of collapse.
When only temporary protection is needed for storage or transport, a thin layer of oil, grease or a special mixture such as Cosmoline can be applied to an iron surface. Such treatments are extensively used when &quot;mothballing&quot; a steel ship, automobile, or other equipment for long-term storage.

Special anti-seize lubricant mixtures are available and are applied to metallic threads and other precision machined surfaces to protect them from rust. These compounds usually contain grease mixed with copper, zinc, or aluminium powder, and other proprietary ingredients.

=== Bluing ===
Bluing is a technique that can provide limited resistance to rusting for small steel items, such as firearms; for it to be successful, a water-displacing oil is rubbed onto the blued steel and other steel .

=== Inhibitors ===
Corrosion inhibitors, such as gas-phase or volatile inhibitors, can be used to prevent corrosion inside sealed systems. They are not effective when air circulation disperses them, and brings in fresh oxygen and moisture.

=== Humidity control ===
Rust can be avoided by controlling the moisture in the atmosphere. An example of this is the use of silica gel packets to control humidity in equipment shipped by sea.

== Treatment ==

Rust removal from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket filled with an electrolyte consisting of washing soda dissolved in tap water, a length of rebar suspended vertically in the solution to act as an anode, another laid across the top of the bucket to act as a support for suspending the object, baling wire to suspend the object in the solution from the horizontal rebar, and a battery charger as a power source in which the positive terminal is clamped to the anode and the negative terminal is clamped to the object to be treated which becomes the cathode. Hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced at the cathode and anode respectively. This mixture is flammable/explosive. Care should also be taken to avoid hydrogen embrittlement. Overvoltage also produces small amounts of ozone, which is highly toxic, so a low voltage phone charger is a far safer source of DC current. The effects of hydrogen on global warming have also recently come under scrutiny. 

Rust may be treated with commercial products known as rust converter which contain tannic acid or phosphoric acid which combines with rust; removed with organic acids like citric acid and vinegar or the stronger hydrochloric acid; or removed with chelating agents as in some commercial formulations or even a solution of molasses.

== Economic effect ==


Rust is associated with the degradation of iron-based tools and structures. As rust has a much higher volume than the originating mass of iron, its buildup can also cause failure by forcing apart adjacent parts — a phenomenon sometimes known as &quot;rust packing&quot;. It was the cause of the collapse of the Mianus river bridge in 1983, when the bearings rusted internally and pushed one corner of the road slab off its support.

Rust was an important factor in the Silver Bridge disaster of 1967 in West Virginia, when a steel suspension bridge collapsed in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers and passengers on the bridge at the time. The Kinzua Bridge in Pennsylvania was blown down by a tornado in 2003, largely because the central base bolts holding the structure to the ground had rusted away, leaving the bridge anchored by gravity alone.

Reinforced concrete is also vulnerable to rust damage. Internal pressure caused by expanding corrosion of concrete-covered steel and iron can cause the concrete to spall, creating severe structural problems. It is one of the most common failure modes of reinforced concrete bridges and buildings.

== Cultural symbolism ==

Rust is a commonly used metaphor for slow decay due to neglect, since it gradually converts robust iron and steel metal into a soft crumbling powder. A wide section of the industrialized American Midwest and American Northeast, once dominated by steel foundries, the automotive industry, and other manufacturers, has experienced harsh economic cutbacks that have caused the region to be dubbed the &quot;Rust Belt&quot;.

In music, literature, and art, rust is associated with images of faded glory, neglect, decay, and ruin.

<text>In mathematics, the branch of real analysis studies the behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions. Some particular properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include convergence, limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability.

Real analysis is distinguished from complex analysis, which deals with the study of complex numbers and their functions.

==Scope==
===Construction of the real numbers===

The theorems of real analysis rely on the properties of the real number system, which must be established. The real number system consists of an uncountable set (formula_1), together with two binary operations denoted and , and a total order denoted . The operations make the real numbers a field, and, along with the order, an ordered field. The real number system is the unique &quot;complete ordered field&quot;, in the sense that any other complete ordered field is isomorphic to it. Intuitively, completeness means that there are no &#x27;gaps&#x27; (or &#x27;holes&#x27;) in the real numbers. This property distinguishes the real numbers from other ordered fields (e.g., the rational numbers formula_2) and is critical to the proof of several key properties of functions of the real numbers. The completeness of the reals is often conveniently expressed as the &quot;least upper bound property&quot; (see below).

===Order properties of the real numbers===
The real numbers have various lattice-theoretic properties that are absent in the complex numbers. Also, the real numbers form an ordered field, in which sums and products of positive numbers are also positive. Moreover, the ordering of the real numbers is total, and the real numbers have the least upper bound property: &quot;Every nonempty subset of formula_1 that has an upper bound has a least upper bound that is also a real number.&quot; These order-theoretic properties lead to a number of fundamental results in real analysis, such as the monotone convergence theorem, the intermediate value theorem and the mean value theorem.

However, while the results in real analysis are stated for real numbers, many of these results can be generalized to other mathematical objects. In particular, many ideas in functional analysis and operator theory generalize properties of the real numbers – such generalizations include the theories of Riesz spaces and positive operators. Also, mathematicians consider real and imaginary parts of complex sequences, or by pointwise evaluation of operator sequences.

=== Topological properties of the real numbers ===
Many of the theorems of real analysis are consequences of the topological properties of the real number line. The order properties of the real numbers described above are closely related to these topological properties. As a topological space, the real numbers has a &quot;standard topology&quot;, which is the order topology induced by order formula_4. Alternatively, by defining the &quot;metric&quot; or &quot;distance function&quot; formula_5 using the absolute value function as the real numbers become the prototypical example of a metric space. The topology induced by metric formula_6 turns out to be identical to the standard topology induced by order formula_4. Theorems like the intermediate value theorem that are essentially topological in nature can often be proved in the more general setting of metric or topological spaces rather than in formula_1 only. Often, such proofs tend to be shorter or simpler compared to classical proofs that apply direct methods.

===Sequences===

A sequence is a function whose domain is a countable, totally ordered set. The domain is usually taken to be the natural numbers, although it is occasionally convenient to also consider bidirectional sequences indexed by the set of all integers, including negative indices.

Of interest in real analysis, a real-valued sequence, here indexed by the natural numbers, is a map formula_9. Each formula_10 is referred to as a term (or, less commonly, an element) of the sequence. A sequence is rarely denoted explicitly as a function; instead, by convention, it is almost always notated as if it were an ordered ∞-tuple, with individual terms or a general term enclosed in parentheses:
formula_11
A sequence that tends to a limit (i.e., formula_12 exists) is said to be convergent; otherwise it is divergent. (&quot;See the section on limits and convergence for details.&quot;) A real-valued sequence formula_13 is bounded if there exists formula_14 such that formula_15 for all formula_16. A real-valued sequence formula_13 is monotonically increasing or decreasing if
formula_18
or
formula_19
holds, respectively. If either holds, the sequence is said to be monotonic. The monotonicity is strict if the chained inequalities still hold with formula_20 or formula_21 replaced by &lt; or &gt;.

Given a sequence formula_13, another sequence formula_23 is a subsequence of formula_13 if formula_25 for all positive integers formula_26 and formula_27 is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.

===Limits and convergence===

Roughly speaking, a limit is the value that a function or a sequence &quot;approaches&quot; as the input or index approaches some value. (This value can include the symbols formula_28 when addressing the behavior of a function or sequence as the variable increases or decreases without bound.) The idea of a limit is fundamental to calculus (and mathematical analysis in general) and its formal definition is used in turn to define notions like continuity, derivatives, and integrals. (In fact, the study of limiting behavior has been used as a characteristic that distinguishes calculus and mathematical analysis from other branches of mathematics.)

The concept of limit was informally introduced for functions by Newton and Leibniz, at the end of the 17th century, for building infinitesimal calculus. For sequences, the concept was introduced by Cauchy, and made rigorous, at the end of the 19th century by Bolzano and Weierstrass, who gave the modern ε-δ definition, which follows.

Definition. Let formula_29 be a real-valued function defined on We say that formula_30 tends to formula_31 as formula_32 approaches formula_33, or that the limit of formula_30 as formula_32 approaches formula_33 is formula_31 if, for any formula_38, there exists formula_39 such that for all formula_40, formula_41 implies that formula_42. We write this symbolically as
formula_43 or as formula_44
Intuitively, this definition can be thought of in the following way: We say that formula_45 as formula_46, when, given any positive number formula_47, no matter how small, we can always find a formula_48, such that we can guarantee that formula_30 and formula_31 are less than formula_47 apart, as long as formula_32 (in the domain of formula_29) is a real number that is less than formula_48 away from formula_33 but distinct from formula_33. The purpose of the last stipulation, which corresponds to the condition formula_57 in the definition, is to ensure that formula_58 does not imply anything about the value of formula_59 itself. Actually, formula_33 does not even need to be in the domain of formula_29 in order for formula_62 to exist.

In a slightly different but related context, the concept of a limit applies to the behavior of a sequence formula_13 when formula_64 becomes large.

Definition. Let formula_13 be a real-valued sequence. We say that formula_13 converges to formula_67 if, for any formula_68, there exists a natural number formula_69 such that formula_70 implies that formula_71. We write this symbolically as
formula_72or asformula_73
if formula_13 fails to converge, we say that formula_13 diverges.

Generalizing to a real-valued function of a real variable, a slight modification of this definition (replacement of sequence formula_13 and term formula_77 by function formula_29 and value formula_30 and natural numbers formula_69 and formula_64 by real numbers formula_82 and formula_32, respectively) yields the definition of the limit of formula_30 as formula_32 increases without bound, notated formula_86. Reversing the inequality formula_87 to formula_88 gives the corresponding definition of the limit of formula_30 as formula_32 &quot;decreases&quot; &quot;without bound&quot;, 

Sometimes, it is useful to conclude that a sequence converges, even though the value to which it converges is unknown or irrelevant. In these cases, the concept of a Cauchy sequence is useful.

Definition. Let formula_13 be a real-valued sequence. We say that formula_13 is a Cauchy sequence if, for any formula_68, there exists a natural number formula_69 such that formula_95 implies that formula_96.

It can be shown that a real-valued sequence is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. This property of the real numbers is expressed by saying that the real numbers endowed with the standard metric, formula_97, is a complete metric space. In a general metric space, however, a Cauchy sequence need not converge.

In addition, for real-valued sequences that are monotonic, it can be shown that the sequence is bounded if and only if it is convergent.

==== Uniform and pointwise convergence for sequences of functions ====

In addition to sequences of numbers, one may also speak of &quot;sequences of functions&quot; &quot;on&quot; formula_98, that is, infinite, ordered families of functions formula_99, denoted formula_100, and their convergence properties. However, in the case of sequences of functions, there are two kinds of convergence, known as &quot;pointwise convergence&quot; and &quot;uniform convergence&quot;, that need to be distinguished.

Roughly speaking, pointwise convergence of functions formula_101 to a limiting function formula_102, denoted formula_103, simply means that given any formula_40, formula_105 as formula_106. In contrast, uniform convergence is a stronger type of convergence, in the sense that a uniformly convergent sequence of functions also converges pointwise, but not conversely. Uniform convergence requires members of the family of functions, formula_101, to fall within some error formula_68 of formula_29 for &quot;every value of formula_40&quot;, whenever formula_70, for some integer formula_69. For a family of functions to uniformly converge, sometimes denoted formula_113, such a value of formula_69 must exist for any formula_38 given, no matter how small. Intuitively, we can visualize this situation by imagining that, for a large enough formula_69, the functions formula_117 are all confined within a &#x27;tube&#x27; of width formula_118 about formula_29 (that is, between formula_120 and formula_121) &quot;for every value in their domain&quot; formula_122.

The distinction between pointwise and uniform convergence is important when exchanging the order of two limiting operations (e.g., taking a limit, a derivative, or integral) is desired: in order for the exchange to be well-behaved, many theorems of real analysis call for uniform convergence. For example, a sequence of continuous functions (see below) is guaranteed to converge to a continuous limiting function if the convergence is uniform, while the limiting function may not be continuous if convergence is only pointwise. Karl Weierstrass is generally credited for clearly defining the concept of uniform convergence and fully investigating its implications.

=== Compactness ===
Compactness is a concept from general topology that plays an important role in many of the theorems of real analysis. The property of compactness is a generalization of the notion of a set being &quot;closed&quot; and &quot;bounded&quot;. (In the context of real analysis, these notions are equivalent: a set in Euclidean space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.) Briefly, a closed set contains all of its boundary points, while a set is bounded if there exists a real number such that the distance between any two points of the set is less than that number. In formula_1, sets that are closed and bounded, and therefore compact, include the empty set, any finite number of points, closed intervals, and their finite unions. However, this list is not exhaustive; for instance, the set formula_124 is a compact set; the Cantor ternary set formula_125 is another example of a compact set. On the other hand, the set formula_126 is not compact because it is bounded but not closed, as the boundary point 0 is not a member of the set. The set formula_127 is also not compact because it is closed but not bounded.

For subsets of the real numbers, there are several equivalent definitions of compactness.

Definition. A set formula_128 is compact if it is closed and bounded.

This definition also holds for Euclidean space of any finite dimension, formula_129, but it is not valid for metric spaces in general. The equivalence of the definition with the definition of compactness based on subcovers, given later in this section, is known as the Heine-Borel theorem.

A more general definition that applies to all metric spaces uses the notion of a subsequence (see above).

Definition. A set formula_122 in a metric space is compact if every sequence in formula_122 has a convergent subsequence.

This particular property is known as &quot;subsequential compactness&quot;. In formula_1, a set is subsequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded, making this definition equivalent to the one given above. Subsequential compactness is equivalent to the definition of compactness based on subcovers for metric spaces, but not for topological spaces in general.

The most general definition of compactness relies on the notion of &quot;open covers&quot; and &quot;subcovers&quot;, which is applicable to topological spaces (and thus to metric spaces and formula_1 as special cases). In brief, a collection of open sets formula_134 is said to be an &quot;open cover&quot; of set formula_135 if the union of these sets is a superset of formula_135. This open cover is said to have a &quot;finite subcover&quot; if a finite subcollection of the formula_134 could be found that also covers formula_135.

Definition. A set formula_135 in a topological space is compact if every open cover of formula_135 has a finite subcover.

Compact sets are well-behaved with respect to properties like convergence and continuity. For instance, any Cauchy sequence in a compact metric space is convergent. As another example, the image of a compact metric space under a continuous map is also compact.

===Continuity===

A function from the set of real numbers to the real numbers can be represented by a graph in the Cartesian plane; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken curve with no &quot;holes&quot; or &quot;jumps&quot;.

There are several ways to make this intuition mathematically rigorous. Several definitions of varying levels of generality can be given. In cases where two or more definitions are applicable, they are readily shown to be equivalent to one another, so the most convenient definition can be used to determine whether a given function is continuous or not. In the first definition given below, formula_141 is a function defined on a non-degenerate interval formula_142 of the set of real numbers as its domain. Some possibilities include formula_143, the whole set of real numbers, an open interval formula_144 or a closed interval formula_145 Here, formula_67 and formula_147 are distinct real numbers, and we exclude the case of formula_142 being empty or consisting of only one point, in particular.

Definition. If formula_149 is a non-degenerate interval, we say that formula_150 is continuous at formula_151 if formula_152. We say that formula_29 is a continuous map if formula_29 is continuous at every formula_151.

In contrast to the requirements for formula_29 to have a limit at a point formula_157, which do not constrain the behavior of formula_29 at formula_157 itself, the following two conditions, in addition to the existence of formula_160, must also hold in order for formula_29 to be continuous at formula_157: (i) formula_29 must be defined at formula_157, i.e., formula_157 is in the domain of formula_29; &quot;and&quot; (ii) formula_167 as formula_168. The definition above actually applies to any domain formula_122 that does not contain an isolated point, or equivalently, formula_122 where every formula_171 is a limit point of formula_122. A more general definition applying to formula_173 with a general domain formula_174 is the following:

Definition. If formula_135 is an arbitrary subset of formula_1, we say that formula_173 is continuous at formula_178 if, for any formula_38, there exists formula_39 such that for all formula_181, formula_182 implies that formula_183. We say that formula_29 is a continuous map if formula_29 is continuous at every formula_178.

A consequence of this definition is that formula_29 is &quot;trivially continuous at any isolated point&quot; formula_178. This somewhat unintuitive treatment of isolated points is necessary to ensure that our definition of continuity for functions on the real line is consistent with the most general definition of continuity for maps between topological spaces (which includes metric spaces and formula_1 in particular as special cases). This definition, which extends beyond the scope of our discussion of real analysis, is given below for completeness.

Definition. If formula_135 and formula_191 are topological spaces, we say that formula_192 is continuous at formula_178 if formula_194 is a neighborhood of formula_157 in formula_135 for every neighborhood formula_197 of formula_198 in formula_191. We say that formula_29 is a continuous map if formula_201 is open in formula_135 for every formula_203 open in formula_191.

(Here, formula_205 refers to the preimage of formula_206 under formula_29.)

====Uniform continuity====

Definition. If formula_135 is a subset of the real numbers, we say a function formula_173 is uniformly continuous on formula_135 if, for any formula_68, there exists a formula_39 such that for all formula_213, formula_214 implies that formula_215.

Explicitly, when a function is uniformly continuous on formula_135, the choice of formula_48 needed to fulfill the definition must work for &quot;all of&quot; formula_135 for a given formula_47. In contrast, when a function is continuous at every point formula_178 (or said to be continuous on formula_135), the choice of formula_48 may depend on both formula_47 &quot;and&quot; formula_157. In contrast to simple continuity, uniform continuity is a property of a function that only makes sense with a specified domain; to speak of uniform continuity at a single point formula_157 is meaningless.

On a compact set, it is easily shown that all continuous functions are uniformly continuous. If formula_122 is a bounded noncompact subset of formula_1, then there exists formula_102 that is continuous but not uniformly continuous. As a simple example, consider formula_229 defined by formula_230. By choosing points close to 0, we can always make formula_231 for any single choice of formula_39, for a given formula_68.

====Absolute continuity====

Definition. Let formula_234 be an interval on the real line. A function formula_235 is said to be absolutely continuous on formula_142 if for every positive number formula_47, there is a positive number formula_48 such that whenever a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals formula_239 of formula_142 satisfies
:formula_241
then
:formula_242
Absolutely continuous functions are continuous: consider the case &quot;n&quot; = 1 in this definition. The collection of all absolutely continuous functions on &quot;I&quot; is denoted AC(&quot;I&quot;). Absolute continuity is a fundamental concept in the Lebesgue theory of integration, allowing the formulation of a generalized version of the fundamental theorem of calculus that applies to the Lebesgue integral.

===Differentiation===

The notion of the &quot;derivative&quot; of a function or &quot;differentiability&quot; originates from the concept of approximating a function near a given point using the &quot;best&quot; linear approximation. This approximation, if it exists, is unique and is given by the line that is tangent to the function at the given point formula_67, and the slope of the line is the derivative of the function at formula_67.

A function formula_245 is differentiable at formula_67 if the limit

:formula_247

exists. This limit is known as the derivative of formula_29 at formula_67, and the function formula_250, possibly defined on only a subset of formula_1, is the derivative (or derivative function) of formula_29. If the derivative exists everywhere, the function is said to be differentiable.

As a simple consequence of the definition, formula_29 is continuous at formula_67 if it is differentiable there. Differentiability is therefore a stronger regularity condition (condition describing the &quot;smoothness&quot; of a function) than continuity, and it is possible for a function to be continuous on the entire real line but not differentiable anywhere (see Weierstrass&#x27;s nowhere differentiable continuous function). It is possible to discuss the existence of higher-order derivatives as well, by finding the derivative of a derivative function, and so on.

One can classify functions by their differentiability class. The class formula_255 (sometimes formula_256 to indicate the interval of applicability) consists of all continuous functions. The class formula_257 consists of all differentiable functions whose derivative is continuous; such functions are called continuously differentiable. Thus, a formula_257 function is exactly a function whose derivative exists and is of class formula_255. In general, the classes &quot;formula_260&quot; can be defined recursively by declaring formula_255 to be the set of all continuous functions and declaring &quot;formula_260&quot; for any positive integer formula_26 to be the set of all differentiable functions whose derivative is in formula_264. In particular, &quot;formula_260&quot; is contained in formula_264 for every formula_26, and there are examples to show that this containment is strict. Class formula_268 is the intersection of the sets &quot;formula_260&quot; as &quot;formula_26&quot; varies over the non-negative integers, and the members of this class are known as the smooth functions. Class formula_271 consists of all analytic functions, and is strictly contained in formula_268 (see bump function for a smooth function that is not analytic).

===Series===

A series formalizes the imprecise notion of taking the sum of an endless sequence of numbers. The idea that taking the sum of an &quot;infinite&quot; number of terms can lead to a finite result was counterintuitive to the ancient Greeks and led to the formulation of a number of paradoxes by Zeno and other philosophers. The modern notion of assigning a value to a series avoids dealing with the ill-defined notion of adding an &quot;infinite&quot; number of terms. Instead, the finite sum of the first formula_64 terms of the sequence, known as a partial sum, is considered, and the concept of a limit is applied to the sequence of partial sums as formula_64 grows without bound. The series is assigned the value of this limit, if it exists.

Given an (infinite) sequence formula_13, we can define an associated series as the formal mathematical object sometimes simply written as formula_276. The partial sums of a series formula_276 are the numbers formula_278. A series formula_276 is said to be convergent if the sequence consisting of its partial sums, formula_280, is convergent; otherwise it is divergent. The sum of a convergent series is defined as the number 

The word &quot;sum&quot; is used here in a metaphorical sense as a shorthand for taking the limit of a sequence of partial sums and should not be interpreted as simply &quot;adding&quot; an infinite number of terms. For instance, in contrast to the behavior of finite sums, rearranging the terms of an infinite series may result in convergence to a different number (see the article on the &quot;Riemann rearrangement theorem&quot; for further discussion).

An example of a convergent series is a geometric series which forms the basis of one of Zeno&#x27;s famous paradoxes:

:formula_281

In contrast, the harmonic series has been known since the Middle Ages to be a divergent series:

:formula_282

(Here, &quot;formula_283&quot; is merely a notational convention to indicate that the partial sums of the series grow without bound.)

A series formula_276 is said to converge absolutely if formula_285 is convergent. A convergent series formula_276 for which formula_285 diverges is said to converge non-absolutely. It is easily shown that absolute convergence of a series implies its convergence. On the other hand, an example of a series that converges non-absolutely is

:formula_288

====Taylor series====

The Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number &quot;a&quot; is the power series
:formula_289

which can be written in the more compact sigma notation as

:formula_290

where &quot;n&quot;! denotes the factorial of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;ƒ&quot; (&quot;n&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;) denotes the &quot;n&quot;th derivative of &quot;ƒ&quot; evaluated at the point &quot;a&quot;. The derivative of order zero &quot;ƒ&quot; is defined to be &quot;ƒ&quot; itself and and 0! are both defined to be 1. In the case that , the series is also called a Maclaurin series.

A Taylor series of &quot;f&quot; about point &quot;a&quot; may diverge, converge at only the point &quot;a&quot;, converge for all &quot;x&quot; such that formula_291 (the largest such &quot;R&quot; for which convergence is guaranteed is called the &quot;radius of convergence&quot;), or converge on the entire real line. Even a converging Taylor series may converge to a value different from the value of the function at that point. If the Taylor series at a point has a nonzero radius of convergence, and sums to the function in the disc of convergence, then the function is analytic. The analytic functions have many fundamental properties. In particular, an analytic function of a real variable extends naturally to a function of a complex variable. It is in this way that the exponential function, the logarithm, the trigonometric functions and their inverses are extended to functions of a complex variable.

====Fourier series====
Fourier series decomposes periodic functions or periodic signals into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or complex exponentials). The study of Fourier series typically occurs and is handled within the branch mathematics &gt; mathematical analysis &gt; Fourier analysis.

===Integration===
Integration is a formalization of the problem of finding the area bound by a curve and the related problems of determining the length of a curve or volume enclosed by a surface. The basic strategy to solving problems of this type was known to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and was known as the &quot;method of exhaustion&quot;. Generally speaking, the desired area is bounded from above and below, respectively, by increasingly accurate circumscribing and inscribing polygonal approximations whose exact areas can be computed. By considering approximations consisting of a larger and larger (&quot;infinite&quot;) number of smaller and smaller (&quot;infinitesimal&quot;) pieces, the area bound by the curve can be deduced, as the upper and lower bounds defined by the approximations converge around a common value.

The spirit of this basic strategy can easily be seen in the definition of the Riemann integral, in which the integral is said to exist if upper and lower Riemann (or Darboux) sums converge to a common value as thinner and thinner rectangular slices (&quot;refinements&quot;) are considered. Though the machinery used to define it is much more elaborate compared to the Riemann integral, the Lebesgue integral was defined with similar basic ideas in mind. Compared to the Riemann integral, the more sophisticated Lebesgue integral allows area (or length, volume, etc.; termed a &quot;measure&quot; in general) to be defined and computed for much more complicated and irregular subsets of Euclidean space, although there still exist &quot;non-measurable&quot; subsets for which an area cannot be assigned.

====Riemann integration====

The Riemann integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums of functions with respect to tagged partitions of an interval. Let formula_292 be a closed interval of the real line; then a tagged partition formula_293 of formula_292 is a finite sequence

:formula_295

This partitions the interval formula_292 into formula_64 sub-intervals formula_298 indexed by formula_299, each of which is &quot;tagged&quot; with a distinguished point formula_300. For a function formula_29 bounded on formula_292, we define the Riemann sum of formula_29 with respect to tagged partition formula_293 as

:formula_305

where formula_306 is the width of sub-interval formula_307. Thus, each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. The mesh of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, formula_308. We say that the Riemann integral of formula_29 on formula_292 is formula_311 if for any formula_38 there exists formula_39 such that, for any tagged partition formula_293 with mesh formula_315, we have

::formula_316

This is sometimes denoted formula_317. When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum is known as the upper (respectively, lower) Darboux sum. A function is Darboux integrable if the upper and lower Darboux sums can be made to be arbitrarily close to each other for a sufficiently small mesh. Although this definition gives the Darboux integral the appearance of being a special case of the Riemann integral, they are, in fact, equivalent, in the sense that a function is Darboux integrable if and only if it is Riemann integrable, and the values of the integrals are equal. In fact, calculus and real analysis textbooks often conflate the two, introducing the definition of the Darboux integral as that of the Riemann integral, due to the slightly easier to apply definition of the former.

The fundamental theorem of calculus asserts that integration and differentiation are inverse operations in a certain sense.

====Lebesgue integration and measure====

Lebesgue integration is a mathematical construction that extends the integral to a larger class of functions; it also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined. The concept of a measure, an abstraction of length, area, or volume, is central to Lebesgue integral probability theory.

===Distributions===

Distributions (or generalized functions) are objects that generalize functions. Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.

===Relation to complex analysis===
Real analysis is an area of analysis that studies concepts such as sequences and their limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real analysis focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line. Real analysis is closely related to complex analysis, which studies broadly the same properties of complex numbers. In complex analysis, it is natural to define differentiation via holomorphic functions, which have a number of useful properties, such as repeated differentiability, expressibility as power series, and satisfying the Cauchy integral formula.

In real analysis, it is usually more natural to consider differentiable, smooth, or harmonic functions, which are more widely applicable, but may lack some more powerful properties of holomorphic functions. However, results such as the fundamental theorem of algebra are simpler when expressed in terms of complex numbers.

Techniques from the theory of analytic functions of a complex variable are often used in real analysis – such as evaluation of real integrals by residue calculus.

==Important results==
Important results include the Bolzano–Weierstrass and Heine–Borel theorems, the intermediate value theorem and mean value theorem, Taylor&#x27;s theorem, the fundamental theorem of calculus, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, Fatou&#x27;s lemma, and the monotone convergence and dominated convergence theorems.

== Generalizations and related areas of mathematics ==
Various ideas from real analysis can be generalized from the real line to broader or more abstract contexts. These generalizations link real analysis to other disciplines and subdisciplines. For instance, generalization of ideas like continuous functions and compactness from real analysis to metric spaces and topological spaces connects real analysis to the field of general topology, while generalization of finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to infinite-dimensional analogs led to the concepts of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces and, more generally to functional analysis. Georg Cantor&#x27;s investigation of sets and sequence of real numbers, mappings between them, and the foundational issues of real analysis gave birth to naive set theory. The study of issues of convergence for sequences of functions eventually gave rise to Fourier analysis as a subdiscipline of mathematical analysis. Investigation of the consequences of generalizing differentiability from functions of a real variable to ones of a complex variable gave rise to the concept of holomorphic functions and the inception of complex analysis as another distinct subdiscipline of analysis. On the other hand, the generalization of integration from the Riemann sense to that of Lebesgue led to the formulation of the concept of abstract measure spaces, a fundamental concept in measure theory. Finally, the generalization of integration from the real line to curves and surfaces in higher dimensional space brought about the study of vector calculus, whose further generalization and formalization played an important role in the evolution of the concepts of differential forms and smooth (differentiable) manifolds in differential geometry and other closely related areas of geometry and topology.

<text>Richard Benaud (; 6 October 1930 – 10 April 2015) was an Australian cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. Following his retirement from international cricket in 1964, Benaud became a highly regarded commentator on the game.

Benaud was a Test cricket all-rounder, blending leg spin bowling with lower-order batting aggression. Along with fellow bowling all-rounder Alan Davidson, he helped restore Australia to the top of world cricket in the late 1950s and early 1960s after a slump in the early 1950s. In 1958, he became Australia&#x27;s Test captain until his retirement in 1964. He became the first player to reach 200 wickets and 2,000 runs in Test cricket, reaching the milestone in 1963.

Gideon Haigh described him as &quot;perhaps the most influential cricketer and cricket personality since the Second World War.&quot; In his review of Benaud&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Anything But&quot;, Sri Lankan cricket writer Harold de Andrado wrote: &quot;Richie Benaud possibly next to Sir Don Bradman has been one of the greatest cricketing personalities as player, researcher, writer, critic, author, organiser, adviser and student of the game.&quot;

==Early years==
Benaud was born in Penrith, New South Wales, in 1930. He came from a cricket family, with his younger brother John Benaud also going on to become an Australian Test cricketer. His father Louis, a third-generation Australian of French Huguenot descent, was a leg spinner who played for Penrith District Cricket Club in Sydney Grade Cricket, gaining attention for taking all twenty wickets in a match against St. Marys for 65. Lou later moved to Parramatta region in western Sydney, and played for Cumberland. Benaud also used to live in Coraki, NSW.

It was here that Richie Benaud grew up, learning how to bowl leg breaks, googlies and topspinners under his father&#x27;s watch. Educated at Parramatta High School, Benaud made his first grade debut for Cumberland at age 16, primarily as a batsman.

In November 1948, at the age of 18, Benaud was selected for the New South Wales Colts, the state youth team. He scored 47 not out and took 3/37 in an innings win over Queensland. As a specialist batsman, he made his first-class debut for New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground against Queensland in the New Year&#x27;s match of the 1948–49 season. On a green pitch which was struck by a downpour on the opening day, Benaud&#x27;s spin was not used by Arthur Morris, and he failed to make an impression with the bat in his only innings, scoring only two. New South Wales were the dominant state at the time, and vacancies in the team were scarce, particularly as there were no Tests that season and all of the national team players were available for the whole summer.

Relegated to the Second XI after this match, he was struck in the head above the right eye by a ball from Jack Daniel while batting against Victoria in Melbourne, having missed an attempted hook. After 28 X-rays showed nothing, it was finally diagnosed that the crater in his forehead had resulted in a skull fracture and he was sidelined for the remainder of the season, since a second impact could have been fatal. He spent two weeks in hospital for the surgery. This was the only match he played for the second-string state team that summer.

In his early career, Benaud was a batting all-rounder, marked by a looping backlift which made him suspect against fast bowling but allowed him to have a wide attacking stroke range. At the start of the 1949–50 season, he was still in the Second XI, but when the Test players departed for a tour of South Africa soon afterwards, vacancies opened up. Benaud was recalled to the New South Wales First XI in late December for the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s fixtures. With Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Ernie Toshack, three of Australia&#x27;s leading four bowlers from the 1948 &quot;Invincibles&quot; tour of England unavailable, Benaud bowled heavily in some matches. However, he did not have much success in his five games, taking only five wickets at 54.00.

He took the wicket of Queensland batsman Bill Brown in his third match of the season. Benaud erroneously recalled in an autobiography that this was his maiden wicket—it was, in fact, his fourth—and described the ball as &quot;the worst I ever bowled&quot;. He had more success with the bat, scoring 93 and narrowly missing a century against South Australia. He added another fifty and ended with 250 runs at 31.25.

For the next season, England toured Australia, and with the Test players back, Benaud was initially forced out of the team. He was recalled for a match against the Englishmen. He was attacked by the touring batsmen, taking 1/75 from 16.5 overs in his first outing against an international outfit. His only wicket was that of the all-rounder Trevor Bailey. He scored 20 not out and was not called on to bowl in the second innings.

In the next Shield match against Victoria, led by Australian captain Lindsay Hassett, Benaud came in for attack. Hassett was known for his prowess against spin bowling, being the only batsman to score centuries in a match against the leg-spin of Bill O&#x27;Reilly, regarded as the finest bowler of his age. Hassett struck 179 in four hours, and took 47 runs from Benaud&#x27;s seven overs. The young leg spinner claimed Hassett in the second innings when a ball landed in a crack and skidded through onto his foot. He ended with 3/56, the first time he had taken three wickets in a match.

In the next match against South Australia, he made 48, took 4/93 and 1/29 and suffered three dropped catches by the wicketkeeper in successive balls. Benaud was cementing his position and was in the senior team for four consecutive matches even with the Test players available. He was selected for an Australian XI match against England, in what was effectively a trial for Test selection, but suffered a chipped bone in his thumb. This put him out of action until the last match of the season, leaving him with little opportunity to impress the national selectors for his rise to international cricket. Benaud returned and scored 37 and took a total of 2/68 in the final match, ending the season with 184 runs at 36.80 and 11 wickets at 34.63.

==Early Test career==
The 1951–52 season saw a tour to Australia by the West Indies. Benaud was given a chance against the visiting team when New South Wales played them in Sydney after the First Test. On a green pitch, Benaud came in at 7/96 and featured in a century partnership in only an hour, making 43 himself. The Caribbeans were skittled for 134 in reply and went on to lose the match, although they attacked the young leg-spinner, who took 1/130 in total from 36 overs. Benaud scored his maiden first-class century, 117 against South Australia, in the next match, two years after falling short of the milestone by seven runs. In the next four matches, Benaud passed 15 only once, scoring a 34, and took only seven wickets. Up to this point, in seven matches for the season, the young all-rounder had only scored 307 runs at 27.90 and taken ten wickets at 64.80.

Despite this, Benaud was chosen for his Test debut in the Fifth Test against the West Indies in 1951–52 in Sydney. At this point, Australia had already taken an unassailable 3–1 series lead and decided to try out some young players. Selected as a batsman, he scored 3 and 19. Hassett allowed him to bowl only in the second innings, when nine West Indian wickets had fallen and Australia were on the verge of an inevitable victory. Leading opposition batsman Everton Weekes edged Benaud in his first over, but Gil Langley dropped the catch. Benaud went on to dismiss tail-ender Alf Valentine for his first Test wicket, conceding 14 runs from 4.3 overs. Benaud ended his season with 97 and a total of 3/39 in an innings win over South Australia.

For the following Australian season in 1952–53, Benaud started modestly; and, in the five first-class matches before the Tests, he scored 208 runs at 26.00, including a 63 and 69, and 14 wickets at 38.64. This included figures of 2/70 and 4/90 against the touring
South Africa. However, this was not enough to ensure his selection in the First Test, where he was made 12th man. After scoring 60 and 37 and taking 1/60 in an Australian XI against the South Africans following the Test, he was selected for the Second Test. He suffered a smashed gum and a severely cut top lip when a square cut by John Waite in the Third Test against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground hit him in the face while he was fielding at short gully.

Doctors told him he was lucky: it could have broken his cheekbones, jaw or removed his eyesight if it had hit any of the surrounding areas. It could have killed him if it had struck him where his skull was previously fractured. He married after the match and had to mumble his wedding vows through a swathe of bandages. Benaud went on to play in the final four Tests. He made 124 runs at 20.66, making double figures in four of seven innings, but was unable to capitalise on his starts, with a top score of 45. His leg spin yielded ten wickets at 30.60, with a best of 4/118 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide when he was given a heavy workload, totalling 58 overs, when Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller broke down during the match. In another match for New South Wales against the touring team, he took a total of 5/95.

Up to this point, his first-class batting average was below 30 and his bowling average close to 40, and he had never taken more than four wickets in an innings or six in a match.

The selectors persisted in Benaud despite his unproductive Test performances, selecting him for the squad for the 1953 Ashes tour of England. He had been seventh and eighth in the domestic run-scoring and wicket-taking aggregates for the season, but was yet to convert this into international performance. He justified their decision prior to the team&#x27;s departure, scoring 167 not out and taking match figures of 7/137 for the touring team against a Tasmania Combined XI, his wickets including Test batsmen Miller, Ian Craig and Neil Harvey. He also put on 167 in a partnership with Alan Davidson, the first collaboration between the pair, who would later go on to lead Australia&#x27;s bowling in the last five years of their career. Benaud struck an unbeaten 100 and totalled 1/64 in the next match against Western Australia before the Australians departed for England.

On arrival in the British Isles, Benaud quickly made an impression with both bat and ball. After scoring 44 and taking 2/66 in the opening first-class match against Worcestershire, the all-rounder starred in his next match, against Yorkshire. He scored 97 in Australia&#x27;s only innings and then took 7/46 in the hosts&#x27; first innings as the Australians took an innings win. Although his form with the willow dropped off in his remaining six matches before the Tests—a 35 was his only score beyond 20 in seven attempts—Benaud continued to strike regularly with the ball. He took 18 wickets in these matches, including 3/20 and 3/37 against Oxford University, 5/13 against Minor Counties and 4/38 against Hampshire. This was enough for him to gain selection for the start of the Tests.

He managed only eight runs in four innings in the first two Tests, and having taken only two wickets for 136 runs was dropped for the Third. This was part of a month-long run in which he made only 123 runs in eight innings and took only seven wickets in four matches. He was recalled immediately for the Fourth Test, but was dropped for the Fifth after managing seven runs in his only innings and going wicketless. He ended the Test series with 15 runs at 3.00 and two wickets at 87.00. It was thought that the surface at the Oval would favour pacemen, but Australia&#x27;s selection proved to be a blunder as England&#x27;s spinners took them to the only win of the series, allowing them to regain the Ashes.

He also showed his hitting ability in a tour match against T.N. Pearce&#x27;s XI at Scarborough. Opening the batting, he struck 135 in 110 minutes in the second innings, including an Australian record of eleven sixes, four of them in one over. In eight first-class matches after his Test campaign was over, Benaud added a further half-century in addition to the century against Pearce&#x27;s XI, and took 22 more wickets, including 4/20 against the Gentlemen of England.

==Consolidation==
After returning home from his first overseas tour, Benaud was prolific during the 1953–54 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team. He contributed significantly with both bat and ball in New South Wales&#x27; Sheffield Shield triumph, the first of nine consecutive titles. In the opening match of the season, he struck 158 and took 5/88 and 1/65 against Queensland. He made another century in the return match, striking 144 not out and taking a total of 2/55. Midway through the season, he played in Morris&#x27;s XI in a testimonial match for Hassett, who captained the other team. Benaud scored 78 and 68 and took a total of 5/238, his dismissals being Davidson and frontline Test batsmen in a 121-run win. He then finished the summer strongly, and ended the season with 811 runs at 62.38 and 35 wickets at 30.54. Benaud was the only bowler selected for all five Tests of the 1954–55 series when England visited Australia. He secured his place after scoring 125 against Queensland at the start of the season, although his lead-up form in two matches against England for his state and an Australian XI was not encouraging.

At this stage of his career, he had played 13 Tests with mediocre results. Selected as a batsman who could bowl, he had totalled 309 runs at 15.45 without passing 50, and taken 23 wickets at 37.87 with only two four-wicket innings hauls. Even so, he was promoted to vice-captain above several senior players when Ian Johnson and Keith Miller missed the 2nd Test at Sydney through injury and Arthur Morris was made temporary captain. He also made 113 against the touring side for the Prime Minister&#x27;s XI.

Australia&#x27;s selectors persisted and selected him for the squad to tour the West Indies in 1954–55. Their faith was rewarded by an improvement in performances. Benaud contributed 46 and match figures of 2/73 in a First Test victory at Kingston. After a draw in the Second Test, he took three wickets in four balls to end with 4/15 in the first innings at Georgetown, Guyana, before scoring 68 (his first Test half century) as Australia moved to a 2–0 series lead. In the Fifth Test at Kingston, he struck a century in 78 minutes, despite taking 15 minutes to score his first run. He ended with 121 and took four wickets in the match as Australia won by an innings and took the series 3–0. Benaud had contributed 246 runs at 41 and taken wickets steadily to total 18 at 26.94.

During the 1956 tour to England, he helped Australia to its only victory in the Lord&#x27;s Test, when he scored a rapid 97 in the second innings in 143 minutes from only 113 balls. His fielding, in particular at gully and short leg, was consistently of a high standard, in particular his acrobatic catch to dismiss Colin Cowdrey. He was unable to maintain the standards he had set in the West Indies, contributing little apart from the Lord&#x27;s Test. He ended the series with 200 runs at 25 and eight wickets at 42.5.

Benaud&#x27;s bowling reached a new level on the return leg of Australia&#x27;s overseas tour, when they stopped in the Indian subcontinent in 1956–57 en route back to Australia. In a one-off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, he scored 56 and took 1/36 as Australia fell to defeat. He claimed his Test innings best of 7/72 in the first innings of the First Test in Madras, allowing Australia to build a large lead and win by an innings. It was his first five-wicket haul in a Test innings. After taking four wickets in the drawn Second Test in Bombay,

Benaud bowled Australia to victory in the Third Test in Calcutta, sealing the series 2–0. He took 6/52 and 5/53, his best-ever match analysis, ending the series with 113 runs at 18.83 and 24 wickets at 17.66.

It was the first of his successes against India, against whom he took his wickets at an average of 18. This put him in a small group of spinners whose career averages were inferior to their performances against India, generally regarded as the best players of spin in the world. At this stage of his career, he had yet to perform consistently with bat and ball simultaneously, apart from his breakthrough series in the Caribbean. He had managed, in the 14 Tests since then, 559 runs at 27.95 and 67 wickets at 24.98.

Benaud took part in Australia&#x27;s tour of New Zealand from February to March 1957. The tour included seven first-class matches, three of which were unofficial Tests. Benaud was the top wicket-taker on the tour, with 32 wickets at 19.31, and Australia&#x27;s top wicket-taker in the three matches against New Zealand, with 15 wickets at 21.73. Early in the tour, when the team visited Timaru to pay a minor match, Benaud went to a pharmacy to see if he could get something to soothe his spinning-fingers, which had been torn by his spinning action for many years. The pharmacist, Ivan James, suggested a treatment with calamine lotion and boracic acid. It worked at once, and Benaud used it thereafter. &quot;Meeting Ivan James was a remarkable piece of luck,&quot; he wrote later; &quot;walking into that chemist&#x27;s shop in Timaru saved my bowling career.&quot;

==Peak years and captaincy==

After a break in the international calendar of a year, the 1957–58 tour to South Africa heralded the start of a phase of three international seasons when Benaud was at his peak. The tour saw his bowling talents come to the fore when he took 106 wickets, surpassing the previous record of 104 by England&#x27;s Sydney Barnes. He scored 817 runs including four centuries, two of them in Test matches. The first of these came in the First Test at Johannesburg, where after conceding 1/115, Benaud struck 122, his highest Test score, to see Australia reach a draw.

In the Second Test at Cape Town, Benaud took 4/95 and then 5/49 in the second innings to secure an innings victory after the home team were forced to follow on. He followed this with 5/114 in a drawn Third Test, before a match-winning all round performance in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg. Benaud struck exactly 100 in the first innings, before taking 4/70 in South Africa&#x27;s reply. When South Africa followed on, Benaud took 5/84, which left Australia needing only one run to win. He took 5/82 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, the fourth consecutive match in which he had taken five wickets in an innings, as Australia took a 3–0 series win. He had been a major contributor to the series win, scoring 329 runs at 54.83 and taking 30 wickets at 21.93, establishing himself as one of the leading leg spinners of the modern era.

When Ian Craig fell ill at the start of the 1958–59 season, Benaud was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice-captain Neil Harvey. Harvey and Benaud had been captains of their respective states until Harvey moved in the same season for employment purposes from Victoria to New South Wales and became Benaud&#x27;s deputy. Benaud had little prior leadership experience, and faced the task of recovering the Ashes from an England team which had arrived in Australia as favourites. He led from the front with his bowling, taking match figures of 7/112 in his debut as captain as Australia claimed the First Test in Brisbane. Benaud&#x27;s men won the Second Test, before he took 5/83 and 4/94 in the drawn Third Test. Benaud produced an all-round performance of 46, 5/91 and 4/82 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead and regain the Ashes, before scoring 64 and match figures of 5/57 to help take the Fifth Test and a 4–0 series result. Benaud contributed 132 runs at 26.4 and 31 wickets at the low average of 18.83, as well as his shrewd and innovative captaincy. According to Neil Harvey, he also was the first captain who started hosting team meetings, a procedure now followed by his successors after he retired.

Benaud then led Australia on its first full tour of the Indian subcontinent, playing three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Benaud took 4/69 and 4/42 in the First Test in Dacca (now in Bangladesh), sealing Australia&#x27;s first win in Pakistan. He took four wickets in a Second Test in Lahore that sealed the series 2–0, the last time Australia would win a Test in Pakistan until Mark Taylor&#x27;s men in 1998, 37 years later. Six further wickets in the drawn Third Test saw Benaud end the series with 84 runs at 28 and 18 wickets at 21.11. Benaud made a strong start to the series against India, taking 3/0 in the first innings of the First Test in Delhi, before a 5/76-second innings haul secured an innings victory. Benaud had less of an impact on the next two Tests, which Australia lost and drew, totaling 6/244. He returned to form with 5/43 and 3/43 as India were defeated by an innings after being forced to follow on in the Fourth Test in Madras. A further seven wickets from the captain in the Fifth Test saw Australia secure a draw and the series 2–1.

Benaud had contributed 91 runs at 15.16 and 29 wickets at 19.59. The first two seasons of the Benaud captaincy had been a resounding success, with Australia winning eight, drawing four and losing only one Test. Benaud&#x27;s personal form was a major factor in this success. In the previous seasons when he and his team were at their peak, he had scored 636 runs at 31.8 with taken 108 wickets at 20.27 in eighteen Tests, averaging six wickets a match.

==Later career==
Benaud took over when Australian cricket was in a low phase with a young team. His instinctive, aggressive captaincy and daring approach to cricket – and his charismatic nature and public relations ability – revitalised cricket interest in Australia. This was exhibited in the 1960–61 Test series against the visiting West Indians, in which the grounds were packed to greater levels than they are today despite Australia&#x27;s population doubling since then.

The First Test in Brisbane ended in the first tie in Test history, which came about after Benaud and Alan Davidson, rather than settle for a draw, decided to risk defeat and play an attacking partnership, which took Australia to the brink of victory. Australia had fallen to 6/92 on the final day chasing a target of 233 with Benaud and Davidson at the crease. Australia&#x27;s chances of winning looked remote when they reached tea at 6/109 with 124 runs still required with only the tailenders to follow. Despite this, Benaud told chairman of selectors Don Bradman that he would still be going for an improbable victory in accordance with his policy of aggression. With an attacking partnership, the pair took Australia to within sight of the target.

Both men were noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most effective chance of survival. Regular boundaries and quickly-run singles took the score to 226, a seventh-wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as time was running short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single when a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out. Australia needed six runs from the final over, in which Benaud was caught and the last two wickets fell to run outs while attempting the winning run.

The Test was tied when Solomon ran out Ian Meckiff with a direct hit. Benaud had an ineffective match with the ball, taking 1/162. He took 4/107 in a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne, before the West Indies levelled the series with a 22-run win in Sydney. Benaud had a heavy load in the match, taking 8/199 after Davidson tore a hamstring mid-match. In Adelaide, with Davidson absent, Benaud bowled long spells to take match figures of 7/207 in addition to a score of 77 in the first innings. With Davidson back, Australia won the final Test by two wickets, after a controversial incident in which Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout was not given out hit wicket when a bail was dislodged and the umpires did not notice. Australia won the series 2–1, and although Benaud was below his best, scoring at 21.77 and taking 23 wickets at 33.87, the series was a success for cricket. The unprecedented public interest saw the Caribbean touring party farewelled with a ticker-tape parade by the Australian public. Along with the West Indian captain Frank Worrell, Benaud&#x27;s bold leadership enlivened interest in Test cricket among a public who had increasingly regarded it as boring.

On his third and final tour to England in 1961, he was hampered by damaged tendons in his right shoulder, which forced him to miss the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s known as the &quot;Battle of the Ridge&quot;. In all he missed a third of the matches due to injury. Despite this impairment to his bowling shoulder, his team played with an aggressive strategy leading them to lose only one Test match and no other matches during the tour, honouring his pre-series pledge. The First Test at Edgbaston was drawn with Benaud taking three wickets. After Harvey led the team to victory at Lord&#x27;s, Benaud had an unhappy return in the Third at Headingley scoring two runs in two innings and taking match figures of 2/108 as Australia lost within three days. With the series balanced at 1–1, the Fourth Test at Old Trafford initially brought no improvement, with Benaud scoring 2 and taking 0/80 in the first innings. He made 1 in the second before a last-wicket partnership between Davidson and Graham McKenzie of 98 yielded a defendable target.

During England&#x27;s chase on the final afternoon it became apparent that, with Ted Dexter scoring quickly, Australia would lose the Test unless England were bowled out. Benaud went around the wicket and bowled into the footmarks, having Dexter caught behind and then Peter May bowled around his legs. Benaud&#x27;s 5/13 in 25 balls instigated an English collapse which saw Australia retain the Ashes. He finished the innings with 6/70. Benaud then took four wickets in the drawn Fifth Test to end the series 2–1. Benaud had a poor series with the bat, scoring 45 runs at 9, but was more successful with the ball, taking 15 wickets at 32.53. He finished the first-class tour with 627 runs and 61 wickets at 23.54. He was appointed an OBE in that year and in 1962 was named as one of the &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year.

The 1961–62 Australian season was purely a domestic one, with no touring international team. Benaud led New South Wales throughout a dominant season, winning the Sheffield Shield with 64 of the 80 possible points. Benaud was the leading wicket-taker of the season with 47 at 17.97. His aggressive tactical style brought large crowds throughout the season, with almost 18,000 watching one match against South Australia.

In another match against Victoria, he ordered his team to attempt to score 404 on the final day to take an unlikely victory in accordance with a promise to score at 400 per day. At one stage, New South Wales were six wickets down with less than 150 runs scored, but Benaud refused to attempt to defend for a draw. He made 140, in a seventh-wicket partnership of 255 in just 176 minutes, an Australian record that still stands.

In 1962–63 an English team under Dexter visited Australia. Fred Trueman with 216 Test wickets and Brian Statham with 229 were poised to overtake the record of 236 Test wickets set by the assistant-manager Alec Bedser. Benaud was another contender with 219 wickets, but it was Statham who broke the record (only to be overtaken by Trueman in New Zealand) and Benaud had to be content with breaking Ray Lindwall&#x27;s Australian record of 228 Test wickets. In an early tour match Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18–10–18–7 for New South Wales against the MCC, which lost by an innings and 80 runs, the state&#x27;s biggest win against the English team. Benaud started the series with seven wickets and a half century as the First Test in Brisbane was drawn. This was followed by three unproductive Tests which yielded only 5/360 and a win apiece. Benaud returned to form with match figures of 5/142 and 57 in the Fifth Test at Sydney, which ended in a draw when Benaud ordered Bill Lawry and Peter Burge to play out the last afternoon for a draw that would retain the Ashes. They were booed and heckled as they left the field and Benaud&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;go ahead&quot; cricket captain was badly tarnished. The draw meant that the series was shared 1–1, the first time he had drawn a series after five successive wins. It was another lean series with the ball, Benaud&#x27;s 17 wickets costing 40.47, the third consecutive series where his wickets cost more than 30. His batting was reliable, with 227 runs at 32.47.

At the start of the 1963–64 season, Benaud announced that it would be his last at first-class level. The first Test of the season, against the touring South Africans, saw high drama as Australia&#x27;s left arm paceman Ian Meckiff was called for throwing by Colin Egar and removed from the attack by Benaud after one over. Benaud did not bowl Meckiff from the other end, and at the end of the match Meckiff announced his retirement. Benaud took 5/72 and scored 43 in the First Test, but then injured himself in a grade match, so Bob Simpson captained the team for the Second Test and won the match in Benaud&#x27;s absence.

Upon his return, Benaud advised the Australian Cricket Board that it would be in the better interests of the team if Simpson continued as captain for the remainder of the season. Benaud took 3/116 to complement scores of 43 and 90 on his return in the Third Test in Sydney. His final two Tests saw no fairytale finish, yielding only four wickets and 55 runs. His batting had been steady though with 231 runs at 33, but his bowling was less so, taking 12 wickets at 37.42.

Benaud was awarded life membership by the New South Wales Cricket Association, but he returned it in protest in 1970 when his younger brother John was removed from the captaincy. In 1967–68 he captained a Commonwealth team against Pakistan, playing in his last five first-class fixtures.

During Benaud&#x27;s captaincy, Australia did not lose a series, and became the dominant team in world cricket. His success was based on his ability to attack, his tactical boldness and his ability to extract more performance from his players, in particular Davidson. He was known for his unbuttoned shirt, and raised eyebrows with his on-field exuberance. Benaud embraced his players when opposition wickets fell, something that was uncommon at the time. Benaud&#x27;s bold leadership coupled with his charismatic nature and public relations ability enlivened interest in Test cricket among a public who had increasingly regarded it as boring.

==Playing style==
Benaud was not a large spinner of the ball, but he was known for his ability to extract substantial bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket at a time when he was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, he was tall and lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.

Johnnie Moyes said &quot;Certainly Benaud received a little help from the roughened patches, but he could do what the off-spinners could not do: he could turn the ball, mostly slowly, sometimes with more life. His control was admirable, and when Benaud gets a batsman in trouble he rarely if ever gives him a loose one. He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.&quot;

==Cricket career highlights==
*Early in his career, he hit 100 runs against the West Indies in 78 minutes, the third fastest Test century of all time (in terms of minutes at the crease, not balls faced) and the second fastest by an Australian. *Benaud was in charge for the inaugural 1960–61 Frank Worrell Trophy against the West Indies, a series that included the famous Tied Test.
*Benaud&#x27;s highest Test score of 122 was made against South Africa, Johannesburg, 1957–1958
*His best Test bowling effort of 7 for 72 was against India, Madras, 1956–1957
*He captained Australia in 28 Tests: 12 wins, 11 draws, 1 tie, 4 losses
*In 1963 he became the first player to complete the Test double of 200 wickets and 2,000 runs. He was one of only 10 Australian cricketers to have scored more than 10,000 runs and taken more than 500 wickets in first-class cricket. He ended his Test career in Sydney with statistics of 248 wickets (the Australia Test record at that time) at 27.03 and 2,201 runs at 24.45.

==Media career==

After the 1956 England tour, Benaud stayed behind in London to take a BBC presenter training course. He took up a journalism position with the &quot;News of the World&quot;, beginning as a police roundsman before becoming a sports columnist. In 1960, he made his first radio commentary in the United Kingdom at the BBC, after which he moved into television.

After retiring from playing in 1964, Benaud turned to full-time cricket journalism and commentary, dividing his time between Britain (where he worked for the BBC for many years before joining Channel 4 in 1999), and Australia (for the Nine Network). Overall he played in or commentated on approximately 500 Test matches, as he himself noted in one of his final interviews in Britain when asked if he would miss Test cricket.

He openly criticised the actions by the Chappell brothers (Trevor and Greg) in the post-match reaction to the underarm bowling incident of 1981. He vacated the commentary booth when New Zealand was about to clinch a Test victory at Lord&#x27;s in 1999, allowing former New Zealand captain-turned-commentator Ian Smith to call the famous victory of his compatriots. Some of his other memorable moments he commentated on included Shane Warne&#x27;s &quot;Ball of the Century&quot;, Ian Botham&#x27;s dominant all-round display during the 1981 Ashes, Dennis Lillee overtaking Benaud&#x27;s record for most wickets, and subsequent 300th and 310th wickets, and Andrew Symonds&#x27; tackle on a streaker.

The idea for what became his trademark—wearing a cream or white jacket during live commentary—came from Channel 9 owner Kerry Packer, who suggested the look to help Benaud stand out from the rest of the commentary team.

He also helped to design a computer-based parody of himself available for download off Channel 4&#x27;s website called &quot;Desktop Richie&quot;. It was developed by the software company Turtlez Ltd. Having downloaded this, cricket fans would be treated to live Test match updates and weather reports from a cartoon version of Benaud with real voice samples such as &quot;Got &#x27;im!&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s stumps ... and time for a glass of something chilled&quot;. On Channel 4&#x27;s live commentary, Benaud often made sarcastic comments regarding the advertisement of Desktop Richie.

In 2004, Benaud starred in a series of television advertisements for the Australian Tourism Commission, aimed at promoting Australia as a tourist destination. Benaud&#x27;s ad featured him in various scenic locations uttering his signature comment, &quot;Marvellous!&quot;. It was also emulated by New Zealand broadcaster John Campbell. He appeared in &quot;Richie Benaud&#x27;s Greatest XI&quot;, a video in which he chooses his own team.

Benaud became a staunch advocate of cricket being available on free-to-view TV. He chose to end his British commentary career, which spanned more than 42 years, when the rights to broadcast live Test match cricket were lost by Channel 4 to the subscription broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting. Thus, the 2005 Ashes series was the last that Benaud commentated on in Britain. His final commentary came near the end of the final day of the Fifth Test at the Oval. His last goodbye was interrupted by Glenn McGrath taking Kevin Pietersen&#x27;s wicket; Benaud simply wove his description of the dismissal into what he was already saying. Benaud stated he would spend the Northern Hemisphere summer in Britain writing, and would continue working for the Nine Network in Australia.

Benaud commentated for the BBC TV highlights of the 2006–07 Ashes in Australia as part of his continuing commentary work for Australia&#x27;s Nine Network.

Benaud&#x27;s distinctive speaking style has been frequently parodied on the Australian comedy series &quot;Comedy Inc.&quot; and &quot;The Twelfth Man&quot;. In the case of the latter, comedian Billy Birmingham&#x27;s impersonations of Benaud on The Twelfth Man comedy recordings have become very successful, spanning more than twenty years. Chris Barrie of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; fame incorporated impressions of Benaud into his stand-up repertoire.

On 18 February 2009, during a radio interview, Benaud announced that he would be retiring from television commentary. Benaud said: &quot;I&#x27;ll be doing Australian cricket next year—2010—but I don&#x27;t do any television at all anywhere else now and when I finish next year, then I&#x27;ll be doing other things ... But that&#x27;ll be no more television commentary&quot;.

It was announced on 15 November 2009, that Benaud had signed a three-year contract with the Nine Network to continue being part of their cricket coverage until 2013, although his role would change from that of ball-by-ball commentary. Benaud said: &quot;I won&#x27;t be doing live commentary any more.&quot; Someone asked me, &quot;Does that mean you&#x27;ll never again go into the commentary box?&quot;, &quot;Well, the answer to that&quot;, Benaud replied, &quot;If there is, as there always can be, some emergency or a sensational happening on or off the field where it would be quite ridiculous not to go into the commentary box, of course I&#x27;ll be in there doing my job and doing it as professionally as I can. But I won&#x27;t be on the live commentary roster. But I will be doing all sorts of, what I regard as, interesting things for Channel Nine on the cricket—special features on the cricket ...&quot;. Benaud commentated regularly during the 2011–12 season and was part of Nine&#x27;s commentating team/roster.

==Personal life==
Benaud married Marcia Lavender in 1953 and had two sons, Greg and Jeffery, from this marriage; he divorced Marcia in 1967. In 1967, he married his second wife, Daphne Surfleet, who had worked for the English cricket writer E. W. Swanton. Benaud and Daphne often stayed at their holiday home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer on the French Riviera.

On 29 October 2008, Benaud&#x27;s mother, Irene, died, aged 104. He said of her, &quot;She improved my love of vegetables by introducing the phrase, &#x27;You can&#x27;t go out and play cricket until you have eaten all your vegetables.&#x27;&quot;

In October 2013, Benaud crashed his vintage 1965 Sunbeam Alpine into a wall while driving near his home in Coogee, a beachside suburb in Sydney&#x27;s east. He sustained a cracked sternum and shoulder injuries. Slow recovery meant he was unable to commentate for Australia&#x27;s Channel Nine during the 2013–14 Ashes series.

Benaud had last handed &quot;Baggy green&quot; caps to Simon Katich and Mitchell Starc when they made their Test debuts. Benaud&#x27;s own was lost early in his Test career, and former captain—now commentator and the Director of Cricket Australia, Mark Taylor—was to present a replacement cap to him at the semi-final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup between Australia and India at the SCG, but Benaud was too unwell to attend, and when the cap arrived at Channel 9 headquarters, it was the day before Benaud died. It was presented to his wife.

==Death==
In November 2014, at age 84, Benaud announced that he had been diagnosed with skin cancer. He died in his sleep on 10 April 2015.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott offered his family a state funeral; his widow, Daphne, declined, respecting his wishes for a private funeral.

Benaud was buried on 15 April, in a private funeral ceremony attended only by his immediate family. Later that same day, there was a commemoration service officiated by former teammate turned lay preacher Brian Booth; attendees included his family and close friends—among them former players, including Ian Chappell and Shane Warne, and Australian Test captain Michael Clarke.

==Recognition==

Benaud was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1961 for services to cricket. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999, he was awarded a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Sports Broadcaster.

In 2007, he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame at the Allan Border Medal award evening and in 2009 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In November 2015, Benaud became an honouree at Bradman Foundation, having been a long-serving patron in his life. After rain interrupted the 2016 SCG Test against West Indies, the second day unofficially became Richie Benaud Day as 501 Benaud impersonators stayed at the SCG, which is a day before the annual Jane McGrath Day for Breast Cancer awareness and fundraising, which was again rained out.

In 2017, the Australian Mint issued a 50-cent coin commemorating Benaud.

In October 2018, Benaud became the 40th Legend in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

<text>The Radio Research Project was a social research project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation to look into the effects of mass media on society.

In 1937, the Rockefeller Foundation started funding research to find the effects of new forms of mass media on society, especially radio. Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. 

:A particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. Managed by Paul Lazarsfeld, Austrian émigré psychologist, the program was overseen by Hadley Cantril, Princeton psychologist, and Frank Stanton, director of research at CBS. The program was designed by Cantril and Stanton to determine why people listened to radio. Stanton, a psychological researcher who soon became CBS president, was naturally interested in what lured people to programs and to what extent a program and its ads boosted sales of products.

Among the subjects of the Project&#x27;s first studies were soap operas, known as radio dramas at the time. Herta Herzog authored an article on this research, titled &quot;What Do We Really Know About Daytime Serial Listeners?&quot; It is considered a pioneering work of the uses-and-gratifications approach and the use of psychology research methods in media studies. Herta Herzog was formerly the Associate Director of the Office of Radio Research where she worked on consulting studies.

The Radio Project also conducted research on the Halloween broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; in 1938. Of the estimated six million people who heard this broadcast, they found that 25% accepted the program&#x27;s reports of mass destruction. The majority of these did not think they were hearing a literal invasion from Mars, but rather an attack by Germany. The researchers determined that radio broadcasts from the Munich Crisis may have lent credence to this supposition. Pooley and Socolow (2013), however, contend that Cantril used inaccurate audience measurement methods which grossly overestimated the listening audience. Sensationalistic newspaper publicity following the broadcast also led to the myth of the terrorized audience that has continued well into the 21st century.

A third research project was that of listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience – this was dubbed the Little Annie Project. The official name was the Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer. This allowed one not only to find out if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, through a dial which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.

Theodor Adorno produced numerous reports on the effects of &quot;atomized listening&quot; which radio supported and of which he was highly critical. However, because of profound methodological disagreements with Lazarsfeld over the use of techniques such as listener surveys and &quot;Little Annie&quot; (Adorno thought both grossly simplified and ignored the degree to which expressed tastes were the result of commercial marketing), Adorno left the project in 1941.

<doc id="26484" wikidata="Q2002426" url="?curid=26484" title="Religious pluralism">
<text>Religious pluralism is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:

* Recognizing and tolerating the religious diversity of a society or country, promoting freedom of religion, and defining secularism as neutrality (of the state or non-sectarian institution) on issues of religion as opposed to opposition of religion in the public forum or public square that is open to public expression, and promoting friendly separation of religion and state as opposed to hostile separation or antitheism espoused by other forms of secularism. 
* Any of several forms of religious inclusivism. One such worldview holds that one&#x27;s own religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus acknowledges that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions. Another concept is that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid; this may be considered a form of either toleration (a concept that arose as a result of the European wars of religion) or moral relativism.
*&quot;Perennialism&quot; (based on the concept of &quot;philosophia perennis&quot;) is the understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. While some perennialists are universalists who accept religious syncretism, those of the Traditionalist School reject it, and uphold the importance of the historical, &quot;orthodox&quot; faiths.
* Sometimes as a synonym for ecumenism, i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different denominations within a single religion.
* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations.

==Definition and scopes==

Religious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in &quot;Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism&quot;, explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century United States. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called religious toleration: &quot;The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those &#x27;tolerated&#x27; could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.&quot; In short, religious toleration is only the absence of religious persecution, and does not necessarily preclude religious discrimination. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the Thirteen Colonies, at least if one views the events from &quot;a late eighteenth-century perspective&quot;. Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with &quot;something that is usually called religious liberty&quot;. Mark Silka, in &quot;Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis&quot;, states that religious pluralism &quot;enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a cultural construct that embodies some shared conception of how a country&#x27;s various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.&quot;

Religious pluralism can be defined as &quot;respecting the otherness of others&quot;. Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. Exclusivist religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some Protestant sects argue fiercely against Roman Catholicism, and fundamentalist Christians of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of Paganism and witchcraft are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the Enlightenment, and has informed governmental policy into the present day. For instance, Saudi Arabia has no protection for freedom of religion, and the country&#x27;s non-Muslim population are at risk for discrimination and arrest on religious grounds. Of course, many religious communities have long been engaged in building peace, justice, and development themselves, and the emergence of the secular peacemaking field has led religious communities to systematize and institutionalize their own peacebuilding and interfaith work. The Catholic Church has worked in development and poverty reduction, human rights, solidarity, and peace, and after World War II, it began to develop specific tools and apply conflict transformation practices.

Giving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the Lateran Treaty and Church of England. In the modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam for someone born into a Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into mosques, and forbid construction of churches, synagogues or temples in their countries.

Relativism, the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of inclusivism. Likewise, syncretism, the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. Syncretism must not be confused with ecumenism, the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a schism.

==History==
Cultural and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in post-modernity.

German philosophers of religion Ludwig Feuerbach and Ernst Troeltsch concluded that Asian religious traditions, in particular Hinduism and Buddhism, were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith and develop a personal religious construct within it (see also Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism); Jainism, another ancient Indian religion, as well as Daoism have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints. The Age of Enlightenment in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the French Revolution (liberalism, democracy, civil and political rights, freedom of thought, separation of Church and State, secularization), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and decline of Christianity. According to Chad Meister, these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.

==Classical civilization: Greek and Roman religions==

For the Romans, religion was part of the daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family&#x27;s domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances; in the Imperial Era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to religious festivals and games (&quot;ludi)&quot;. Women, slaves and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome&#x27;s most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestal Virgins, who tended Rome&#x27;s sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian persecution and domination.

The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.

Mystery religions imported from the Near East (Ptolemaic Egypt, Persia and Mesopotamia), which offered initiates salvation through a personal God and eternal life after the death, were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one&#x27;s family rites and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of &quot;magic&quot;, conspiracy (), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the Senate&#x27;s efforts to restrict the Bacchanals in 186 BC.
As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to absorb the deities and cults of other peoples rather than try to eradicate them, since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.

One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by supporting their religious heritage, building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local Gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous international deities were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote provinces (among them Cybele, Isis, Osiris, Serapis, Epona), and Gods of solar monism such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing monotheistic religions. The monotheistic rigor of Judaism posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.

==Christianity==


Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept.

Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Most Christians hold this idea to be logically impossible from the principle of contradiction. The two largest Christian branches, the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, both claim to be the &quot;one true church&quot; and that &quot;outside the true Church there is no salvation&quot;; Protestantism however, which has many different denominations, has no consistent doctrine in this regard, and has a variety of different positions regarding religious pluralism.

Other Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. John Macquarrie, described in the &quot;Handbook of Anglican Theologians&quot; (1998) as &quot;unquestionably Anglicanism&#x27;s most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century&quot;, wrote that &quot;there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the Baháʼí movement&quot; (p. 2). In discussing nine founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called &quot;mediators between the human and the divine&quot;, Macquarrie wrote that:

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.

===Classical Christian views===
Before the Great Schism, mainstream Christianity confessed &quot;one holy catholic and apostolic church&quot;, in the words of the Nicene Creed. Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Episcopalians and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the Catholic Church makes the claim that it alone is the one and only true Church founded by Jesus Christ, but the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.

Church unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of &quot;validity&quot; when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the &quot;form&quot; of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as &quot;heterodox&quot; and &quot;schismatic&quot;, while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least secundum quid (see ecumenicism).

===Modern Christian views===
Some other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation. They continue to believe in &quot;one&quot; church, an &quot;invisible church&quot; which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some evangelical Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this &quot;invisible church&quot;, and usually they reject religious (typically restorationist) movements rooted in 19th-century American Christianity, such as Mormonism, Christian Science, or Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as not distinctly Christian.

The Catholic Church, unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms &quot;developmental theology&quot;, understood to mean that the &quot;Holy Spirit, in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the deposit of faith (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles—these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize baptism of desire quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14–16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: &quot;When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires... They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts... Various forms of &quot;implicit faith&quot; come to hold standing, until at Vatican Council II, the Church declares: &quot;Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life&quot; (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration Nostra aetate addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them. Since Vatican Council II, Catholic dialogists in particular are working out the implications of John Paul II&#x27;s statement, in Redemptor hominis #6 that Christians should recognize &quot;the Holy Spirit operating outside the visible confines of the Mystical Body of Christ.&quot; Among these dialogists, Robert Magliola, an affiliate of the Italian community Vangelo e Zen (&quot;The Gospel and Zen&quot;), Desio and Milano, Italy, who taught in predominantly Buddhist cultures for years, and practiced Buddhist-Catholic dialogue there and in the West, and who is widely published in this dialogue, argues the following:
==Hinduism==

Hinduism is naturally pluralistic as it &quot;acknowledges different forms and representations of the divine, all understood in their relation to the supreme being, Brahman.&quot; Historians argue that the differentiations between the various Indic religions of the subcontinent were blurred before their specific codification and separation during British efforts to catalog different Indic philosophies. . Moreover, Hinduism itself is the oldest major religion, explaining a relative lack of antipathy towards specifiable religious traditions – and so the Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. From a Vedantic perspective, Swami Bhaskarananda argues that Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not. In the 8th sutra of the Pratyabhijñahrdyam, the Indian philosopher Ksemaraja says that all the siddhantas or theses of all the darsanas (schools of thought) are just the different aspects of the one Atman. It being all-pervading and all-inclusive, from matter to consciousness to nothingness, all are its aspects or its different roles. The Advaita Vedanta philosophy, a widely held view of many Hindus who follow Sanatana Dharma, encompasses pluralism.. Other, lesser-known philosophers have strived to encompass Indic philosophies under traditions other than Advaita, including the Indian philosopher Vijñabhikshu. Thus, the culture of open boundaries and continuous interaction and synthesis between all schools of thought is a very important aspect in understanding Hinduism and its fundamental nature of plurality.

In several mantras, sutras, smriti, and shruti, the idea that there are many ways to approach Truth or an underlying Reality is emphasized.

For example, the Rig Veda states that the Truth can be known in different ways:

The Rig Veda also envisions an ideal world where a diverse collective speaks together to focus upon an idea that pervades all:

The Uddhava Gita is explicit that those interested in spirituality should learn the perspectives of a diverse group of proficient practitioners rather than a singular one who espouses a specific doctrine:

Conversely, the Bhagavad Gita warns against exclusivism:

It also affirms Truth in a variety of spiritual practices:

==Buddhism==

Buddhist doctrine, fundamentally based upon minimizing or negating the suffering which arises from attachment, like its sister Indic religions, opposes exclusivism and emphasizes pluralism. This is not only encapsulated in the life story of the Buddha, who sought many gurus himself before resolving to seek Enlightenment on his own, but also in Buddhist scripture.

The Buddha also himself stated that truth is compromised when an individual is not open to entertaining a wide array of teachings. Moreover, without a pluralist understanding, the Buddha stated that truth cannot be discovered or ascertained such that it is truly known:

In the Lankavatara Sutra, the Buddha gave a long treatise on the idea that various expressions of Truth may seem contradictory or boundless, yet they all speak of Truth itself – emphasizing that an Enlightened One both accepts pluralism in that there are many ways to referring to Truth, but rises above it through the understanding that Truth transcends all labels.

When asked, &quot;Don&#x27;t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?&quot; the Dalai Lama said:

==Islam==


Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of Medina (then known as &quot;Yathrib&quot;), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and pagans was declared by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. In early Muslim history (until mid 11th century), most Islamic scholars maintained a level of separation from the state which helped to establish some elements of institutional religious freedom. The Islamic Caliphate later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept &quot;dhimmi&quot; status and their adult males pay the &quot;jizya&quot; tax instead of the &quot;zakat&quot; paid by Muslim citizens. Though Dhimmis were not given the same political rights as Muslims, they nevertheless did enjoy equality under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.

Religious pluralism existed in classical Islamic ethics and Sharia, as the religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system. In medieval Islamic societies, the &quot;qadi&quot; (Islamic judges) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily choose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the &quot;dhimmi&quot; communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who would have their own &quot;Halakha&quot; courts.

Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, such as the consumption of alcohol and pork, as well as religious practices which Muslims found repugnant, such as the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous &quot;self-marriage&quot; where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.

Despite Dhimmis enjoying special statuses under the Caliphates, they were not considered equals, and sporadic persecutions of non-Muslim groups did occur in the history of the Caliphates. 

The primary sources that guide Islam, namely Quran and Sunnahs, may be interpreted as promoting the fundamental right to practice an individual&#x27;s belief. However, the acceptability of religious pluralism within Islam remains a topic of active debate, though the vast majority of Islamic scholars and historical evidences reveal Islam&#x27;s commitment to no coercion in religion, supporting pluralism in the context of relative toleration. Hamed Kazemzadeh, a pluralist orientalist, argues that cultural absolutism of ours is, of course, today under heavy pressure, a double pressure of defining and semi-bankrupt imperialism and surprisingly strong counter assertive challenge that changed the mentality of Muslims to have a pluralist identity. Then he highlights the policy method of Islam Messenger in the early Islamic civilization toward other religions.

In Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the Jizya, a tax, with willing submission.
Some people have concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:
In Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the apostates. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution or attack the Muslims.
===Sufism===
The Sufis were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at a certain point. Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or Pir (Sufism) or fakeer or Wali in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters include Rumi, Shadhili, Sheikh Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Shams Tabrizi, Waris Shah, al-Ghazali, Mian Mir, Attar of Nishapur, Amir Khusrow, and Salim Chishti. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many taught that if one wants to change the world, one must change oneself and thereby change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also Blind men and an elephant. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan; however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols. Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other. He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi&#x27;s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.

Rumi says:

I looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn&#x27;t find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn&#x27;t find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn&#x27;t find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. 
Rumi also says:

How many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.
Rumi also says:
A true Lover doesn&#x27;t follow any one religion,
be sure of that.
Since in the religion of Love,
there is no irreverence or faith.
When in Love,
body, mind, heart and soul don&#x27;t even exist.
Become this,
fall in Love,
and you will not be separated again.
===Ahmadiyya===

Ahmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: &quot;And there is a guide for every people&quot;. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, Muhammad states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize Buddha, Krishna, founders of Chinese religions to be divinely appointed individuals.

The Second Khalifatul Maish of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community writes:
&quot;According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America—all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.&quot;

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community wrote in his book &quot;A Message of Peace&quot;:
&quot;Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America.&quot;

===In modern practice===
Religious pluralism is a contested issue in modern Islamic countries. Twenty-three Islamic countries have laws, as of 2014, which make it a crime, punishable with death penalty or prison, for a Muslim, by birth or conversion, to leave Islam or convert to another religion. In Muslim countries such as Algeria, it is illegal to preach, persuade or attempt to convert a Muslim to another religion. Saudi Arabia and several Islamic nations have strict laws against the construction of Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas anywhere inside the country, by anyone including minorities working there. Brunei in southeast Asia adopted Sharia law in 2013 that prescribes a death penalty for any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion. Other Islamic scholars state Sharia does not allow non-Muslim minorities to enjoy religious freedoms in a Muslim-majority nation, but other scholars disagree.

The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a multi-racial and multi-religious nation, where Muslims form the majority. Residents of Pakistan follow many of the major religions. Pakistan&#x27;s diverse cultural and religious heritage is part of its multicultural history, but there is a lack of tolerance towards religious minorities in Pakistan. Minorities are facing exploitation by extremist groups, and some sections of the society show hatred towards them, religious minorities are not allowed to join the mainstream of the society because of their religion.

==Jainism==
&quot;Anekāntavāda&quot;, the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of Jainism. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth. Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the Kevalins—the omniscient beings—can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it. Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth—only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with &quot;andhgajnyaya &quot;or the &quot;maxim of the blind men and elephant&quot;, wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective. For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of &quot;ekānta&quot; (one-sidedness). Openness to the truths of others is one way in which Jainism embodies religious pluralism.

==Sikhism==

The Sikh gurus have propagated the message of &quot;many paths&quot; leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who treading on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with Sufism as well as Hinduism, influenced them and was influenced by them.

The Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, says:
As well as:

Some call the Lord &quot;Ram, Ram&quot;, and some &quot;Khuda&quot;. Some serve Him as &quot;Gusain&quot;, others as &quot;Allah&quot;. He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer. Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran. Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God&#x27;s Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, page 885) 

One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142) 

The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)
The Guru Granth Sahib also says that Bhagat Namdev and Bhagat Kabir, who were both believed to be Hindus, both attained salvation though they were born before Sikhism took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru&#x27;s saying that &quot;peoples of other faiths&quot; can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.

Additionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:

First, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1||
Again, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:

Naam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His Shabad (&quot;word&quot;) lose their ego and class consciousness. (Guru Granth Sahib page 67) 
Most of the 15 Sikh Bhagats who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.

The pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words &quot;Na koi hindu na koi musalman&quot; – &quot;There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim&quot;. He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.

Sikhs have been considered eager exponents of interfaith dialogue and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar, who on the pleas of a pandit of the Kashmiris, agreed to fight against a tyrannic Moghul Empire (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.

==Baháʼí Faith==

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, founder of Baháʼí Faith, a religion that developed in Persia, having roots in Islam, urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and religion has been progressively revealed over time through Manifestations of God, the founders of religion. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh taught that Baháʼís must associate with peoples of all religions, whether this is reciprocated or not.

Baháʼís refer to this concept as Progressive revelation, meaning that each religion brings a more advanced understanding of divinity and updated social laws as mankind matures. In this view, God&#x27;s word is revealed through a series of messengers: Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Báb and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh (the founder of the Baháʼí Faith) among them. According to Baháʼí writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years.

There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.

==Religious pluralism and human service professions==
The concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions. For example, psychologist Kenneth Pargament has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called &quot;rejectionist&quot;, &quot;exclusivist&quot;, &quot;constructivist&quot;, and &quot;pluralist&quot;. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:

Importantly, &quot;the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy&quot; (p. 168). The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as &quot;should religious issues be discussed in counseling?&quot;, have also been presented in tabular form (p. 362, Table 12.1).

The profession of chaplaincy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg argues: &quot;With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents&#x27; spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative&quot; (p. 182).

==Skepticism==
===Argument from inconsistent revelations===
The argument from inconsistent revelations is an argument that aims to show that one cannot choose one religion over another since their revelations are inconsistent with each other and that any two religions cannot both be true. The argument appears, among other places, in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;Philosophical Dictionary&quot;. It is also manifested in Denis Diderot&#x27;s statement in response to Pascal&#x27;s wager that, whatever proofs are offered for the existence of God in Christianity or any other religion, &quot;an Imam can reason the same way&quot;. Also in response to Pascal&#x27;s wager, J. L. Mackie said &quot;the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but perhaps that of the Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or the worshippers of Kali or of Odin&quot;.

<text>Calendar-based methods are various methods of estimating a woman&#x27;s likelihood of fertility, based on a record of the length of previous menstrual cycles. Various methods are known as the Knaus–Ogino method and the rhythm method. The standard days method is also considered a calendar-based method, because when using it, a woman tracks the days of her menstrual cycle without observing her physical fertility signs. The standard days method is based on a fixed formula taking into consideration the timing of ovulation, the functional life of the sperm and the ovum, and the resulting likelihood of pregnancy on particular days of the menstrual cycle. These methods may be used to achieve pregnancy by timing unprotected intercourse for days identified as fertile, or to avoid pregnancy by avoiding unprotected intercourse during fertile days.

The first formalized calendar-based method was developed in 1930 by John Smulders, a Catholic physician from the Netherlands. It was based on knowledge of the menstrual cycle. This method was independently discovered by Hermann Knaus (Austria), and Kyusaku Ogino (Japan). This system was a main form of birth control available to Catholic couples for several decades, until the popularization of symptoms-based fertility awareness methods. A new development in calendar-based methods occurred in 2002, when Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method. The Standard Days Method is promoted in conjunction with a product called CycleBeads, a ring of colored beads which are meant to help the user keep track of her fertile and non-fertile days.

==Terminology==
While the terms &quot;rhythm method&quot; and &quot;fertility awareness&quot; are not synonymous, some sources do treat them as such. However, fertility awareness is usually used as a broad term that includes tracking basal body temperature and cervical mucus as well as cycle length. The World Health Organization considers the rhythm method to be a specific type of calendar-based method, and calendar-based methods to be only one form of fertility awareness.

More effective than calendar-based methods, systems of fertility awareness that track basal body temperature, cervical mucus, or both, are known as symptoms-based methods. Teachers of symptoms-based methods take care to distance their systems from the poor reputation of the rhythm method. Many consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years, and some even exclude calendar-based methods from their definition of fertility awareness.

Some sources may treat the terms &quot;rhythm method&quot; and &quot;natural family planning&quot; as synonymous. In the early 20th century, the calendar-based method known as the &quot;rhythm method&quot; was promoted by members of the Roman Catholic Church as the only morally acceptable form of family planning. Methods accepted by this church are referred to as natural family planning (NFP): so at one time, the term &quot;the rhythm method&quot; was synonymous with NFP. Today, NFP is an umbrella term that includes symptoms-based fertility awareness methods and the lactational amenorrhea method as well as calendar-based methods such as rhythm. This overlap between uses of the terms &quot;the rhythm method&quot; and &quot;natural family planning&quot; may contribute to confusion.

The first day of bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle.

==History==

===Early methods===
It is not known if historical cultures were aware of what part of the menstrual cycle is most fertile. In the year 388, Augustine of Hippo wrote of periodic abstinence. Addressing followers of Manichaeism, his former religion, he said, &quot;Is it not you who used to counsel us to observe as much as possible the time when a woman, after her purification, is most likely to conceive, and to abstain from cohabitation at that time...?&quot; If the Manichaieans practiced something like the Jewish observances of menstruation, then the &quot;time... after her purification&quot; would have indeed been when &quot;a woman... is most likely to conceive.&quot; Over a century previously, however, the influential Greek physician Soranus had written that &quot;the time directly before and after menstruation&quot; was the most fertile part of a woman&#x27;s cycle; this inaccuracy was repeated in the 6th century by the Byzantine physician Aëtius. Similarly, a Chinese sex manual written close to the year 600 stated that only the first five days following menstruation were fertile. Some historians believe that Augustine, too, incorrectly identified the days immediately after menstruation as the time of highest fertility.

Written references to a &quot;safe period&quot; do not appear again for over a thousand years. Scientific advances prompted a number of secular thinkers to advocate periodic abstinence to avoid pregnancy: in the 1840s it was discovered that many animals ovulate during estrus. Because some animals (such as dogs) have a bloody discharge during estrus, it was assumed that menstruation was the corresponding most fertile time for women. This inaccurate theory was popularized by physicians Bischoff, Félix Archimède Pouchet, and Adam Raciborski. In 1854, an English physician named George Drysdale correctly taught his patients that the days near menstruation are the &quot;least&quot; fertile, but this remained the minority view for the remainder of the 19th century.

===Knaus–Ogino or rhythm method===
In 1905 Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde, a Dutch gynecologist, showed that women only ovulate once per menstrual cycle. In the 1920s, Kyusaku Ogino, a Japanese gynecologist, and Hermann Knaus, from Austria, working independently, each made the discovery that ovulation occurs about fourteen days before the next menstrual period. Ogino used his discovery to develop a formula for use in aiding infertile women to time intercourse to achieve pregnancy.

In 1930, Johannes Smulders, a Roman Catholic physician from the Netherlands, used Knaus and Ogino&#x27;s discoveries to create a method for &quot;avoiding&quot; pregnancy. Smulders published his work with the Dutch Roman Catholic medical association, and this was the official rhythm method promoted over the next several decades. In 1932 a Catholic physician, Dr. Leo J Latz, published a book titled &quot;The Rhythm of Sterility and Fertility in Women&quot; describing the method, and the 1930s also saw the first U.S. Rhythm Clinic (founded by John Rock) to teach the method to Catholic couples.

===Later 20th century to present===
In the first half of the 20th century, most users of the rhythm method were Catholic; they were following their church&#x27;s teaching that all other methods of birth control were sinful. In 1968 the encyclical &quot;Humanae vitae&quot; included the statement, &quot;It is supremely desirable... that medical science should by the study of natural rhythms succeed in determining a sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring.&quot; This is interpreted as favoring the then-new, more reliable symptoms-based fertility awareness methods over the rhythm method. Currently, many fertility awareness teachers consider the rhythm method to have been obsolete for at least 20 years.

New attention was drawn to calendar-based methods in 2002, when the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University introduced the Standard Days Method. Designed to be simpler to teach and use than the older rhythm method, the Standard Days Method was initially integrated piloted in 30 family planning programs worldwide. However, only 16 countries scaled up beyond pilots, with limited adoption since.

==Types and effectiveness==
Most menstrual cycles have several days at the beginning that are infertile (pre-ovulatory infertility), a period of fertility, and then several days just before the next menstruation that are infertile (post-ovulatory infertility). The first day of red bleeding is considered day one of the menstrual cycle. To use these methods, a woman is required to know the length of her menstrual cycles.

Imperfect use of calendar-based methods would consist of not correctly tracking the length of the woman&#x27;s cycles, thus using the wrong numbers in the formula, or of having unprotected intercourse on an identified fertile day. The discipline required to keep accurate records of menstrual cycles, and to abstain from unprotected intercourse, makes imperfect use fairly common. The typical-use failure rate of calendar-based methods is 25% per year.

===Rhythm method (Knaus–Ogino method)===
To find the estimated length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase, eighteen (18) is subtracted from the length of the woman&#x27;s shortest cycle. To find the estimated start of the post-ovulatory infertile phase, eleven (11) is subtracted from the length of the woman&#x27;s longest cycle. A woman whose menstrual cycles ranged in length from 30 to 36 days would be estimated to be infertile for the first 11 days of her cycle (30-19=11), to be fertile on days 12–25, and to resume infertility on day 26 (36-10=26). When used to avoid pregnancy, such fertility awareness-based methods have a typical-use failure rate of 25% per year.

===Standard days method===
Developed at Georgetown University&#x27;s Institute for Reproductive Health, the standard days method is a variation of the rhythm method that has a simpler rule set and is more effective than the Knaus–Ogino method. A product called CycleBeads was developed alongside the method to help the user keep track of estimated high and low fertility points during her menstrual cycle. The standard days method is only effective for women whose cycles are consistently between 26 and 32 days in length; it is estimated that between 50% and 60% of women of reproductive age satisfy this condition. In this system:
* Days 1–7 of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle are considered infertile
* Days 8–19 are considered fertile; considered unsafe for unprotected intercourse
* Day 20 through the end of the cycle are considered infertile.

When used to avoid pregnancy, the standard days method has been estimated to have perfect-use efficacy of 95% and typical-use efficacy of 88%. These figures are based on a 2002 study in Bolivia, Peru, and the Philippines of women of reproductive age having menstrual cycles between 26 and 32 days, and on a 2014 study in Turkey. However, other researchers have criticized the methodology of the first study, have stated that the 95% figure has been presented to the public in misleading ways, and have argued that the true efficacy figures are likely to be much lower. Another meta study indicated that typical-use efficacy ranged between 90% and 82%, a bit lower than the 88% figure originally found.

==Software-based systems==
Several web-based implementations of the cycle method exist, as well as mobile apps such as Natural Cycles.

==Advantages==
The Standard Days method (SDM) was introduced as part of family planning programs in developing countries. The method is satisfactory for many women and men. The low cost of the method may also enable it to play a useful role in countries that lack funding to provide other methods of birth control.

==Potential concerns==

===Failure rate===
One concern related to the use of calendar-based methods is their relatively high failure rate, compared to other methods of birth control. Even when used perfectly, calendar-based methods, especially the rhythm method, result in a high pregnancy rate among couples intending to avoid pregnancy. Of commonly known methods of birth control, only the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge have comparably high failure rates. This lower level of reliability of calendar-based methods is because their formulas make several assumptions that are not always true.

The postovulatory (luteal) phase has a normal length of 12 to 16 days, and the rhythm method formula assumes all women have luteal phase lengths within this range. However, many women have shorter luteal phases, and a few have longer luteal phases. For these women, the rhythm method formula incorrectly identifies a few fertile days as being in the infertile period. Roughly 30-50% of women have phases outside this range.

Finally, calendar-based methods assume that all bleeding is true menstruation. However, mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding can be caused by a number of factors. Incorrectly identifying bleeding as menstruation will cause the method&#x27;s calculations to be incorrect.

===Embryonic health===
It has been suggested that pregnancies resulting from failures of periodic abstinence methods are at increased risk of miscarriage and birth defects due to aged gametes at the time of conception. Other research suggests that timing of conception has no effect on miscarriage rates, low birth weight, or preterm delivery.

===Destruction of fertilized eggs===
Philosopher Luc Bovens has suggested that the use of the rhythm method probably results in a large number of abortions, because unprotected intercourse in the infertile periods of the menstrual cycle may still result in conceptions but create zygotes incapable of implanting. Bovens&#x27;s argument requires the assumption that any and all destruction of fertilized eggs is abortion.

<doc id="26487" wikidata="Q190975" url="?curid=26487" title="Roulette">
<text>Roulette (named after the French word meaning &quot;little wheel&quot;) is a casino game which was likely developed from the Italian game Biribi. In the game, a player may choose to place a bet on a single number, various groupings of numbers, the color red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the number is high or low.

To determine the winning number, a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum, passes through an area of deflectors, and falls onto the wheel and into one of the colored and numbered pockets on the wheel. The winnings are then paid to anyone who has placed a successful bet.

==History==

The first form of roulette was devised in 18th-century France. Many historians believe Blaise Pascal introduced a primitive form of roulette in the 17th century in his search for a perpetual motion machine. The roulette mechanism is a hybrid of a gaming wheel invented in 1720 and the Italian game Biribi. A primitive form of roulette, known as &#x27;EO&#x27; (Even/Odd), was played in England in the late 18th century using a gaming wheel similar to that used in roulette.

The game has been played in its present form since as early as 1796 in Paris. An early description of the roulette game in its current form is found in a French novel &quot;La Roulette, ou le Jour&quot; by Jaques Lablee, which describes a roulette wheel in the Palais Royal in Paris in 1796. The description included the house pockets: &quot;There are exactly two slots reserved for the bank, whence it derives its sole mathematical advantage.&quot; It then goes on to describe the layout with &quot;two betting spaces containing the bank&#x27;s two numbers, zero and double zero&quot;. The book was published in 1801. An even earlier reference to a game of this name was published in regulations for New France (Québec) in 1758, which banned the games of &quot;dice, hoca, faro, and roulette&quot;.

The roulette wheels used in the casinos of Paris in the late 1790s had red for the single zero and black for the double zero. To avoid confusion, the color green was selected for the zeros in roulette wheels starting in the 1800s.

In 1843, in the German spa casino town of Bad Homburg, fellow Frenchmen François and Louis Blanc introduced the single &quot;0&quot; style roulette wheel in order to compete against other casinos offering the traditional wheel with single and double zero house pockets.

In some forms of early American roulette wheels, there were numbers 1 to 28, plus a single zero, a double zero, and an American Eagle. The Eagle slot, which was a symbol of American liberty, was a house slot that brought the casino an extra edge. Soon, the tradition vanished and since then the wheel features only numbered slots. According to Hoyle &quot;the single 0, the double 0, and the eagle are never bars; but when the ball falls into either of them, the banker sweeps every thing upon the table, except what may happen to be bet on either one of them, when he pays twenty-seven for one, which is the amount paid for all sums bet upon any single figure&quot;.
In the 19th century, roulette spread all over Europe and the US, becoming one of the most popular casino games. When the German government abolished gambling in the 1860s, the Blanc family moved to the last legal remaining casino operation in Europe at Monte Carlo, where they established a gambling mecca for the elite of Europe. It was here that the single zero roulette wheel became the premier game, and over the years was exported around the world, except in the United States where the double zero wheel remained dominant.
In the United States, the French double zero wheel made its way up the Mississippi from New Orleans, and then westward. It was here, because of rampant cheating by both operators and gamblers, that the wheel was eventually placed on top of the table to prevent devices from being hidden in the table or wheel, and the betting layout was simplified. This eventually evolved into the American-style roulette game. The American game was developed in the gambling dens across the new territories where makeshift games had been set up, whereas the French game evolved with style and leisure in Monte Carlo.

During the first part of the 20th century, the only casino towns of note were Monte Carlo with the traditional single zero French wheel, and Las Vegas with the American double zero wheel. In the 1970s, casinos began to flourish around the world. In 1996 the first online casino, generally believed to be InterCasino, made it possible to play roulette online. By 2008, there were several hundred casinos worldwide offering roulette games. The double zero wheel is found in the United States, Canada, South America, and the Caribbean, while the single zero wheel is predominant elsewhere.

==Rules of play against a casino==

Roulette players have a variety of betting options. &quot;Inside&quot; bets involve selecting either the exact number on which the ball will land, or a small group of numbers adjacent to each other on the layout. &quot;Outside&quot; bets, by contrast, allow players to select a larger group of numbers based on properties such as their color or parity (odd/even). The payout odds for each type of bet are based on its probability.

The roulette table usually imposes minimum and maximum bets, and these rules usually apply separately for all of a player&#x27;s inside and outside bets for each spin. For inside bets at roulette tables, some casinos may use separate roulette table chips of various colors to distinguish players at the table. Players can continue to place bets as the ball spins around the wheel until the dealer announces &quot;no more bets&quot; or &quot;rien ne va plus&quot;.
When a winning number and color is determined by the roulette wheel, the dealer will place a marker, also known as a &quot;dolly&quot;, on that number on the roulette table layout. When the dolly is on the table, no players may place bets, collect bets or remove any bets from the table. The dealer will then sweep away all losing bets either by hand or by rake, and determine the payouts for the remaining inside and outside winning bets. When the dealer is finished making payouts, the dolly is removed from the board and players may collect their winnings and make new bets. Winning chips remain on the board until picked up by a player. 

===California Roulette===
In 2004, California legalized a form of roulette known as California Roulette. By law, the game must use cards and not slots on the roulette wheel to pick the winning number.

==Roulette wheel number sequence==
The pockets of the roulette wheel are numbered from 0 to 36.

In number ranges from 1 to 10 and 19 to 28, odd numbers are red and even are black. In ranges from 11 to 18 and 29 to 36, odd numbers are black and even are red.

There is a green pocket numbered 0 (zero). In American roulette, there is a second green pocket marked 00. Pocket number order on the roulette wheel adheres to the following clockwise sequence in most casinos:

; Single-zero wheel: 0-32-15-19-4-21-2-25-17-34-6-27-13-36-11-30-8-23-10-5-24-16-33-1-20-14-31-9-22-18-29-7-28-12-35-3-26
; Double-zero wheel: 0-28-9-26-30-11-7-20-32-17-5-22-34-15-3-24-36-13-1-00-27-10-25-29-12-8-19-31-18-6-21-33-16-4-23-35-14-2
; Triple-zero wheel: 0-000-00-32-15-19-4-21-2-25-17-34-6-27-13-36-11-30-8-23-10-5-24-16-33-1-20-14-31-9-22-18-29-7-28-12-35-3-26

==Roulette table layout==
The cloth-covered betting area on a roulette table is known as the &quot;layout&quot;. The layout is either single-zero or double-zero.

The European-style layout has a single zero, and the American style layout is usually a double-zero. The American-style roulette table with a wheel at one end is now used in most casinos because it has a higher house edge compared to a European layout.

The French style table with a wheel in the centre and a layout on either side is rarely found outside of Monte Carlo.

==Types of bets==
In roulette, bets can be either &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;outside&quot;.

===Inside bets===
===Outside bets===
Outside bets typically have smaller payouts with better odds at winning. Except as noted, all of these bets lose if a 0 comes up.
; 1 to 18 (low or &quot;manque&quot;), or 19 to 36 (high or &quot;passe&quot;): A bet that the number will be in the chosen range.
; Red or black (&quot;rouge ou noir&quot;): A bet that the number will be the chosen color.
; Even or odd (&quot;pair ou impair&quot;): A bet that the number will be of the chosen parity. Unlike in mathematics, 0 is considered neither even nor odd.
; Dozen bet: A bet that the number will be in the chosen dozen: first (1-12, &quot;Première douzaine&quot; or P12), second (13-24, &quot;Moyenne douzaine&quot; or M12), or third (25-36, &quot;Dernière douzaine&quot; or D12).
; Column bet: A bet that the number will be in the chosen vertical column of 12 numbers, such as 1-4-7-10 on down to 34. The chip is placed on the space below the final number in this sequence.
; Snake bet: A special bet that covers the numbers 1, 5, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 23, 27, 30, 32, and 34. It has the same payout as the dozen bet and takes its name from the zig-zagging, snakelike pattern traced out by these numbers. The snake bet is not available in all casinos; when it is allowed, the chip is placed on the lower corner of the 34 square that borders the 19-36 betting box. Some layouts mark the bet with a two-headed snake that winds from 1 to 34, and the bet can be placed on the head at either end of the body.

In some casinos, the farthest outside bets (low/high, red/black, even/odd) result in the player losing only half of their bet if a zero comes up. This is known as the &quot;halfback&quot; or &quot;la partage&quot; rule. Others may use an &quot;imprisonment&quot; or &quot;en prison&quot; rule, wherein a loss on such an outside bet causes the player&#x27;s money to be &quot;imprisoned&quot;, and if the next spin would be a win for that bet, the player&#x27;s wager is returned.

==Bet odds table==
The expected value of a $1 bet (except for the special case of top line bets), for American and European roulette, can be calculated as

:formula_1

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of pockets in the wheel.

The initial bet is returned in addition to the mentioned payout: it can be easily demonstrated that this payout formula would lead to a zero expected value of profit if there were only 36 numbers (that is, the casino would break even). Having 37 or more numbers gives the casino its edge.

Top line (0, 00, 1, 2, 3) has a different expected value because of approximation of the correct -to-1 payout obtained by the formula to 6-to-1.

If &quot;en prison&quot; rules are used, the house edge on the 1:1 bets is reduced to 1.35%-1.38% on a single-zero wheel, and to 2.63% on a double-zero wheel.

==House edge==
The &quot;house average&quot; or &quot;house edge&quot; or &quot;house advantage&quot; (also called the &quot;expected value&quot;) is the amount the player loses relative to any bet made, on average. If a player bets on a single number in the American game there is a probability of that the player wins 35 times the bet, and a chance that the player loses their bet. The expected value is:

: −1 × + 35 × = −0.0526 (5.26% house edge)

For European roulette, a single number wins and loses :

: −1 × + 35 × = −0.0270 (2.70% house edge)

For triple-zero wheels, a single number wins and loses :

: −1 × + 35 × = −0.0769 (7.69% house edge)

==Mathematical model==
As an example, the European roulette model, that is, roulette with only one zero, can be examined. Since this roulette has 37 cells with equal odds of hitting, this is a final model of field probability formula_2, where formula_3, formula_4 for all formula_5.

Call the bet formula_6 a triple formula_7, where formula_8 is the set of chosen numbers, formula_9 is the size of the bet, and formula_10 determines the return of the bet.

The rules of European roulette have 10 types of bets. First the &#x27;Straight Up&#x27; bet can be imagined. In this case, formula_11, for some formula_12, and formula_13 is determined by
: formula_14

The bet&#x27;s expected net return, or profitability, is equal to
:formula_15

Without details, for a bet, black (or red), the rule is determined as
:formula_16

and the profitability
:formula_17.

For similar reasons it is simple to see that the profitability is also equal for all remaining types of bets. formula_18.

In reality this means that, the more bets a player makes, the more they are going to lose independent of the strategies (combinations of bet types or size of bets) that they employ:
:formula_19
Here, the profit margin for the roulette owner is equal to approximately 2.7%. Nevertheless, several roulette strategy systems have been developed despite the losing odds. These systems can not change the odds of the game in favor of the player.

The odds for the player in American roulette are even worse, as the bet profitability is at worst formula_20, and never better than formula_21.

===Simplified mathematical model===
For a roulette wheel with formula_22 green numbers and 36 other unique numbers, the chance of the ball landing on a given number is formula_23. For a betting option with formula_24 numbers defining a win, the chance of winning a bet is formula_25

For example, if a player bets on red, there are 18 red numbers, formula_26, so the chance of winning is formula_27.

The payout given by the casino for a win is based on the roulette wheel having 36 outcomes, and the payout for a bet is given by formula_28.

For example, betting on 1-12 there are 12 numbers that define a win, formula_29, the payout is formula_30, so the bettor wins 3 times their bet.

The average return on a player&#x27;s bet is given by formula_31

For formula_32, the average return is always lower than 1, so on average a player will lose money.

With 1 green number, formula_33, the average return is formula_34, that is, after a bet the player will on average have formula_34 of their original bet returned to them. With 2 green numbers, formula_36, the average return is formula_37. With 3 green numbers, formula_38, the average return is formula_39.

This shows that the expected return is independent of the choice of bet.

==Called (or call) bets or announced bets==
Although most often named &quot;call bets&quot; technically these bets are more accurately referred to as &quot;announced bets&quot;. The legal distinction between a &quot;call bet&quot; and an &quot;announced bet&quot; is that a &quot;call bet&quot; is a bet called by the player without placing any money on the table to cover the cost of the bet. In many jurisdictions (most notably the United Kingdom) this is considered gambling on credit and is illegal. An &quot;announced bet&quot; is a bet called by the player for which they immediately place enough money to cover the amount of the bet on the table, prior to the outcome of the spin or hand in progress being known.

There are different number series in roulette that have special names attached to them. Most commonly these bets are known as &quot;the French bets&quot; and each covers a section of the wheel. For the sake of accuracy, zero spiel, although explained below, is not a French bet, it is more accurately &quot;the German bet&quot;. Players at a table may bet a set amount per series (or multiples of that amount). The series are based on the way certain numbers lie next to each other on the roulette wheel. Not all casinos offer these bets, and some may offer additional bets or variations on these.

===Voisins du zéro (&quot;neighbors of zero&quot;)===

This is a name, more accurately &quot;grands voisins du zéro&quot;, for the 17 numbers that lie between 22 and 25 on the wheel, including 22 and 25 themselves. The series is 22-18-29-7-28-12-35-3-26-0-32-15-19-4-21-2-25 (on a single-zero wheel).

Nine chips or multiples thereof are bet. Two chips are placed on the 0-2-3 trio; one on the 4–7 split; one on 12–15; one on 18–21; one on 19–22; two on the 25-26-28-29 corner; and one on 32–35.

===Jeu zéro (&quot;zero game&quot;)===

Zero game, also known as zero spiel (&quot;Spiel&quot; is German for game or play), is the name for the numbers closest to zero. All numbers in the zero game are included in the voisins, but are placed differently. The numbers bet on are 12-35-3-26-0-32-15.

The bet consists of four chips or multiples thereof. Three chips are bet on splits and one chip straight-up: one chip on 0–3 split, one on 12–15 split, one on 32–35 split and one straight-up on number 26.

This type of bet is popular in Germany and many European casinos. It is also offered as a 5-chip bet in many Eastern European casinos. As a 5-chip bet, it is known as &quot;zero spiel naca&quot; and includes, in addition to the chips placed as noted above, a straight-up on number 19.

===Le tiers du cylindre (&quot;third of the wheel&quot;)===

This is the name for the 12 numbers that lie on the opposite side of the wheel between 27 and 33, including 27 and 33 themselves. On a single-zero wheel, the series is 27-13-36-11-30-8-23-10-5-24-16-33. The full name (although very rarely used, most players refer to it as &quot;tiers&quot;) for this bet is &quot;le tiers du cylindre&quot; (translated from French into English meaning one third of the wheel) because it covers 12 numbers (placed as 6 splits), which is as close to of the wheel as one can get.

Very popular in British casinos, tiers bets outnumber voisins and orphelins bets by a massive margin.

Six chips or multiples thereof are bet. One chip is placed on each of the following splits: 5–8, 10–11, 13–16, 23–24, 27–30, and 33–36.

The tiers bet is also called the &quot;small series&quot; and in some casinos (most notably in South Africa) &quot;series 5-8&quot;.

A variant known as &quot;tiers 5-8-10-11&quot; has an additional chip placed straight up on 5, 8, 10, and 11 and so is a 10-piece bet. In some places the variant is called &quot;gioco Ferrari&quot; with a straight up on 8, 11, 23 and 30, the bet is marked with a red G on the racetrack.

===Orphelins (&quot;orphans&quot;)===

These numbers make up the two slices of the wheel outside the tiers and voisins. They contain a total of 8 numbers, comprising 17-34-6 and 1-20-14-31-9.

Five chips or multiples thereof are bet on four splits and a straight-up: one chip is placed straight-up on 1 and one chip on each of the splits: 6–9, 14–17, 17–20, and 31–34.

===... and the neighbors===

A number may be backed along with the two numbers on the either side of it in a 5-chip bet. For example, &quot;0 and the neighbors&quot; is a 5-chip bet with one piece straight-up on 3, 26, 0, 32, and 15. Neighbors bets are often put on in combinations, for example &quot;1, 9, 14, and the neighbors&quot; is a 15-chip bet covering 18, 22, 33, 16 with one chip, 9, 31, 20, 1 with two chips and 14 with three chips.

Any of the above bets may be combined; e.g. &quot;orphelins by 1 and zero and the neighbors by 1&quot;. The &quot;...and the neighbors&quot; is often assumed by the croupier.

===Final bets===

Another bet offered on the single-zero game is &quot;final&quot;, &quot;finale&quot;, or &quot;finals&quot;.

Final 4, for example, is a 4-chip bet and consists of one chip placed on each of the numbers ending in 4, that is 4, 14, 24, and 34. Final 7 is a 3-chip bet, one chip each on 7, 17, and 27. Final bets from final 0 (zero) to final 6 cost four chips. Final bets 7, 8 and 9 cost three chips.

Some casinos also offer split-final bets, for example final 5-8 would be a 4-chip bet, one chip each on the splits 5–8, 15–18, 25–28, and one on 35.

===Full completes/maximums===

A complete bet places all of the inside bets on a certain number. Full complete bets are most often bet by high rollers as &quot;maximum bets&quot;.

The maximum amount allowed to be wagered on a single bet in European roulette is based on a progressive betting model. If the casino allows a maximum bet of $1,000 on a 35-to-1 straight-up, then on each 17-to-1 split connected to that straight-up, $2,000 may be wagered. Each 8-to-1 corner that covers four numbers) may have $4,000 wagered on it. Each 11-to-1 street that covers three numbers may have $3,000 wagered on it. Each 5-to-1 six-line may have $6,000 wagered on it. Each $1,000 incremental bet would be represented by a marker that is used to specifically identify the player and the amount bet.

For instance, if a patron wished to place a full complete bet on 17, the player would call &quot;17 to the maximum&quot;. This bet would require a total of 40 chips, or $40,000. To manually place the same wager, the player would need to bet:

The player calls their bet to the croupier (most often after the ball has been spun) and places enough chips to cover the bet on the table within reach of the croupier. The croupier will immediately announce the bet (repeat what the player has just said), ensure that the correct monetary amount has been given while simultaneously placing a matching marker on the number on the table and the amount wagered.

The payout for this bet if the chosen number wins is 392 chips, in the case of a $1000 straight-up maximum, $40,000 bet, a payout of $392,000. The player&#x27;s wagered 40 chips, as with all winning bets in roulette, are still their property and in the absence of a request to the contrary are left up to possibly win again on the next spin.

Based on the location of the numbers on the layout, the number of chips required to &quot;complete&quot; a number can be determined.
* Zero costs 17 chips to complete and pays 235 chips.
* Number 1 and number 3 each cost 27 chips and pay 297 chips.
* Number 2 is a 36-chip bet and pays 396 chips.
* 1st column numbers 4 to 31 and 3rd column numbers 6 to 33, cost 30 chips each to complete. The payout for a win on these 30-chip bets is 294 chips.
* 2nd column numbers 5 to 32 cost 40 chips each to complete. The payout for a win on these numbers is 392 chips.
* Numbers 34 and 36 each cost 18 chips and pay 198 chips.
* Number 35 is a 24-chip bet which pays 264 chips.

Most typically (Mayfair casinos in London and other top-class European casinos) with these &quot;maximum&quot; or &quot;full complete&quot; bets, nothing (except the aforementioned maximum button) is ever placed on the layout even in the case of a win. Experienced gaming staff, and the type of customers playing such bets, are fully aware of the payouts and so the croupier simply makes up the correct payout, announces its value to the table inspector (floor person in the U.S.) and the customer, and then passes it to the customer, but only after a verbal authorization from the inspector has been received.

Also typically at this level of play (house rules allowing) the experienced croupier caters to the needs of the customer and will most often add the customer&#x27;s winning bet to the payout, as the type of player playing these bets very rarely bets the same number two spins in succession. For example, the winning 40-chip / $40,000 bet on &quot;17 to the maximum&quot; pays 392 chips / $392,000. The experienced croupier would pay the player 432 chips / $432,000, that is 392 + 40, with the announcement that the payout &quot;is with your bet down&quot;.

There are also several methods to determine the payout when a number adjacent to a chosen number is the winner, for example, player bets &quot;23 full complete&quot; and number 26 is the winning number. The most notable method is known as the &quot;station&quot; method. When paying in stations, the dealer counts the number of ways or stations that the winning number hits the complete bet. In the example above, 26 hits 4 stations - 2 different corners, 1 split and 1 six-line. The dealer takes the number 4, multiplies it by 36, making 144 with the players bet down. 

In some casinos, a player may bet full complete for less than the table straight-up maximum, for example, &quot;number 17 full complete by $25&quot; would cost $1000, that is 40 chips each at $25 value.

==Betting strategies and tactics==
Over the years, many people have tried to beat the casino, and turn roulette—a game designed to turn a profit for the house—into one on which the player expects to win. Most of the time this comes down to the use of betting systems, strategies which say that the house edge can be beaten by simply employing a special pattern of bets, often relying on the &quot;Gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot;, the idea that past results are any guide to the future (for example, if a roulette wheel has come up 10 times in a row on red, that red on the next spin is any more or less likely than if the last spin was black).

All betting systems that rely on patterns, when employed on casino edge games will result, on average, in the player losing money. In practice, players employing betting systems may win, and may indeed win very large sums of money, but the losses (which, depending on the design of the betting system, may occur quite rarely) will outweigh the wins. Certain systems, such as the Martingale, described below, are extremely risky, because the worst-case scenario (which is mathematically certain to happen, at some point) may see the player chasing losses with ever-bigger bets until they run out of money.

The American mathematician Patrick Billingsley said that no betting system can convert a subfair game into a profitable enterprise. At least in the 1930s, some professional gamblers were able to consistently gain an edge in roulette by seeking out rigged wheels (not difficult to find at that time) and betting opposite the largest bets.

===Prediction methods===

Whereas betting systems are essentially an attempt to beat the fact that a geometric series with initial value of 0.95 (American roulette) or 0.97 (European roulette) will inevitably over time tend to zero, engineers instead attempt to overcome the house edge through predicting the mechanical performance of the wheel, most notably by Joseph Jagger at Monte Carlo in 1873. These schemes work by determining that the ball is more likely to fall at certain numbers. If effective, they raise the return of the game above 100%, defeating the betting system problem.

Edward O. Thorp (the developer of card counting and an early hedge-fund pioneer) and Claude Shannon (a mathematician and electronic engineer best known for his contributions to information theory) built the first wearable computer to predict the landing of the ball in 1961. This system worked by timing the ball and wheel, and using the information obtained to calculate the most likely octant where the ball would fall. Ironically, this technique works best with an unbiased wheel though it could still be countered quite easily by simply closing the table for betting before beginning the spin.

In 1982, several casinos in Britain began to lose large sums of money at their roulette tables to teams of gamblers from the US. Upon investigation by the police, it was discovered they were using a legal system of biased wheel-section betting. As a result of this, the British roulette wheel manufacturer John Huxley manufactured a roulette wheel to counteract the problem.

The new wheel, designed by George Melas, was called &quot;low profile&quot; because the pockets had been drastically reduced in depth, and various other design modifications caused the ball to descend in a gradual approach to the pocket area. In 1986, when a professional gambling team headed by Billy Walters won $3.8 million using the system on an old wheel at the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, every casino in the world took notice, and within one year had switched to the new low-profile wheel.

Thomas Bass, in his book &quot;The Eudaemonic Pie&quot; (1985) (published as &quot;The Newtonian Casino&quot; in Britain), has claimed to be able to predict wheel performance in real time. The book describes the exploits of a group of University of California Santa Cruz students, who called themselves &quot;the Eudaemons&quot;, who in the late 1970s used computers in their shoes to win at roulette. This is an updated and improved version of Edward O. Thorp&#x27;s approach, where Newtonian Laws of Motion are applied to track the roulette ball&#x27;s deceleration; hence the British title.

To defend against exploits like these, many casinos use tracking software, use wheels with new designs, rotate wheel heads, and randomly rotate pocket rings.

At the Ritz London casino in March 2004, two Serbs and a Hungarian used a laser scanner hidden inside a mobile phone linked to a computer to predict the sector of the wheel where the ball was most likely to drop. They netted £1.3m in two nights. They were arrested and kept on police bail for nine months, but eventually released and allowed to keep their winnings as they had not interfered with the casino equipment.

===Specific betting systems===

The numerous even-money bets in roulette have inspired many players over the years to attempt to beat the game by using one or more variations of a martingale betting strategy, wherein the gambler doubles the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses, plus win a profit equal to the original bet. The problem with this strategy is that, remembering that past results do not affect the future, it is possible for the player to lose so many times in a row, that the player, doubling and redoubling their bets, either runs out of money or hits the table limit. A large financial loss is almost certain in the long term if the player continues to employ this strategy. Another strategy is the Fibonacci system, where bets are calculated according to the Fibonacci sequence. Regardless of the specific progression, no such strategy can statistically overcome the casino&#x27;s advantage, since the expected value of each allowed bet is negative.

===Types of betting system===

Betting systems in roulette can be divided in to two main categories:

&quot;Negative progression&quot; systems involve increasing the size of one&#x27;s bet when they lose. This is the most common type of betting system. The goal of this system is to recoup losses faster so that one can return to a winning position more quickly after a losing streak. The typical shape of these systems is small but consistent wins followed by occasional catastrophic losses. Examples of negative progression systems include the Martingale system, the Fibonacci system, the Labouchère system, and the d&#x27;Alembert system.

&quot;Positive progression&quot; systems involve increasing the size of one&#x27;s bet when one wins. The goal of these systems is to either exacerbate the effects of winning streaks (e.g. the Paroli system) or to take advantage of changes in luck to recover more quickly from previous losses (e.g. Oscar&#x27;s grind). The shape of these systems is typically small but consistent losses followed by occasional big wins. However, over the long run these wins do not compensate for the losses incurred in between.

===Reverse Martingale system===
The Reverse Martingale system, also known as the Paroli system, follows the idea of the martingale betting strategy, but reversed. Instead of doubling a bet after a loss the gambler doubles the bet after every win. The system creates a false feeling of eliminating the risk of betting more when losing, but, in reality, it has the same problem as the martingale strategy. By doubling bets after every win, one keeps betting everything they have won until they either stop playing, or lose it all.

===Labouchère system===

The Labouchère System is a progression betting strategy like the martingale but does not require the gambler to risk their stake as quickly with dramatic double-ups. The Labouchere System involves using a series of numbers in a line to determine the bet amount, following a win or a loss. Typically, the player adds the numbers at the front and end of the line to determine the size of the next bet. If the player wins, they cross out numbers and continue working on the smaller line. If the player loses, then they add their previous bet to the end of the line and continue to work on the longer line. This is a much more flexible progression betting system and there is much room for the player to design their initial line to their own playing preference.

This system is one that is designed so that when the player has won over a third of their bets (less than the expected 18/38), they will win. Whereas the martingale will cause ruin in the event of a long sequence of successive losses, the Labouchère system will cause bet size to grow quickly even where a losing sequence is broken by wins. This occurs because as the player loses, the average bet size in the line increases.

As with all other betting systems, the average value of this system is negative.

===D&#x27;Alembert system===
The system, also called (from French, meaning upwards and downwards), is often called a pyramid system. It is based on a mathematical equilibrium theory devised by a French mathematician of the same name. Like the martingale, this system is mainly applied to the even-money outside bets, and is favored by players who want to keep the amount of their bets and losses to a minimum. The betting progression is very simple: After each loss, one unit is added to the next bet, and after each win, one unit is deducted from the next bet. Starting with an initial bet of, say, 1 unit, a loss would raise the next bet to 2 units. If this is followed by a win, the next bet would be 1 units.

This betting system relies on the gambler&#x27;s fallacy—that the player is more likely to lose following a win, and more likely to win following a loss.

===Other systems===
There are numerous other betting systems that rely on this fallacy, or that attempt to follow &#x27;streaks&#x27; (looking for patterns in randomness), varying bet size accordingly.

Many betting systems are sold online and purport to enable the player to &#x27;beat&#x27; the odds. One such system was advertised by Jason Gillon of Rotherham, UK, who claimed one could &#x27;earn £200 daily&#x27; by following his betting system, described as a &#x27;loophole&#x27;. As the system was advertised in the UK press, it was subject to Advertising Standards Authority regulation, and following a complaint, it was ruled by the ASA that Mr. Gillon had failed to support his claims, and that he had failed to show that there was any loophole.

==Notable winnings==
*In the 1960s and early 1970s, Richard Jarecki won about $1.2 million at dozens of European casinos. He claimed that he was using a mathematical system designed on a powerful computer. In reality, he simply observed more than 10,000 spins of each roulette wheel to determine flaws in the wheels. Eventually the casinos realized that flaws in the wheels could be exploited, and replaced older wheels. The manufacture of roulette wheels has improved over time.
* In 1963 Sean Connery, filming &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; in Italy, attended the casino in Saint-Vincent and won three consecutive times on the number 17, his winnings &quot;riding&quot; on the second and third spins.
*In the early 1990s, Gonzalo García-Pelayo performed computer analysis on many roulette spins at the Casino de Madrid in Madrid, Spain, winning 600,000 euros in a single day, and two million euros in total. Legal action against him by the casino was unsuccessful, it being ruled that the casino should fix its wheel.
*In 2004, Ashley Revell of London sold all of his possessions, clothing included, and placed his entire net worth of US$135,300 on red at the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas. The ball landed on &quot;Red 7&quot; and Revell walked away with $270,600.

<text>In computer science, reference counting is a programming technique of storing the number of references, pointers, or handles to a resource, such as an object, a block of memory, disk space, and others.

In garbage collection algorithms, reference counts may be used to deallocate objects that are no longer needed.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The main advantage of the reference counting over tracing garbage collection is that objects are reclaimed &quot;as soon as&quot; they can no longer be referenced, and in an incremental fashion, without long pauses for collection cycles and with clearly defined lifetime of every object. In real-time applications or systems with limited memory, this is important to maintain responsiveness. Reference counting is also among the simplest forms of memory management to implement. It also allows for effective management of non-memory resources such as operating system objects, which are often much scarcer than memory (tracing garbage collection systems use finalizers for this, but the delayed reclamation may cause problems). Weighted reference counts are a good solution for garbage collecting a distributed system.
Tracing garbage collection cycles are triggered too often if the set of live objects fills most of the available memory; it requires extra space to be efficient. Reference counting performance does not deteriorate as the total amount of free space decreases.

Reference counts are also useful information to use as input to other runtime optimizations. For example, systems that depend heavily on immutable objects such as many functional programming languages can suffer an efficiency penalty due to frequent copies. However, if the compiler (or runtime system) knows that a particular object has only one reference (as most do in many systems), and that the reference is lost at the same time that a similar new object is created (as in the string append statement codice_1), it can replace the operation with a mutation on the original object.

Reference counting in naive form has three main disadvantages over the tracing garbage collection, both of which require additional mechanisms to ameliorate:
* The frequent updates it involves are a source of inefficiency. While tracing garbage collectors can impact efficiency severely via context switching and cache line faults, they collect relatively infrequently, while accessing objects is done continually. Also, less importantly, reference counting requires every memory-managed object to reserve space for a reference count. In tracing garbage collectors, this information is stored implicitly in the references that refer to that object, saving space, although tracing garbage collectors, particularly incremental ones, can require additional space for other purposes.
* The naive algorithm described above can&#x27;t handle &quot;,&quot; an object which refers directly or indirectly to itself. A mechanism relying purely on reference counts will never consider cyclic chains of objects for deletion, since their reference count is guaranteed to stay nonzero (cf. picture). Methods for dealing with this issue exist but can also increase the overhead and complexity of reference counting — on the other hand, these methods need only be applied to data that might form cycles, often a small subset of all data. One such method is the use of weak references, while another involves using a mark-sweep algorithm that gets called infrequently to clean up.
* In a concurrent setting, all updates of the reference counts and all pointer modifications must be atomic operations, which incurs an additional cost. There are three reasons for the atomicity requirements. First, a reference count field may be updated by multiple threads, and so an adequate atomic instruction, such as a (costly) compare-and-swap, must be used to update the counts. Second, it must be clear which object loses a reference so that its reference count can be adequately decremented. But determining this object is non-trivial in a setting where multiple threads attempt to modify the same reference (i.e., when data races are possible). Finally, there exists a subtle race in which one thread gains a pointer to an object, but before it increments the object&#x27;s reference count, all other references to this object are deleted concurrently by other threads and the object is reclaimed, causing the said thread to increment a reference count of a reclaimed object. 

In addition to these, if the memory is allocated from a free list, reference counting suffers from poor locality. Reference counting alone cannot move objects to improve cache performance, so high performance collectors implement a tracing garbage collector as well. Most implementations (such as the ones in PHP and Objective-C) suffer from poor cache performance since they do not implement copying objects.

==Graph interpretation==
When dealing with garbage collection schemes, it is often helpful to think of the reference graph, which is a directed graph where the vertices are objects and there is an edge from an object A to an object B if A holds a reference to B. We also have a special vertex or vertices representing the local variables and references held by the runtime system, and no edges ever go to these nodes, although edges can go from them to other nodes.

In this context, the simple reference count of an object is the in-degree of its vertex. Deleting a vertex is like collecting an object. It can only be done when the vertex has no incoming edges, so it does not affect the out-degree of any other vertices, but it can affect the in-degree of other vertices, causing their corresponding objects to be collected as well if their in-degree also becomes 0 as a result.

The connected component containing the special vertex contains the objects that can&#x27;t be collected, while other connected components of the graph only contain garbage. If a reference-counting garbage collection algorithm is implemented, then each of these garbage components must contain at least one cycle; otherwise, they would have been collected as soon as their reference count (i.e., the number of incoming edges) dropped to zero.

==Dealing with inefficiency of updates==
Incrementing and decrementing reference counts every time a reference is created or destroyed can significantly impede performance. Not only do the operations take time, but they damage cache performance and can lead to pipeline bubbles. Even read-only operations like calculating the length of a list require a large number of reads and writes for reference updates with naive reference counting.

One simple technique is for the compiler to combine a number of nearby reference updates into one. This is especially effective for references which are created and quickly destroyed. Care must be taken, however, to put the combined update at the right position so that a premature free can be avoided.

The Deutsch-Bobrow method of reference counting capitalizes on the fact that most reference count updates are in fact generated by references stored in local variables. It ignores these references, only counting references in data structures, but before an object with reference count zero can be deleted, the system must verify with a scan of the stack and registers that no other reference to it still exists.

Another technique devised by Henry Baker involves deferred increments, in which references which are stored in local variables do not immediately increment the corresponding reference count, but instead defer this until it is necessary. If such a reference is destroyed quickly, then there is no need to update the counter. This eliminates a large number of updates associated with short-lived references (such as the above list-length-counting example). However, if such a reference is copied into a data structure, then the deferred increment must be performed at that time. It is also critical to perform the deferred increment before the object&#x27;s count drops to zero, to avoid a premature free.

A dramatic decrease in the overhead on counter updates was obtained by Levanoni and Petrank. They introduce the update coalescing method which coalesces many of the redundant reference count updates. Consider a pointer that in a given interval of the execution is updated several times. It first points to an object codice_2, then to an object codice_3, and so forth until at the end of the interval it points to some object codice_4. A reference counting algorithm would typically execute codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, ..., codice_10. But most of these updates are redundant. In order to have the reference count properly evaluated at the end of the interval it is enough to perform codice_5 and codice_10. The rest of the updates are redundant.

Levanoni and Petrank showed in 2001 how to use such update coalescing in a reference counting collector. When using update coalescing with an appropriate treatment of new objects, more than 99% of the counter updates are eliminated for typical Java benchmarks. 

Interestingly, update coalescing also eliminates the need to employ atomic operations during pointer updates in a concurrent setting, this solving reference counting issues in a concurrent setting. Therefore, update coalescing solves the third problem of naive reference counting (i.e., a costly overhead in a concurrent setting). Levanoni and Petrank presented an enhanced algorithm that may run concurrently with multithreaded applications employing only fine synchronization.

Blackburn and McKinley&#x27;s &quot;ulterior reference counting&quot; method in 2003 combines deferred reference counting with a copying nursery, observing that the majority of pointer mutations occur in young objects. This algorithm achieves throughput comparable with the fastest generational copying collectors with the low bounded pause times of reference counting.

==Dealing with reference cycles==
Perhaps the most obvious way to handle reference cycles is to design the system to avoid creating them. A system may explicitly forbid reference cycles; file systems with hard links often do this. Judicious use of &quot;weak&quot; (non-counted) references may also help avoid retain cycles; the Cocoa framework, for instance, recommends using &quot;strong&quot; references for parent-to-child relationships and &quot;weak&quot; references for child-to-parent relationships.

Systems may also be designed to tolerate or correct the cycles they create in some way. Developers may design code to explicitly &quot;tear down&quot; the references in a data structure when it is no longer needed, though this has the cost of requiring them to manually track that data structure&#x27;s lifetime. This technique can be automated by creating an &quot;owner&quot; object that does the tearing-down when it is destroyed; for instance, a Graph object&#x27;s destructor could delete the edges of its GraphNodes, breaking the reference cycles in the graph. Cycles may even be ignored in systems with short lives and a small amount of cyclic garbage, particularly when the system was developed using a methodology of avoiding cyclic data structures wherever possible, typically at the expense of efficiency.

Computer scientists have also discovered ways to detect and collect reference cycles automatically, without requiring changes in the data structure design. One simple solution is to periodically use a tracing garbage collector to reclaim cycles; since cycles typically constitute a relatively small amount of reclaimed space, the collector can be run much less often than with an ordinary tracing garbage collector.

Bacon describes a cycle-collection algorithm for reference counting with similarities to tracing collectors, including the same theoretical time bounds. It is based on the observation that a cycle can only be isolated when a reference count is decremented to a nonzero value. All objects which this occurs on are put on a &quot;roots&quot; list, and then periodically the program searches through the objects reachable from the roots for cycles. It knows it has found a cycle that can be collected when decrementing all the reference counts on a cycle of references brings them all down to zero. An enhanced version of this algorithm by Paz et al. is able to run concurrently with other operations and improve its efficiency by using the update coalescing method of Levanoni and Petrank.

==Variant forms==
Although it is possible to augment simple reference counts in a variety of ways, often a better solution can be found by performing reference counting in a fundamentally different way. Here we describe some of the variants on reference counting and their benefits and drawbacks.

===Weighted reference counting===
In weighted reference counting, each reference is assigned a &quot;weight&quot;, and each object tracks not the number of references referring to it, but the total weight of the references referring to it. The initial reference to a newly created object has a large weight, such as 216. Whenever this reference is copied, half of the weight goes to the new reference, and half of the weight stays with the old reference. Since the total weight does not change, the object&#x27;s reference count does not need to be updated.

Destroying a reference decrements the total weight by the weight of that reference. When the total weight becomes zero, all references have been destroyed. If an attempt is made to copy a reference with a weight of 1, the reference has to &quot;get more weight&quot; by adding to the total weight and then adding this new weight to the reference, and then splitting it. An alternative in this situation is to create an &quot;indirection&quot; reference object, the initial reference to which is created with a large weight which can then be split.

The property of not needing to access a reference count when a reference is copied is particularly helpful when the object&#x27;s reference count is expensive to access, for example because it is in another process, on disk, or even across a network. It can also help increase concurrency by avoiding many threads locking a reference count to increase it. Thus, weighted reference counting is most useful in parallel, multiprocess, database, or distributed applications.

The primary problem with simple weighted reference counting is that destroying a reference still requires accessing the reference count, and if many references are destroyed, this can cause the same bottlenecks we seek to avoid. Some adaptations of weighted reference counting seek to avoid this by transferring weight from a dying reference to an active reference.

Weighted reference counting was independently devised by Bevan and Watson &amp; Watson in 1987.

===Indirect reference counting===
In indirect reference counting, it is necessary to keep track of the reference&#x27;s source. This means that two references are kept to the object: a direct one which is used for invocations; and an indirect one which forms part of a diffusion tree, such as in the Dijkstra–Scholten algorithm, which allows a garbage collector to identify dead objects. This approach prevents an object from being discarded prematurely.

==Examples of use==

===Garbage collection===
As a collection algorithm, reference counting tracks, for each object, a count of the number of references to it held by other objects. If an object&#x27;s reference count reaches zero, the object has become inaccessible, and can be destroyed.

When an object is destroyed, any objects referenced by that object also have their reference counts decreased. Because of this, removing a single reference can potentially lead to a large number of objects being freed. A common modification allows reference counting to be made incremental: instead of destroying an object as soon as its reference count becomes zero, it is added to a list of unreferenced objects, and periodically (or as needed) one or more items from this list are destroyed.

Simple reference counts require frequent updates. Whenever a reference is destroyed or overwritten, the reference count of the object it references is decremented, and whenever one is created or copied, the reference count of the object it references is incremented.

Reference counting is also used in file systems and distributed systems, where full non-incremental tracing garbage collection is too time-consuming because of the size of the object graph and slow access speed.

===Component Object Model===
Microsoft&#x27;s Component Object Model (COM) and WinRT makes pervasive use of reference counting. In fact, two of the three methods that all COM objects must provide (in the IUnknown interface) increment or decrement the reference count. Much of the Windows Shell and many Windows applications (including MS Internet Explorer, MS Office, and countless third-party products) are built on COM, demonstrating the viability of reference counting in large-scale systems.

One primary motivation for reference counting in COM is to enable interoperability across different programming languages and runtime systems. A client need only know how to invoke object methods in order to manage object life cycle; thus, the client is completely abstracted from whatever memory allocator the implementation of the COM object uses. As a typical example, a Visual Basic program using a COM object is agnostic towards whether that object was allocated (and must later be deallocated) by a C++ allocator or another Visual Basic component.

===C++===
C++ does not perform reference-counting by default, fulfilling its philosophy of not adding functionality that might incur overheads where the user has not explicitly requested it. Objects that are shared but not owned can be accessed via a reference, raw pointer, or iterator (a conceptual generalisation of pointers).

However, by the same token, C++ provides native ways for users to opt-into such functionality: C++11 provides reference counted smart pointers, via the  class, enabling automatic shared memory-management of dynamically allocated objects. Programmers can use this in conjunction with weak pointers (via ) to break cyclic dependencies. Objects that are dynamically allocated but not intended to be shared can have their lifetime automatically managed using a .

In addition, C++11&#x27;s move semantics further reduce the extent to which reference counts need to be modified by removing the deep copy normally used when a function returns an object, as it allows for a simple copy of the pointer of said object.

===Cocoa (Objective-C)===

Apple&#x27;s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks (and related frameworks, such as Core Foundation) use manual reference counting, much like COM. Traditionally this was accomplished by the programmer manually sending codice_13 and codice_14 messages to objects, but Automatic Reference Counting, a Clang compiler feature that automatically inserts these messages as needed, was added in iOS 5 and Mac OS X 10.7. Mac OS X 10.5 introduced a tracing garbage collector as an alternative to reference counting, but it was deprecated in OS X 10.8 and removed from the Objective-C runtime library in macOS Sierra. iOS has never supported a tracing garbage collector.

===Delphi===

Delphi is mostly not a garbage collected language, in that user-defined types must still be manually allocated and deallocated; however, it does provide automatic collection using reference counting for a few built-in types, such as strings, dynamic arrays, and interfaces, for ease of use and to simplify the generic database functionality. It is up to the programmer to decide whether to use the built-in types; Delphi programmers have complete access to low-level memory management like in C/C++. So all potential cost of Delphi&#x27;s reference counting can, if desired, be easily circumvented.

Some of the reasons reference counting may have been preferred to other forms of garbage collection in Delphi include:

* The general benefits of reference counting, such as prompt collection.
* Cycles either cannot occur or do not occur in practice because none of the garbage-collected built-in types are recursive. (using interfaces one could create such scenario, but that is not common usage)
* The overhead in code size required for reference counting is very small (on native x86, typically a single LOCK INC, LOCK DEC or LOCK XADD instruction, which ensures atomicity in any environment), and no separate thread of control is needed for collection as would be needed for a tracing garbage collector.
* Many instances of the most commonly used garbage-collected type, the string, have a short lifetime, since they are typically intermediate values in string manipulation. A lot of local string usage could be optimized away, but the compiler currently doesn&#x27;t do it.
* The reference count of a string is checked before mutating a string. This allows reference count 1 strings to be mutated directly whilst higher reference count strings are copied before mutation. This allows the general behaviour of old style pascal strings to be preserved whilst eliminating the cost of copying the string on every assignment. 
* Because garbage-collection is only done on built-in types, reference counting can be efficiently integrated into the library routines used to manipulate each datatype, keeping the overhead needed for updating of reference counts low. Moreover, a lot of the runtime library is in hand-optimized assembler.
* The string type can be cast to a pointer to char, and high performance operations can be performed that way. This is important since both Delphi and FPC implement their RTL in Pascal. Various other automated types have such casting options.

===GObject===
The GObject object-oriented programming framework implements reference counting on its base types, including weak references. Reference incrementing and decrementing uses atomic operations for thread safety. A significant amount of the work in writing bindings to GObject from high-level languages lies in adapting GObject reference counting to work with the language&#x27;s own memory management system.

The Vala programming language uses GObject reference counting as its primary garbage collection system, along with copy-heavy string handling.

===Perl===
Perl also uses reference counting, without any special handling of circular references, although (as in Cocoa and C++ above), Perl does support weak references, which allows programmers to avoid creating a cycle.

===PHP===
PHP uses a reference counting mechanism for its internal variable management. Since PHP 5.3, it implements the algorithm from Bacon&#x27;s above mentioned paper. PHP allows you to turn on and off the cycle collection with user-level functions. It also allows you to manually force the purging mechanism to be run.

===Python===
Python also uses reference counting and offers cycle detection as well (and can reclaim reference cycles).

===Rust===
Like other low-level languages, Rust does not provide reference counting by default. Instead, any constructed type will be dropped when it falls out of scope. When a programmer needs to define the scope of a constructed type, they often use lifetimes. 

However, the language also offers various alternatives to complex forms of memory management. Reference counting functionality is provided by the codice_15 and codice_16 types, which are non-atomic and atomic respectively. 

For example, the type codice_17 provides shared ownership of a value of type codice_18, allocated on the heap for multiple references to its data.
use std::rc::Rc;

struct Cat {
 color: String,

fn main() {
 let cat = Cat { color: &quot;black&quot;.to_string() };
 let cat = Rc::new(cat);
Using these constructs allows programmers to avoid lifetimes for a small runtime cost. Both reference counters keep track of the number of owners, as they must drop themselves when no owners remain. 

One noteworthy facet of these types is related to their usage as a shared reference. In Rust, shared references cannot mutate their held data, so codice_15 often comes bundled with codice_20, and codice_16 with codice_22, in contexts where interior mutability is necessary. 

Interior mutability without codice_23 has performance costs, too, so, for maximum performance, some applications may call for additional complexity.

===Squirrel===
Squirrel uses reference counting with cycle detection.
This tiny language is relatively unknown outside the video game industry; however, it is a concrete example of how reference counting can be practical and efficient (especially in realtime environments).

=== Swift ===
Swift uses reference counting to track and manage the memory of class instances, and provides the codice_24 keyword for creating weak references. Instances of value types do not use reference counting.

===Tcl===
Tcl 8 uses reference counting for memory management of values (Tcl Obj structs). Since Tcl&#x27;s values are immutable, reference cycles are impossible to form and no cycle detection scheme is needed. Operations that would replace a value with a modified copy are generally optimized to instead modify the original when its reference count indicates that it is not shared. The references are counted at a data structure level, so the problems with very frequent updates discussed above do not arise.

=== Xojo ===
Xojo also uses reference counting, without any special handling of circular references, although (as in Cocoa and C++ above), Xojo does support weak references, which allows programmers to avoid creating a cycle.

===File systems===
Many file systems maintain reference counts to any particular block or file, for example the inode &quot;link count&quot; on Unix-style file systems, which are usually known as hard links. When the count reaches zero, the file can be safely deallocated. While references can still be made from directories, some Unixes only allow references from live processes, and there can be files that exist outside the file system hierarchy.

<text>The red-eye effect in photography is the common appearance of red pupils in color photographs of eyes. It occurs when using a photographic flash at low lighting or at night. When a flash passes through the eyes and rebounds at the back of the eye, it causes a red reflex in an image, turning the subject&#x27;s eyes red. The hue is mostly caused by a high concentration of blood in the choroid. The effect can also be influenced by the near proximity of the flash and camera lens. In children, a different hue red reflex, such as white or yellow, may indicate an illness. In animals, a similar effect could cause their eyes to change colors in photographs.

The effect can be avoided physically by instructing the subject to look away from the lens, increasing the brightness of the photographic location, or moving the flash further away from the lens, or digitally by using the red-eye correction option on digital cameras or by removing the effect in editing software. Scholars have developed a number of red-eye detection techniques to improve digital red-eye removal.

== Causes ==
The red-eye effect occurs in the eyes of humans when a photography flash is used in low light or at night. The flash travels through the eyes and rebounds at the rear of the eye, turning the eyes red (red reflex) in a photograph. The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid, which supports the back of the eye and lies behind the retina. Melanin also plays a role in the effect, as individuals with less melanin, such as albinos, reflect more light. The close distance of the flash to the camera lens can also have an impact, especially on cameras with built-in flash.

The effect could also infrequently occur in only one eye of persons with cataracts or tumors, or it may be exacerbated by photographing subjects that are drunk. In children, if the red reflex is white, it may indicate retinoblastoma malignancy, whereas yellow color may indicate Coats&#x27; disease. If the effect is asymmetrical, it may indicate strabismus. A similar reaction to the red-eye occurs in animals, turning their eyes different colors.

== Prevention ==
Either physical or digital manipulation of the effect is possible. The subject can turn away from the camera lens, the flash can be mounted on a hot shoe, or the lighting can be increased to make the subject&#x27;s pupils more constricted. The effect could potentially be avoided by positioning the flash off the side of the camera or by pointing it away from the subject and toward a white solid surface to bounce the flash off of it. The subject could also be photographed near a bright light source or in sunlight. To lessen the effect, the photographer might alternatively employ the fill flash technique. The effect can be removed digitally by using red-eye correction.

== Cure ==
Digital cameras with red-eye correction can eliminate the effect by using flash lighting that fires rapidly and repeatedly just before a photograph is taken, which causes the subject&#x27;s pupils to contract. Editing software can also eliminate the effect.

Scholars have proposed a number of red-eye detection methods for digital red-eye correction. The red-eye detection algorithm developed by electronic engineers Seunghwan Yoo and Rae-Hong Park is composed of face detection, region-growing, and red-eye detection. Following the detection of the subject&#x27;s face and eyes, the algorithm searches for red-eye regions, which are subsequently enlarged using the region-growing technique. They claim that pupil size calculation, pupil painting, and iris detection make up the red-eye correction that may then take place. Computer scientists Xiao-Ping Miao and Terence Sim have proposed their technique for detecting red-eye by fusing subjects&#x27; flash and non-flash photos. Scholars Tauseef Ali, Asif Khan, and Intaek Kim put forth an algorithm that, following facial recognition, grayscales the image before applying red-eye correction. On the contrary, researchers Richard Youmaran and Andy Adler presented a method for improving the quality of videos with the red-eye phenomenon. They have stated that their method consists of two frames, the first shot under standard illumination with no infrared light and the second one using infrared light.

<doc id="26492" wikidata="Q1648128" url="?curid=26492" title="Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2">
<text>Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, commonly referred to simply as Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) and also known as herpes zoster oticus, is inflammation of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve as a late consequence of &quot;varicella zoster virus&quot; (VZV). In regard to the frequency, less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in RHS. It is traditionally defined as a triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicles close to the ear and auditory canal. Due to its proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, the virus can spread and cause hearing loss, tinnitus (hearing noises that are not caused by outside sounds), and vertigo. It is common for diagnoses to be overlooked or delayed, which can raise the likelihood of long-term consequences. It is more complicated than Bell&#x27;s palsy. Therapy aims to shorten its overall length, while also providing pain relief and averting any consequences.

==Signs and symptoms==
Early symptoms include intense pain in one ear, the jaw on one side or the neck on one side which may precede the acute facial paralysis by a week or more.

Acute symptoms include:

* acute facial nerve paralysis 
* pain in the ear, jaw and/or neck
* taste loss in the front two-thirds of the tongue 
* dry mouth and eyes 
* an erythematous vesicular rash in the ear canal, the tongue, and/or hard palate.

Because the vestibulocochlear nerve is in proximity to the geniculate ganglion, it may also be affected and patients may also experience:

* tinnitus 
* hearing loss
* hyperacusis
* vertigo

The swallow reflex might also be affected.

Involvement of the trigeminal nerve can cause numbness of the face.

==Pathophysiology==
The varicella zoster virus infects people and results in a distributed vesicular rash with fever, known as chickenpox. Respiratory droplets are the main method of virus transmission during the acute stage of the infection. After it subsides, it stays dormant in nerve cells in the body. It may reactivate under conditions of physiological stress or if the immune system is suppressed in any way (for example during an illness or undergoing chemotherapy), resulting in herpes zoster, also known as shingles or Ramsay Hunt syndrome when facial paralysis in involved. If the nerve cells affected lie within the facial nerves, it causes the symptoms described above.

Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 is estimated to account for 12% of all facial nerve paralysis. It occurs in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals with immunocompromised patients often having more severe disease presentation. RHS may occur in any age group with cases reported in patients ranging in age from 3 months to 82 years.

The affected ganglion is responsible for the movements of facial muscles, the touch sensation of a part of ear and ear canal, the taste function of the frontal two-thirds of the tongue, and the moisturization of the eyes and the mouth. The syndrome specifically refers to the combination of this entity with weakness of the muscles activated by the facial nerve. In isolation, the latter is called Bell&#x27;s palsy.

However, as with shingles, the lack of lesions does not definitely exclude the existence of a herpes infection. Even before the eruption of vesicles, varicella zoster virus can be detected from the skin of the ear.

==Diagnosis==
Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 can be diagnosed based on clinical features; however, in ambiguous cases, PCR or direct immunofluorescent assay of vesicular fluid can help with the diagnosis. Laboratory studies such as WBC count, ESR and electrolytes can distinguish infectious versus inflammatory etiologies.

===Clinical diagnosis===
On a physical exam, look for vesicular exanthema on the external auditory canal, concha and or pinna. Dry eyes with possible lower cornea epithelium damage due to incomplete closure of eyelids. It is possible to have Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 without an external rash present. This is called &quot;RHS sine herpete&quot; and may occur in up to 30% of patients.

===Diagnostic procedures===
Ramsay Hunt Syndrome type 2 can usually be diagnosed based on clinical features. However, for suspected cases with unclear presentation, varicella zoster virus can be isolated from vesicle fluid. Tear culture PCR can have positive varicella zoster virus. However, 25–35% of patients with Bell&#x27;s palsy can have false positive varicella zoster virus detected in tears. If central nervous system complications such as meningitis, ventriculitis or meningoencephalitis are suspected, prompt lumbar puncture with spinal fluid analysis and imaging (CT head) are recommended.

An MRI with contrast may be ordered if the diagnosis is ambiguous so as to rule out other causes of acute facial paralysis such as a stroke, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer or tumors. This test is most commonly ordered if the patient presents atypically with RHS sine herpete.

==Prevention==
Shingles is prevented by immunizing against the causal virus, varicella zoster, using a zoster vaccine. Vaccination is recommended for adults 50 and older. Two versions of the vaccine are available, the live attenuated Zostavax (now discontinued in the US, essentially a larger-dose chickenpox vaccine) and the protein subunit Shingrix.

==Treatment==
Treatments for Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 are used to reduce further damage caused by the viral infection. These medications will not reverse any damage that has already occurred at the time that they are prescribed. Initial treatment with a corticosteroid such as prednisone and an antiviral drug such as acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir for 5 to 7 days is standard; however, some studies have shown later damage to the facial nerve and recommend 21 days of antivirals. Studies indicate that treatment started within 72 hours of the onset of facial paralysis improves the chances of the patient experiencing significant recovery. Chances of recovery appear to decrease when treatment is delayed. Delay of treatment may result in permanent facial nerve paralysis. However, some studies demonstrate that even when steroids are started promptly, only 22% of all patients achieve full recovery of facial paralysis. Treatment apparently has no effect on the recovery of hearing loss.

Meclizine, benzodiazepines such as diazepam, and vestibular therapy are sometimes used to treat the vertigo.

During the acute recovery phase, the eye on the affected side of the face may not blink completely or at all and may not close tightly or at all when sleeping. If the eye is dry or feels irritated, this is a strong indication that the eye is not properly blinking or closing completely. Using artificial tears every 5 to 20 minutes while awake and protecting the eye while asleep are very important to maintaining the health of the eye. While asleep, applying overnight eye gel and using sensitive skin medical tape or an eye patch to keep the eye closed or using a moisture chamber can protect the eye. Taking these precautions is extremely important to preserve the health and functionality of the eye and prevent corneal abrasions and corneal ulcers.

Nerve pain associated with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome may be extreme and centered in the ear, neck, cheek, jaw and face. This nerve pain may not respond well to standard pain treatments including NSAIDS and opioids. Medication specifically for nerve pain such as tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin have been shown to be effective for the neuropathic pain and post-herpetic neuralgia common with RHS.

Physical therapy, excessive movement or electrical stimulation practiced during the first year of recovery greatly increase the chances of long term complications, including hyperactive muscles and synkinesis, both of which are permanent. The most common form of synkinesis for Ramsay Hunt Syndrome patients involves the eye being connected to the mouth (i.e. blinking while speaking, tearing while eating) and chin dimpling (chin dimples forming when speaking). Many forms of synkinesis can be managed with use of medical Botox administered by a qualified doctor.

== Prognosis ==
Overall between 30% and 70% of Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 patients recover most functionality depending on early diagnosis and treatment with chances of recovery dropping to 50% if treatment is delayed beyond 72 hours.

Once the active infection has been cleared with antivirals, the facial nerves will begin to regrow at approximately 1mm per day. The recovery process for Ramsay Hunt syndrome is significantly longer than Bell&#x27;s palsy. On average, Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients begin to see their symptoms resolve between 5 and 12 months post diagnosis and can expect to see continued resolution of symptoms for up to 2 years post diagnosis. Occasionally, patients may experience minor improvements beyond 2 years. The order in which symptoms resolve is highly individual. Although most patients will experience some recovery; complete recoveries with no lingering symptoms are in the minority. The main factors affecting the overall prognosis are the severity of symptoms at onset, the age and general health of the patient and the timing of initial treatments

Common long term effects include:

* Permanent facial paralysis of some or all of the affected facial nerves
* Corneal abrasion and/or ulcers if proper care is not taken of the affected eye which may affect long-term vision
* Neuropathic pain and post-herpetic neuralgia can commonly persist for more than 3 months and a year to 18 months is not uncommon. More than 50% of patients report experiencing post-herpetic neuralgia.
* Post-herpetic fatigue is also a common long term side effect and may persist for several months to a year or more. 
* Weakness in the affected facial muscles
* Sensitivity to cold and heat in the affected facial muscles
* Synkinesis including eye fluttering, chin dimpling and eye watering
* Hyperactive muscles that contract inappropriately

Less common long term effects include:

* Verbal processing deficits including speaking the incorrect word (aphasia)
* Memory deficits including failures in short-term memory
* Vertigo
* Partial or full hearing loss
* Hyperacusis
* Hyperactive muscles particularly in the neck and cheek
* Tinnitus

Some patients report an increased sensitivity to barometric pressure with changes in weather patterns causing pain on the affected side of the face.

==History and notable cases==
The syndrome is named for James Ramsay Hunt, the neurologist who first described it.

In 2013, Olivia Chow was diagnosed with the condition.

On June 10, 2022, Canadian singer Justin Bieber announced in a video posted on Instagram that he had been diagnosed with the condition. He has since entered treatment, and recovered successfully.

On May 18, 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that United States Senator Dianne Feinstein had developed the condition as a side effect of a shingles infection.

<doc id="26494" wikidata="Q3041074" url="?curid=26494" title="Race and intelligence">
<text>Discussions of race and intelligence—specifically regarding claims of differences in intelligence along racial lines—have appeared in both popular science and academic research since the modern concept of race was first introduced. With the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century, differences in average test performance between racial groups have been observed, though these differences have fluctuated and in many cases steadily decreased over time. Complicating the issue, modern science has concluded that race is a socially constructed phenomenon rather than a biological reality, and there exist various conflicting definitions of intelligence. In particular, the validity of IQ testing as a metric for human intelligence is disputed. Today, the scientific consensus is that genetics does not explain differences in IQ test performance between groups, and that observed differences are environmental in origin. 

Pseudoscientific claims of inherent differences in intelligence between races have played a central role in the history of scientific racism. The first tests showing differences in IQ scores between different population groups in the United States were the tests of United States Army recruits in World War I. In the 1920s, groups of eugenics lobbyists argued that these results demonstrated that African Americans and certain immigrant groups were of inferior intellect to Anglo-Saxon white people, and that this was due to innate biological differences. In turn, they used such beliefs to justify policies of racial segregation. However, other studies soon appeared, contesting these conclusions and arguing that the Army tests had not adequately controlled for environmental factors, such as socioeconomic and educational inequality between the groups. 

Later observations of phenomena such as the Flynn effect and disparities in access to prenatal care highlighted ways in which environmental factors affect group IQ differences. In recent decades, as understanding of human genetics has advanced, claims of inherent differences in intelligence between races have been broadly rejected by scientists on both theoretical and empirical grounds.

== History of the controversy ==

Claims of differences in intelligence between races have been used to justify colonialism, slavery, racism, social Darwinism, and racial eugenics. Claims of intellectual inferiority were used to justify British wars and colonial campaigns in Asia. Racial thinkers such as Arthur de Gobineau in France relied crucially on the assumption that black people were innately inferior to white people in developing their ideologies of white supremacy. Even Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, believed black people to be innately inferior to white people in physique and intellect. At the same time in the United States, prominent examples of African-American genius such the autodidact and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the pioneering sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, and the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar stood as high-profile counterexamples to widespread stereotypes of black intellectual inferiority. In Britain, Japan&#x27;s military victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War began to reverse negative stereotypes of &quot;oriental&quot; inferiority. 

=== Early IQ testing ===
The first practical intelligence test, the Binet-Simon Intelligence Test, was developed between 1905 and 1908 by Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently. Binet&#x27;s test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by Lewis Terman (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales. In 1916 Terman wrote that Mexican-Americans, African-Americans, and Native Americans have a mental &quot;dullness [that] seems to be racial, or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they come.&quot;

The US Army used a different set of tests developed by Robert Yerkes to evaluate draftees for World War I. Based on the Army&#x27;s data, prominent psychologists and eugenicists such as Henry H. Goddard, Harry H. Laughlin, and Princeton professor Carl Brigham wrote that people from southern and eastern Europe were less intelligent than native-born Americans or immigrants from the Nordic countries, and that black Americans were less intelligent than white Americans. The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the conservationist and theorist of scientific racism Madison Grant, who considered the so-called Nordic race to be superior, but under threat because of immigration by &quot;inferior breeds.&quot; In his influential work, &quot;A Study of American Intelligence,&quot; psychologist Carl Brigham used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the &quot;Nordic race&quot;.

In the 1920s, some US states enacted eugenic laws, such as Virginia&#x27;s 1924 Racial Integrity Act, which established the one-drop rule (of &#x27;racial purity&#x27;) as law. Many scientists reacted negatively to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment (such as speaking English as a second language) to test results. By the mid-1930s, many psychologists in the US had adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results. The psychologist Carl Brigham repudiated his own earlier arguments, explaining that he had come to realize that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence.

Discussions of the issue in the United States, especially in the writings of Madison Grant, influenced German Nazi claims that the &quot;Nordics&quot; were a &quot;master race.&quot; As American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic. Anthropologists such as Franz Boas, Ruth Benedict, and Gene Weltfish did much to demonstrate that claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence were unscientific. Nonetheless, a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate Wickliffe Draper continued to use intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.

=== The Pioneer Fund and &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; ===
As the desegregation of the American South gained traction in the 1950s, debate about black intelligence resurfaced. Audrey Shuey, funded by Draper&#x27;s Pioneer Fund, published a new analysis of Yerkes&#x27; tests, concluding that black people really were of inferior intellect to white people. This study was used by segregationists to argue that it was to the advantage of black children to be educated separately from the superior white children. In the 1960s, the debate was revived when William Shockley publicly defended the view that black children were innately unable to learn as well as white children. Arthur Jensen expressed similar opinions in his &quot;Harvard Educational Review&quot; article, &quot;How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?,&quot; which questioned the value of compensatory education for African-American children. He suggested that poor educational performance in such cases reflected an underlying genetic cause rather than lack of stimulation at home or other environmental factors.

Another revival of public debate followed the appearance of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994), a book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray that supported the general viewpoint of Jensen. A statement in support of Herrnstein and Murray titled &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence,&quot; was published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; with 52 signatures. &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; also led to critical responses in a statement titled &quot;&quot; of the American Psychological Association and in several books, including &quot;The Bell Curve Debate&quot; (1995), &quot;Inequality by Design&quot; (1996) and a second edition of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; (1996) by Stephen Jay Gould.

Some of the authors proposing genetic explanations for group differences have received funding from the Pioneer Fund, which was headed by J. Philippe Rushton until his death in 2012. Arthur Jensen, who jointly with Rushton published a 2005 review article arguing that the difference in average IQs between blacks and whites is partly due to genetics, received $1.1 million in grants from the Pioneer Fund. According to Ashley Montagu, &quot;The University of California&#x27;s Arthur Jensen, cited twenty-three times in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;″s bibliography, is the book&#x27;s principal authority on the intellectual inferiority of blacks.&quot;

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Pioneer Fund as a hate group, citing the fund&#x27;s history, its funding of race and intelligence research, and its connections with racist individuals. Other researchers have criticized the Pioneer Fund for promoting scientific racism, eugenics and white supremacy.

== Conceptual issues ==

=== Intelligence and IQ ===

The concept of intelligence and the degree to which intelligence is measurable are matters of debate. There is no consensus about how to define intelligence; nor is it universally accepted that it is something that can be meaningfully measured by a single figure. A recurring criticism is that different societies value and promote different kinds of skills and that the concept of intelligence is therefore culturally variable and cannot be measured by the same criteria in different societies. Consequently, some critics argue that it makes no sense to propose relationships between intelligence and other variables.

Correlations between scores on various types of IQ tests led English psychologist Charles Spearman to propose in 1904 the existence of an underlying factor, which he referred to as &quot;g&quot; or &quot;general intelligence&quot;, a trait which is supposed to be innate. Another proponent of this view is Arthur Jensen. This view, however, has been contradicted by a number of studies showing that education and changes in environment can significantly improve IQ test results.

Other psychometricians have argued that, whether or not there is such a thing as a general intelligence factor, performance on tests relies crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This means that comparisons of test scores between persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits do not reveal their relative innate potentials.

=== Race ===

The consensus view among geneticists, biologists and anthropologists is that race is a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one, a view supported by considerable genetics research. The current mainstream view is that race is a social construction based on folk ideologies that construct groups based on social disparities and superficial physical characteristics. A 2023 consensus report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine stated: &quot;In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic differences between groups.&quot;

The concept of human &quot;races&quot; as natural and separate divisions within the human species has also been rejected by the American Anthropological Association. The official position of the AAA, adopted in 1998, is that advances in scientific knowledge have made it &quot;clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups&quot; and that &quot;any attempt to establish lines of division among biological populations [is] both arbitrary and subjective.&quot; A more recent statement from the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (2019) declares that &quot;Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters.&quot;

Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace, the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther, and the geneticist Joseph Graves, have argued that the cluster structure of genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the influence of these hypotheses on the choice of populations to sample. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental, but if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials. Kaplan and Winther conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther&#x27;s view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. argue that the social construction of race derives not from any valid scientific basis but rather &quot;from people&#x27;s desire to classify.&quot;

In studies of human intelligence, race is almost always determined using self-reports rather than analyses of genetic characteristics. According to psychologist David Rowe, self-report is the preferred method for racial classification in studies of racial differences because classification based on genetic markers alone ignore the &quot;cultural, behavioral, sociological, psychological, and epidemiological variables&quot; that distinguish racial groups. Hunt and Carlson disagreed, writing that &quot;Nevertheless, self-identification is a surprisingly reliable guide to genetic composition,&quot; citing a study by . Sternberg and Grigorenko disputed Hunt and Carlson&#x27;s interpretation of Tang&#x27;s results as supporting the view that racial divisions are biological; rather, &quot;Tang et al.&#x27;s point was that ancient geographic ancestry rather than current residence is associated with self-identification and not that such self-identification provides evidence for the existence of biological race.&quot;

== Group differences ==
The study of human intelligence is one of the most controversial topics in psychology, in part because of difficulty reaching agreement about the meaning of &quot;intelligence&quot; and objections to the assumption that intelligence can be meaningfully measured by IQ tests. Claims that there are innate differences in intelligence between racial and ethnic groups—which go back at least to the 19th century—have been criticized for relying on specious assumptions and research methods and for serving as an ideological framework for discrimination and racism.

In a 2012 study of tests of different components of intelligence, Hampshire et al. expressed disagreement with the view of Jensen and Rushton that genetic factors must play a role in IQ differences between races, stating that &quot;it remains unclear ... whether population differences in intelligence test scores are driven by heritable factors or by other correlated demographic variables such as socioeconomic status, education level, and motivation. More relevantly, it is questionable whether [population differences in intelligence test scores] relate to a unitary intelligence factor, as opposed to a bias in testing paradigms toward particular components of a more complex intelligence construct.&quot; According to Jackson and Weidman, 
=== Test scores ===

In the United States, Asians on average score higher than White people, who tend to score higher than Hispanics, who tend to score higher than African Americans. Much greater variation in IQ scores exists within each ethnic group than between them. A 2001 meta-analysis of the results of 6,246,729 participants tested for cognitive ability or aptitude found a difference in average scores between black people and white people of 1.1 standard deviations. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (N = 2.4 million) and Graduate Record Examination (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate settings (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).

In response to the controversial 1994 book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, the American Psychological Association (APA) formed a task-force of eleven experts, which issued a report &quot;&quot; in 1996. Regarding group differences, the report reaffirmed the consensus that differences within groups are much wider than differences between groups, and that claims of ethnic differences in intelligence should be scrutinized carefully, as such claims had been used to justify racial discrimination. The report also acknowledged problems with the racial categories used, as these categories are neither consistently applied, nor homogeneous .

In the UK, some African groups have higher average educational attainment and standardized test scores than the overall population. In 2010–2011, white British pupils were 2.3% less likely to have gained 5 A*–C grades at GCSE than the national average, whereas the likelihood was 21.8% above average for those of Nigerian origin, 5.5% above average for those of Ghanaian origin, and 1.4% above average for those of Sierra Leonian origin. For the two other African ethnic groups on which data was available, the likelihood was 23.7% below average for those of Somali origin and 35.3% below average for those of Congolese origin. In 2014, Black-African pupils of 11 language groups were more likely to pass Key Stage 2 Maths 4+ in England than the national average. Overall, the average pass rate by ethnicity was 86.5% for white British (N = 395,787), whereas it was 85.6% for Black-Africans (N = 18,497). Nevertheless, several Black-African language groups, including Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Akan, Ga, Swahili, Edo, Ewe, Amharic speakers, and English-speaking Africans, each had an average pass rate above the white British average (total N = 9,314), with the Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, and Amhara having averages above 90% (N = 2,071). In 2017–2018, the percentage of pupils getting a strong pass (grade 5 or above) in the English and maths GCSE (in Key Stage 4) was 42.7% for whites (N = 396,680) and 44.3% for Black-Africans (N = 18,358).

=== Flynn effect and the closing gap ===

The &#x27;Flynn effect&#x27; — a term coined after researcher James R. Flynn — refers to the substantial rise in raw IQ test scores observed in many parts of the world during the 20th century. In the United States, the increase was continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to about 1998 when the gains stopped and some tests even showed decreasing test scores. For example, the average scores of black people on some IQ tests in 1995 were the same as the scores of white people in 1945. As one pair of academics phrased it, &quot;the typical African American today probably has a slightly higher IQ than the grandparents of today&#x27;s average white American.&quot;

Flynn himself argued that the dramatic changes having taken place between one just generation and the next pointed strongly at an environmental explanation, and that it is highly unlikely that genetic factors could have accounted for the increasing scores. The Flynn effect, along with Flynn&#x27;s analysis, continues to hold significance in the context of the black/white IQ gap debate, demonstrating the potential for environmental factors to influence IQ test scores by as much as 1 standard deviation, a scale of change that had previously been doubted.

A distinct but related observation has been the gradual narrowing of the American black-white IQ gap in the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black–white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults. Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of black people and white people closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002, a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished. Reviews by Flynn and Dickens, Mackintosh, and Nisbett &quot;et al.&quot; accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. Flynn and Dickens summarize this trend, stating, &quot;The constancy of the Black-White IQ gap is a myth and therefore cannot be cited as evidence that the racial IQ gap is genetic in origin.&quot;

==Environmental factors==
===Health and nutrition===

Environmental factors including childhood lead exposure, low rates of breast feeding, and poor nutrition are significantly correlated with poor cognitive development and functioning. For example, childhood exposure to associated with homes in poorer correlates with an average IQ drop of 7 points, and iodine deficiency causes a decline, on average, of 12 IQ points. Such impairments may sometimes be permanent, but in some cases they be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. 
The first two years of life are critical for malnutrition, the consequences of which are often irreversible and include poor cognitive development, educability, and future economic productivity. Mackintosh points out that, for American black people, infant mortality is about twice as high as for white people, and low birth weight is twice as prevalent. At the same time, white mothers are twice as likely to breastfeed their infants, and breastfeeding is directly correlated with IQ for low-birth-weight infants. In this way, a wide number of health-related factors which influence IQ are unequally distributed between the two groups.

The Copenhagen consensus in 2004 stated that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people: it is estimated that one-third of the total global population is affected by iodine deficiency. In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under have anaemia because of insufficient iron in their diets.

Other scholars have found that simply the standard of nutrition has a significant effect on population intelligence, and that the Flynn effect may be caused by increasing nutrition standards across the world. James Flynn has himself argued against this view.

Some recent research has argued that the retardation caused in brain development by infectious diseases, many of which are more prevalent in non-white populations, may be an important factor in explaining the differences in IQ between different regions of the world. The findings of this research, showing the correlation between IQ, race and infectious diseases was also shown to apply to the IQ gap in the US, suggesting that this may be an important environmental factor.

A 2013 meta-analysis by the World Health Organization found that, after controlling for maternal IQ, breastfeeding was associated with IQ gains of 2.19 points. The authors suggest that this relationship is causal but state that the practical significance of this gain is debatable; however, they highlight one study suggesting an association between breastfeeding and academic performance in Brazil, where &quot;breastfeeding duration does not present marked variability by socioeconomic position.&quot; Colen and Ramey (2014) similarly find that controlling for sibling comparisons within families, rather than between families, reduces the correlation between breastfeeding status and WISC IQ scores by nearly a third, but further find the relationship between breastfeeding duration and WISC IQ scores to be insignificant. They suggest that &quot;much of the beneficial long-term effects typically attributed to breastfeeding, per se, may primarily be due to selection pressures into infant feeding practices along key demographic characteristics such as race and socioeconomic status.&quot; Reichman estimates that no more than 3 to 4% of the black–white IQ gap can be explained by black–white disparities in low birth weight.

===Education===
Several studies have proposed that a large part of the gap in IQ test performance can be attributed to differences in quality of education. Racial discrimination in education has been proposed as one possible cause of differences in educational quality between races. According to a paper by Hala Elhoweris, Kagendo Mutua, Negmeldin Alsheikh and Pauline Holloway, teachers&#x27; referral decisions for students to participate in gifted and talented educational programs were influenced in part by the students&#x27; ethnicity.

The Abecedarian Early Intervention Project, an intensive early childhood education project, was also able to bring about an average IQ gain of 4.4 points at age 21 in the black children who participated in it compared to controls. Arthur Jensen agreed that the Abecedarian project demonstrated that education can have a significant effect on IQ, but also declared his view that no educational program thus far had been able to reduce the black–white IQ gap by more than a third, and that differences in education are thus unlikely to be its only cause.

A series of studies by Joseph Fagan and Cynthia Holland measured the effect of prior exposure to the kind of cognitive tasks posed in IQ tests on test performance. Assuming that the IQ gap was the result of lower exposure to tasks using the cognitive functions usually found in IQ tests among African American test takers, they prepared a group of African Americans in this type of tasks before taking an IQ test. The researchers found that there was no subsequent difference in performance between the African-Americans and white test takers. Daley and Onwuegbuzie conclude that Fagan and Holland demonstrate that &quot;differences in knowledge between black people and white people for intelligence test items can be erased when equal opportunity is provided for exposure to the information to be tested&quot;. A similar argument is made by David Marks who argues that IQ differences correlate well with differences in literacy suggesting that developing literacy skills through education causes an increase in IQ test performance.

A 2003 study found that two variables—stereotype threat and the degree of educational attainment of children&#x27;s fathers—partially explained the black–white gap in cognitive ability test scores, undermining the hereditarian view that they stemmed from immutable genetic factors.

===Socioeconomic environment===
Different aspects of the socioeconomic environment in which children are raised have been shown to correlate with part of the IQ gap, but they do not account for the entire gap. According to a 2006 review, these factors account for slightly less than half of one standard deviation.

Other research has focused on different causes of variation within low socioeconomic status (SES) and high SES groups.
In the US, among low SES groups, genetic differences account for a smaller proportion of the variance in IQ than among high SES populations. Such effects are predicted by the &quot;bioecological&quot; hypothesis—that genotypes are transformed into phenotypes through nonadditive synergistic effects of the environment. suggest that high SES individuals are more likely to be able to develop their full biological potential, whereas low SES individuals are likely to be hindered in their development by adverse environmental conditions. The same review also points out that adoption studies generally are biased towards including only high and high middle SES adoptive families, meaning that they will tend to overestimate average genetic effects. They also note that studies of adoption from lower-class homes to middle-class homes have shown that such children experience a 12 to 18 point gain in IQ relative to children who remain in low SES homes. A 2015 study found that environmental factors (namely, family income, maternal education, maternal verbal ability/knowledge, learning materials in the home, parenting factors, child birth order, and child birth weight) accounted for the black–white gap in cognitive ability test scores.

===Test bias===
A number of studies have reached the conclusion that IQ tests may be biased against certain groups. The validity and reliability of IQ scores obtained from outside the United States and Europe have been questioned, in part because of the inherent difficulty of comparing IQ scores between cultures. Several researchers have argued that cultural differences limit the appropriateness of standard IQ tests in non-industrialized communities.

A 1996 report by the American Psychological Association states that intelligence can be difficult to compare across cultures, and notes that differing familiarity with test materials can produce substantial differences in test results; it also says that tests are accurate predictors of future achievement for black and white Americans, and are in that sense unbiased. The view that tests accurately predict future educational attainment is reinforced by Nicholas Mackintosh in his 1998 book &quot;IQ and Human Intelligence&quot;, and by a 1999 literature review by .

James R. Flynn, surveying studies on the topic, notes that the weight and presence of many test questions depends on what sorts of information and modes of thinking are culturally valued.

===Stereotype threat and minority status===

Stereotype threat is the fear that one&#x27;s behavior will confirm an existing stereotype of a group with which one identifies or by which one is defined; this fear may in turn lead to an impairment of performance. Testing situations that highlight the fact that intelligence is being measured tend to lower the scores of individuals from racial-ethnic groups who already score lower on average or are expected to score lower. Stereotype threat conditions cause larger than expected IQ differences among groups. Psychometrician Nicholas Mackintosh considers that there is little doubt that the effects of stereotype threat contribute to the IQ gap between black people and white people.

A large number of studies have shown that systemically disadvantaged minorities, such as the African American minority of the United States, generally perform worse in the educational system and in intelligence tests than the majority groups or less disadvantaged minorities such as immigrant or &quot;voluntary&quot; minorities. The explanation of these findings may be that children of caste-like minorities, due to the systemic limitations of their prospects of social advancement, do not have &quot;effort optimism&quot;, i.e. they do not have the confidence that acquiring the skills valued by majority society, such as those skills measured by IQ tests, is worthwhile. They may even deliberately reject certain behaviors that are seen as &quot;acting white.&quot; Research published in 1997 indicates that part of the black–white gap in cognitive ability test scores is due to racial differences in test motivation.

Some researchers have suggested that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-life performance gaps, and have raised the possibility of publication bias. Other critics have focused on correcting what they claim are misconceptions of early studies showing a large effect. However, numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat, though the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization. For instance, one meta-analysis found that with female subjects &quot;subtle threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and moderately explicit cues&quot; while with minorities &quot;moderately explicit stereotype threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and subtle cues&quot;.

Some researchers have argued that studies of stereotype threat may in fact systematically under-represent its effects, since such studies measure &quot;only that portion of psychological threat that research has identified and remedied. To the extent that unidentified or unremedied psychological threats further undermine performance, the results underestimate the bias.&quot;

==Research into possible genetic factors==

Although IQ differences between individuals have been shown to have a large hereditary component, it does not follow that mean group-level disparities (between-group differences) in IQ necessarily have a genetic basis. The scientific consensus is that there is no evidence for a genetic component behind IQ differences between racial groups. Growing evidence indicates that environmental factors, not genetic ones, explain the racial IQ gap.

===Genetics of race and intelligence===

Geneticist Alan R. Templeton argued that the question about the possible genetic effects on the test score gap is muddled by the general focus on &quot;race&quot; rather than on populations defined by gene frequency or by geographical proximity, and by the general insistence on phrasing the question in terms of heritability. Templeton pointed out that racial groups neither represent sub-species nor distinct evolutionary lineages, and that therefore there is no basis for making claims about the general intelligence of races. He argued that, for these reasons, the search for possible genetic influences on the black–white test score gap is &quot;a priori&quot; flawed, because there is no genetic material shared by all Africans or by all Europeans. , on the other hand, argued that by using genetic cluster analysis to correlate gene frequencies with continental populations it might be possible to show that African populations have a higher frequency of certain genetic variants that contribute to differences in average intelligence. Such a hypothetical situation could hold without all Africans carrying the same genes or belonging to a single evolutionary lineage. According to Mackintosh, a biological basis for the observed gap in IQ test performance thus cannot be ruled out on &quot;a priori&quot; grounds.

 noted that &quot;no genes related to difference in cognitive skills have across the various racial and ethnic groups have ever been discovered. The argument for genetic differences has been carried forward largely by circumstantial evidence. Of course, tomorrow afternoon genetic mechanisms producing racial and ethnic differences in intelligence might be discovered, but there have been a lot of investigations, and tomorrow has not come for quite some time now.&quot; concurred, noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been negligible. A 2012 review by concluded that the entire IQ gap can be explained by known environmental factors, and Mackintosh found this view to be plausible.

More recent research attempting to identify genetic loci associated with individual-level differences in IQ has yielded promising results, which led the editorial board of &quot;Nature&quot; to issue a statement differentiating this research from the &quot;racist&quot; pseudoscience which it acknowledged has dogged intelligence research since its inception. It characterized the idea of genetically determined differences in intelligence between races as definitively false. Analysis of polygenic scores sampled from the 1000 Genomes Project has likewise found no evidence that intelligence was under diversifying selection in Africans and Europeans, suggesting that genetic differences make up a negligible component of the observed Black-White gap in IQ.

===Heritability within and between groups===
Twin studies of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies have been criticized for being based on questionable assumptions. When used in the context of human behavior genetics, the term &quot;heritability&quot; can be misleading, as it does not necessarily convey information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined. Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.

Psychometricians have found that intelligence is substantially heritable within populations, with 30–50% of variance in IQ scores in early childhood being attributable to genetic factors in analyzed US populations, increasing to 75–80% by late adolescence. In biology heritability is defined as the ratio of variation attributable to genetic differences in an observable trait to the trait&#x27;s total observable variation. The heritability of a trait describes the proportion of variation in the trait that is attributable to genetic factors within a particular population. A heritability of 1 indicates that variation correlates fully with genetic variation and a heritability of 0 indicates that there is no correlation between the trait and genes at all. In psychological testing, heritability tends to be understood as the degree of correlation between the results of a test taker and those of their biological parents. However, since high heritability is simply a correlation between child and parents, it does not describe the causes of heritability which in humans can be either genetic or environmental.

Therefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable. In addition, environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability, and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genetic and environmental factors. High heritability does not imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined; rather, it can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).

The figure to the right demonstrates how heritability works. In each of the two gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable, as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition. But the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental, as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence, the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.

=== Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis ===

Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis states that the magnitude of the black–white difference in tests of cognitive ability depends entirely or mainly on the extent to which a test measures general mental ability, or &quot;g&quot;. The hypothesis was first formalized by Arthur Jensen, who devised the statistical &quot;method of correlated vectors&quot; to test it. If Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis holds true, then the cognitive tasks that have the highest &quot;g&quot;-load are the tasks in which the gap between black and white test takers are greatest. Jensen and Rushton took this to show that the cause of &quot;g&quot; and the cause of the gap are the same—in their view, genetic differences.

 acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton showed a modest correlation between &quot;g&quot;-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but does not agree that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. Mackintosh argues that it is exactly those tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest &quot;g&quot;-loading and heritability, such as the Wechsler test, that have seen the greatest increases in black performance due to the Flynn effect. This likely suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes, which undermines Jensen&#x27;s argument that the black–white gap is most likely caused by genetic factors. make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of black test takers necessarily indicates an increase in &quot;g&quot;.

James Flynn argued that his findings undermine Spearman&#x27;s hypothesis. In a 2006 study, he and William Dickens found that between 1972 and 2002 &quot;The standard measure of the &quot;g&quot; gap between Blacks and Whites declined virtually in tandem with the IQ gap.&quot; Flynn also criticized Jensen&#x27;s basic assumption that a correlation between &quot;g&quot;-loading and test score gap implies a genetic cause for the gap. In a 2014 suite of meta-analyses, along with co-authors Jan te Nijenhuis and Daniel Metzen, he showed that the same negative correlation between IQ gains and &quot;g&quot;-loading obtains for cognitive deficits of known environmental cause: iodine deficiency, prenatal cocaine exposure, fetal alcohol syndrome, and traumatic brain injury.
===Adoption studies===
A number of IQ studies have been done on the effect of similar rearing conditions on children from different races. The hypothesis is that this can be determined by investigating whether black children adopted into white families demonstrated gains in IQ test scores relative to black children reared in black families. Depending on whether their test scores are more similar to their biological or adoptive families, that could be interpreted as supporting either a genetic or an environmental hypothesis. Critiques of such studies question whether the environment of black children—even when raised in white families—is truly comparable to the environment of white children. Several reviews of the adoption study literature have suggested that it is probably impossible to avoid confounding biological and environmental factors in this type of study. Another criticism by is that adoption studies on the whole tend to be carried out in a restricted set of environments, mostly in the medium-high SES range, where heritability is higher than in the low-SES range.

The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study (1976) examined the IQ test scores of 122 adopted children and 143 nonadopted children reared by advantaged white families. The children were restudied ten years later. The study found higher IQ for white people compared to black people, both at age 7 and age 17. Acknowledging the existence of confounding factors, Scarr and Weinberg, the authors of the original study, did not consider that it provided support for either the hereditarian or environmentalist view.

Three other studies lend support to environmental explanations of group IQ differences: 
* studied the out-of-wedlock children of black and white soldiers stationed in Germany after World War II who were then raised by white German mothers in what has become known as the Eyferth study. He found no significant differences in average IQ between groups. 
* studied black (West Indian), white, and mixed-race children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. Two out of three tests found no significant differences. One test found higher scores for non-white people.
* compared black and mixed-race children adopted by either black or white middle-class families in the United States. Moore observed that 23 black and interracial children raised by white parents had a significantly higher mean score than 23 age-matched children raised by black parents (117 vs 104), and argued that differences in early socialization explained these differences.

Frydman and Lynn (1989) showed a mean IQ of 119 for Korean infants adopted by Belgian families. After correcting for the Flynn effect, the IQ of the adopted Korean children was still 10 points higher than that of the Belgian children.

Reviewing the evidence from adoption studies, Mackintosh finds that environmental and genetic variables remain confounded and considers evidence from adoption studies inconclusive, and fully compatible with a 100% environmental explanation. Similarly, Drew Thomas argues that race differences in IQ that appear in adoption studies are in fact an artifact of methodology, and that East Asian IQ advantages and black IQ disadvantages disappear when this is controlled for.

===Racial admixture studies===
Most people have ancestry from different geographical regions. In particular, African Americans typically have ancestors from both Africa and Europe, with, on average, 20% of their genome inherited from European ancestors. If racial IQ gaps have a partially genetic basis, one might expect black people with a higher degree of European ancestry to score higher on IQ tests than black people with less European ancestry, because the genes inherited from European ancestors would likely include some genes with a positive effect on IQ. Geneticist Alan Templeton has argued that an experiment based on the Mendelian &quot;common garden&quot; design, where specimens with different hybrid compositions are subjected to the same environmental influences, are the only way to definitively show a causal relation between genes and group differences in IQ. Summarizing the findings of admixture studies, he concludes that they have shown no significant correlation between any cognitive ability and the degree of African or European ancestry.

Studies have employed different ways of measuring or approximating relative degrees of ancestry from Africa and Europe. Some studies have used skin color as a measure, and others have used blood groups. surveys the literature and argues that the blood groups studies may be seen as providing some support to the genetic hypothesis, even though the correlation between ancestry and IQ was quite low. He finds that studies by , Willerman, Naylor &amp; Myrianthopoulos (1970) did not find a correlation between degree of African/European ancestry and IQ. The latter study did find a difference based on the race of the mother, with children of white mothers with black fathers scoring higher than children of black mothers and white fathers. Loehlin considers that such a finding is compatible with either a genetic or an environmental cause. All in all Loehlin finds admixture studies inconclusive and recommends more research.

Reviewing the evidence from admixture studies considers it to be inconclusive because of too many uncontrolled variables. quotes a statement by to the effect that admixture studies have not provided a shred of evidence in favor of a genetic basis for the IQ gap.

===Mental chronometry===

Mental chronometry measures the elapsed time between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the subsequent behavioral response by the participant. These studies have shown inconsistent results when comparing black and white populations groups, with some studies showing whites outperforming blacks, and others showing blacks outperforming whites. 

Arthur Jensen argued that this reaction time (RT) is a measure of the speed and efficiency with which the brain processes information, and that scores on most types of RT tasks tend to correlate with scores on standard IQ tests as well as with &quot;g&quot;. Nisbett argues that some studies have found correlations closer to 0.2, and that a correlation is not always found. Nisbett points to the study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in and suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for black people than for white people. considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and comments that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/dishabituation test. He further comments that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.

===Brain size===

A number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group. Some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between racial groups, although this is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ as brain size also differs between men and women, but without significant differences in IQ. At the same time newborn black children have the same average brain size as white children, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in environment. Several environmental factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect black children.

===Archaeological data===
Archaeological evidence does not support claims by Rushton and others that black people&#x27;s cognitive ability was inferior to white people&#x27;s during prehistoric times.

==Policy relevance and ethics==

The ethics of research on race and intelligence has long been a subject of debate: in a 1996 report of the American Psychological Association; in guidelines proposed by Gray and Thompson and by Hunt and Carlson; and in two editorials in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2009 by Steven Rose and by Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams.

Steven Rose maintains that the history of eugenics makes this field of research difficult to reconcile with current ethical standards for science.
On the other hand, James R. Flynn has argued that had there been a ban on research on possibly poorly conceived ideas, much valuable research on intelligence testing (including his own discovery of the Flynn effect) would not have occurred.

Many have argued for increased interventions in order to close the gaps. Flynn writes that &quot;America will have to address all the aspects of black experience that are disadvantageous, beginning with the regeneration of inner city neighborhoods and their schools.&quot; Especially in developing nations, society has been urged to take on the prevention of cognitive impairment in children as a high priority. Possible preventable causes include malnutrition, infectious diseases such as meningitis, parasites, cerebral malaria, in utero drug and alcohol exposure, newborn asphyxia, low birth weight, head injuries, lead poisoning and endocrine disorders.

<text>Retirement is the withdrawal from one&#x27;s position or occupation or from one&#x27;s active working life. A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours or workload.

Many people choose to retire when they are elderly or incapable of doing their job for health reasons. People may also retire when they are eligible for private or public pension benefits, although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their positions. In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Previously, low life expectancy, lack of social security and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until their death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889.

Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in old age, funded by employers or the state. In many poorer countries, there is no support for the elderly beyond that provided through the family. Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies; hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. In many Western countries, this is a right embodied in national constitutions.

An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of pre-tirement.

==History==

Retirement, or the practice of leaving one&#x27;s job or ceasing to work after reaching a certain age, has been around since around the 18th century. Prior to the 18th century, humans had an average life expectancy between 26 and 40 years.
In consequence, only a small percentage of the population reached an age where physical impairments began to be obstacles to working. Countries began to adopt government policies on retirement during the late 19th century and the 20th century, beginning in Germany under Otto von Bismarck.

==In specific countries==

A person may retire at whatever age they please. However, a country&#x27;s tax laws or state old-age pension rules usually mean that in a given country a certain age is thought of as the standard retirement age. As life expectancy increases and more and more people live to an advanced age, in many countries the age at which a pension is awarded has been increased in the 21st century, often progressively.

The standard retirement age varies from country to country but it is generally between 50 and 70 (according to latest statistics, 2011). In some countries this age is different for men and women, although this has recently been challenged in some countries (e.g., Austria), and in some countries the ages are being brought into line. The table below shows the variation in eligibility ages for public old-age benefits in the United States and many European countries, according to the OECD.

&quot;The retirement age in many countries is increasing, often starting in the 2010s and continuing until the late 2020s.&quot;

Notes: Parentheses indicate eligibility age for women when different. Sources: Cols. 1–2: OECD Pensions at a Glance (2005), Cols. 3–6: Tabulations from HRS, ELSA and SHARE. Square brackets indicate early retirement for some public employees.

1 In Denmark, early retirement is called &quot;efterløn&quot; and there are some requirements to be met such as contributing to the labor market for at least 20 years. Early and normal retirement ages vary according to the date of birth of the person filing for retirement.

2 In France, the retirement age was 60, with full pension entitlement at 65; in 2010 this was extended to 62 and 67 respectively, increasing progressively over the following eight years.

3 In Latvia, the retirement age depends on the date of birth of the person filing for retirement.

4 In Spain it was ruled that the retirement age was to increase from 65 to 67 progressively from 2013 to 2027.

5 In the United States, while the normal retirement age for Social Security, or Old Age Survivors Insurance (OASI) was age 65 to receive unreduced benefits, it is gradually increasing to age 67 by 2027. Public servants are often not covered by Social Security but have their own pension programs. Police officers in the United States may typically retire at half pay after 20 years of service, or three-quarter pay after 30 years, allowing retirement from the early forties. Military members of the US Armed Forces may elect to retire after 20 years of active duty. (See also: military retirement pay and military pension.)

Iranian age of retirement was increased much in 2022 and 2023 to 42 years of work insurance payment record to avoid government social security bankruptcy.

==Data sets==
Recent advances in data collection have vastly improved the ability to understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains a wealth of information on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) and a host of other topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).

2002 and 2004 saw the introductions of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which includes respondents from 14 continental European countries plus Israel. These surveys were closely modeled after the HRS in the sample frame, design and content. A number of other countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea) also now field HRS-like surveys, and others (e.g., China, India) are currently fielding pilot studies. These data sets have expanded the ability of researchers to examine questions about retirement behavior by adding a cross-national perspective.

==Factors affecting retirement decisions==

Many factors affect people&#x27;s retirement decisions. Retirement funding education is a big factor that affects the success of an individual&#x27;s retirement experience. Social Security plays an important role because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security&#x27;s trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual&#x27;s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people are much more likely to retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age &quot;a&quot; is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age &quot;a&quot;+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).

Greater wealth tends to lead to earlier retirement since wealthier individuals can essentially &quot;purchase&quot; additional leisure. Generally, the effect of wealth on retirement is difficult to estimate empirically since observing greater wealth at older ages may be the result of increased saving over the working life in anticipation of earlier retirement. However, many economists have found creative ways to estimate wealth effects on retirement and typically find that they are small. For example, one paper exploits the receipt of an inheritance to measure the effect of wealth shocks on retirement using data from the HRS. The authors find that receiving an inheritance increases the probability of retiring earlier than expected by 4.4 percentage points, or 12 percent relative to the baseline retirement rate, over an eight-year period.

A great deal of attention has surrounded how the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and subsequent Great Recession are affecting retirement decisions, with the conventional wisdom saying that fewer people will retire since their savings have been depleted; however recent research suggests that the opposite may happen. Using data from the HRS, researchers examined trends in defined benefit (DB) vs. defined contribution (DC) pension plans and found that those nearing retirement had only limited exposure to the recent stock market decline and thus are not likely to substantially delay their retirement. At the same time, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), another study estimates that mass layoffs are likely to lead to an increase in retirement almost 50% larger than the decrease brought about by the stock market crash, so that on net retirements are likely to increase in response to the crisis.

More information tells of how many who retire will continue to work, but not in the career they have had for the majority of their life. Job openings will increase in the next 5 years due to retirements of the baby boomer generation. The Over 50 population is actually the fastest growing labor groups in the US.

A great deal of research has examined the effects of health status and health shocks on retirement. It is widely found that individuals in poor health generally retire earlier than those in better health. This does not necessarily imply that poor health status leads people to retire earlier, since in surveys retirees may be more likely to exaggerate their poor health status to justify their earlier decision to retire. This justification bias, however, is likely to be small. In general, declining health over time, as well as the onset of new health conditions, have been found to be positively related to earlier retirement. Health conditions that can cause someone to retire include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, joint diseases, and hyperlipidemia.

Most people are married when they reach retirement age; thus, spouse&#x27;s employment status may affect one&#x27;s decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, men are more likely to retire if their wives are also retired than if they are still in the labor force, and vice versa.

=== EU member states ===
Researchers analyzed factors affecting retirement decisions in EU member states:
* Alba-Ramirez (1997) uses micro data from the Active Population Survey of Spain and logit model for analyzing determinants of retirement decision and finds that having more members in the household, and as well as children, has a negative effect on the probability of retirement among older males. This is an intuitive result as males in bigger household with children have to earn more and pension benefits will be less than needed for household.
* Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) using German Socio-Economic Panel and hazard model find that Socio-demographic factors such as health and gender have a strong impact on the retirement decision: women tend to retire earlier than men, and poor health makes people go into retirement, particularly in the case of disability retirement. The relationship between health status and retirement is significant for both self-assessed and objective indicators of health status. This is similar finding to the previous research of Blau and Riphahn (1997); using individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel as well, but controlling for different variables they found that if individual has chronic health condition, then he tends to retire. Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) use better measure for health status than Blau and Riphahn (1997), because self-assessed and objective indicators of health status are better measures than chronic health condition.
* Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find significant effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think that this can be because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.
* Murray et al. (2016, 2019) have shown that in the United Kingdom local labour markets of where workers live effects later life work exit. In the first study, older workers aged 50 to 75 were more likely to exit the workforce over 10 years (years 2011–2011) if they had lived in a more deprived local authority in 2001. For respondents that identified as sick/disabled in 2011, effects of local area unemployment in 2001 were stronger for respondents who had better self-rated health in 2001. The second study used the 1946 Birth Cohort to show that it&#x27;s not just area unemployment near retirement age that matters for the ages workers retire: higher area unemployment at age 26 was associated with poorer health and lower likelihood of employment at aged 53; and these two individual pathways were identified as the key mediators between area unemployment and retirement age.
* Rashad Mehbaliyev (2011) analyzed how different factors related with health, demographics, behavior, financial status, and macroeconomics can affect retirement status in European Union countries for data collected from the SHARE Wave 2 dataset (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and UN sources. He found that males are less likely to be retired compared with females in New Member States, which is the opposite result than he found for Old Member States. He explained that: &quot;The reasons for these results can be the facts that significant gender wage gap exists in New Member States, household sizes are bigger in these countries than in Old Member States and males play important role in household income which make them retire less than females.&quot;

=== United States ===

* Quinn et al. (1998) find significant correlation between health status and retirement status. They transform answers for question about health status from five levels (&quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;very good&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;) into three levels and report results for three groups of people. 85% of respondents who answered &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; to the question about their health in 1992 were still working two years after this interview, compared to 82% of those who answered &quot;good&quot;, and 70% of those answered &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;. This fact is also true for year 1996: 73% of people from the first group were still on the job market, while this is 66% and 55% for other groups of people. However, Dhaval, Rashad and Spasojevic (2006) using data from six waves of Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) show that relationship between retirement and health status can imply the opposite effect in reality: physical and mental health decline after retirement.
* Benitez-Silva (2000) analyzes determinants of labor force status and retirement process among elderly US citizens and possibility of decision returning to work using logit and probit models. He uses Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) for this purpose and finds that physical and mental health has significant effect on becoming employed. Male respondents are more likely to change their status from being not-employed to employed, but being insured has a negative effect on switching job status from “not-employed&quot; to &quot;employed&quot; for people aged 60–62 and insignificant effect for 55–59 and aged over 63.

==Saving for retirement==

Overall, income after retirement can come from state pensions, occupational pensions, private savings and investments (private pension funds, owned housing), donations (e.g., by children), and social benefits. In some countries an additional lump sum is granted, according to the years of work and the average pay; this is usually provided by the employer. On a personal level, the rising cost of living during retirement is a serious concern to many older adults. Health care costs play an important role.

Provision of state pensions is a significant drain on a government&#x27;s budget. As life expectancy increases and the health of older people improves with medical advances, the age of entitlement to a pension has been increasing progressively since about 2010.

Older people are more prone to sickness, and the cost of health care in retirement is large. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for Medicare health cover at 65 years of age.

===Calculators===

A useful and straightforward calculation can be done if it is assumed that interest, after expenses, taxes, and inflation is zero. Assume that in real (after-inflation) terms, one&#x27;s salary never changes over &quot;w&quot; years of working life. During &quot;p&quot; years of pension, one has a living standard that costs a replacement ratio &quot;R&quot; times as much as one&#x27;s living standard in working life. The working life living standard is one&#x27;s salary minus the proportion of salary Z that should be saved. Calculations are per unit salary (e.g., assume salary = 1).

Then after &quot;w&quot; years work, retirement age accumulated savings = &quot;wZ&quot;. To pay for pension for &quot;p&quot; years, necessary savings at retirement = &quot;Rp(1-Z)&quot;

Equate these: &quot;wZ&quot; = &quot;Rp&quot;(&quot;1-Z&quot;) and solve to give &quot;Z&quot; = &quot;Rp&quot; / (&quot;w + Rp&quot;). For example, if &quot;w&quot; = 35, &quot;p&quot; = 30 and &quot;R&quot; = 0.65, a proportion &quot;Z&quot; = 35.78% should be saved.

Retirement calculators generally accumulate a proportion of salary up to retirement age. This shows a straightforward case, which nonetheless could be practically useful for optimistic people hoping to work for only as long as they are likely to be retired.

For more complicated situations, there are several online retirement calculators on the Internet. Many retirement calculators project how much an investor needs to save, and for how long, to provide a certain level of retirement expenditures. Some retirement calculators, appropriate for safe investments, assume a constant, unvarying rate of return. Monte Carlo retirement calculators take volatility into account and project the probability that a particular plan of retirement savings, investments, and expenditures will outlast the retiree. Retirement calculators vary in the extent to which they take taxes, social security, pensions, and other sources of retirement income and expenditures into account.

The assumptions keyed into a retirement calculator are critical. One of the most important assumptions is the assumed rate of real (after inflation) investment return. A conservative return estimate could be based on the real yield of Inflation-indexed bonds offered by some governments, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The TIP$TER retirement calculator projects the retirement expenditures that a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds, coupled with other income sources like Social Security, would be able to sustain. Current real yields on United States Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are available at the US Treasury site. Current real yields on Canadian &#x27;Real Return Bonds&#x27; are available at the Bank of Canada&#x27;s site. As of December 2011, US Treasury inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) were yielding about 0.8% real per annum for the 30-year maturity and a noteworthy slightly negative real return for the 7-year maturity.
Many individuals use &quot;retirement calculators&quot; on the Internet to determine the proportion of their pay they should be saving in a tax advantaged-plan (e.g., IRA or 401-K in the US, RRSP in Canada, personal pension in the UK, superannuation in Australia).
After expenses and any taxes, a reasonable (though arguably pessimistic) long-term assumption for a safe real rate of return is zero. So in real terms, interest does not help the savings grow. Each year of work must pay its share of a year of retirement. For someone planning to work for 40 years and be retired for 20 years, each year of work pays for itself and for half a year of retirement. Hence, 33.33% of pay must be saved, and 66.67% can be spent when earned. After 40 years of saving 33.33% of pay, we have accumulated assets of 13.33 years of pay, as in the graph. In the graph to the right, the lines are straight, which is appropriate given the assumption of a zero real investment return.

The graph above can be compared with those generated by many retirement calculators. However, most retirement calculators use nominal (not &quot;real&quot; dollars) and therefore require a projection of both the expected inflation rate and the expected nominal rate of return. One way to work around this limitation is to, for example, enter &quot;0% return, 0% inflation&quot; inputs into the calculator. The Bloomberg retirement calculator gives the flexibility to specify, for example, zero inflation and zero investment return and to reproduce the graph above. The MSN retirement calculator in 2011 has as the defaults a realistic 3% per annum inflation rate and optimistic 8% return assumptions; consistency with the December 2011 US nominal bond and inflation-protected bond market rates requires a change to about 3% inflation and 4% investment return before and after retirement.

Ignoring tax, someone wishing to work for a year and then relax for a year on the same living standard needs to save 50% of pay. Similarly, someone wishing to work from age 25 to 55 and be retired for 30 years till 85 needs to save 50% of pay if government and employment pensions are not a factor and if it is considered appropriate to assume a zero real investment return. The problem that the lifespan is not known in advance can be reduced in some countries by the purchase at retirement of an inflation-indexed life annuity.

===Size of lump sum required===

To pay for pension, assumed for simplicity to be received at the end of each year, and taking discounted values in the manner of a net present value calculation, the ideal lump sum available at retirement should be:

:(1 – zprop ) R repl S {(1+ ireal ) −1+(1+ ireal ) −2 +... ...+ (1+ ireal ) −p} = (1-zprop ) R repl S {(1 – (1+ireal)−p )/ireal}

Above is the standard mathematical formula for the sum of a geometric series. (Or if ireal =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year and that it is desired to replace Rrepl=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using ireal=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation&#x27;s currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being &#x27;13.43 years of retirement age salary&#x27;. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for a homeowner the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.

===Size of lump sum saved===

At retirement, the following amount will have been accumulated:

:zprop S {(1+ i rel to pay )w-1+(1+ i rel to pay )w-2 +... ...+ (1+ i rel to pay )+ 1 }

: = zprop S ((1+i rel to pay)w- 1)/i rel to pay

===Equate and derive necessary saving proportion===

To make the accumulation match with the lump sum needed to pay pension:

:zprop S (((1+i rel to pay )) w – 1)/i rel to pay = (1-zprop ) R repl S (1 – ((1+i real)) −p )/i real 

Bring zprop to the left hand side to give the answer, under this rough and unguaranteed method, for the proportion of pay that should be saved:

:zprop = R repl (1 – ((1+i real )) −p )/i real / [(((1+i rel to pay )) w – 1)/i rel to pay + R repl (1 – ((1+i real )) −p )/i real ] (Ret-03)

Note that the special case i rel to pay =0 = i real means that the geometric series should be summed by noting that there are p or w identical terms and hence z prop = p/(w+p). This corresponds to the graph above with the straight line real-terms accumulation.

===Sample results===
The result for the necessary zprop given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions made. As an example, one might assume that price inflation will be 3.5% per year forever and that one&#x27;s pay will increase only at that same rate of 3.5%. If a 4.5% per year nominal rate of interest is assumed, then (using 1.045/1.035 in real terms) pre-retirement and post-retirement net interest rates will remain the same, irel to pay = 0.966 percent per year and ireal = 0.966 percent per year. These assumptions may be reasonable in view of the market returns available on inflation-indexed bonds, after expenses and any tax. Equation (Ret-03) is readily coded in Excel and with these assumptions gives the required savings rates in the accompanying picture.

===Monte Carlo: Better allowance for randomness===
Finally, a newer method for determining the adequacy of a retirement plan is Monte Carlo simulation. This method has been gaining popularity and is now employed by many financial planners. Monte Carlo retirement calculators allow users to enter savings, income and expense information and run simulations of retirement scenarios. The simulation results show the probability that the retirement plan will be successful.

==Early retirement==

Retirement is generally considered to be &quot;early&quot; if it occurs before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Early retirees typically rely on their own savings and investments to be self-supporting, either indefinitely or until they begin receiving external support. Early retirement can also be used as a euphemistic term for being terminated from employment before typical retirement age.

===Savings needed===
While conventional wisdom has it that one can retire and take 7% or more out of a portfolio year after year, this strategy would not have worked very often in the past.

Those contemplating early retirement will want to know if they have enough to survive possible bear markets. The history of the US stock market shows that one would need to live on about 4% of the initial portfolio per year to ensure that the portfolio is not depleted before the end of the retirement; this rule of thumb is a summary of one conclusion of the Trinity study, though the report is more nuanced and the conclusions and very approach have been heavily criticized (see Trinity study for details). This allows for increasing the withdrawals with inflation to maintain a consistent spending ability throughout the retirement, and to continue making withdrawals even in dramatic and prolonged bear markets. (The 4% figure does not assume any pension or change in spending levels throughout the retirement.)

When retiring prior to age , there is a 10% IRS penalty on withdrawals from a retirement plan such as a 401(k) plan or a Traditional IRA. Exceptions apply under certain circumstances. At age 59 and six months, the penalty-free status is achieved and the 10% IRS penalty no longer applies.

To avoid the 10% penalty prior to age , a person should consult a lawyer about the use of IRS rule 72 T. This rule must be applied for with the IRS. It allows the distribution of an IRA account prior to age in equal amounts of a period of either 5 years or until the age of , whichever is the longest time period, without a 10% penalty. Taxes still must be paid on the distributions.

===Calculations using actual numbers===
Although the 4% initial portfolio withdrawal rate described above can be used as a rough gauge, it is often desirable to use a retirement planning tool that accepts detailed input and can render a result that has more precision. Some of these tools model only the retirement phase of the plan while others can model both the savings or accumulation phase as well as the retirement phase of the plan. For example, an analysis by &quot;Forbes&quot; reckoned that in 90% of historical markets, a 4% rate would have lasted for at least 30 years, while in 50% of the historical markets, a 4% rate would have been sustained for more than 40 years.

The effects of making inflation-adjusted withdrawals from a given starting portfolio can be modeled with a downloadable spreadsheet that uses historical stock market data to estimate likely portfolio returns. Another approach is to employ a retirement calculator that also uses historical stock market modeling, but adds provisions for incorporating pensions, other retirement income, and changes in spending that may occur during the course of the retirement.

==Life after retirement==

Retirement might coincide with important life changes; a retired worker might move to a new location, for example a retirement community (Kamal et. al, 2024), thereby having less frequent contact with their previous social context and adopting a new lifestyle. Often retirees volunteer for charities and other community organizations. Tourism is a common marker of retirement and for some becomes a way of life, such as for so-called grey nomads. Some retired people even choose to go and live in warmer climates in what is known as retirement migration.

It has been found that Americans have six lifestyle choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual&#x27;s work force participation decision.

Often retirees are called upon to care for grandchildren and occasionally aged parents. For many it gives them more time to devote to a hobby or sport such as golf or sailing.

On the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression as a result of their new situation. The newly retired are one of the most vulnerable social groups to become depressed most likely due to retirement coinciding with a deteriorating health status and increased care-giving responsibilities. Retirement coincides with deterioration of one&#x27;s health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression. Research around what retirees would ideally like to have a fulfilling life after retiring, found the most important factors were &quot;physical comfort, social integration, contribution, security, autonomy and enjoyment&quot;.

Many people in the later years of their lives, due to failing health, require assistance, sometimes in extremely expensive treatments – in some countries – being provided in a nursing home. Those who need care, but are not in need of constant assistance, may choose to live in a retirement home.

<doc id="26501" wikidata="Q132516" url="?curid=26501" title="Boeing RC-135">
<text>The Boeing RC-135 is a family of large reconnaissance aircraft built by Boeing and modified by a number of companies, including General Dynamics, Lockheed, LTV, E-Systems, L3Harris Technologies, and used by the United States Air Force and Royal Air Force to support theater and national level intelligence consumers with near real-time on-scene collection, analysis and dissemination capabilities.

Based on the C-135 Stratolifter airframe, various types of RC-135s have been in service since 1961. Unlike the C-135 and KC-135 which are recognized by Boeing as the Model 717, most of the current RC-135 fleet, with the exception of the RAF&#x27;s RC-135Ws, is internally designated as the Model 739 by the company. Many variants have been modified numerous times, resulting in a large variety of designations, configurations, and program names.

==Design and development==
In 1962, the first RC-135 variant, the RC-135A, was ordered by the United States Air Force to replace the Boeing RB-50 Superfortress. Originally nine were ordered but this was later reduced to four. Boeing allocated the variant the designation &quot;Boeing 739-700&quot; but they were a modified variant of the KC-135A then in production. They used the same Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet engines as the tanker and carried cameras in a bay just aft of the nose wheel well where the forward fuel tank was normally located. They had no in-flight refueling system and they were used for photographic and surveying tasks. Although the RC-135A was the first designation in the RC-135 family, it was not the first RC-135 in service. That distinction belongs to the RC-135S, which began operational reconnaissance missions in 1961, followed by the RC-135D in 1962.

The next variant ordered was the RC-135B, to be used as an electronic intelligence aircraft to replace the Boeing RB-47H Stratojet, a SIGINT platform. Unlike the earlier variants, the RC-135Bs had Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 turbofans rather than the older J57s. These ten aircraft were delivered directly to Martin Aircraft beginning in 1965 for installation of their operational electronics suite. By 1967, they emerged as RC-135Cs and all entered service that year. The refueling boom was not fitted and the boom operator station was used as a camera bay for a KA-59 camera. Externally, the aircraft were distinguished by the large cheek antenna fairings on the forward fuselage.

The RC-135Bs were the last of the new aircraft built. All further reconnaissance variants that followed were modified aircraft, either from earlier RC-135 variants or from tankers and transports.

In 2005, the RC-135 fleet completed a series of significant airframe, navigation and powerplant upgrades, which include re-engining from the TF33 to the CFM International CFM-56 (F108) engines used on the KC-135R and T Stratotanker, and an upgrade of the flight deck instrumentation and navigation systems to the Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) standard. The AMP standard includes conversion from analog readouts to a digital glass cockpit configuration.

==Operational history==
The current RC-135 fleet is the latest iteration of modifications to this pool of aircraft dating back to the early 1960s. Initially employed by Strategic Air Command for reconnaissance, the RC-135 fleet has participated in every armed conflict involving U.S. forces during its tenure. RC-135s supported operations in Vietnam War, the Mediterranean for Operation El Dorado Canyon, Grenada for Operation Urgent Fury, Panama for Operation Just Cause, the Balkans for Operations Deliberate Force and Allied Force, and Southwest Asia for Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. RC-135s have maintained a constant presence in Southwest Asia since the early 1990s. They were stalwarts of Cold War operations, with missions flown around the periphery of the USSR and its client states in Europe and around the world.

Originally, all RC-135s were operated by Strategic Air Command. Since 1992, they have been assigned to Air Combat Command. The RC-135 fleet is permanently based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska and operated by the 55th Wing, using forward operating locations worldwide.

On 9 August 2010, the Rivet Joint program recognized its 20th anniversary of continuous service in Central Command, dating back to the beginning of Desert Shield. This represents the longest unbroken presence of any aircraft in the Air Force inventory. During this time it has flown over 8,000 combat missions supporting air and ground forces of Operations Desert Storm, Desert Shield, Northern Watch, Southern Watch, Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.

In March 2010 the British Ministry of Defence announced that it reached an agreement with the US Government to purchase three RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft to replace the Nimrod R1, which was retired in June 2011. The aircraft, to be styled as &#x27;Airseeker&#x27;, were scheduled to be delivered by 2017 at a total cost of around £650 million, including provision of ground infrastructure, training of personnel and ground supporting systems. In 2013, the UK government confirmed that crews from the RAF&#x27;s 51 Squadron had been training and operating alongside their USAF colleagues since 2011, having achieved in excess of 32,000 flying hours and 1,800 sorties as part of the 55th Wing at Offutt AFB.

The RAF received the first RC-135W in September 2013, which was deployed from July 2014 to support coalition action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant militants in Iraq. The second aircraft was delivered seven months ahead of schedule in September 2015, with over sixty improvements incorporated ranging from upgrades to the aircraft&#x27;s mission systems to engine improvements providing increased fuel efficiency and durability. In due course, the first Airseeker will receive the same upgrades. The aircraft will be air-to-air refuelled in service by USAF tankers based in Europe, as the UK does not operate boom-equipped refueling aircraft, and has no plans to adapt drogue-equipped aircraft.

U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force RC-135W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft were deployed numerous times to conduct reconnaissance missions around Poland and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad during the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. Stated objectives include broadcasting a clear signal that the US, and thus NATO, is aware of Russian movements in the area of operations.

==Variants==

===KC-135A Reconnaissance Platforms===
At least four KC-135A tankers were converted into makeshift reconnaissance platforms with no change of Mission Design Series (MDS) designation. KC-135As 55–3121, 55–3127, 59–1465, and 59-1514 were modified beginning in 1961. That year the Soviet Union announced its intention to detonate a 100 megaton thermonuclear device on Novaya Zemlya, the so-called Tsar Bomba. A testbed KC-135A (55–3127) was modified under the Big Safari program to the SPEED LIGHT BRAVO configuration in order to obtain intelligence information on the test. The success of the mission prompted conversion of additional aircraft for intelligence gathering duties.

===KC-135R Rivet Stand / Rivet Quick===

Not to be confused with the CFM F108-powered KC-135R tanker, the KC-135R MDS was applied in 1963 to the three KC-135A reconnaissance aircraft under the Rivet Stand program. The three aircraft were 55–3121, 59–1465, and 59–1514. A fourth, serial no. 58–0126, was converted in 1969 to replace 1465, which crashed in 1967. Externally the aircraft had varied configurations throughout their careers, but generally they were distinguished by five &quot;towel bar&quot; antennas along the spine of the upper fuselage and a radome below the forward fuselage.

The first three aircraft retained the standard tanker nose radome, while 58-0126 was fitted with the &#x27;hog nose&#x27; radome commonly associated with an RC-135. A trapeze-like structure in place of the refueling boom which was used to trail an aerodynamic shape housing a specialized receiver array, colloquially known as a &quot;blivet&quot;, on a wire was installed. This was reported to be used for &quot;Briar Patch&quot; and &quot;Combat Lion&quot; missions. There were four small optically flat windows on each side of the forward fuselage.

On some missions, a small wing-like structure housing sensors was fitted to each side of the forward fuselage, with a diagonal brace below it. With the loss of 59–1465, KC-135A 58-0126 was modified to this standard under the Rivet Quick operational name. All four aircraft were lost in accidents or converted to KC-135R tanker configurations. They are among the few KC-135 tankers equipped with an aerial refueling receptacle above the cockpit, a remnant of their service as intelligence gathering platforms.

===KC-135T Cobra Jaw===

In 1969, KC-135R 55-3121 was modified by Lockheed Air Services to the unique KC-135T configuration, under the Cobra Jaw program name. Externally distinguished by the &#x27;hog nose&#x27; radome, the aircraft featured spinning &quot;fang&quot; receiver antennas below the nose radome, a large blade antenna above the forward fuselage, a single &#x27;towel bar&#x27; antenna on the spine, teardrop antennas forward of the horizontal stabilizers on each side, and the trapeze-like structure in place of the refueling boom. The aircraft briefly carried nose art consisting of the Ford Cobra Jet cartoon cobra. It was later modified into an RC-135T Rivet Dandy.

===RC-135A===
Four RC-135As (63-8058 to 8061) were photo mapping platforms used briefly by the Air Photographic &amp; Charting Service, based at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia and later at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas as part of the 1370th Photographic Mapping Wing. The mission was soon assumed by satellites, and the RC-135As were de-modified and used in various other roles, such as staff transport and crew training.

In the early 1980s they were converted to tankers, with the designation KC-135D, of the same basic configuration as the KC-135A and later E, plus some remaining special mission equipment. Due to delays in reinstalling their original equipment, the RC-135As were the last of the entire C-135 series delivered to the USAF. The Boeing model number for the RC-135A is 739-700.

===RC-135B===
The as-delivered version of the RC-135. The RC-135B was never used operationally, as it had no mission equipment installed by Boeing. The entire RC-135B production run of ten aircraft was delivered directly to Martin Aircraft in Baltimore, Maryland for modification and installation of mission equipment under the Big Safari program. Upon completion, the RC-135Bs were re-designated RC-135C. The Boeing model number for the RC-135B is 739-445B.

===RC-135C Big Team===
Modified and re-designated RC-135B aircraft used for strategic reconnaissance duties, equipped with the AN/ASD-1 electronic intelligence (ELINT) system. This system was characterized by the large &#x27;cheek&#x27; pods on the forward fuselage containing the Automated ELINT Emitter Locating System (AEELS – not Side Looking Airborne Radar – SLAR, as often quoted), as well as numerous other antennae and a camera position in the refuelling pod area of the aft fuselage. The aircraft was crewed by two pilots, two navigators, numerous intelligence gathering specialists, inflight maintenance technicians and airborne linguists. When the RC-135C was fully deployed, SAC was able to retire its fleet of RB-47H Stratojets from active reconnaissance duties. All ten continue in active service as either RC-135V Rivet Joint or RC-135U Combat Sent platforms.

===RC-135D Office Boy / Rivet Brass===

The RC-135Ds, originally designated KC-135A-II, were the first reconnaissance configured C-135s given the &quot;R&quot; MDS prefix designation, although they were not the first reconnaissance-tasked members of the C-135 family. In 1962, they were delivered to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska as part of the Office Boy Project. Serial numbers were 60–0356, 60–0357, and 60–0362. In 1963, the aircraft began operational missions. These three aircraft were ordered as KC-135A tankers, but delivered without refueling booms, and known as &quot;falsie C-135As&quot; pending the delivery of the first actual C-135A cargo aircraft in 1961.

The primary Rivet Brass mission flew along the northern border of the Soviet Union, often as a shuttle mission between Eielson and RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, and later RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, UK. The RC-135D was also used in Southeast Asia during periods when the RC-135M (see below) was unavailable. In the late 1970s, with the expansion of the RC-135 fleet powered by TF33 turbofan engines, the RC-135Ds were converted into tankers, and remain in service as receiver-capable KC-135Rs.

===RC-135E Lisa Ann / Rivet Amber===
Originally designated C-135B-II, project name Lisa Ann, the RC-135E Rivet Amber was a one-of-a-kind aircraft, equipped with a large 7 MW Hughes Aircraft phased-array radar system. Originally delivered as a C-135B, 62-4137 operated from Shemya Air Force Station, Alaska from 1966 to 1969. Its operations were performed in concert with the RC-135S Rivet Ball aircraft (see below). The radar system alone weighed over 35,000 pounds and cost over US$35 million (1960 dollars), making Rivet Amber both the heaviest C-135 derivative aircraft flying and the most expensive Air Force aircraft for its time. This prevented the forward and aft crew areas from having direct contact after boarding the aircraft.

The system could track an object the size of a soccer ball from a distance of . Its mission was to monitor Soviet ballistic missile testing in the reentry phase. The power requirement for the phased array radar was enormous, necessitating an additional power supply. This took the form of a podded Lycoming T55-L5 turboshaft engine in a pod under the left inboard wing section, driving a 350 kVA generator, dedicated to powering mission equipment.

On the opposite wing, in the same location, was a podded heat exchanger to permit cooling of the massive electronic components on board the aircraft. This configuration has led to the mistaken impression that the aircraft had six engines. On 5 June 1969, Rivet Amber was lost at sea on a ferry flight from Shemya to Eielson AFB for maintenance. No trace of the aircraft or its crew was ever found.

===RC-135M Rivet Card===
The RC-135M was an interim type, with more limited ELINT capability than the RC-135C, but with extensive additional COMINT capability. They were converted from Military Airlift Command C-135B transports, and operated by the 82d Reconnaissance Squadron during the Vietnam War from Kadena AB, gathering signals intelligence over the Gulf of Tonkin and Laos with the program name Combat Apple, originally Burning Candy. There were six RC-135M aircraft, 62–4131, 62–4132, 62–4134, 62–4135, 62–4138 and 62–4139. All were later modified to and continue in active service as RC-135W Rivet Joints by the early 1980s.

===RC-135S Nancy Rae / Wanda Belle / Rivet Ball===
Rivet Ball was the predecessor program to Cobra Ball and was initiated with a single RC-135S (serial 59–1491, formerly a JKC-135A) on 31 December 1961. The aircraft first operated under the Nancy Rae project as an asset of Air Force Systems Command, and later as an RC-135S reconnaissance platform with Strategic Air Command under project Wanda Belle. The name Rivet Ball was assigned in January 1967. The aircraft operated from Shemya AFB, Alaska. Along with most other RC-135 variants, the RC-135S had an elongated nose radome, housing an S band receiving antenna.

The aircraft had ten large optically flat quartz windows for tracking cameras on the right side of the fuselage. Unlike any other RC-135S, Rivet Ball had a plexiglass dome mounted top-center on its fuselage for the Manual Tracker position. It obtained the first photographic documentation of Soviet Multiple Reentry vehicle (MRV) testing on 4 October 1968. On 13 January 1969, Rivet Ball was destroyed when it overran the runway when landing at Shemya, with no fatalities.

===RC-135S Cobra Ball===

The RC-135S Cobra Ball is a measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) collector equipped with special electro-optical instruments such an All Weather Tracking Radar and Medium Wave Infrared Array (MIRA) designed to observe ballistic missile flights at long range. The Cobra Ball monitors missile-associated signals and tracks missiles during boost and re-entry phases to provide reconnaissance for treaty verification and theater ballistic missile proliferation. The aircraft are extensively modified C-135Bs. The right wing and engines are traditionally painted black to reduce sun glare for tracking cameras.

There are three aircraft in service, assigned to the 55th Wing, 45th Reconnaissance Squadron based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Cobra Ball aircraft were originally assigned to Shemya and used to observe ballistic missile tests on the Kamchatka peninsula in conjunction with Cobra Dane and Cobra Judy. In 1969, two aircraft were converted for Cobra Ball. Following the loss of an aircraft in 1981, another aircraft was converted in 1983. In 1995, the sole RC-135X was converted into an RC-135S to supplement the other aircraft.

===RC-135T Rivet Dandy===

In 1971, KC-135T 55-3121 was modified to a RC-135T Rivet Dandy configuration. It was used to supplement the RC-135C/D/M fleet, then in short supply due to ongoing upgrades requiring airframes to be out of service. It operated under the Burning Candy operational order. In 1973, the aircraft&#x27;s SIGINT gear was removed and transferred to KC-135R 58–0126, resulting in 55-3121 assuming the role of trainer, a role which it fulfilled for the remainder of its operational existence. Externally the aircraft retained the &#x27;hog nose&#x27; radome and some other external modifications. The aerial refueling boom and trapeze below the tail were removed, and it had no operational reconnaissance role.

In this configuration, it operated variously with the 376th Strategic Wing at Kadena AB, Okinawa, the 305th AREFW at Grissom AFB, Indiana, and the 6th Strategic Wing at Eielson AFB, Alaska. In 1982, the aircraft was modified with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-PW102 engines and other modifications common to the KC-135E tanker program, and returned to Eielson AFB. It crashed while on approach to Valdez Airport, Alaska on 25 February 1985 with the loss of three crew members. The wreckage was found in August 1985, six months after the accident.

===RC-135U Combat Sent===

The RC-135U Combat Sent is designed to collect technical intelligence on adversary radar emitter systems. Combat Sent data is collected to develop new or upgraded radar warning receivers, radar jammers, decoys, anti-radiation missiles, and training simulators.

Distinctly identified by the antenna arrays on the fuselage chin, tailcone, and wing tips, three RC-135C aircraft were converted to RC-135U (63-9792, 64–14847, &amp; 64–14849) in the early 1970s. In 1978, 63-9792 was converted into a Rivet Joint. All aircraft remain in service based at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Minimum crew requirements are 2 pilots, 2 navigators, 3 systems engineers, 10 electronic warfare officers, and 6 area specialists.

===RC-135V/W Rivet Joint===
The RC-135V/W is the USAF&#x27;s standard airborne SIGINT platform. Missions flown by the RC-135s are designated either Burning Wind or Misty Wind. Its sensor suite allows the mission crew to detect, identify and geolocate signals throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. The mission crew can then forward gathered information in a variety of formats to a wide range of consumers via Rivet Joint&#x27;s extensive communications suite. The crew consists of the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators, and airborne systems maintenance personnel. All Rivet Joint airframe and mission systems modifications are performed by L-3 Communications in Greenville, Texas, under the oversight of the Air Force Materiel Command.

All RC-135s are assigned to the 55th Wing, Air Combat Command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The wing uses various forward deployment locations worldwide. They have flown from Eielson AFB, Alaska; Howard AB, Panama; Hellenikon Air Base, Greece; Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan; and RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, and RAF Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, in the United Kingdom.

For many years, the RC-135V/W could be identified by the four large disc-capped Multiple Communications Emitter Location System (MUCELS) antennas forward, four somewhat smaller blade antennae aft and myriad of smaller underside antennas. Baseline 8 Rivet Joints, in the 2000s, introduced the first major change to the external RC-135V/W configuration, replacing the MUCELS antennas with plain blade antennas. The configuration of smaller underside antennas was also changed significantly.

====RC-135W Rivet Joint (Project Airseeker)====
The United Kingdom bought three KC-135R aircraft for conversion to RC-135W Rivet Joint standard under the Airseeker project. Acquisition of the three aircraft was budgeted at £634m, with entry into service in October 2014. The aircraft formed No. 51 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Waddington along with the RAF&#x27;s other ISTAR assets. They are expected to remain in service until 2045.

Previously, the Royal Air Force had gathered signals intelligence with three Nimrod R1 aircraft. When the time came to upgrade the maritime Nimrods to MRA4 standard, Project Helix was launched in August 2003 to study options for extending the life of the R1 out to 2025. In 2008, the option of switching to Rivet Joint was added to Helix, and the retirement of the R1 became inevitable when the MRA4 was cancelled under the UK&#x27;s 2010 defence review. The R1&#x27;s involvement over Libya in Operation Ellamy delayed its retirement until June 2011.

Helix became Project Airseeker, under which three KC-135R airframes were converted to the RC-135W standard by L-3 Communications. L-3 provides ongoing maintenance and upgrades under a long-term agreement. The three airframes are former United States Air Force KC-135Rs, all of which first flew in 1964 and were modified to the latest RC-135W standard before delivery. The three airframes on offer to the UK are the youngest KC-135s in the USAF fleet. As of September 2010 the aircraft had approximately 23,200 flying hours, 22,200 hours and 23,200 hours.

In January 2011, 51 Sqn personnel began training at Offutt for conversion to the RC-135. The first RC-135W (ZZ664) was delivered ahead of schedule to the Royal Air Force on 12 November 2013, for final approval and testing by the Defence Equipment and Support team prior to its release to service from the UK MAA. The second (ZZ665) was delivered in September 2015 and the third (ZZ666) in June 2017. The latter entered operational service in December 2017.

===RC-135X Cobra Eye===
The sole RC-135X Cobra Eye was converted during the mid-to-late-1980s from a C-135B Telemetry/Range Instrumented Aircraft, serial number 62–4128, with the mission of tracking ICBM reentry vehicles. In 1993, it was converted into an additional RC-135S Cobra Ball.

===TC-135===
Three aircraft are in service for crew training, and lack fully functional mission equipment. One TC-135S (62–4133) provides training capability for the Cobra Ball mission, and is distinguishable from combat-ready aircraft by the lack of cheeks on the forward fuselage. It was converted from an EC-135B in 1985 following the crash of the former RC-135T 55–3121, which had been used as a trainer up to that point. Two TC-135Ws (62-4127 and 4129) serve as training aircraft, primarily for the Rivet Joint mission, but can provide some training capability for RC-135U Combat Sent crews. They carry considerably fewer antennas than the fully equipped aircraft, but are otherwise similar in appearance to other Rivet Joint aircraft.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 17 July 1967, a KC-135R Rivet Stand, &quot;59-1465&quot;, crashed on takeoff from Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The aircraft commander over-rotated the aircraft, causing it to stall and crash just under a mile from the end of the runway on the edge of Papillion Creek. One of the five crew members aboard was killed.
*On 13 January 1969, USAF RC-135S, &quot;59-1491&quot;, called &quot;Rivet Ball&quot;, was returning from an operational reconnaissance mission, when it landed at Shemya Air Force Base, Alaska in a snowstorm. The aircraft slid off the ice-covered runway and plunged into a 40-foot ravine. Later &quot;Ball&quot; aircraft were equipped with thrust-reversers on their TF-33 turbofan engines, but this aircraft had J-57 turbojet engines without reverse thrust capability. All eighteen crew members successfully evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft was written off as damaged beyond repair, but many components specific to the reconnaissance mission were salvaged for later use.
*On 5 June 1969, USAF RC-135E, &quot;62-4137&quot;, called &quot;Rivet Amber&quot;, departed Shemya Air Force Base, Alaska for a ferry flight to Eielson Air Force Base. Although the purpose of this ferry flight is sometimes described as routine maintenance, the aircraft had encountered severe turbulence on its previous operational mission and had been cleared for a one-time flight to be checked for possible structural damage at the main operating base. &quot;Rivet Amber&quot; was the heaviest 135 series aircraft ever built. It was a highly sophisticated aircraft with a radar that weighed over 35,000 pounds. Under each wing were specialized pods housing a heat-exchanger (right wing) and an additional electrical generator (left wing). During the flight, all contact with 62-4137 was lost and the wreckage of the aircraft was never found.
*On 15 March 1981, USAF RC-135S, &quot;61-2664&quot;, called &quot;Cobra Ball&quot;, crashed on final approach in bad weather to Shemya Air Force Base, Alaska on a flight from Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. The aircraft commander never established a proper glide path or descent rate on final and impacted the ground short of the runway. Of the twenty-four occupants of the aircraft, six were killed.
*On 25 February 1985, USAF RC-135T, &quot;55-3121&quot;, operating out of Eielson AFB, Alaska, was flying practice approaches in very poor weather at the Valdez Municipal Airport, Alaska. This one-time &quot;Speed Light&quot; aircraft had been re-engined with P&amp;W TF-33 engines, but was at this time only used for proficiency training in landings and air refueling, not for operational reconnaissance missions, but was sometimes called &quot;Rivet Dandy&quot;. The first two approaches were uneventful, but the crew apparently became disoriented and the third Microwave Landing System (MLS) approach was commenced some north of the prescribed MLS inbound course. The crew of three, two pilots and a navigator, were killed when the aircraft flew into the side of a mountain. The approach procedure being attempted was certified for a de Havilland Canada DHC-7, STOL airplane. Both the glide slope and missed approach flight path were too steep for an RC-135 aircraft. The wreckage was located on 2 August 1985.
*On 3 March 2003, two MiG-29 and MiG-23 of the North Korean KPAAF intercepted a RC-135S in the Sea of Japan. A MiG-29 came within 50 feet of the aircraft. Another locked onto it with fire control radar in preparation to conduct a shoot down. The RC-135S changed course towards Japan and landed at Kadena airbase.
*On 30 April 2015, USAF RC-135V, &quot;64-14848&quot;, operating out of Offutt AFB, NE aborted takeoff on a routine training mission, when crewmembers observed smoke and flames coming from the aft galley. The aircraft commander aborted the takeoff at about 50 KIAS and the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians—27 individuals in all—evacuated the aircraft. Although there were no injuries, except for minor smoke inhalation, the ensuing fire damaged aircraft control and mission related systems. Total repair cost was estimated at $62.4 million US. The cause of the mishap was failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut and caused the tubing to become detached, feeding even more oxygen to the fire, which increased in size and caused severe damage to the airframe, galley and mission equipment aboard the aircraft. The oxygen line system work, which was listed as the cause of this 2015 mishap, was carried out in August 2013.
*On 29 September 2022, an RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint plane interacted with two Russian SU-27s, one of which released a missile in the vicinity of the RAF Rivet Joint beyond visual range. Russia claimed this was due to a technical malfunction, and acknowledged the incident took place over the Black Sea in international waters. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, declared &quot;we are incredibly lucky that the episode did not become worse&quot;. Later due to a set of classified data leaks, more information was released regarding the incident. According to two U.S. defense officials, the Russian pilot had misinterpreted what a radar operator on the ground was saying to him and thought he had permission to fire. The pilot, who had locked on the British aircraft, fired, but the missile did not launch properly.

<doc id="26502" wikidata="Q219948" url="?curid=26502" title="Rumiko Takahashi">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. With a career of several commercially successful works, beginning with &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; in 1978, she is one of Japan&#x27;s best-known and wealthiest manga artists. Her works are known worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 230 million copies in circulation; making Takahashi one of the best-selling authors of all time. She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and again in 2001 for &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and again in 1989 for &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot;. She also received the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême in 2019, becoming the second woman and second Japanese to win the prize. In 2020, the Japanese government awarded Takahashi the Medal with Purple Ribbon for her contributions to the arts.

==Career==
Takahashi was born in Niigata, Japan. Although she showed little interest in manga during her childhood, she was said to occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending . She co-founded a manga club at high school together with Yōko Kondō, who also became a manga artist. Takahashi&#x27;s interest in drawing manga herself did not start until later. In an interview in 2000, Takahashi said that she had always wanted to become a professional comic author since she was a child.

=== Initial works ===
During her university years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, author of &quot;Crying Freeman&quot; and &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. Under his guidance Takahashi began to publish her first &quot;dōjinshi&quot; creations in 1975, such as &quot;Bye-Bye Road&quot; and &quot;Star of Futile Dust&quot;. Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s works throughout her career. She also briefly worked as an assistant for horror manga artist Kazuo Umezu while he was working on his comedy series &quot;Makoto-chan&quot;.

=== &quot;Katte na Yatsura&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; ===
Her professional career began in 1978. Her first published work was the one-shot &quot;&quot; (&quot;Those Selfish Aliens&quot;), which garnered her an honorable mention at that year&#x27;s Shogakukan New Comics Contest. Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;; &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, a comedic science fiction story. She had difficulty meeting deadlines to begin with, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During the run of the series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet due to a lack of space. During the same year, she published &quot;Time Warp Trouble&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Buddha&quot;, and the &quot;Golden Gods of Poverty&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.

=== Romantic comedies and short stories ===
In 1980, Takahashi started her second major series, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, in &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot; magazine, which had an older target audience than her previous work. Because of the influence of the New Wave movement of manga in the late 1970s, &quot;seinen&quot; manga became more open to including &quot;shōjo&quot; manga aesthetics and to hiring female manga artists. &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; is a romantic comedy, and Takahashi used her own experience living in an apartment complex to create the series. Takahashi managed to work on the series on and off simultaneously with &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. She concluded both series in 1987, with &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; ending at 34 volumes, and &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; at 15.

During the 1980s, Takahashi became a prolific writer of short story manga. Her stories &quot;Laughing Target&quot;, &quot;Maris the Chojo&quot;, and &quot;Fire Tripper&quot; all were adapted into original video animations (OVAs). In 1984, during the writing of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, Takahashi began a series published sporadically in Weekly Shōnen Sunday called &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; which ran for 10 years, until 1994. The series was partially released in two wide-ban volumes, with the complete story released as a set of shinsoban in 2003.

Another short work of Takahashi&#x27;s to be published sporadically was &quot;One-Pound Gospel&quot;. Takahashi concluded the series in 2007 after publishing chapters in 1998, 2001 and 2006. One-Pound Gospel was adapted into a live-action TV drama.

===Other works===
In 1987, Takahashi began her third major series, &quot;Ranma ½ &quot;. Following the late 1980s and early 1990s trend of &quot;shōnen&quot; martial arts manga, &quot;Ranma ½&quot; features a gender-bending twist. The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes. &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and its anime adaptation are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.

During the latter half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; and &quot;One-Pound Gospel&quot; until beginning her fourth major work, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. Unlike the majority of her works, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; has a darker tone more akin to &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; and, having been serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from 1996 to 2008, is her longest to date. On March 5, 2009, Rumiko Takahashi released her one-shot &quot;Unmei No Tori&quot;. On March 16, 2009, she collaborated with Mitsuru Adachi, creator of &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Cross Game&quot;, to release a one-shot called &quot;My Sweet Sunday&quot;. Her next manga series, &quot;Kyōkai no Rinne&quot; started on April 22, 2009. This was Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s first new manga series since her previous manga series &quot;Inuyasha&quot; ended in June 2008. She concluded it on December 13, 2017, with a total of 398 chapters, collected in 40 volumes.

&quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, &quot;Ranma ½&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, and &quot;RIN-NE&quot; are all published in English in the United States by Viz Comics. The 1989 re-release of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; was halted after only a few volumes were translated, but a reprint in a 2-in-1 omnibus format began in 2019 .

Rumiko Takahashi started a new manga series entitled &quot;Mao&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; issue #23 released on May 8, 2019.

==Animation==

In 1981, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; became the first of Takahashi&#x27;s works to be animated. This series first aired on Japanese television on October 14, and went through multiple director changes during its run. Though the 195-episode TV series ended in March 1986, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; was kept alive in anime form through OVA and movie releases through 1991. Most notable of the series directors was Mamoru Oshii, who made &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, the second &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; movie. AnimEigo has released the entire TV series and all of the OVAs and movies except for &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; (which was released by Central Park Media in the U.S.) in the United States in English-subtitled format, with English dubs also made for the first two TV episodes (as &quot;Those Obnoxious Aliens&quot;) and for all of the movies.

=== Kitty Films ===
Continued cooperation of Kitty Films, Studio Pierrot, and Studio Deen in 1986 led to the adaptation of Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s second work, &quot;Maison Ikkoku,&quot; which debuted the week after the final TV episode of &quot;UY&quot;. The TV series ran for 96 episodes, 3 OVAs, a movie and also a live-action movie.

OVAs produced in the mid-80s:

* &quot;Maris the Chojo&quot; (May 21, 1986)
* &quot;Fire Tripper&quot; (December 16, 1985)
* &quot;Laughing Target&quot; (March 21, 1987)

OVAs produced in the early 90s:

* &quot;Mermaid&#x27;s Forest&quot; (August 16, 1991)
* &quot;Mermaid&#x27;s Scar&quot; (September 24, 1993)

All listed titles were eventually subtitled in English and released in the United States. Viz Communications has released the anime of &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot;, &quot;Ranma&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot; in English, in both subtitled and dubbed formats. Studio Deen also provided animation duties on &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; and &quot;Ranma&quot;.

&quot;Ranma ½&quot; was the last major series produced by Kitty Films. The series was never concluded in animated form despite being 161 episodes and having two movies. Kitty Films discontinued work on the series due to turmoil in the company, and was continued by Studio Deen until 1996.

After Kitty Films, Sunrise was the first studio to adapt a major Rumiko Takahashi series. From 2000 to 2004, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; ran for 167 episodes and spawned four major films. The first anime ended before the manga did, thus wrapping up inconclusively. A second Inuyasha series in 2009, &quot;&quot;, ran until March 2010 in order to officially conclude the story.

=== 2008 special exhibit ===
2008 marked the 50th anniversary of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; and the 30th anniversary of the first publication of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;. Rumiko Takahashi&#x27;s manga work was honoured in &quot;It&#x27;s a Rumic World&quot;, a special exhibition held from July 30 to August 11 at the Matsuya Ginza department store in Tokyo.

The exhibit included a new half-hour &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot; OVAs and an introductory sequence featuring characters from &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Ranma&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot; (starring the characters&#x27; original anime voice talents). The sequence has become a popular video on YouTube.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Rumic World&quot; was scheduled to re-open in Sendai in December 2008, at which time a new half-hour &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; OVA was scheduled to premiere. A special DVD release containing all three new OVAs was announced as coming out on January 29, 2010, with a trailer posted in September 2009. However, it is not known whether any of the new episodes will ever be released outside Japan.

&quot;Rumiko Takahashi Anthology&quot;, animated by TMS Entertainment adapts many of her short stories from the 80s. It features her stories &quot;The Tragedy of P&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Romance&quot;, &quot;Middle-Aged Teen&quot;, &quot;Hidden in the Pottery&quot;, &quot;Aberrant Family F&quot;, &quot;As Long As You Are Here&quot;, &quot;One Hundred Years of Love&quot;, &quot;In Lieu of Thanks&quot;, &quot;Living Room Lovesong&quot;, &quot;House of Garbage&quot;, &quot;One Day Dream&quot;, &quot;Extra-Large Size Happiness&quot;, and &quot;The Executive&#x27;s Dog&quot;. Also, a TV series of &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; was produced in 2003, animating 8 of her stories.

==Legacy and impact in the West==
Many of Takahashi&#x27;s works have been translated into English, as well as other European languages. Takahashi said that she did not know why her works are relatively popular with English speakers. Takahashi said &quot;Sure, there are cultural differences in my work. When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there&#x27;s always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, &#x27;Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more&#x27;. I suppose the same thing must happen with my books. It&#x27;s inevitable. And yet, that doesn&#x27;t mean my books can&#x27;t be enjoyed by English-speaking readers. I feel confident that there&#x27;s enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can have a lot of fun reading them.&quot;

Artists that have cited Takahashi and her work as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley on his series &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot;, American Colleen Coover on her erotic series &quot;Small Favors&quot;, Japanese Chihiro Tamaki on her manga &quot;Walkin&#x27; Butterfly&quot;, Chinese-Australian Queenie Chan, and Thai Wisut Ponnimit. Scottish rock band Urusei Yatsura named themselves after her first work. Matt Bozon, creator of the &quot;Shantae&quot; video game series, cited &quot;Ranma ½&quot; as a big influence on his work. Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Domee Shi listed both &quot;Ranma ½&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot; as influences on her film &quot;Turning Red&quot;.

== Honors ==
Takahashi was one of the recipients of the Inkpot Award at the 1994 San Diego Comic-Con.

She was inducted into Friends of Lulu&#x27;s Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2005.

In 2016, ComicsAlliance listed Takahashi as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition, stating that &quot;Any one of her projects would be the career highlight of another talent.&quot; In 2017, Takahashi was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame as part of the 2016 class.

In July 2018, Takahashi was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame. She was previously nominated for entry in 2014, 2016 and 2017.

In January 2019, Takahashi won the Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême, becoming the second woman and second manga artist to win the award at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.

In 2020, Takahashi was awarded Japan&#x27;s Medal with Purple Ribbon.

Takahashi was inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame in October 2021.

In April 2023, Takahashi was conferred the Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.
