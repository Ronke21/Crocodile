<text>Superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism which appears in small ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic nanoparticles. In sufficiently small nanoparticles, magnetization can randomly flip direction under the influence of temperature. The typical time between two flips is called the Néel relaxation time. In the absence of an external magnetic field, when the time used to measure the magnetization of the nanoparticles is much longer than the Néel relaxation time, their magnetization appears to be on average zero; they are said to be in the superparamagnetic state. In this state, an external magnetic field is able to magnetize the nanoparticles, similarly to a paramagnet. However, their magnetic susceptibility is much larger than that of paramagnets.

== The Néel relaxation in the absence of magnetic field ==

Normally, any ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material undergoes a transition to a paramagnetic state above its Curie temperature. Superparamagnetism is different from this standard transition since it occurs below the Curie temperature of the material.

Superparamagnetism occurs in nanoparticles which are single-domain, i.e. composed of a single magnetic domain. This is possible when their diameter is below 3–50 nm, depending on the materials. In this condition, it is considered that the magnetization of the nanoparticles is a single giant magnetic moment, sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the nanoparticle. Those in the field of superparamagnetism call this &quot;macro-spin approximation&quot;.

Because of the nanoparticle’s magnetic anisotropy, the magnetic moment has usually only two stable orientations antiparallel to each other, separated by an energy barrier. The stable orientations define the nanoparticle’s so called “easy axis”. At finite temperature, there is a finite probability for the magnetization to flip and reverse its direction. The mean time between two flips is called the Néel relaxation time formula_1 and is given by the following Néel–Arrhenius equation:

: formula_2,

where:
* formula_1 is thus the average length of time that it takes for the nanoparticle’s magnetization to randomly flip as a result of thermal fluctuations.
* formula_4 is a length of time, characteristic of the material, called the &quot;attempt time&quot; or &quot;attempt period&quot; (its reciprocal is called the &quot;attempt frequency&quot;); its typical value is between 10−9 and 10−10 second.
* &quot;K&quot; is the nanoparticle’s magnetic anisotropy energy density and &quot;V&quot; its volume. &quot;KV&quot; is therefore the energy barrier associated with the magnetization moving from its initial easy axis direction, through a “hard plane”, to the other easy axis direction.
* &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant.
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature.

This length of time can be anywhere from a few nanoseconds to years or much longer. In particular, it can be seen that the Néel relaxation time is an exponential function of the grain volume, which explains why the flipping probability becomes rapidly negligible for bulk materials or large nanoparticles.

=== Blocking temperature ===

Let us imagine that the magnetization of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured and let us define formula_5 as the measurement time. If formula_6, the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement, then the measured magnetization will average to zero. If formula_7, the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be what the instantaneous magnetization was at the beginning of the measurement. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will appear to be “blocked” in its initial state.

The state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state occurs when formula_8. In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state is seen as a function of the temperature. The temperature for which formula_8 is called the &quot;blocking temperature&quot;:

:formula_10

For typical laboratory measurements, the value of the logarithm in the previous equation is in the order of 20–25.

Equivalently, blocking temperature is the temperature below which a material shows slow relaxation of magnetization. 

== Effect of a magnetic field ==

When an external magnetic field &quot;H&quot; is applied to an assembly of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, their magnetic moments tend to align along the applied field, leading to a net magnetization. The magnetization curve of the assembly, i.e. the magnetization as a function of the applied field, is a reversible S-shaped increasing function. This function is quite complicated but for some simple cases:
# If all the particles are identical (same energy barrier and same magnetic moment), their easy axes are all oriented parallel to the applied field and the temperature is low enough (&quot;T&quot;B &lt; &quot;T&quot; ≲ &quot;KV&quot;/(10 &quot;k&quot;B)), then the magnetization of the assembly is
#: formula_11.
# If all the particles are identical and the temperature is high enough (&quot;T&quot; ≳ &quot;KV&quot;/&quot;k&quot;B), then, irrespective of the orientations of the easy axes:
#: formula_12

In the above equations:
* &quot;n&quot; is the density of nanoparticles in the sample
* formula_13 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum
* formula_14 is the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle
* formula_15 is the Langevin function

The initial slope of the formula_16 function is the magnetic susceptibility of the sample formula_17:
: formula_18

The latter susceptibility is also valid for all temperatures formula_19 if the easy axes of the nanoparticles are randomly oriented.

It can be seen from these equations that large nanoparticles have a larger &quot;μ&quot; and so a larger susceptibility. This explains why superparamagnetic nanoparticles have a much larger susceptibility than standard paramagnets: they behave exactly as a paramagnet with a huge magnetic moment.

=== Time dependence of the magnetization ===

There is no time-dependence of the magnetization when the nanoparticles are either completely blocked (formula_20) or completely superparamagnetic (formula_21). There is, however, a narrow window around formula_22 where the measurement time and the relaxation time have comparable magnitude. In this case, a frequency-dependence of the susceptibility can be observed. For a randomly oriented sample, the complex susceptibility is:

: formula_23

where
* formula_24 is the frequency of the applied field
* formula_25 is the susceptibility in the superparamagnetic state
* formula_26 is the susceptibility in the blocked state
* formula_27 is the relaxation time of the assembly

From this frequency-dependent susceptibility, the time-dependence of the magnetization for low-fields can be derived:

:formula_28

==Measurements==
A superparamagnetic system can be measured with AC susceptibility measurements, where an applied magnetic field varies in time, and the magnetic response of the system is measured. A superparamagnetic system will show a characteristic frequency dependence: When the frequency is much higher than 1/τN, there will be a different magnetic response than when the frequency is much lower than 1/τN, since in the latter case, but not the former, the ferromagnetic clusters will have time to respond to the field by flipping their magnetization. The precise dependence can be calculated from the Néel–Arrhenius equation, assuming that the neighboring clusters behave independently of one another (if clusters interact, their behavior becomes more complicated). It is also possible to perform magneto-optical AC susceptibility measurements with magneto-optically active superparamagnetic materials such as iron oxide nanoparticles in the visible wavelength range.

==Effect on hard drives==
Superparamagnetism sets a limit on the storage density of hard disk drives due to the minimum size of particles that can be used. This limit on areal-density is known as the superparamagnetic limit.

* Older hard disk technology uses longitudinal recording. It has an estimated limit of 100 to 200 Gbit/in2.
* Current hard disk technology uses perpendicular recording. drives with densities of approximately 1 Tbit/in2 are available commercially. This is at the limit for conventional magnetic recording that was predicted in 1999.
* Future hard disk technologies currently in development include: heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and microwave-assisted magnetic recording (MAMR), which use materials that are stable at much smaller sizes. They require localized heating or microwave excitation before the magnetic orientation of a bit can be changed. Bit-patterned recording (BPR) avoids the use of fine-grained media and is another possibility. In addition, magnetic recording technologies based on topological distortions of the magnetization, known as skyrmions, have been proposed.

<text>In mathematics, a topological space is called separable if it contains a countable, dense subset; that is, there exists a sequence formula_1 of elements of the space such that every nonempty open subset of the space contains at least one element of the sequence.

Like the other axioms of countability, separability is a &quot;limitation on size&quot;, not necessarily in terms of cardinality (though, in the presence of the Hausdorff axiom, this does turn out to be the case; see below) but in a more subtle topological sense. In particular, every continuous function on a separable space whose image is a subset of a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset.

Contrast separability with the related notion of second countability, which is in general stronger but equivalent on the class of metrizable spaces.

==First examples==
Any topological space that is itself finite or countably infinite is separable, for the whole space is a countable dense subset of itself. An important example of an uncountable separable space is the real line, in which the rational numbers form a countable dense subset. Similarly the set of all length-formula_2 vectors of rational numbers, formula_3, is a countable dense subset of the set of all length-formula_2 vectors of real numbers, formula_5; so for every formula_2, formula_2-dimensional Euclidean space is separable.

A simple example of a space that is not separable is a discrete space of uncountable cardinality.

Further examples are given below.

==Separability versus second countability==
Any second-countable space is separable: if formula_8 is a countable base, choosing any formula_9 from the non-empty formula_10 gives a countable dense subset. Conversely, a metrizable space is separable if and only if it is second countable, which is the case if and only if it is Lindelöf.

To further compare these two properties:
* An arbitrary subspace of a second-countable space is second countable; subspaces of separable spaces need not be separable (see below).
* Any continuous image of a separable space is separable ; even a quotient of a second-countable space need not be second countable.
* A product of at most continuum many separable spaces is separable . A countable product of second-countable spaces is second countable, but an uncountable product of second-countable spaces need not even be first countable.

We can construct an example of a separable topological space that is not second countable. Consider any uncountable set formula_11, pick some formula_12, and define the topology to be the collection of all sets that contain formula_13 (or are empty). Then, the closure of formula_14 is the whole space (formula_11 is the smallest closed set containing formula_13), but every set of the form formula_17 is open. Therefore, the space is separable but there cannot have a countable base.

==Cardinality==
The property of separability does not in and of itself give any limitations on the cardinality of a topological space: any set endowed with the trivial topology is separable, as well as second countable, quasi-compact, and connected. The &quot;trouble&quot; with the trivial topology is its poor separation properties: its Kolmogorov quotient is the one-point space.

A first-countable, separable Hausdorff space (in particular, a separable metric space) has at most the continuum cardinality formula_18. In such a space, closure is determined by limits of sequences and any convergent sequence has at most one limit, so there is a surjective map from the set of convergent sequences with values in the countable dense subset to the points of formula_11.

A separable Hausdorff space has cardinality at most formula_20, where formula_18 is the cardinality of the continuum. For this closure is characterized in terms of limits of filter bases: if formula_22 and formula_23, then formula_24 if and only if there exists a filter base formula_25 consisting of subsets of formula_26 that converges to formula_27. The cardinality of the set formula_28 of such filter bases is at most formula_29. Moreover, in a Hausdorff space, there is at most one limit to every filter base. Therefore, there is a surjection formula_30 when formula_31

The same arguments establish a more general result: suppose that a Hausdorff topological space formula_11 contains a dense subset of cardinality formula_33.
Then formula_11 has cardinality at most formula_35 and cardinality at most formula_36 if it is first countable.

The product of at most continuum many separable spaces is a separable space . In particular the space formula_37 of all functions from the real line to itself, endowed with the product topology, is a separable Hausdorff space of cardinality formula_20. More generally, if formula_33 is any infinite cardinal, then a product of at most formula_40 spaces with dense subsets of size at most formula_33 has itself a dense subset of size at most formula_33 (Hewitt–Marczewski–Pondiczery theorem).

==Constructive mathematics==
Separability is especially important in numerical analysis and constructive mathematics, since many theorems that can be proved for nonseparable spaces have constructive proofs only for separable spaces. Such constructive proofs can be turned into algorithms for use in numerical analysis, and they are the only sorts of proofs acceptable in constructive analysis. A famous example of a theorem of this sort is the Hahn–Banach theorem.

==Further examples==

===Separable spaces===
* Every compact metric space (or metrizable space) is separable.
* Any topological space that is the union of a countable number of separable subspaces is separable. Together, these first two examples give a different proof that formula_2-dimensional Euclidean space is separable.
* The space formula_44 of all continuous functions from a compact subset formula_45 to the real line formula_46 is separable.
* The Lebesgue spaces formula_47, over a measure space formula_48 whose σ-algebra is countably generated and whose measure is σ-finite, are separable for any formula_49.
* The space formula_50 of continuous real-valued functions on the unit interval formula_51 with the metric of uniform convergence is a separable space, since it follows from the Weierstrass approximation theorem that the set formula_52 of polynomials in one variable with rational coefficients is a countable dense subset of formula_50. The Banach–Mazur theorem asserts that any separable Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a closed linear subspace of formula_50.
* A Hilbert space is separable if and only if it has a countable orthonormal basis. It follows that any separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is isometric to the space formula_55 of square-summable sequences.
* An example of a separable space that is not second-countable is the Sorgenfrey line formula_56, the set of real numbers equipped with the lower limit topology.
* A separable σ-algebra is a σ-algebra formula_57 that is a separable space when considered as a metric space with metric formula_58 for formula_59 and a given finite measure formula_60 (and with formula_61 being the symmetric difference operator).

===Non-separable spaces===
* The first uncountable ordinal formula_62, equipped with its natural order topology, is not separable.
* The Banach space formula_63 of all bounded real sequences, with the supremum norm, is not separable. The same holds for formula_64.
* The Banach space of functions of bounded variation is not separable; note however that this space has very important applications in mathematics, physics and engineering.

==Properties==
* A subspace of a separable space need not be separable (see the Sorgenfrey plane and the Moore plane), but every &quot;open&quot; subspace of a separable space is separable . Also every subspace of a separable metric space is separable.
* In fact, every topological space is a subspace of a separable space of the same cardinality. A construction adding at most countably many points is given in ; if the space was a Hausdorff space then the space constructed that it embeds into is also a Hausdorff space.
* The set of all real-valued continuous functions on a separable space has a cardinality equal to formula_18, the cardinality of the continuum. This follows since such functions are determined by their values on dense subsets.
* From the above property, one can deduce the following: If &quot;X&quot; is a separable space having an uncountable closed discrete subspace, then &quot;X&quot; cannot be normal. This shows that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal.
*For a compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot;, the following are equivalent: 

===Embedding separable metric spaces===
* Every separable metric space is homeomorphic to a subset of the Hilbert cube. This is established in the proof of the Urysohn metrization theorem.
* Every separable metric space is isometric to a subset of the (non-separable) Banach space &quot;l&quot;∞ of all bounded real sequences with the supremum norm; this is known as the Fréchet embedding. 
* Every separable metric space is isometric to a subset of C([0,1]), the separable Banach space of continuous functions [0,1] → R, with the supremum norm. This is due to Stefan Banach. 
* Every separable metric space is isometric to a subset of the Urysohn universal space.
&quot;For nonseparable spaces&quot;:
* A metric space of density equal to an infinite cardinal is isometric to a subspace of , the space of real continuous functions on the product of copies of the unit interval.

<text>In quantum mechanics, Schrödinger&#x27;s cat is a thought experiment concerning quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This experiment viewed this way is described as a paradox. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

In Schrödinger&#x27;s original formulation, a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal radiation monitor (e.g. a Geiger counter) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation implies that, after a while, the cat is &quot;simultaneously&quot; alive &quot;and&quot; dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat &quot;either&quot; alive &quot;or&quot; dead, not both alive &quot;and&quot; dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality resolves into one possibility or the other.

Although originally a critique on the Copenhagen interpretation, Schrödinger&#x27;s seemingly paradoxical thought experiment became part of the foundation of quantum mechanics. The scenario is often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly in situations involving the measurement problem. As a result, Schrödinger&#x27;s cat has had enduring appeal in popular culture. The experiment is not intended to be actually performed on a cat, but rather as an easily understandable illustration of the behavior of atoms. Experiments at the atomic scale have been carried out, showing that very small objects may exist as superpositions; but superposing an object as large as a cat would pose considerable technical difficulties.

Fundamentally, the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat experiment asks how long quantum superpositions last and when (or &quot;whether&quot;) they collapse. Different interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different explanations for this process.

== Origin and motivation ==
Schrödinger intended his thought experiment as a discussion of the EPR article—named after its authors Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen—in 1935. The EPR article highlighted the counterintuitive nature of quantum superpositions, in which a quantum system for two particles does not separate even when the particles are detected far from their last point of contact. The EPR paper concludes with a claim that this lack of separability meant that quantum mechanics as a theory of reality was incomplete. 

Schrödinger and Einstein exchanged letters about Einstein&#x27;s EPR article, in the course of which Einstein pointed out that the state of an unstable keg of gunpowder will, after a while, contain a superposition of both exploded and unexploded states.

To further illustrate, Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create a superposition in a large-scale system by making it dependent on a quantum particle that was in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a closed steel chamber, wherein the cat&#x27;s life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that &quot;the cat remains both alive and dead&quot; until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-live cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics, thus employing reductio ad absurdum.

Since Schrödinger&#x27;s time, various interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the &quot;alive and dead&quot; cat superposition as quite real, others do not. Intended as a critique of the Copenhagen interpretation (the prevailing orthodoxy in 1935), the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat thought experiment remains a touchstone for modern interpretations of quantum mechanics and can be used to illustrate and compare their strengths and weaknesses.
== Thought experiment ==
Schrödinger wrote:

Schrödinger developed his famous thought experiment in correspondence with Einstein. He suggested this &#x27;quite ridiculous case&#x27; to illustrate his conclusion that the wave function cannot represent reality. 
The wave function description of the complete cat system implies that the reality of the cat mixes the living and dead cat. Einstein was impressed by the ability of the thought experiment to highlight these issues. In a letter to Schrödinger dated 1950, he wrote:

Note that the charge of gunpowder is not mentioned in Schrödinger&#x27;s setup, which uses a Geiger counter as an amplifier and hydrocyanic poison instead of gunpowder. The gunpowder had been mentioned in Einstein&#x27;s original suggestion to Schrödinger 15 years before, and Einstein carried it forward to the present discussion.

== Analysis ==
In modern terms Schrodinger&#x27;s hypothetical cat experiment describes the measurement problem: quantum theory describes the cat system as a combination of two possible outcomes but only one outcome is ever observed. 
The experiment poses the question, &quot;&quot;when&quot; does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?&quot; (More technically, when does the actual quantum state stop being a non-trivial linear combination of states, each of which resembles different classical states, and instead begin to have a unique classical description?) Standard microscopic quantum mechanics describes multiple possible outcomes of experiments but only one outcome is observed. The thought experiment illustrates this apparent paradox. Our intuition says that the cat cannot be in more than one state simultaneously—yet the quantum mechanical description of the thought experiment requires such a condition.

== Interpretations ==
Since Schrödinger&#x27;s time, other interpretations of quantum mechanics have been proposed that give different answers to the questions posed by Schrödinger&#x27;s cat of how long superpositions last and when (or &quot;whether&quot;) they collapse.

=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
A commonly held interpretation of quantum mechanics is the Copenhagen interpretation. In the Copenhagen interpretation, a measurement results in only one state of a superposition. This thought experiment makes apparent the fact that this interpretation simply provides no explanation for the state of the cat while the box is closed. The wavefunction description of the system consists of a superposition of the states &quot;decayed nucleus/dead cat&quot; and &quot;undecayed nucleus/living cat&quot;. Only when the box is opened and observed can we make a statement about the cat.

===Von Neumann interpretation===

In 1932, John von Neumann described in his book &quot;Mathematical Foundations&quot; a pattern where the radioactive source is observed by a device, which itself is observed by another device and so on. It makes no difference in the predictions of quantum theory where along this chain of causal effects the superposition collapses. This potentially infinite chain could be broken if the last device is replaced by a conscious observer. This solved the problem because it was claimed that an individual&#x27;s consciousness cannot be multiple. Neumann asserted that a conscious observer is necessary for a collapse to one or the other (e.g., either a live cat or a dead cat) of the terms on the right-hand side of a wave function. This interpretation was later adopted by Eugene Wigner, who then rejected the interpretation in a thought experiment known as Wigner&#x27;s friend.

Wigner supposed that a friend opened the box and observed the cat without telling anyone. From Wigner&#x27;s conscious perspective, the friend is now part of the wave function and has seen a live cat and seen a dead cat. To a third person&#x27;s conscious perspective, Wigner himself becomes part of the wave function once Wigner learns the outcome from the friend. This could be extended indefinitely.

A resolution of the paradox is that the triggering of the Geiger counter counts as a measurement of the state of the radioactive substance. Because a measurement has already occurred deciding the state of the cat, the subsequent observation by a human records only what has already occurred. Analysis of an actual experiment by Roger Carpenter and A. J. Anderson found that measurement alone (for example by a Geiger counter) is sufficient to collapse a quantum wave function before any human knows of the result. The apparatus indicates one of two colors depending on the outcome. The human observer sees which color is indicated, but they don&#x27;t consciously know which outcome the color represents. A second human, the one who set up the apparatus, is told of the color and becomes conscious of the outcome, and the box is opened to check if the outcome matches. However, it is disputed whether merely observing the color counts as a conscious observation of the outcome.

===Bohr&#x27;s interpretation===
Analysis of the work of Niels Bohr, one of the main scientists associated with the Copenhagen interpretation, suggests he viewed the state of the cat before the box is opened as indeterminate. The superposition itself had no physical meaning to Bohr: Schrödinger&#x27;s cat would be either dead or alive long before the box is opened but the cat and box form a inseparable combination. 
Bohr saw no role for a human observer.
Bohr emphasized the classical nature of measurement results.
An &quot;irreversible&quot; or effectively irreversible process imparts the classical behavior of &quot;observation&quot; or &quot;measurement&quot;.

=== Many-worlds interpretation ===

In 1957, Hugh Everett formulated the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which does not single out observation as a special process. In the many-worlds interpretation, both alive and dead states of the cat persist after the box is opened, but are decoherent from each other. In other words, when the box is opened, the observer and the possibly-dead cat split into an observer looking at a box with a dead cat and an observer looking at a box with a live cat. But since the dead and alive states are decoherent, there is no communication or interaction between them.

When opening the box, the observer becomes entangled with the cat, so &quot;observer states&quot; corresponding to the cat&#x27;s being alive and dead are formed; each observer state is entangled, or linked, with the cat so that the observation of the cat&#x27;s state and the cat&#x27;s state correspond with each other. Quantum decoherence ensures that the different outcomes have no interaction with each other. Decoherence is generally considered to prevent simultaneous observation of multiple states.

A variant of the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat experiment, known as the quantum suicide machine, has been proposed by cosmologist Max Tegmark. It examines the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat experiment from the point of view of the cat, and argues that by using this approach, one may be able to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation and many-worlds.

=== Ensemble interpretation ===

The ensemble interpretation states that superpositions are nothing but subensembles of a larger statistical ensemble. The state vector would not apply to individual cat experiments, but only to the statistics of many similarly prepared cat experiments. Proponents of this interpretation state that this makes the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat paradox a trivial matter, or a non-issue.

This interpretation serves to &quot;discard&quot; the idea that a single physical system in quantum mechanics has a mathematical description that corresponds to it in any way.

=== Relational interpretation ===

The relational interpretation makes no fundamental distinction between the human experimenter, the cat, and the apparatus or between animate and inanimate systems; all are quantum systems governed by the same rules of wavefunction evolution, and all may be considered &quot;observers&quot;. But the relational interpretation allows that different observers can give different accounts of the same series of events, depending on the information they have about the system. The cat can be considered an observer of the apparatus; meanwhile, the experimenter can be considered another observer of the system in the box (the cat plus the apparatus). Before the box is opened, the cat, by nature of its being alive or dead, has information about the state of the apparatus (the atom has either decayed or not decayed); but the experimenter does not have information about the state of the box contents. In this way, the two observers simultaneously have different accounts of the situation: To the cat, the wavefunction of the apparatus has appeared to &quot;collapse&quot;; to the experimenter, the contents of the box appear to be in superposition. Not until the box is opened, and both observers have the same information about what happened, do both system states appear to &quot;collapse&quot; into the same definite result, a cat that is either alive or dead.

=== Transactional interpretation ===

In the transactional interpretation the apparatus emits an advanced wave backward in time, which combined with the wave that the source emits forward in time, forms a standing wave. The waves are seen as physically real, and the apparatus is considered an &quot;observer&quot;. In the transactional interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction is &quot;atemporal&quot; and occurs along the whole transaction between the source and the apparatus. The cat is never in superposition. Rather the cat is only in one state at any particular time, regardless of when the human experimenter looks in the box. The transactional interpretation resolves this quantum paradox.

=== Objective collapse theories ===

According to objective collapse theories, superpositions are destroyed spontaneously (irrespective of external observation) when some objective physical threshold (of time, mass, temperature, irreversibility, etc.) is reached. Thus, the cat would be expected to have settled into a definite state long before the box is opened. This could loosely be phrased as &quot;the cat observes itself&quot; or &quot;the environment observes the cat&quot;.

Objective collapse theories require a modification of standard quantum mechanics to allow superpositions to be destroyed by the process of time evolution. These theories could ideally be tested by creating mesoscopic superposition states in the experiment. For instance, energy cat states has been proposed as a precise detector of the quantum gravity related energy decoherence models.

== Applications and tests ==
The experiment as described is a purely theoretical one, and the machine proposed is not known to have been constructed. However, successful experiments involving similar principles, e.g. superpositions of relatively large (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed. These experiments do not show that a cat-sized object can be superposed, but the known upper limit on &quot;cat states&quot; has been pushed upwards by them. In many cases the state is short-lived, even when cooled to near absolute zero.
* A &quot;cat state&quot; has been achieved with photons.
* A beryllium ion has been trapped in a superposed state.
* An experiment involving a superconducting quantum interference device (&quot;SQUID&quot;) has been linked to the theme of the thought experiment: &quot;The superposition state does not correspond to a billion electrons flowing one way and a billion others flowing the other way. Superconducting electrons move en masse. All the superconducting electrons in the SQUID flow both ways around the loop at once when they are in the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat state.&quot;
* A piezoelectric &quot;tuning fork&quot; has been constructed, which can be placed into a superposition of vibrating and non vibrating states. The resonator comprises about 10 trillion atoms.
* An experiment involving a flu virus has been proposed.
* An experiment involving a bacterium and an electromechanical oscillator has been proposed.

In quantum computing the phrase &quot;cat state&quot; sometimes refers to the GHZ state, wherein several qubits are in an equal superposition of all being 0 and all being 1; e.g.,

:formula_1

According to at least one proposal, it may be possible to determine the state of the cat &quot;before&quot; observing it.

== Extensions ==

In August 2020, physicists presented studies involving interpretations of quantum mechanics that are related to the Schrödinger&#x27;s cat and Wigner&#x27;s friend paradoxes, resulting in conclusions that challenge seemingly established assumptions about reality.

<doc id="27859" wikidata="Q12507" url="?curid=27859" title="Sphere">
<text>A sphere (from Greek , ) is a geometrical object that is a three-dimensional analogue to a two-dimensional circle. Formally, a sphere is the set of points that are all at the same distance from a given point in three-dimensional space. That given point is the center of the sphere, and is the sphere&#x27;s &quot;radius&quot;. The earliest known mentions of spheres appear in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians.

The sphere is a fundamental surface in many fields of mathematics. Spheres and nearly-spherical shapes also appear in nature and industry. Bubbles such as soap bubbles take a spherical shape in equilibrium. The Earth is often approximated as a sphere in geography, and the celestial sphere is an important concept in astronomy. Manufactured items including pressure vessels and most curved mirrors and lenses are based on spheres. Spheres roll smoothly in any direction, so most balls used in sports and toys are spherical, as are ball bearings.

==Basic terminology==
As mentioned earlier is the sphere&#x27;s radius; any line from the center to a point on the sphere is also called a radius. &#x27;Radius&#x27; is used in two senses: as a line segment and also as its length.

If a radius is extended through the center to the opposite side of the sphere, it creates a diameter. Like the radius, the length of a diameter is also called the diameter, and denoted . Diameters are the longest line segments that can be drawn between two points on the sphere: their length is twice the radius, . Two points on the sphere connected by a diameter are antipodal points of each other.

A unit sphere is a sphere with unit radius (). For convenience, spheres are often taken to have their center at the origin of the coordinate system, and spheres in this article have their center at the origin unless a center is mentioned.
A &quot;great circle&quot; on the sphere has the same center and radius as the sphere, and divides it into two equal hemispheres.

Although the figure of Earth is not perfectly spherical, terms borrowed from geography are convenient to apply to the sphere.
A particular line passing through its center defines an &quot;axis&quot; (as in Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation).
The sphere-axis intersection defines two antipodal &quot;poles&quot; (&quot;north pole&quot; and &quot;south pole&quot;). The great circle equidistant to the poles is called the &quot;equator&quot;. Great circles through the poles are called lines of longitude or &quot;meridians&quot;. Small circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are circles of latitude (or &quot;parallels&quot;). In geometry unrelated to astronomical bodies, geocentric terminology should be used only for illustration and noted as such, unless there is no chance of misunderstanding.

Mathematicians consider a sphere to be a two-dimensional closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space. They draw a distinction between a &quot;sphere&quot; and a &quot;ball&quot;, which is a solid figure, a three-dimensional manifold with boundary that includes the volume contained by the sphere. An &quot;open ball&quot; excludes the sphere itself, while a &quot;closed ball&quot; includes the sphere: a closed ball is the union of the open ball and the sphere, and a sphere is the boundary of a (closed or open) ball. The distinction between &quot;ball&quot; and &quot;sphere&quot; has not always been maintained and especially older mathematical references talk about a sphere as a solid. The distinction between &quot;circle&quot; and &quot;disk&quot; in the plane is similar.

Small spheres or balls are sometimes called &quot;spherules&quot; (e.g., in Martian spherules).

==Equations==
In analytic geometry, a sphere with center and radius is the locus of all points such that
:formula_1
Since it can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial, a sphere is a quadric surface, a type of algebraic surface.

Let be real numbers with and put
:formula_2
Then the equation
:formula_3
has no real points as solutions if formula_4 and is called the equation of an imaginary sphere. If formula_5, the only solution of formula_6 is the point formula_7 and the equation is said to be the equation of a point sphere. Finally, in the case formula_8, formula_6 is an equation of a sphere whose center is formula_10 and whose radius is formula_11.

If in the above equation is zero then is the equation of a plane. Thus, a plane may be thought of as a sphere of infinite radius whose center is a point at infinity.

===Parametric===
A parametric equation for the sphere with radius formula_12 and center formula_13 can be parameterized using trigonometric functions.
:formula_14

The symbols used here are the same as those used in spherical coordinates. is constant, while varies from 0 to and formula_15 varies from 0 to 2.

==Properties==
===Enclosed volume===
In three dimensions, the volume inside a sphere (that is, the volume of a ball, but classically referred to as the volume of a sphere) is
:formula_16
where is the radius and is the diameter of the sphere. Archimedes first derived this formula by showing that the volume inside a sphere is twice the volume between the sphere and the circumscribed cylinder of that sphere (having the height and diameter equal to the diameter of the sphere). This may be proved by inscribing a cone upside down into semi-sphere, noting that the area of a cross section of the cone plus the area of a cross section of the sphere is the same as the area of the cross section of the circumscribing cylinder, and applying Cavalieri&#x27;s principle. This formula can also be derived using integral calculus (i.e., disk integration) to sum the volumes of an infinite number of circular disks of infinitesimally small thickness stacked side by side and centered along the -axis from to , assuming the sphere of radius is centered at the origin.

At any given , the incremental volume () equals the product of the cross-sectional area of the disk at and its thickness ():
:formula_17

The total volume is the summation of all incremental volumes:
:formula_18

In the limit as approaches zero, this equation becomes:
:formula_19

At any given , a right-angled triangle connects , and to the origin; hence, applying the Pythagorean theorem yields:
:formula_20

Using this substitution gives
:formula_21

which can be evaluated to give the result
:formula_22

An alternative formula is found using spherical coordinates, with volume element
:formula_23
so
:formula_24
For most practical purposes, the volume inside a sphere inscribed in a cube can be approximated as 52.4% of the volume of the cube, since , where is the diameter of the sphere and also the length of a side of the cube and  ≈ 0.5236. For example, a sphere with diameter 1 m has 52.4% the volume of a cube with edge length 1m, or about 0.524 m3.

===Surface area===

The surface area of a sphere of radius is:
:formula_25

Archimedes first derived this formula from the fact that the projection to the lateral surface of a circumscribed cylinder is area-preserving. Another approach to obtaining the formula comes from the fact that it equals the derivative of the formula for the volume with respect to because the total volume inside a sphere of radius can be thought of as the summation of the surface area of an infinite number of spherical shells of infinitesimal thickness concentrically stacked inside one another from radius 0 to radius . At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius is simply the product of the surface area at radius and the infinitesimal thickness.
At any given radius , the incremental volume () equals the product of the surface area at radius () and the thickness of a shell ():
:formula_26

The total volume is the summation of all shell volumes:
:formula_27

In the limit as approaches zero this equation becomes:
:formula_28

Substitute :
:formula_29

Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to yields as a function of :
:formula_30

This is generally abbreviated as:
:formula_31
where is now considered to be the fixed radius of the sphere.

Alternatively, the area element on the sphere is given in spherical coordinates by . The total area can thus be obtained by integration:
:formula_32
The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The sphere therefore appears in nature: for example, bubbles and small water drops are roughly spherical because the surface tension locally minimizes surface area.

The surface area relative to the mass of a ball is called the specific surface area and can be expressed from the above stated equations as
:formula_33
where is the density (the ratio of mass to volume).

===Other geometric properties===
A sphere can be constructed as the surface formed by rotating a circle one half revolution about any of its diameters; this is very similar to the traditional definition of a sphere as given in Euclid&#x27;s Elements. Since a circle is a special type of ellipse, a sphere is a special type of ellipsoid of revolution. Replacing the circle with an ellipse rotated about its major axis, the shape becomes a prolate spheroid; rotated about the minor axis, an oblate spheroid.

A sphere is uniquely determined by four points that are not coplanar. More generally, a sphere is uniquely determined by four conditions such as passing through a point, being tangent to a plane, etc. This property is analogous to the property that three non-collinear points determine a unique circle in a plane.

Consequently, a sphere is uniquely determined by (that is, passes through) a circle and a point not in the plane of that circle.

By examining the common solutions of the equations of two spheres, it can be seen that two spheres intersect in a circle and the plane containing that circle is called the radical plane of the intersecting spheres. Although the radical plane is a real plane, the circle may be imaginary (the spheres have no real point in common) or consist of a single point (the spheres are tangent at that point).

The angle between two spheres at a real point of intersection is the dihedral angle determined by the tangent planes to the spheres at that point. Two spheres intersect at the same angle at all points of their circle of intersection. They intersect at right angles (are orthogonal) if and only if the square of the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of the squares of their radii.

====Pencil of spheres====

If and are the equations of two distinct spheres then
:formula_34
is also the equation of a sphere for arbitrary values of the parameters and . The set of all spheres satisfying this equation is called a pencil of spheres determined by the original two spheres. In this definition a sphere is allowed to be a plane (infinite radius, center at infinity) and if both the original spheres are planes then all the spheres of the pencil are planes, otherwise there is only one plane (the radical plane) in the pencil.

===Properties of the sphere===
In their book &quot;Geometry and the Imagination&quot;, David Hilbert and Stephan Cohn-Vossen describe eleven properties of the sphere and discuss whether these properties uniquely determine the sphere. Several properties hold for the plane, which can be thought of as a sphere with infinite radius. These properties are:
#&quot;The points on the sphere are all the same distance from a fixed point. Also, the ratio of the distance of its points from two fixed points is constant.&quot;
#: The first part is the usual definition of the sphere and determines it uniquely. The second part can be easily deduced and follows a similar result of Apollonius of Perga for the circle. This second part also holds for the plane.
#&quot;The contours and plane sections of the sphere are circles.&quot;
#: This property defines the sphere uniquely.
#&quot;The sphere has constant width and constant girth.&quot;
#: The width of a surface is the distance between pairs of parallel tangent planes. Numerous other closed convex surfaces have constant width, for example the Meissner body. The girth of a surface is the circumference of the boundary of its orthogonal projection on to a plane. Each of these properties implies the other.
#&quot;All points of a sphere are umbilics.&quot;
#: At any point on a surface a normal direction is at right angles to the surface because on the sphere these are the lines radiating out from the center of the sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a &quot;normal section,&quot; and the curvature of this curve is the &quot;normal curvature&quot;. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures. Any closed surface will have at least four points called &quot;umbilical points&quot;. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the principal curvatures are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.
#: For the sphere the curvatures of all normal sections are equal, so every point is an umbilic. The sphere and plane are the only surfaces with this property.
#&quot;The sphere does not have a surface of centers.&quot;
#: For a given normal section exists a circle of curvature that equals the sectional curvature, is tangent to the surface, and the center lines of which lie along on the normal line. For example, the two centers corresponding to the maximum and minimum sectional curvatures are called the &quot;focal points&quot;, and the set of all such centers forms the focal surface.
#: For most surfaces the focal surface forms two sheets that are each a surface and meet at umbilical points. Several cases are special:
#: * For channel surfaces one sheet forms a curve and the other sheet is a surface
#: * For cones, cylinders, tori and cyclides both sheets form curves.
#: * For the sphere the center of every osculating circle is at the center of the sphere and the focal surface forms a single point. This property is unique to the sphere.
#&quot;All geodesics of the sphere are closed curves.&quot;
#: Geodesics are curves on a surface that give the shortest distance between two points. They are a generalization of the concept of a straight line in the plane. For the sphere the geodesics are great circles. Many other surfaces share this property.
#&quot;Of all the solids having a given volume, the sphere is the one with the smallest surface area; of all solids having a given surface area, the sphere is the one having the greatest volume.&quot;
#: It follows from isoperimetric inequality. These properties define the sphere uniquely and can be seen in soap bubbles: a soap bubble will enclose a fixed volume, and surface tension minimizes its surface area for that volume. A freely floating soap bubble therefore approximates a sphere (though such external forces as gravity will slightly distort the bubble&#x27;s shape). It can also be seen in planets and stars where gravity minimizes surface area for large celestial bodies.
#&quot;The sphere has the smallest total mean curvature among all convex solids with a given surface area.&quot;
#: The mean curvature is the average of the two principal curvatures, which is constant because the two principal curvatures are constant at all points of the sphere.
#&quot;The sphere has constant mean curvature.&quot;
#: The sphere is the only embedded surface that lacks boundary or singularities with constant positive mean curvature. Other such immersed surfaces as minimal surfaces have constant mean curvature.
#&quot;The sphere has constant positive Gaussian curvature.&quot;
#: Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures. It is an intrinsic property that can be determined by measuring length and angles and is independent of how the surface is embedded in space. Hence, bending a surface will not alter the Gaussian curvature, and other surfaces with constant positive Gaussian curvature can be obtained by cutting a small slit in the sphere and bending it. All these other surfaces would have boundaries, and the sphere is the only surface that lacks a boundary with constant, positive Gaussian curvature. The pseudosphere is an example of a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.
#&quot;The sphere is transformed into itself by a three-parameter family of rigid motions.&quot;
#: Rotating around any axis a unit sphere at the origin will map the sphere onto itself. Any rotation about a line through the origin can be expressed as a combination of rotations around the three-coordinate axis (see Euler angles). Therefore, a three-parameter family of rotations exists such that each rotation transforms the sphere onto itself; this family is the rotation group SO(3). The plane is the only other surface with a three-parameter family of transformations (translations along the - and -axes and rotations around the origin). Circular cylinders are the only surfaces with two-parameter families of rigid motions and the surfaces of revolution and helicoids are the only surfaces with a one-parameter family.

==Treatment by area of mathematics==
===Spherical geometry===

The basic elements of Euclidean plane geometry are points and lines. On the sphere, points are defined in the usual sense. The analogue of the &quot;line&quot; is the geodesic, which is a great circle; the defining characteristic of a great circle is that the plane containing all its points also passes through the center of the sphere. Measuring by arc length shows that the shortest path between two points lying on the sphere is the shorter segment of the great circle that includes the points.

Many theorems from classical geometry hold true for spherical geometry as well, but not all do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry&#x27;s postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180 degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.

Any pair of points on a sphere that lie on a straight line through the sphere&#x27;s center (i.e., the diameter) are called &quot;antipodal points&quot;on the sphere, the distance between them is exactly half the length of the circumference. Any other (i.e., not antipodal) pair of distinct points on a sphere
*lie on a unique great circle,
*segment it into one minor (i.e., shorter) and one major (i.e., longer) arc, and
*have the minor arc&#x27;s length be the &quot;shortest distance&quot; between them on the sphere.

Spherical geometry is a form of elliptic geometry, which together with hyperbolic geometry makes up non-Euclidean geometry.

===Differential geometry===
The sphere is a smooth surface with constant Gaussian curvature at each point equal to . As per Gauss&#x27;s Theorema Egregium, this curvature is independent of the sphere&#x27;s embedding in 3-dimensional space. Also following from Gauss, a sphere cannot be mapped to a plane while maintaining both areas and angles. Therefore, any map projection introduces some form of distortion.

A sphere of radius has area element formula_35. This can be found from the volume element in spherical coordinates with held constant.

A sphere of any radius centered at zero is an integral surface of the following differential form:
:formula_36
This equation reflects that the position vector and tangent plane at a point are always orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, the outward-facing normal vector is equal to the position vector scaled by .

In Riemannian geometry, the filling area conjecture states that the hemisphere is the optimal (least area) isometric filling of the Riemannian circle.

===Topology===
Remarkably, it is possible to turn an ordinary sphere inside out in a three-dimensional space with possible self-intersections but without creating any creases, in a process called sphere eversion.

The antipodal quotient of the sphere is the surface called the real projective plane, which can also be thought of as the Northern Hemisphere with antipodal points of the equator identified.

==Curves on a sphere ==

===Circles===

Circles on the sphere are, like circles in the plane, made up of all points a certain distance from a fixed point on the sphere. The intersection of a sphere and a plane is a circle, a point, or empty. Great circles are the intersection of the sphere with a plane passing through the center of a sphere: others are called small circles.

More complicated surfaces may intersect a sphere in circles, too: the intersection of a sphere with a surface of revolution whose axis contains the center of the sphere (are &quot;coaxial&quot;) consists of circles and/or points if not empty. For example, the diagram to the right shows the intersection of a sphere and a cylinder, which consists of two circles. If the cylinder radius were that of the sphere, the intersection would be a single circle. If the cylinder radius were larger than that of the sphere, the intersection would be empty.

===Loxodrome===

In navigation, a &quot;loxodrome&quot; or &quot;rhumb line&quot; is a path whose bearing, the angle between its tangent and due North, is constant. Loxodromes project to straight lines under the Mercator projection. Two special cases are the meridians which are aligned directly North–South and parallels which are aligned directly East–West. For any other bearing, a loxodrome spirals infinitely around each pole. For the Earth modeled as a sphere, or for a general sphere given a spherical coordinate system, such a loxodrome is a kind of spherical spiral.

===Clelia curves===

Another kind of spherical spiral is the Clelia curve, for which the longitude (or azimuth) formula_15 and the colatitude (or polar angle) formula_38 are in a linear relationship, . Clelia curves project to straight lines under the equirectangular projection. Viviani&#x27;s curve () is a special case. Clelia curves approximate the ground track of satellites in polar orbit.

===Spherical conics===

The analog of a conic section on the sphere is a spherical conic, a quartic curve which can be defined in several equivalent ways.
*The intersection of a sphere with a quadratic cone whose vertex is the sphere center
*The intersection of a sphere with an elliptic or hyperbolic cylinder whose axis passes through the sphere center
*The locus of points whose sum or difference of great-circle distances from a pair of foci is a constant

Many theorems relating to planar conic sections also extend to spherical conics.

===Intersection of a sphere with a more general surface===
If a sphere is intersected by another surface, there may be more complicated spherical curves.
;Example: sphere–cylinder

The intersection of the sphere with equation formula_39 and the cylinder with equation formula_40 is not just one or two circles. It is the solution of the non-linear system of equations
:formula_41
:formula_42
(see implicit curve and the diagram)

==Generalizations==
===Ellipsoids===
An ellipsoid is a sphere that has been stretched or compressed in one or more directions. More exactly, it is the image of a sphere under an affine transformation. An ellipsoid bears the same relationship to the sphere that an ellipse does to a circle.

===Dimensionality===

Spheres can be generalized to spaces of any number of dimensions. For any natural number , an &quot;-sphere,&quot; often denoted , is the set of points in ()-dimensional Euclidean space that are at a fixed distance from a central point of that space, where is, as before, a positive real number. In particular:
*: a 0-sphere consists of two discrete points, and 
*: a 1-sphere is a circle of radius &quot;r&quot;
*: a 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere
*: a 3-sphere is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

Spheres for are sometimes called hyperspheres.

The -sphere of unit radius centered at the origin is denoted and is often referred to as &quot;the&quot; -sphere. The ordinary sphere is a 2-sphere, because it is a 2-dimensional surface which is embedded in 3-dimensional space.

In topology, the -sphere is an example of a compact topological manifold without boundary. A topological sphere need not be smooth; if it is smooth, it need not be diffeomorphic to the Euclidean sphere (an exotic sphere).

The sphere is the inverse image of a one-point set under the continuous function , so it is closed; is also bounded, so it is compact by the Heine–Borel theorem.

===Metric spaces===

More generally, in a metric space , the sphere of center and radius is the set of points such that .

If the center is a distinguished point that is considered to be the origin of , as in a normed space, it is not mentioned in the definition and notation. The same applies for the radius if it is taken to equal one, as in the case of a unit sphere.

Unlike a ball, even a large sphere may be an empty set. For example, in with Euclidean metric, a sphere of radius is nonempty only if can be written as sum of squares of integers.

An octahedron is a sphere in taxicab geometry, and a cube is a sphere in geometry using the Chebyshev distance.

==History==
The geometry of the sphere was studied by the Greeks. &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot; defines the sphere in book XI, discusses various properties of the sphere in book XII, and shows how to inscribe the five regular polyhedra within a sphere in book XIII. Euclid does not include the area and volume of a sphere, only a theorem that the volume of a sphere varies as the third power of its diameter, probably due to Eudoxus of Cnidus. The volume and area formulas were first determined in Archimedes&#x27;s &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot; by the method of exhaustion. Zenodorus was the first to state that, for a given surface area, the sphere is the solid of maximum volume.

Archimedes wrote about the problem of dividing a sphere into segments whose volumes are in a given ratio, but did not solve it. A solution by means of the parabola and hyperbola was given by Dionysodorus. A similar problemto construct a segment equal in volume to a given segment, and in surface to another segmentwas solved later by al-Quhi.

<doc id="27861" wikidata="Q62132" url="?curid=27861" title="Sápmi">
<text>() is the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Sámi people. Sápmi includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia, also known as the &quot;Cap of the North&quot;.

The region stretches over four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. To the north, it is bounded by the Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, and White Sea. Lapland () has been a historical term for areas inhabited by the Sami based on the older term &quot;Lapp&quot; for its inhabitants, a term which is now considered outdated or pejorative. Norwegian Sápmi was historically called &quot;Finnmǫrk&quot;, a name used for the county Finnmark.

Sápmi overlaps with several other national, cultural and administrative regions. In practice, most of the Sámi population is concentrated in a few traditional areas in the northernmost part of Sápmi, such as Kautokeino and Karasjok. Culturally, Inari is considered one of the centres of Sámi culture, and because of that, it is also widely known as the &quot;capital of Sámi culture&quot;.

==Etymology==
Sápmi (and corresponding terms in other Sami languages) refers to both the Sami land and the Sami people. The word &quot;Sámi&quot; is the accusative-genitive form of the noun &quot;Sápmi&quot;—making the name&#x27;s (&quot;Sámi olbmot&quot;) meaning &quot;people of Sápmi&quot;. The origin of the word is speculated to be related to the Baltic word &quot;*žēmē&quot;, meaning &quot;land&quot;. Also &quot;Häme&quot;, the Finnish name for Tavastia, a historical province of Finland, is thought to have the same origin, and the same word is at least speculated to be the origin of &quot;&quot;, the Finnish name for Finland.
Sápmi is the name in Northern Sami, the most widely spoken of the Sami languages. In other languages, the following terms are used:
* 
* 
* 

In modern Swedish and Norwegian, Sápmi is known as either &quot;Sapmi&quot; or &quot;Sameland&quot;. In older Swedish, it was known as &quot;Lappmarken&quot; or &quot;Lappland&quot;. Norwegian Sápmi was historically called &quot;Finnmǫrk&quot;, a name used for the modern county Finnmark that covers key parts of historical Sápmi. Some English language sources have transferred &quot;Lapland&quot; (or Lappland) to areas in Norway notably in the context of tourism marketing. Originally these names referred to all of Sápmi, but subsequently became applied to areas &quot;exclusively&quot; inhabited by the Sami.

&quot;Lappland&quot; (Laponia) became the name of Sweden&#x27;s northernmost province (&quot;landskap&quot;) which in 1809 was split into one part that remained Swedish and one part falling under Finland (which became part of the Russian Empire). &quot;Lappland&quot; survives as the name of both Sweden&#x27;s northernmost province and Finland&#x27;s, also containing part of the historical province of Ostrobothnia.

In the 17th century, Johannes Schefferus assumed the etymology of the term &quot;Lapland&quot; to be related to the Swedish word for &quot;running&quot;, (cognate with English, &quot;to leap&quot;). The terms &quot;Lapp&quot; and &quot;Lappland&quot; are now regarded as outdated or offensive by many Sami people, who prefer the area&#x27;s name in their language &quot;&quot;, because over time the term &quot;Lapp&quot; has acquired the pejorative connotation of &quot;silly&quot;, &quot;uneducated&quot;, &quot;backwards&quot;, etc. in the major languages of the Scandinavian countries that include Sapmi.

In older Norwegian, Sápmi was known as &quot;Finnmork&quot; or &quot;Finnmark&quot;; which is now the name of Norway&#x27;s northernmost county. Northern Norway and Murmansk Oblast are sometimes marketed as &quot;Norwegian Lapland&quot; and &quot;Russian Lapland&quot;, respectively.

==Geography==

===Landscape===
The largest part of Sápmi lies north of the Arctic Circle. The western portion is an area of fjords, deep valleys, glaciers and mountains, the highest point being Mount Kebnekaise (). The Swedish part of Sápmi is characterized by great rivers running from the northwest to the southeast. From the former Norwegian county of Troms and Finnmark and eastward, the terrain is that of a low plateau with many marshes and lakes, the largest of which is Lake Inari in Finnish Lapland. The extreme northeastern section lies within the tundra region, but it does not have permafrost. In the 19th century, scientific expeditions to Sápmi were undertaken, for instance by Jöns Svanberg.

===Climate===
The climate is subarctic/tundra and vegetation is sparse, except in the densely forested southern portion. The mountainous west coast has significantly milder winters and more precipitation than the large areas east of the mountain chain. North of the Arctic Circle polar nights characterize the winter season and the midnight sun the summer season—both phenomena are longer the further north you go. Traditionally, the Sami divide the year into &quot;eight&quot; seasons instead of four.

In Inari, the climate is warm-end subarctic, with summer highs of , and winter lows of . The average winter sees 131 days of snowfall, with the first flakes falling to the ground in September. Snow cover lasts about two-thirds of the year and may persist past the last flake and even the last frost.

Even without permafrost or a true tundra climate, much of Sápmi is arctic moorland with stunted, scattered trees.

===Natural resources===
Reindeers, wolves, bears, and birds are the main forms of animal life, in addition to a myriad of insects in the short summer. Sea and river fisheries abound in the region. Steamers are operated on some of the lakes, and many ports are ice-free throughout the year. All ports along the Norwegian Sea in the west and the Barents Sea in the northeast to Murmansk are ice-free all year. The Gulf of Bothnia usually freezes over in winter. The ocean floor to the north and west of Sápmi has deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Sápmi contains valuable mineral deposits, particularly iron ore in Sweden, copper in Norway, and nickel and apatite in Russia.

===Cultural subdivisions===
====East Sápmi====
&quot;East Sápmi&quot; consists of the Kola peninsula and the Lake Inari region and is home to the eastern Sami languages. While being the most heavily populated part of Sápmi, this is also the region where the Indigenous population and their culture are weakest. Corresponds to the regions marked 6 through 9 on the map below.

====Central Sápmi====
&quot;Central Sápmi&quot; consists of the western part of Finland&#x27;s Sami Domicile Area, the parts of Norway north of the Saltfjellet mountains and areas on the Swedish side corresponding to this. Central Sápmi is the region where Sami culture is strongest and home to North Sami—the most widely used Sami language. In the southernmost part of this subregion, however, Sami culture is rather weak—this is where the moribund &quot;Bithun&quot; Sami language is used. The areas around the Tysfjorden fjord in Norway and the river Lule in Sweden are home to the &quot;Julev&quot; Sami language, one of the more widely used Sami languages. These correspond to the regions marked 3 through 5 on the map below.

====South Sápmi====
&quot;South Sápmi&quot; consists of the areas south of Saltfjellet and corresponding areas in Sweden and is home to the southern languages. In this area, Sami culture is mostly visible inland and on the coast of the Baltic Sea, and the languages are spoken by few. Corresponds to the regions marked 1 and 2 on the map below to the southeast of region 1 in Sweden.

====Lapland====
The inner parts of Sápmi are often referred to as Lappi. The name is also found on the Russian side as &quot;Laplandige&quot; (the name of a natural reservation) and the Norwegian landscape of Finnmark is sometimes titled the &quot;Norwegian Lapland&quot;, especially by the travel industry. &quot;Lappi-&quot; appears as a common component of place names throughout central and southern Finland as well; in many cases, it probably refers to earlier Sami presence, though in some cases the underlying meaning may be mere &quot;periphery&quot; or &quot;outlying district&quot;.

====&quot;Sides&quot;====
Finally, Sápmi may also be subdivided into cultural regions according to the state&#x27;s borders, which affects daily life for people no matter their ethnicity. These regions are commonly referred to as &quot;sides&quot; by Sami, for example, &quot;the Norwegian side&quot; (&quot;norgga bealli&quot;) or &quot;the Finnish side&quot; (&quot;suoma bealli&quot;).

==Sámi languages==

The Saamic languages are the region&#x27;s main minority languages and its oldest attested languages. They belong to the Uralic language family and are most closely related to the Finnic languages. Many Sami languages are mutually unintelligible, but the languages originally formed a dialect continuum stretching southwest and northeast, so that a message could hypothetically be passed between Sami speakers from one end to the other and be understood by all. Today, however, many of the languages are moribund and thus there are &quot;gaps&quot; in the original continuum.

On the map to the right numbers indicate Sámi languages. Of these languages, Northern Sámi is by far the most vital; whereas Ume Sámi and Pite Sámi are critically endangered. Kemi Sámi and Ter Sámi are extinct.

North Sami is subdivided into three main dialects: West, East, and Coast. The written standard is based on the Western dialect.

==Demography==
It is difficult to give estimates of inhabitants since Sápmi is not precisely defined. It is also difficult to account for the distribution of ethnic groups as many people have double or multiple ethnic identities—both seeing themselves as members of the majority population and being part of one or more minority groups.

Different criteria are set when calculating the number of Sámi, but the number is generally between 80,000 and 100,000. Many live in areas outside Sápmi such as Oulu, Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki. Some Sámi people have migrated to places outside the Sápmi vernacular region, such as Canada and the United States.

Groups of Sámi people have settled in the northern parts of Minnesota.

The Sami are a small minorities in the Russian part of Sápmi.

As of 2016, 13,226 people inhabited the Sami native region of Finnish Lapland many of whom are Sami.

==Politics==
Norway, Finland and Sweden all have Sámi Parliaments that to varying degrees are involved in governing the region—though mostly they only have authority over the matters of the Sámi citizens of the states in which they are situated.

=== Sámi Parliaments ===

Every Norwegian citizen registered as a Sámi has the right to vote in the elections for the Sámi Parliament of Norway. Elections are held every four years by direct vote from seven constituencies covering all of Norway (six of which are in Sápmi) and run parallel to the general Norwegian parliamentary elections. This is the Sámi Parliament with the most influence over any part of Sápmi, as it is involved in the autonomy established by the Finnmark Act. The parliament is in the village of Kárášjohka and its current president is Silje Karine Muotka from the Norwegian Sámi Association.

The Sámi Parliament of Sweden, situated in Kiruna (), is elected by a general vote which all registered Sámi citizens of Sweden may attend. The current president is Lars-Anders Baer.

Voting for elections to the Sámi Parliament of Finland is restricted to inhabitants of the Sámi Domicile Area. The Parliament is in Inari (), and its current president is Tuomas Aslak Juuso.

In Russia, there is no Sámi Parliament. Two Sámi organisations are members of the national umbrella organisation of Indigenous peoples, the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), and represent the Russian Sámi in the Sámi Council. RAIPON is represented in Russia&#x27;s Public Chamber by Pavel Sulyandziga. On 14 December 2008, the first Congress of the Russian Sámi took place. The Conference decided to demand the formation of a Russian Sámi Parliament, to be elected by the local Sámi. A suggestion to have the Russian Federation pick representatives for the Parliament was voted down with a clear majority. The Congress also chose a Council of Representatives that was to work for the establishment of a parliament and otherwise represent the Russian Sámi. It is headed by Valentina Sovkina.

=== Sámi Parliamentary Council ===
On 2 March 2000, the Sámi parliaments of Norway and Finland founded the Sámi Parliamentary Council, and the Sámi Parliament of Sweden joined two years later. Each parliament sends seven representatives, and observers are sent from the Sámi organisations of Russia and the Sámi Council. The Sámi Parliamentary Council discuss cross-border cooperation, hands out the annual &quot;Gollegiella&quot; language development award, and represents the Sámi people abroad.

=== Saami Council ===
In addition to the parliaments and their common council, there is a Saami Council based on Saami organisations. This council also organises interstate cooperation between the Saami, and also often represents the Saami in international fora such as the Barents Region. This organisation is older than the Parliamentary Council, but not connected to the parliaments except that some of the NGOs double as party lists in Sami parliament elections.

===Russia===
The Russian side of Sápmi is within Murmansk Oblast. &quot;Oblasts&quot; are governed by popularly elected parliaments and formally headed by governors. The governors are nominated by the president of Russia and accepted or rejected by the local parliaments. However, should the parliament refuse to accept the president&#x27;s nominee, the president is entitled to dissolve parliament and call local elections.

Murmansk Oblast covers the Kola Peninsula and is home to Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle and in the Sápmi. It is subdivided into several districts, of which the geographically largest is Lovozersky District. This is also part of Russia where the Sami population is most numerous and visible.

The Lapland Nature Reserve (, Laplandskiy zapovednik) is a Russian &quot;zapovednik&quot; (strict nature reserve) in Murmansk Oblast, above the Arctic Circle. Its administrative centre is the rural locality of Laplandsky Zapovednik. First established between 1930-1951 and reestablished in 1957, the reserve protects an area of to the northwest of Lake Imandra, including 86 km2 of inland water.

===Norway===
The counties of Norway are governed by popularly elected assemblies, headed by county mayors. Formally, the counties are headed by county governors, but in practice, these have limited influence today.

The largest of Norway&#x27;s landscapes, Finnmárku (Northern Sami) or Finnmark (Norwegian) county, is in Sápmi and has a special form of autonomy: 95% (about ) of the area is owned by the Finnmark Estate. The board of the Estate consists of many representatives from the Sami Parliament of Norway and Finnmark&#x27;s county council. The two institutions appoint leaders of the board alternately. The administrative centre of Finnmárku (Finnmark) is Čáhcesuolu or Vadsø, in the far east of the county. The current county governor is Runar Sjåstad from the Norwegian Labour Party.

Romsa (or Troms) county is southwest of Finnmárku. Its administrative centre is the city after which the county is named, Romsa or Tromsø. Romsa is North Norway&#x27;s biggest city and Sápmi&#x27;s biggest city after Murmansk. The current &quot;fylkesordfører&quot; is Terje Olsen from the Conservative Party. A similar solution to the Finnmark Estate, Hålogalandsallmenningen, has been proposed for Romsa County and its southern neighbour Nordlánda.

Nordland covers a long strip of coast that includes both North Sami, Julev Sami, Bithun Sami, and South Sami areas. Its administrative centre is Bådåddjo or Bodø. The current county governor is Mariette Korsrud from the Norwegian Labour Party.

The southernmost parts of Norwegian Sapmi lie in Trøndelag county (mostly the northern part of the county). The administrative centre is Steinkjer. The largest city in Trøndelag is Trondheim. Trondheim is outside Sápmi but is well known for being the site of the first international Sami conference in February 1917. The county governor is Frank Jenssen from the Conservative Party.

===Sweden===
Lapland is a large northwestern province of Sweden, wholly within Sápmi. The traditional provinces of Sweden are cultural and historical entities; for administrative and political purposes they were replaced by the counties of Sweden (län) in 1634.

Five counties are wholly or partially within Sápmi. &quot;Län&quot; is formally governed by the &quot;landshövding&quot;, who is an envoy of the government and runs the government-appointed &quot;länsstyrelse&quot; that coordinates administration with national political goals for the county. Much of county politics is run by the county council or &quot;landsting&quot;, which is elected by the inhabitants of the county; but the counties&#x27; top positions are still determined by those who win the general elections of Sweden.

Norrbotten County is mostly covered by Sápmi, although the lower Tornedalen region is often excluded. The administrative centre is Luleå in the Julev Sami area (Norrbotten includes North, Julev and Bithun areas). Current landshövding is Per-Ola Eriksson of the Centre Party.

Sápmi covers the interior majority of Västerbotten County, which are Ubmeje and South Sami regions. The administrative centre is Umeå, and the current landshövding is Chris Heister from the conservative Moderate Party.

Västernorrland County is an old part of Sapmi and still is. There are a lot of Sami on the coast of the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Bothnia).

Jämtland County is sometimes considered a part of the Sápmi cultural region and is a South Sami county. The administrative centre is Östersund. Current landshövding is Jöran Hägglund from the centre party Centerpartiet.

===Finland===
Finland is subdivided into nineteen regions (&quot;maakunta&quot;). The regions are governed by regional councils, which are generally forums of cooperation between the municipalities and are not elected by direct popular vote. Lapland (Lappi) is the northernmost of the regions, which stretches farther south than Sápmi. The administrative centre is Rovaniemi. North Sami, Skolt Sami, and Aanaar Sami are Indigenous to the region.

Four municipalities in the northern part of Finnish Lapland constitute the Sami Domicile Area, &quot;Sámiid Ruovttoguovlu&quot;, a region that is autonomous on issues regarding Sami culture and language.

===Coats of Arms of Sami Communities===
== Sports ==
The region has its own football team, the Sápmi football team, which is organised by FA Sápmi. It is a member of ConIFA and the host of the 2014 ConIFA World Football Cup. The Sápmi football team won the 2006 VIVA World Cup and hosted the 2008 event.

The Tour de Barents is a cross-country skiing race held in the region.

<text>Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia. Located on Australia&#x27;s east coast, the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about 80 km (50 mi) from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west, and about 80 km (50 mi) from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and the Hawkesbury River in the north and north-west, to the Royal National Park and Macarthur in the south and south-west. Greater Sydney consists of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. Residents of the city are colloquially known as &quot;Sydneysiders&quot;. The estimated population in June 2023 was 5,450,496, which is about 66% of the state&#x27;s population. The city&#x27;s nicknames include the Emerald City and the Harbour City.

There is evidence that Aboriginal Australians inhabited the Greater Sydney region at least 30,000 years ago, and their engravings and cultural sites are common. The of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug, Dharawal and Eora. During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. After World War II, Sydney experienced mass migration and by 2021 over 40 per cent of the population was born overseas. Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities. It is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world. Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity, Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in education, finance, manufacturing and tourism. The University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are ranked 18th and 19th in the world respectively.

Sydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2003 Rugby World Cup Final, and the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final. The city is among the top fifteen most-visited, with millions of tourists coming each year to see the city&#x27;s landmarks. The city has over of nature reserves and parks, and its notable natural features include Sydney Harbour and Royal National Park. The Sydney Harbour Bridge and the World Heritage-listed Sydney Opera House are major tourist attractions. Central Station is the hub of Sydney&#x27;s suburban train, metro and light rail networks and longer-distance services. The main passenger airport serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the world&#x27;s oldest continually operating airports.

==Toponymy==
In 1788, Captain Arthur Phillip, the first governor of New South Wales, named the cove where the first British settlement was established Sydney Cove after Home Secretary Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney. The cove was called &quot;Warrane&quot; by the Aboriginal inhabitants. Phillip considered naming the settlement Albion, but this name was never officially used. By 1790 Phillip and other officials were regularly calling the township Sydney. Sydney was declared a city in 1842.

The Gadigal (Cadigal) clan, whose territory stretches along the southern shore of Port Jackson from South Head to Darling Harbour, are the traditional owners of the land on which the British settlement was initially established, and call their territory &quot;Gadi&quot; (&quot;Cadi&quot;). Aboriginal clan names within the Sydney region were often formed by adding the suffix &quot;-gal&quot; to a word denoting the name for their territory, a specific place in their territory, a food source, or totem. Greater Sydney covers the traditional lands of 28 known Aboriginal clans.

==History==

===First inhabitants of the region===
The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were Aboriginal Australians who had migrated from southeast Asia via northern Australia. Flaked pebbles found in Western Sydney&#x27;s gravel sediments might indicate human occupation from 45,000 to 50,000 years ago, while radiocarbon dating has shown evidence of human activity in the region from around 30,000 years ago. Prior to the arrival of the British, there were 4,000 to 8,000 Aboriginal people in the greater Sydney region.

The inhabitants subsisted on fishing, hunting, and gathering plants and shellfish. The diet of the coastal clans was more reliant on seafood whereas hinterland clans ate more forest animals and plants. The clans had distinctive equipment and weapons mostly made of stone, wood, plant materials, bone and shell. They also differed in their body decorations, hairstyles, songs and dances. Aboriginal clans had a rich ceremonial life, part of a belief system centring on ancestral, totemic and supernatural beings. People from different clans and language groups came together to participate in initiation and other ceremonies. These occasions fostered trade, marriages and clan alliances.

The earliest British settlers recorded the word &#x27;Eora&#x27; as an Aboriginal term meaning either &#x27;people&#x27; or &#x27;from this place&#x27;. The clans of the Sydney area occupied land with traditional boundaries. There is debate, however, about which group or nation these clans belonged to, and the extent of differences in language and rites. The major groups were the coastal Eora people, the Dharug (Darug) occupying the inland area from Parramatta to the Blue Mountains, and the Dharawal people south of Botany Bay. Darginung and Gundungurra languages were spoken on the fringes of the Sydney area.
The first meeting between Aboriginals and British explorers occurred on 29 April 1770 when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay (Kamay) and encountered the Gweagal clan. Two Gweagal men opposed the landing party and one was shot and wounded. Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week, collecting water, timber, fodder and botanical specimens and exploring the surrounding area. Cook sought to establish relations with the Aboriginal population without success.

=== Convict town (1788–1840) ===
 Britain had been sending convicts to its American colonies for most of the eighteenth century, and the loss of these colonies in 1783 was the impetus to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay. Proponents of colonisation also pointed to the strategic importance of a new base in the Asia-Pacific region and its potential to provide much-needed timber and flax for the navy.

The First Fleet of 11 ships under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788. It comprised more than a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts. The fleet soon moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. The colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788. Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour, which Philip described as &quot;the finest Harbour in the World ... Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security&quot;.

The settlement was planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and shipbuilding were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated. However, the soil around the settlement proved poor and the first crops failed, leading to several years of hunger and strict rationing. The food crisis was relieved with the arrival of the Second Fleet in mid-1790 and the Third Fleet in 1791. Former convicts received small grants of land, and government and private farms spread to the more fertile lands around Parramatta, Windsor and Camden on the Cumberland Plain. By 1804, the colony was self-sufficient in food.

A smallpox epidemic in April 1789 killed about half the region&#x27;s Indigenous population. In November 1790 Bennelong led a group of survivors of the Sydney clans into the settlement, establishing a continuous presence of Aboriginal Australians in settled Sydney.

Phillip had been given no instructions for urban development, but in July 1788 submitted a plan for the new town at Sydney Cove. It included a wide central avenue, a permanent Government House, law courts, hospital and other public buildings, but no provision for warehouses, shops, or other commercial buildings. Phillip promptly ignored his own plan, and unplanned development became a feature of Sydney&#x27;s topography.After Phillip&#x27;s departure in December 1792, the colony&#x27;s military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods from visiting ships. Former convicts engaged in trade and opened small businesses. Soldiers and former convicts built houses on Crown land, with or without official permission, in what was now commonly called Sydney town. Governor William Bligh (180608) imposed restrictions on commerce and ordered the demolition of buildings erected on Crown land, including some owned by past and serving military officers. The resulting conflict culminated in the Rum Rebellion of 1808, in which Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie (18101821) played a leading role in the development of Sydney and New South Wales, establishing a bank, a currency and a hospital. He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches, and public buildings. Parramatta Road, linking Sydney and Parramatta, was opened in 1811, and a road across the Blue Mountains was completed in 1815, opening the way for large-scale farming and grazing west of the Great Dividing Range.

Following the departure of Macquarie, official policy encouraged the emigration of free British settlers to New South Wales. Immigration to the colony increased from 900 free settlers in 1826–30 to 29,000 in 1836–40, many of whom settled in Sydney. By the 1840s Sydney exhibited a geographic divide between poor and working-class residents living west of the Tank Stream in areas such as The Rocks, and the more affluent residents living to its east. Free settlers, free-born residents and former convicts now represented the vast majority of the population of Sydney, leading to increasing public agitation for responsible government and an end to transportation. Transportation to New South Wales ceased in 1840.

==== Conflict on the Cumberland Plain ====
In 1804, Irish convicts led around 300 rebels in the Castle Hill Rebellion, an attempt to march on Sydney, commandeer a ship, and sail to freedom. Poorly armed, and with their leader Philip Cunningham captured, the main body of insurgents were routed by about 100 troops and volunteers at Rouse Hill. At least 39 convicts were killed in the uprising and subsequent executions.

As the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the Hawkesbury River, north-west of Sydney, conflict between the settlers and the Darug people intensified, reaching a peak from 1794 to 1810. Bands of Darug people, led by Pemulwuy and later by his son Tedbury, burned crops, killed livestock and raided settler stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the colonial frontier expanded. A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in 1795. The death toll from 1794 to 1800 was 26 settlers and up to 200 Darug.

Conflict again erupted from 1814 to 1816 with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south-west of Sydney. Following the deaths of several settlers, Governor Macquarie dispatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands, culminating in the Appin massacre (April 1816) in which at least 14 Aboriginal people were killed.

=== Colonial city (1841–1900) ===
The New South Wales Legislative Council became a semi-elected body in 1842. Sydney was declared a city the same year, and a governing council established, elected on a restrictive property franchise.The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 initially caused economic disruption as men moved to the goldfields. Melbourne soon overtook Sydney as Australia&#x27;s largest city, leading to an enduring rivalry between the two. However, increased immigration from overseas and wealth from gold exports increased demand for housing, consumer goods, services and urban amenities. The New South Wales government also stimulated growth by investing heavily in railways, trams, roads, ports, telegraph, schools and urban services. The population of Sydney and its suburbs grew from 95,600 in 1861 to 386,900 in 1891. The city developed many of its characteristic features. The growing population packed into rows of terrace houses in narrow streets. New public buildings of sandstone abounded, including at the University of Sydney (1854–61), the Australian Museum (1858–66), the Town Hall (1868–88), and the General Post Office (1866–92). Elaborate coffee palaces and hotels were erected. Daylight bathing at Sydney&#x27;s beaches was banned, but segregated bathing at designated ocean baths was popular.

Drought, the winding down of public works and a financial crisis led to economic depression in Sydney throughout most of the 1890s. Meanwhile, the Sydney-based premier of New South Wales, George Reid, became a key figure in the process of federation.

=== State capital (1901–present) ===

When the six colonies federated on 1 January 1901, Sydney became the capital of the State of New South Wales. The spread of bubonic plague in 1900 prompted the state government to modernise the wharves and demolish inner-city slums. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more Sydney males volunteer for the armed forces than the Commonwealth authorities could process, and helped reduce unemployment. Those returning from the war in 1918 were promised &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot; in new suburbs such as Daceyville and Matraville. &quot;Garden suburbs&quot; and mixed industrial and residential developments also grew along the rail and tram corridors. The population reached one million in 1926, after Sydney had regained its position as the most populous city in Australia. The government created jobs with massive public projects such as the electrification of the Sydney rail network and building the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Sydney was more severely affected by the Great Depression of the 1930s than regional New South Wales or Melbourne. New building almost came to a standstill, and by 1933 the unemployment rate for male workers was 28 per cent, but over 40 per cent in working class areas such as Alexandria and Redfern. Many families were evicted from their homes and shanty towns grew along coastal Sydney and Botany Bay, the largest being &quot;Happy Valley&quot; at La Perouse. The Depression also exacerbated political divisions. In March 1932, when populist Labor premier Jack Lang attempted to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge he was upstaged by Francis de Groot of the far-right New Guard, who slashed the ribbon with a sabre.

In January 1938, Sydney celebrated the Empire Games and the sesquicentenary of European settlement in Australia. One journalist wrote, &quot;Golden beaches. Sun tanned men and maidens...Red-roofed villas terraced above the blue waters of the harbour...Even Melbourne seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney&#x27;s sub-tropical splendours.&quot; A congress of the &quot;Aborigines of Australia&quot; declared 26 January &quot;A Day of Mourning&quot; for &quot;the whiteman&#x27;s seizure of our country.&quot;

With the outbreak of Second World War in 1939, Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development. Unemployment virtually disappeared and women moved into jobs previously typically reserved for males. Sydney was attacked by Japanese submarines in May and June 1942 with 21 killed. Households built air raid shelters and performed drills. Military establishments in response to World War II in Australia included the Garden Island Tunnel System, the only tunnel warfare complex in Sydney, and the heritage-listed military fortification systems Bradleys Head Fortification Complex and Middle Head Fortifications, which were part of a total defence system for Sydney Harbour.

A post-war immigration and baby boom saw a rapid increase in Sydney&#x27;s population and the spread of low-density housing in suburbs throughout the Cumberland Plain. Immigrantsmostly from Britain and continental Europeand their children accounted for over three-quarters of Sydney&#x27;s population growth between 1947 and 1971. The newly created Cumberland County Council oversaw low-density residential developments, the largest at Green Valley and Mount Druitt. Older residential centres such as Parramatta, Bankstown and Liverpool became suburbs of the metropolis. Manufacturing, protected by high tariffs, employed over a third of the workforce from 1945 to the 1960s. However, as the long post-war economic boom progressed, retail and other service industries became the main source of new jobs.

An estimated one million onlookers, most of the city&#x27;s population, watched Queen Elizabeth II land in 1954 at Farm Cove where Captain Phillip had raised the Union Jack 165 years earlier, commencing her Australian Royal Tour. It was the first time a reigning monarch stepped onto Australian soil.

Increasing high-rise development in Sydney and the expansion of suburbs beyond the &quot;green belt&quot; envisaged by the planners of the 1950s resulted in community protests. In the early 1970s, trade unions and resident action groups imposed green bans on development projects in historic areas such as The Rocks. Federal, State and local governments introduced heritage and environmental legislation. The Sydney Opera House was also controversial for its cost and disputes between architect Jørn Utzon and government officials. However, soon after it opened in 1973 it became a major tourist attraction and symbol of the city. The progressive reduction in tariff protection from 1974 began the transformation of Sydney from a manufacturing centre to a &quot;world city&quot;. From the 1980s, overseas immigration grew rapidly, with Asia, the Middle East and Africa becoming major sources. By 2021, the population of Sydney was over 5.2 million, with 40% of the population born overseas. China and India overtook England as the largest source countries for overseas-born residents.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Sydney is a coastal basin with the Tasman Sea to the east, the Blue Mountains to the west, the Hawkesbury River to the north, and the Woronora Plateau to the south.

Sydney spans two geographic regions. The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat. The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys. The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed; it was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches became more heavily populated. Seventy surf beaches can be found along its coastline, with Bondi Beach being the most famous.

The Nepean River wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching Broken Bay. Most of Sydney&#x27;s water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River. The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs into Port Jackson. The southern parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River into Botany Bay.

There is no single definition of the boundaries of Sydney. The Australian Statistical Geography Standard definition of Greater Sydney covers and includes the local government areas of Central Coast in the north, Hawkesbury in the north-west, Blue Mountains in the west, Sutherland Shire in the south, and Wollondilly in the south-west. The local government area of the City of Sydney covers about 26 square kilometres from Garden island in the east to Bicentennial Park in the west, and south to the suburbs of Alexandria and Rosebery.

===Geology===

Sydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks (typically found in the Prospect dolerite intrusion, west of Sydney). The Sydney Basin was formed in the early Triassic period. The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was laid down between 360 and 200 million years ago. The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds. The continental shelf of Australia is only away from the coast of Sydney. 

The Sydney Basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs, beaches, and estuaries. Deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region. The rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours. Port Jackson, better known as Sydney Harbour, is one such ria. Sydney features two major soil types: sandy soils (which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone) and clay (which are from shales and volcanic rocks), though some soils may be a mixture of the two.

Directly overlying the older Hawkesbury sandstone is the Wianamatta shale, a geological feature found in western Sydney that was deposited in connection with a large river delta during the Middle Triassic. The Wianamatta shale generally comprises fine grained sedimentary rocks such as shales, mudstones, ironstones, siltstones and laminites, with less common sandstone units. The Wianamatta Group is made up of Bringelly Shale, Minchinbury Sandstone and Ashfield Shale.

===Ecology===
The most prevalent plant communities in the Sydney region are grassy woodlands (i.e. savannas) and some pockets of dry sclerophyll forests, which consist of eucalyptus trees, casuarinas, melaleucas, corymbias and angophoras, with shrubs (typically wattles, callistemons, grevilleas and banksias), and a semi-continuous grass in the understory. The plants in this community tend to have rough, spiky leaves due to low soil fertility. Sydney also features a few areas of wet sclerophyll forests in the wetter, elevated areas in the north and northeast. These forests are defined by straight, tall tree canopies with a moist understory of soft-leaved shrubs, tree ferns and herbs.

The predominant vegetation community in Sydney is the Cumberland Plain Woodland in Western Sydney (Cumberland Plain), followed by the Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest in the Inner West and Northern Sydney, the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub in the coastline and the Blue Gum High Forest scantily present in the North Shore – all of which are critically endangered. The city also includes the Sydney Sandstone Ridgetop Woodland found in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park on the Hornsby Plateau to the north.

Sydney is home to dozens of bird species, which commonly include the Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, noisy miner and the pied currawong. Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common myna, common starling, house sparrow and the spotted dove. Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks. Sydney has a few mammal and spider species, such as the grey-headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel-web, respectively, and has a huge diversity of marine species inhabiting its harbour and beaches.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen–Geiger classification, Sydney has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with &quot;warm, sometimes hot&quot; summers and &quot;generally mild&quot;, to &quot;cool&quot; winters. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode play an important role in determining Sydney&#x27;s weather patterns: drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation in Australia. The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs because Sydney CBD is more affected by the oceanic climate drivers than the western suburbs.

At Sydney&#x27;s primary weather station at Observatory Hill, extreme temperatures have ranged from on 18 January 2013 to on 22 June 1932. An average of 14.9 days a year have temperatures at or above in the central business district (CBD). In contrast, the metropolitan area averages between 35 and 65 days, depending on the suburb. The hottest day in the metropolitan area occurred in Penrith on 4 January 2020, where a high of was recorded. The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from in September to in February. Sydney has an average of 7.2 hours of sunshine per day and 109.5 clear days annually. Due to the inland location, frost is recorded early in the morning in Western Sydney a few times in winter. Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons, with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn.

Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect. This makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat, including coastal suburbs. In late spring and summer, temperatures over are not uncommon, though hot, dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster, a powerful southerly that brings gale winds and a rapid fall in temperature. Since Sydney is downwind of the Great Dividing Range, it occasionally experiences dry, westerly foehn winds typically in winter and early spring (which are the reason for its warm maximum temperatures). Westerly winds are intense when the Roaring Forties (or the Southern Annular Mode) shift towards southeastern Australia, where they may damage homes and affect flights, in addition to making the temperature seem colder than it actually is.

Rainfall has a moderate to low variability and has historically been fairly uniform throughout the year, although in recent years it has been more summer-dominant and erratic. Precipitation is usually higher in summer through to autumn, and lower in late winter to early spring. In late autumn and winter, east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall, especially in the CBD. In the warm season black nor&#x27;easters are usually the cause of heavy rain events, though other forms of low-pressure areas, including remnants of ex-cyclones, may also bring heavy deluge and afternoon thunderstorms. &#x27;Snow&#x27; was last alleged in 1836, more than likely a fall of graupel, or soft hail; and in July 2008 the Upper North Shore saw a fall of graupel that was mistaken by many for &#x27;snow&#x27;. In 2009, dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards the city.
==Regions==

The Greater Sydney Commission divides Sydney into three &quot;cities&quot; and five &quot;districts&quot; based on the 33 LGAs in the metropolitan area. The &quot;metropolis of three cities&quot; comprises &quot;Eastern Harbour City&quot;, &quot;Central River City&quot; and &quot;Western Parkland City&quot;. The Australian Bureau of Statistics also includes City of Central Coast (the former Gosford City and Wyong Shire) as part of Greater Sydney for population counts, adding 330,000 people.

===Inner suburbs===

The CBD extends about south from Sydney Cove. It is bordered by Farm Cove within the Royal Botanic Garden to the east and Darling Harbour to the west. Suburbs surrounding the CBD include Woolloomooloo and Potts Point to the east, Surry Hills and Darlinghurst to the south, Pyrmont and Ultimo to the west, and Millers Point and The Rocks to the north. Most of these suburbs measure less than in area. The Sydney CBD is characterised by narrow streets and thoroughfares, created in its convict beginnings.

Several localities, distinct from suburbs, exist throughout Sydney&#x27;s inner reaches. Central and Circular Quay are transport hubs with ferry, rail, and bus interchanges. Chinatown, Darling Harbour, and Kings Cross are important locations for culture, tourism, and recreation. The Strand Arcade, located between Pitt Street Mall and George Street, is a historical Victorian-style shopping arcade. Opened on 1 April 1892, its shop fronts are an exact replica of the original internal shopping facades. Westfield Sydney, located beneath the Sydney Tower, is the largest shopping centre by area in Sydney.

Since the late 20th century, there has been a trend of gentrification amongst Sydney&#x27;s inner suburbs. Pyrmont, located on the harbour, was redeveloped from a centre of shipping and international trade to an area of high density housing, tourist accommodation, and gambling. Originally located well outside of the city, Darlinghurst is the location of the historic Darlinghurst Gaol, manufacturing, and mixed housing. For a period it was known as an area of prostitution. The terrace-style housing has largely been retained and Darlinghurst has undergone significant gentrification since the 1980s.

Green Square is a former industrial area of Waterloo which is undergoing urban renewal worth $8 billion. On the city harbour edge, the historic suburb and wharves of Millers Point are being built up as the new area of Barangaroo. The suburb of Paddington is known for its restored terrace houses, Victoria Barracks, and shopping including the weekly Oxford Street markets.

=== Inner West ===

The Inner West generally includes the Inner West Council, Municipality of Burwood, Municipality of Strathfield, and City of Canada Bay. These span up to about 11 km west of the CBD. Historically, especially prior to the building of the Harbour Bridge, the outer suburbs of the Inner West such as Strathfield were the location of &quot;country&quot; estates for the colony&#x27;s elites. By contrast, the inner suburbs in the Inner West, being close to transport and industry, have historically housed working-class industrial workers. These areas have undergone gentrification in the late 20th century, and many parts are now highly valued residential suburbs. As of 2021, an Inner West suburb (Strathfield) remained one of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia by median house price (the others were all in metropolitan Sydney, all in Northern Sydney or the Eastern Suburbs). The University of Sydney is located in this area, as well as the University of Technology, Sydney and a campus of the Australian Catholic University. The Anzac Bridge spans Johnstons Bay and connects Rozelle to Pyrmont and the city, forming part of the Western Distributor.

The Inner West is today well known as the location of village commercial centres with cosmopolitan flavours, such as the &quot;Little Italy&quot; commercial centres of Leichardt, Five Dock and Haberfield, &quot;Little Portugal&quot; in Petersham, &quot;Little Korea&quot; in Strathfield or &quot;Little Shanghai&quot; in Ashfield. Large-scale shopping centres in the area include Westfield Burwood, DFO Homebush and Birkenhead Point Outlet Centre. There is a large cosmopolitan community and nightlife hub on King Street, Newtown.

The area is serviced by Sydney Trains&#x27; T1, T2 and T3 services, including the Main Suburban Line, which was the first to be constructed in New South Wales. Strathfield railway station is a secondary railway hub within Sydney, and major station on the Suburban and Northern lines. It was constructed in 1876. The future Sydney Metro West will also connect this area with the City and Parramatta. The area is also serviced by the Parramatta River services of Sydney Ferries, numerous bus routes and cycleways.

===Eastern suburbs===

The Eastern Suburbs encompass the Municipality of Woollahra, the City of Randwick, the Waverley Municipal Council, and parts of the Bayside Council. They include some of the most affluent and advantaged areas in the country, with some streets being amongst the most expensive in the world. As at 2014, Wolseley Road, Point Piper, had a top price of $20,900 per square metre, making it the ninth-most expensive street in the world. More than 75% of neighbourhoods in the Electoral District of Wentworth fall under the top decile of SEIFA advantage, making it the least disadvantaged area in the country. As of 2021, of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia by median house price, nine were in the Eastern Suburbs.

Major landmarks include Bondi Beach, which was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2008; and Bondi Junction, featuring a Westfield shopping centre and an estimated office workforce of 6,400 by 2035, as well as a railway station on the T4 Eastern Suburbs Line. The suburb of Randwick contains Randwick Racecourse, the Royal Hospital for Women, the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital, and University of New South Wales Kensington Campus.

Construction of the CBD and South East Light Rail was completed in April 2020. The project aims to provide reliable and high-capacity tram services to residents in the City and South-East.

Major shopping centres in the area include Westfield Bondi Junction and Westfield Eastgardens.

===Southern Sydney===

The Southern district of Sydney includes the suburbs in the local government areas of the Georges River Council (collectively known as St George) and the Sutherland Shire (colloquially known as &#x27;The Shire&#x27;), on the southern banks of the Georges River.

The Kurnell peninsula, near Botany Bay, is the site of the first landfall on the eastern coastline made by James Cook in 1770. La Perouse, a historic suburb named after the French navigator Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, is notable for its old military outpost at Bare Island and the Botany Bay National Park.

The suburb of Cronulla in southern Sydney is close to Royal National Park, Australia&#x27;s oldest national park. Hurstville, a large suburb with commercial and high-rise residential buildings dominating the skyline, has become a CBD for the southern suburbs.

===Northern Sydney===
&#x27;Northern Sydney&#x27; includes the suburbs in the Upper North Shore, Lower North Shore and the Northern Beaches.

The Northern Suburbs include several landmarks – Macquarie University, Gladesville Bridge, Ryde Bridge, Macquarie Centre and Curzon Hall in Marsfield. This area includes suburbs in the local government areas of Hornsby Shire, Ku-ring-gai Council, City of Ryde, the Municipality of Hunter&#x27;s Hill and parts of the City of Parramatta.

The North Shore includes the commercial centres of North Sydney and Chatswood. North Sydney itself consists of a large commercial centre, which contains the second largest concentration of high-rise buildings in Sydney after the CBD. North Sydney is dominated by advertising, marketing and associated trades, with many large corporations holding offices.

The Northern Beaches area includes Manly, one of Sydney&#x27;s most popular holiday destinations. The region also features Sydney Heads, a series of headlands which form the entrance to Sydney Harbour. The Northern Beaches area extends south to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour), west to Middle Harbour and north to the entrance of Broken Bay. The 2021 Australian census found the Northern Beaches to have, in comparison with the rest of Sydney, a large British diaspora and high concentration of people with European ancestry.

As of the end of 2021, half of the 20 most expensive postcodes in Australia (by median house price) were in Northern Sydney, including four on the Northern Beaches, two on the Lower North Shore, three on the Upper North Shore, and one straddling Hunters Hill and Woolwich.

===Hills district===
The Hills district generally refers to the suburbs in north-western Sydney including the local government areas of The Hills Shire, parts of the City of Parramatta Council and Hornsby Shire. Actual suburbs and localities that are considered to be in the Hills District can be somewhat amorphous. For example, the Hills District Historical Society restricts its definition to the Hills Shire local government area, yet its study area extends from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury. The region is so named for its characteristically comparatively hilly topography as the Cumberland Plain lifts up, joining the Hornsby Plateau. Windsor and Old Windsor Roads are the second and third roads, respectively, laid in Australia.

On 26 May 2019, The Sydney Metro Northwest, which went from Chatswood to Tallawong, opened, with a large portion running through the Hills District, which meant the Hills District, for the first time, started having heavy rail.
Before this, The Hills was served by Bus Rapid Transit.

===Western suburbs===
The greater western suburbs encompasses the areas of Parramatta, the sixth largest business district in Australia, settled the same year as the harbour-side colony, Bankstown, Liverpool, Penrith, and Fairfield. Covering and having an estimated population as at 2017 of 2,288,554, western Sydney has the most multicultural suburbs in the country – Cabramatta has earned the nickname &quot;Little Saigon&quot; due to its Vietnamese population, Fairfield has been named &quot;Little Assyria&quot; for its predominant Assyrian population and Harris Park is known as &quot;Little India&quot; with its plurality of Indian and Hindu population. The population is predominantly of a working class background, with major employment in the heavy industries and vocational trade. Toongabbie is noted for being the third mainland settlement (after Sydney and Parramatta) set up after British colonisation began in 1788, although the site of the settlement is actually in the separate suburb of Old Toongabbie.

The western suburb of Prospect, in the City of Blacktown, is home to Raging Waters, a water park operated by Parques Reunidos. Auburn Botanic Gardens, a botanical garden in Auburn, attracts thousands of visitors each year, including many from outside Australia. The greater west also includes Sydney Olympic Park, a suburb created to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, and Sydney Motorsport Park, a circuit in Eastern Creek. Prospect Hill, a historically significant ridge in the west and the only area in Sydney with ancient volcanic activity, is also listed on the State Heritage Register.

To the northwest, Featherdale Wildlife Park, a zoo in Doonside, near Blacktown, is a major tourist attraction. Sydney Zoo, opened in 2019, is another prominent zoo situated in Bungaribee. Established in 1799, the Old Government House, a historic house museum and tourist spot in Parramatta, was included in the Australian National Heritage List on 1 August 2007 and World Heritage List in 2010 (as part of the 11 penal sites constituting the Australian Convict Sites), making it the only site in greater western Sydney to be featured in such lists. The house is Australia&#x27;s oldest surviving public building.

Further to the southwest is the region of Macarthur and the city of Campbelltown, a significant population centre until the 1990s considered a region separate to Sydney proper. Macarthur Square, a shopping complex in Campbelltown, has become one of the largest shopping complexes in Sydney. The southwest also features Bankstown Reservoir, the oldest elevated reservoir constructed in reinforced concrete that is still in use and is listed on the State Heritage Register. The southwest is home to one of Sydney&#x27;s oldest trees, the Bland Oak, which was planted in the 1840s by William Bland in Carramar.

==Urban structure==
===Architecture===

The earliest structures in the colony were built to the bare minimum of standards. Governor Macquarie set ambitious targets for the design of new construction projects. The city now has a world heritage listed building, several national heritage listed buildings, and dozens of Commonwealth heritage listed buildings as evidence of the survival of Macquarie&#x27;s ideals.

In 1814, the Governor called on a convict named Francis Greenway to design Macquarie Lighthouse. The lighthouse&#x27;s Classical design earned Greenway a pardon from Macquarie in 1818 and introduced a culture of refined architecture that remains to this day. Greenway went on to design the Hyde Park Barracks in 1819 and the Georgian style St James&#x27;s Church in 1824. Gothic-inspired architecture became more popular from the 1830s. John Verge&#x27;s Elizabeth Bay House and St Philip&#x27;s Church of 1856 were built in Gothic Revival style along with Edward Blore&#x27;s Government House of 1845. Kirribilli House, completed in 1858, and St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Australia&#x27;s oldest cathedral, are rare examples of Victorian Gothic construction.

From the late 1850s there was a shift towards Classical architecture. Mortimer Lewis designed the Australian Museum in 1857. The General Post Office, completed in 1891 in Victorian Free Classical style, was designed by James Barnet. Barnet also oversaw the 1883 reconstruction of Greenway&#x27;s Macquarie Lighthouse. Customs House was built in 1844. The neo-Classical and French Second Empire style Town Hall was completed in 1889. Romanesque designs gained favour from the early 1890s. Sydney Technical College was completed in 1893 using both Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne approaches. The Queen Victoria Building was designed in Romanesque Revival fashion by George McRae; completed in 1898, it accommodates 200 shops across its three storeys.

As the wealth of the settlement increased and Sydney developed into a metropolis after Federation in 1901, its buildings became taller. Sydney&#x27;s first tower was Culwulla Chambers which topped out at making 12 floors. The Commercial Traveller&#x27;s Club, built in 1908, was of similar height at 10 floors. It was built in a brick stone veneer and demolished in 1972. This heralded a change in Sydney&#x27;s cityscape and with the lifting of height restrictions in the 1960s there came a surge of high-rise construction.

The Great Depression had a tangible influence on Sydney&#x27;s architecture. New structures became more restrained with far less ornamentation. The most notable architectural feat of this period is the Harbour Bridge. Its steel arch was designed by John Bradfield and completed in 1932. A total of 39,000 tonnes of structural steel span the between Milsons Point and Dawes Point.

Modern and International architecture came to Sydney from the 1940s. Since its completion in 1973 the city&#x27;s Opera House has become a World Heritage Site and one of the world&#x27;s most renowned pieces of Modern design. Jørn Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003 for his work on the Opera House. Sydney is home to Australia&#x27;s first building by renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building (2015). An entrance from The Goods Line–a pedestrian pathway and former railway line–is located on the eastern border of the site.

Contemporary buildings in the CBD include Citigroup Centre, Aurora Place, Chifley Tower, the Reserve Bank building, Deutsche Bank Place, MLC Centre, and Capita Centre. The tallest structure is Sydney Tower, designed by Donald Crone and completed in 1981. Due to the proximity of Sydney Airport, a maximum height restriction was imposed, now sitting at 330 metres (1083 feet). Green bans and heritage overlays have been in place since at least 1977 to protect Sydney&#x27;s heritage after controversial demolitions in the 1970s.

===Housing===

Sydney surpasses both New York City and Paris real estate prices, having some of the most expensive in the world. The city remains Australia&#x27;s most expensive housing market, with the median house price at $1,595,310 as of December 2023 

There were 1.83 million dwellings in Sydney in 2021 including 900,000 (54%) detached houses, 218,000 (13%) semi-detached terrace houses and 550,000 (33%) units and apartments. Whilst terrace houses are common in the inner city areas, detached houses dominate the landscape in the outer suburbs. Due to environmental and economic pressures, there has been a noted trend towards denser housing, with a 30% increase in the number of apartments between 1996 and 2006. Public housing in Sydney is managed by the Government of New South Wales. Suburbs with large concentrations of public housing include Claymore, Macquarie Fields, Waterloo, and Mount Druitt.

A range of heritage housing styles can be found throughout Sydney. Terrace houses are found in the inner suburbs such as Paddington, The Rocks, Potts Point and Balmain, many of which have been the subject of gentrification. These terraces, particularly those in suburbs such as The Rocks, were historically home to Sydney&#x27;s miners and labourers. In the present day, terrace houses now make up some of the most valuable real estate in the city. Surviving large mansions from the Victorian era are mostly found in the oldest suburbs, such as Double Bay, Darling Point, Rose Bay and Strathfield.

Federation homes, constructed around the time of Federation in 1901, are located in a large number of suburbs that developed thanks to the arrival of railways in the late 19th century, such as Penshurst and Turramurra, and in large-scale planned &quot;garden suburbs&quot; such as Haberfield. Workers cottages are found in Surry Hills, Redfern, and Balmain. California bungalows are common in Ashfield, Concord, and Beecroft. Larger modern homes are predominantly found in the outer suburbs, such as Stanhope Gardens, Kellyville Ridge, Bella Vista to the northwest, Bossley Park, Abbotsbury, and Cecil Hills to the west, and Hoxton Park, Harrington Park, and Oran Park to the southwest.

===Parks and open spaces===
The Anzac War Memorial in Hyde Park is a public memorial dedicated to the Australian Imperial Force of World War I.

The Royal Botanic Garden is the most iconic green space in the region, hosting both scientific and leisure activities. There are 15 separate parks under the City administration. Parks within the city centre include Hyde Park, The Domain and Prince Alfred Park.

The Centennial Parklands is the largest park in the City of Sydney, comprising .

The inner suburbs include Centennial Park and Moore Park in the east (both within the City of Sydney local government area), while the outer suburbs contain Sydney Park and Royal National Park in the south, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in the north, and Western Sydney Parklands in the west, which is one of the largest urban parks in the world. The Royal National Park was proclaimed in 1879 and with is the second oldest national park in the world.

Hyde Park is the oldest parkland in the country. The largest park in the Sydney metropolitan area is Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, established in 1894 with an area of . It is regarded for its well-preserved records of indigenous habitation – more than 800 rock engravings, cave drawings and middens.

The area now known as The Domain was set aside by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1788 as his private reserve. Under the orders of Macquarie the land to the immediate north of The Domain became the Royal Botanic Garden in 1816. This makes them the oldest botanic garden in Australia. The Gardens host scientific research with herbarium collections, a library and laboratories. The two parks have a total area of with 8,900 individual plant species and receive over 3.5 million annual visits.

To the south of The Domain is Hyde Park, the oldest public parkland in Australia which measures . Its location was used for both relaxation and grazing of animals from the earliest days of the colony. Macquarie dedicated it in 1810 for the &quot;recreation and amusement of the inhabitants of the town&quot; and named it in honour of Hyde Park in London.

==Economy==
Researchers from Loughborough University have ranked Sydney amongst the top ten world cities that are highly integrated into the global economy. The Global Economic Power Index ranks Sydney eleventh in the world. The Global Cities Index recognises it as fourteenth in the world based on global engagement. There is a significant concentration of foreign banks and multinational corporations in Sydney and the city is promoted as Australia&#x27;s financial capital and one of Asia Pacific&#x27;s leading financial hubs.

The prevailing economic theory during early colonial days was mercantilism, as it was throughout most of Western Europe. The economy struggled at first due to difficulties in cultivating the land and the lack of a stable monetary system. Governor Macquarie created two coins from every Spanish silver dollar in circulation. The economy was capitalist in nature by the 1840s as the proportion of free settlers increased, the maritime and wool industries flourished, and the powers of the East India Company were curtailed.

Wheat, gold, and other minerals became export industries towards the end of the 1800s. Significant capital began to flow into the city from the 1870s to finance roads, railways, bridges, docks, courthouses, schools and hospitals. Protectionist policies after federation allowed for the creation of a manufacturing industry which became the city&#x27;s largest employer by the 1920s. These same policies helped to relieve the effects of the Great Depression during which the unemployment rate in New South Wales reached as high as 32%. From the 1960s onwards Parramatta gained recognition as the city&#x27;s second CBD and finance and tourism became major industries and sources of employment.

Sydney&#x27;s nominal gross domestic product was AU$400.9 billion and AU$80,000 per capita in 2015. Its gross domestic product was AU$337 billion in 2013, the largest in Australia. The financial and insurance services industry accounts for 18.1% of gross product, ahead of professional services with 9% and manufacturing with 7.2%. The creative and technology sectors are also focus industries for the City of Sydney and represented 9% and 11% of its economic output in 2012.

===Businesses===
There were 451,000 businesses based in Sydney in 2011, including 48% of the top 500 companies in Australia and two-thirds of the regional headquarters of multinational corporations. Global companies are attracted to the city in part because its time zone spans the closing of business in North America and the opening of business in Europe. Most foreign companies in Sydney maintain significant sales and service functions but comparably less production, research, and development capabilities. There are 283 multinational companies with regional offices in Sydney.

===Domestic economics===

Sydney has been ranked between the fifteenth and the fifth most expensive city in the world and is the most expensive city in Australia. Of the 15 categories only measured by UBS in 2012, workers receive the seventh highest wage levels of 77 cities in the world. Working residents of Sydney work an average of 1,846 hours per annum with 15 days of leave.

The labour force of Greater Sydney Region in 2016 was 2,272,722 with a participation rate of 61.6%. It comprised 61.2% full-time workers, 30.9% part-time workers, and 6.0% unemployed individuals. The largest reported occupations are professionals, clerical and administrative workers, managers, technicians and trades workers, and community and personal service workers. The largest industries by employment across Greater Sydney are Health Care and Social Assistance (11.6%), Professional Services (9.8%), Retail Trade (9.3%), Construction (8.2%), Education and Training (8.0%), Accommodation and Food Services (6.7%), and Financial and Insurance Services (6.6%). The Professional Services and Financial and Insurance Services industries account for 25.4% of employment within the City of Sydney.

In 2016, 57.6% of working-age residents had a weekly income of less than $1,000 and 14.4% had a weekly income of $1,750 or more. The median weekly income for the same period was $719 for individuals, $1,988 for families, and $1,750 for households.

Unemployment in the City of Sydney averaged 4.6% for the decade to 2013, much lower than the current rate of unemployment in Western Sydney of 7.3%. Western Sydney continues to struggle to create jobs to meet its population growth despite the development of commercial centres like Parramatta. Each day about 200,000 commuters travel from Western Sydney to the CBD and suburbs in the east and north of the city.

Home ownership in Sydney was less common than renting prior to the Second World War but this trend has since reversed. Median house prices have increased by an average of 8.6% per annum since 1970. The median house price in March 2014 was $630,000. The primary cause of rising prices is the increasing cost of land and scarcity. 31.6% of dwellings in Sydney are rented, 30.4% are owned outright and 34.8% are owned with a mortgage. 11.8% of mortgagees in 2011 had monthly loan repayments of less than $1,000 and 82.9% had monthly repayments of $1,000 or more. 44.9% of renters for the same period had weekly rent of less than $350 whilst 51.7% had weekly rent of $350 or more. The median weekly rent in Sydney in 2011 was $450.

===Financial services===

Macquarie gave a charter in 1817 to form the first bank in Australia, the Bank of New South Wales. New private banks opened throughout the 1800s but the financial system was unstable. Bank collapses were frequent and a crisis point was reached in 1893 when 12 banks failed.

The Bank of New South Wales exists to this day as Westpac. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was formed in Sydney in 1911 and began to issue notes backed by the resources of the nation. It was replaced in this role in 1959 by the Reserve Bank of Australia, also based in Sydney. The Australian Securities Exchange began operating in 1987 and with a market capitalisation of $1.6 trillion is now one of the ten largest exchanges in the world.

The Financial and Insurance Services industry now constitutes 43% of the economic product of the City of Sydney. Sydney makes up half of Australia&#x27;s finance sector and has been promoted by consecutive Commonwealth Governments as Asia Pacific&#x27;s leading financial centre. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Sydney was ranked as having the eighth most competitive financial centre in the world.

In 1985 the Federal Government granted 16 banking licences to foreign banks and now 40 of the 43 foreign banks operating in Australia are based in Sydney, including the People&#x27;s Bank of China, Bank of America, Citigroup, UBS, Mizuho Bank, Bank of China, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered, State Street, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Société Générale, Royal Bank of Scotland, Sumitomo Mitsui, ING Group, BNP Paribas, and Investec.

===Manufacturing===

Sydney has been a manufacturing city since the 1920s. By 1961 the industry accounted for 39% of all employment and by 1970 over 30% of all Australian manufacturing jobs were in Sydney. Its status has declined in recent decades, making up 12.6% of employment in 2001 and 8.5% in 2011. Between 1970 and 1985 there was a loss of 180,000 manufacturing jobs. Despite this, Sydney still overtook Melbourne as the largest manufacturing centre in Australia in the 2010s, with a manufacturing output of $21.7 billion in 2013. Observers have credited Sydney&#x27;s focus on the domestic market and high-tech manufacturing for its resilience against the high Australian dollar of the early 2010s. The &quot;Smithfield-Wetherill Park Industrial Estate&quot; in Western Sydney is the largest industrial estate in the Southern Hemisphere and is the centre of manufacturing and distribution in the region.

===Tourism and international education===
Sydney is a gateway to Australia for many international visitors and ranks among the top sixty most visited cities in the world. It has hosted over 2.8 million international visitors in 2013, or nearly half of all international visits to Australia. These visitors spent 59 million nights in the city and a total of $5.9 billion. The countries of origin in descending order were China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Hong Kong, and India.

The city also received 8.3 million domestic overnight visitors in 2013 who spent a total of $6 billion. 26,700 workers in the City of Sydney were directly employed by tourism in 2011. There were 480,000 visitors and 27,500 people staying overnight each day in 2012. On average, the tourism industry contributes $36 million to the city&#x27;s economy per day.

Popular destinations include the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Watsons Bay, The Rocks, Sydney Tower, Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Garden, the Australian Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Queen Victoria Building, Sea Life Sydney Aquarium, Taronga Zoo, Bondi Beach, Luna Park and Sydney Olympic Park.

Major developmental projects designed to increase Sydney&#x27;s tourism sector include a casino and hotel at Barangaroo and the redevelopment of East Darling Harbour, which involves a new exhibition and convention centre, now Australia&#x27;s largest.

Sydney is the highest-ranking city in the world for international students. More than 50,000 international students study at the city&#x27;s universities and a further 50,000 study at its vocational and English language schools. International education contributes $1.6 billion to the local economy and creates demand for 4,000 local jobs each year.

===Housing affordability===
In 2023, Sydney was ranked the least affordable city to buy a house in Australia and the second least affordable city in the world, after Hong Kong, with the average Sydney house price in late 2023 costing A$1.59 million, and the average unit price costing A$795,000. As of early 2024, Sydney is often described in the media as having a housing shortage, or suffering a housing crisis.

==Demographics==
The population of Sydney in 1788 was less than 1,000. With convict transportation it almost tripled in ten years to 2,953. For each decade since 1961 the population has increased by more than 250,000. The 2021 census recorded the population of Greater Sydney as 5,231,150. The Australian Treasury expects the population will grow to 6.5 million in 2033–34. The four most densely populated suburbs in Australia are located in Sydney with each having more than 13,000 residents per square kilometre (33,700 residents per square mile). Between 1971 and 2018, Sydney experienced a net loss of 716,832 people to the rest of Australia, but its population grew due to overseas arrivals and a healthy birth rate.

The median age of Sydney residents is 37 and 14.8% of people are 65 or older. 48.6% of Sydney&#x27;s population is married whilst 36.7% have never been married. 49.0% of families are couples with children, 34.4% are couples without children, and 14.8% are single-parent families.

===Ancestry and immigration===

At the 2021 census, the most common ancestries were: 
At the 2021 census, 40.5% of Sydney&#x27;s population was born overseas. Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China, India, England, Vietnam, Philippines and New Zealand.

At the 2021 census, 1.7% of Sydney&#x27;s population identified as being Indigenous — Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.

===Language===
42% of households in Sydney use a language other than English, with the most common being Mandarin (5%), Arabic (4.2%), Cantonese (2.8%), Vietnamese (2.2%) and Hindi (1.5%).

===Religion===

In 2021, Christianity was the largest religious affiliation at 46%, the largest denominations of which were Catholicism at 23.1% and Anglicanism at 9.2%. 30.3% of Sydney residents identified as having no religion. The most common non-Christian religious affiliations were Islam (6.3%), Hinduism (4.8%), Buddhism (3.8%), Sikhism (0.7%), and Judaism (0.7%). About 500 people identified with traditional Aboriginal religions.

The Church of England was the only recognised church before Governor Macquarie appointed official Catholic chaplains in 1820. Macquarie also ordered the construction of churches such as St Matthew&#x27;s, St Luke&#x27;s, St James&#x27;s, and St Andrew&#x27;s. Religious groups, alongside secular institutions, have played a significant role in education, health and charitable services throughout Sydney&#x27;s history.

===Crime===

Crime in Sydney is low, with &quot;The Independent&quot; ranking Sydney as the fifth safest city in the world in 2019. However, drug use is a significant problem. Methamphetamine is heavily consumed compared to other countries, while heroin is less common. One of the biggest crime-related issues in recent times was the introduction of lockout laws in February 2014, in an attempt to curb alcohol-fuelled violence. Patrons could not enter clubs or bars in the inner-city after 1:30am, and last drinks were called at 3am. The lockout laws were removed in January 2020.

==Culture==
===Science, art, and history===

Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park is rich in Indigenous Australian heritage, containing around 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal rock art – the largest cluster of Indigenous sites in Australia. The park&#x27;s indigenous sites include petroglyphs, art sites, burial sites, caves, marriage areas, birthing areas, midden sites, and tool manufacturing locations, which are dated to be around 5,000 years old. The inhabitants of the area were the Garigal people. Other rock art sites exist in the Sydney region, such as in Terrey Hills and Bondi, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their quality, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by Indigenous Australians.

The Australian Museum opened in Sydney in 1827 with the purpose of collecting and displaying the natural wealth of the colony. It remains Australia&#x27;s oldest natural history museum. In 1995 the Museum of Sydney opened on the site of the first Government House. It recounts the story of the city&#x27;s development. Other museums include the Powerhouse Museum and the Australian National Maritime Museum.

The State Library of New South Wales holds the oldest library collections in Australia, being established as the Australian Subscription Library in 1826. The Royal Society of New South Wales, formed in 1866, encourages &quot;studies and investigations in science, art, literature, and philosophy&quot;. It is based in a terrace house in Darlington owned by the University of Sydney. The Sydney Observatory building was constructed in 1859 and used for astronomy and meteorology research until 1982 before being converted into a museum.

The Museum of Contemporary Art was opened in 1991 and occupies an Art Deco building in Circular Quay. Its collection was founded in the 1940s by artist and art collector John Power and has been maintained by the University of Sydney. Sydney&#x27;s other significant art institution is the Art Gallery of New South Wales which coordinates the Archibald Prize for portraiture. Sydney is also home to contemporary art gallery Artspace, housed in the historic Gunnery Building in Woolloomooloo, fronting Sydney Harbour.

===Entertainment===
Sydney&#x27;s first commercial theatre opened in 1832 and nine more had commenced performances by the late 1920s. The live medium lost much of its popularity to the cinema during the Great Depression before experiencing a revival after World War II. Prominent theatres in the city today include State Theatre, Theatre Royal, Sydney Theatre, The Wharf Theatre, and Capitol Theatre. Sydney Theatre Company maintains a roster of local, classical, and international plays. It occasionally features Australian theatre icons such as David Williamson, Hugo Weaving, and Geoffrey Rush. The city&#x27;s other prominent theatre companies are New Theatre, Belvoir, and Griffin Theatre Company. Sydney is also home to Event Cinemas&#x27; first theatre, which opened on George St in 1913, under its former Greater Union brand; the theatre currently operates, and is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s busiest cinema locations.

The Sydney Opera House is the home of Opera Australia and Sydney Symphony. It has staged over 100,000 performances and received 100 million visitors since opening in 1973. Two other important performance venues in Sydney are Town Hall and the City Recital Hall. The Sydney Conservatorium of Music is located adjacent to the Royal Botanic Garden and serves the Australian music community through education and its biannual Australian Music Examinations Board exams.

Many writers have originated in and set their work in Sydney. Others have visited the city and commented on it. Some of them are commemorated in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay. The city was the headquarters for Australia&#x27;s first published newspaper, the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot;. Watkin Tench&#x27;s &quot;A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay&quot; (1789) and &quot;A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales&quot; (1793) have remained the best-known accounts of life in early Sydney. Since the infancy of the establishment, much of the literature set in Sydney were concerned with life in the city&#x27;s slums and working-class communities, notably William Lane&#x27;s &quot;The Working Man&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (1892), Christina Stead&#x27;s &quot;Seven Poor Men of Sydney&quot; (1934) and Ruth Park&#x27;s &quot;The Harp in the South&quot; (1948). The first Australian-born female novelist, Louisa Atkinson, set several novels in Sydney. Contemporary writers, such as Elizabeth Harrower, were born in the city and set most of their work there–Harrower&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Down in the City&quot; (1957) was mostly set in a King&#x27;s Cross apartment. Well known contemporary novels set in the city include Melina Marchetta&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot; (1992), Peter Carey&#x27;s &quot;30 Days in Sydney: A Wildly Distorted Account&quot; (1999), J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Bad Year&quot; (2007) and Kate Grenville&#x27;s &quot;The Secret River&quot; (2010). The Sydney Writers&#x27; Festival is held annually between April and May.

Filmmaking in Sydney was prolific until the 1920s when spoken films were introduced and American productions gained dominance. The Australian New Wave saw a resurgence in film production, with many notable features shot in the city between the 1970s and 80s, helmed by directors such as Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and Gillian Armstrong. Fox Studios Australia commenced production in Sydney in 1998. Successful films shot in Sydney since then include &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Lantana&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Anyone but You&quot;. The National Institute of Dramatic Art is based in Sydney and has several famous alumni such as Mel Gibson, Judy Davis, Baz Luhrmann, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Jacqueline Mckenzie.

Sydney hosts several festivals throughout the year. The city&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations are the largest in Australia. The Royal Easter Show is held every year at Sydney Olympic Park. Sydney Festival is Australia&#x27;s largest arts festival. The travelling rock music festival Big Day Out originated in Sydney. The city&#x27;s two largest film festivals are Sydney Film Festival and Tropfest. Vivid Sydney is an annual outdoor exhibition of art installations, light projections, and music. In 2015, Sydney was ranked the 13th top fashion capital in the world. It hosts the Australian Fashion Week in autumn. Sydney Mardi Gras has commenced each February since 1979.

Sydney&#x27;s Chinatown has had numerous locations since the 1850s. It moved from George Street to Campbell Street to its current setting in Dixon Street in 1980. Little Italy is located in Stanley Street.

Restaurants, bars and nightclubs can be found in the entertainment hubs in the Sydney CBD (Darling Harbour, Barangaroo, The Rocks and George Street), Oxford Street, Surry Hills, Newtown and Parramatta. Kings Cross was previously considered the red-light district. The Star is the city&#x27;s casino and is situated next to Darling Harbour while the new Crown Sydney resort is in nearby Barangaroo.

===Media===
The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; is Australia&#x27;s oldest newspaper still in print; it has been published continuously since 1831. Its competitor is &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, in print since 1879. Both papers have Sunday tabloid editions called &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; respectively. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; was founded in Sydney in 1880 and became Australia&#x27;s longest running magazine. It closed after 128 years of continuous publication. Sydney heralded Australia&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot;, published until 1842.

Each of Australia&#x27;s three commercial television networks and two public broadcasters is headquartered in Sydney. Nine&#x27;s offices and news studios are in North Sydney, Ten is based in Pyrmont, and Seven is based in South Eveleigh in Redfern. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is located in Ultimo, and the Special Broadcasting Service is based in Artarmon. Multiple digital channels have been provided by all five networks since 2000. Foxtel is based in North Ryde and sells subscription cable television to most of the urban area. Sydney&#x27;s first radio stations commenced broadcasting in the 1920s. Radio has managed to survive despite the introduction of television and the Internet. 2UE was founded in 1925 and under the ownership of Nine Entertainment is the oldest station still broadcasting. Competing stations include the more popular 2GB, ABC Radio Sydney, KIIS 106.5, Triple M, Nova 96.9 and 2Day FM.

==Sport and outdoor activities==

Sydney&#x27;s earliest migrants brought with them a passion for sport but were restricted by the lack of facilities and equipment. The first organised sports were boxing, wrestling, and horse racing from 1810 in Hyde Park. Horse racing remains popular and events such as the Golden Slipper Stakes attract widespread attention. The first cricket club was formed in 1826 and matches were played within Hyde Park throughout the 1830s and 1840s. Cricket is a favoured sport in summer and big matches have been held at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1878. The New South Wales Blues compete in the Sheffield Shield league and the Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder contest the national Big Bash Twenty20 competition.

First played in Sydney in 1865, rugby grew to be the city&#x27;s most popular football code by the 1880s. One-tenth of the state&#x27;s population attended a New South Wales versus New Zealand rugby match in 1907. Rugby league separated from rugby union in 1908. The New South Wales Waratahs contest the Super Rugby competition, while the Sydney Rays represent the city in the National Rugby Championship. The national Wallabies rugby union team competes in Sydney in international matches such as the Bledisloe Cup, Rugby Championship, and World Cup. Sydney is home to nine of the seventeen teams in the National Rugby League competition: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Penrith Panthers, Parramatta Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St George Illawarra Dragons, Sydney Roosters, and Wests Tigers. New South Wales contests the annual State of Origin series against Queensland.

Sydney FC and the Western Sydney Wanderers compete in the A-League Men and A-League Women competitions. The Sydney Swans and Greater Western Sydney Giants are local Australian rules football clubs that play in the Australian Football League and the AFL Women&#x27;s. The Sydney Kings compete in the National Basketball League. The Sydney Uni Flames play in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League. The Sydney Blue Sox contest the Australian Baseball League. The NSW Pride are a member of the Hockey One League. The Sydney Bears and Sydney Ice Dogs play in the Australian Ice Hockey League. The Swifts are competitors in the national women&#x27;s netball league.

=== Major sporting venues ===

Women were first allowed to participate in recreational swimming when separate baths were opened at Woolloomooloo Bay in the 1830s. From being illegal at the beginning of the century, sea bathing gained immense popularity during the early 1900s and the first surf lifesaving club was established at Bondi Beach. Disputes about appropriate clothing for surf bathing surfaced occasionally and concerned men as well as women. The City2Surf is an annual running race from the CBD to Bondi Beach and has been held since 1971. In 2010, 80,000 runners participated which made it the largest run of its kind in the world.

Sailing races have been held on Sydney Harbour since 1827. Yachting has been popular amongst wealthier residents since the 1840s and the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron was founded in 1862. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is a event that starts from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day. Since its inception in 1945 it has been recognised as one of the most difficult yacht races in the world. Six sailors died and 71 vessels of 115 failed to finish in the 1998 edition.

The Royal Sydney Golf Club is based in Rose Bay and since its opening in 1893 has hosted the Australian Open on 13 occasions. Royal Randwick Racecourse opened in 1833 and holds several major cups throughout the year.

Sydney benefitted from the construction of significant sporting infrastructure in preparation for its hosting of the 2000 Summer Olympics. The Sydney Olympic Park accommodates athletics, aquatics, tennis, hockey, archery, baseball, cycling, equestrian, and rowing facilities. It also includes the high capacity Stadium Australia used for rugby, soccer, and Australian rules football. The Sydney Football Stadium was completed in 1988 and was used for rugby and soccer matches. Sydney Cricket Ground was opened in 1878 and is used for both cricket and Australian rules football fixtures.

Sydney was one of the host cities during the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Sydney Football Stadium and Stadium Australia were selected as venues, with the later hosting the final.

The Sydney International tennis tournament is held here at the beginning of each year as the warm-up for the Grand Slam in Melbourne. Two of the most successful tennis players in history (Ken Rosewall and Todd Woodbridge) were born in and live in the city.

Sydney co-hosted the FIBA Oceania Championship in 1979, 1985, 1989, 1995, 2007, 2009 and 2011.

==Government==
===Historical governance===
The first five governors had near autocratic power in the colony of New South Wales, subject only to the laws of England and the supervision of the Colonial Office in London. Sydney was the seat of government for the colony which encompassed over half the Australian continent. The first Legislative Council met in 1826, and in 1842, the imperial parliament expanded and reformed the council, making it partly elected. In the same year, the town of Sydney officially became a city and an elected municipal council was established. The council had limited powers, mostly relating to services such as street lighting and drainage. Its boundaries were restricted to an area of 11.6 square kilometres, taking in the city centre and the modern suburbs of Woolloomooloo, Surry Hills, Chippendale, and Pyrmont. As Sydney grew, other municipal councils were formed to provide local administration.

In 1856, New South Wales achieved responsible government with the introduction of a bicameral parliament, based in Sydney, comprising a directly elected Legislative Assembly and a nominated Legislative Council. With the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Sydney became the capital of the state of New South Wales and its administration was divided between the Commonwealth, State and constituent local governments.

===Government in the present===

In common with other Australian capital cities, Sydney has no single local government covering its whole area. Local government areas have responsibilities such as local roads, libraries, child care, community services and waste collection, whereas the state government retains responsibility for main roads, traffic control, public transport, policing, education, and major infrastructure project. There are 33 local government areas which are wholly or mostly within Greater Sydney as defined by the Australian Statistical Geography Standard.
* Bayside
* Canterbury-Bankstown
* Blacktown
* Blue Mountains
* Burwood
* Camden
* Campbelltown
* Canada Bay
* Central Coast
* Cumberland
* Fairfield
* Georges River
* Hawkesbury
* The Hills
* Hornsby
* Hunter&#x27;s Hill
* Inner West
* Ku-ring-gai
* Lane Cove

* Mosman
* North Sydney
* Northern Beaches
* Parramatta
* Penrith

* Wollondilly
* Woollahra
Sydney is the location of the secondary official residences of the Governor-General and Prime Minister – Admiralty House and Kirribilli House respectively. The Parliament of New South Wales sits in Parliament House on Macquarie Street. This building was completed in 1816 and first served as a hospital. The Legislative Council moved into its northern wing in 1829 and by 1852 had entirely supplanted the surgeons from their quarters. Several additions have been made as the Parliament has expanded, but it retains its original Georgian façade. Government House was completed in 1845 and has served as the home of 25 Governors and 5 Governors-General. The Cabinet of Australia also meets in Sydney when needed.

The highest court in the state is the Supreme Court of New South Wales, located in Queen&#x27;s Square. The city is also the home of numerous branches of the intermediate District Court of New South Wales and the lower Local Court of New South Wales.

In the past, the state has tended to resist amalgamating Sydney&#x27;s more populated local government areas as merged councils could pose a threat to its governmental power. Established in 1842, the City of Sydney is one such local government area and includes the CBD and some adjoining inner suburbs. It is responsible for fostering development in the local area, providing local services (waste collection and recycling, libraries, parks, sporting facilities), promoting the interests of residents, supporting organisations that target the local community, and attracting and providing infrastructure for commerce, tourism, and industry. The City of Sydney is led by an elected Council and Lord Mayor.

In federal politics, Sydney was initially considered as a possibility for Australia&#x27;s capital city; the newly created city of Canberra ultimately filled this role. Seven Australian Prime Ministers have been born in Sydney, more than any other city, including first Prime Minister Edmund Barton and current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Essential public emergency services are provided and managed by the State Government. Greater Sydney is served by:
* New South Wales Police Force
* New South Wales Ambulance
* Fire and Rescue NSW

===Education===
Education became a focus for the colony from the 1870s when public schools began to form and schooling became compulsory. By 2011, 90% of working age residents had completed some schooling and 57% had completed the highest level of school. 1,390,703 people were enrolled in an educational institution in 2011 with 45.1% of these attending school and 16.5% studying at a university. Undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications are held by 22.5% of working age Sydney residents and 40.2% of working age residents of the City of Sydney. The most common fields of tertiary qualification are commerce (22.8%), engineering (13.4%), society and culture (10.8%), health (7.8%), and education (6.6%).

There are six public universities based in Sydney: The University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Technology Sydney, Macquarie University, Western Sydney University, and Australian Catholic University. Five public universities maintain secondary campuses in the city: the University of Notre Dame Australia, Central Queensland University, Victoria University, University of Wollongong, and University of Newcastle. Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University operate secondary campuses only designated for international students. In addition, four public universities offer programs in Sydney through third-party providers: University of the Sunshine Coast, La Trobe University, Federation University Australia and Charles Darwin University. 5.2% of residents of Sydney are attending a university. The University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney are ranked equal 19th in the world, the University of Technology Sydney is ranked in the top 100, while Macquarie University is ranked 237, and Western Sydney University is ranked 474.
Sydney has public, denominational, and independent schools. 7.8% of Sydney residents are attending primary school and 6.4% are enrolled in secondary school. There are 935 public preschool, primary, and secondary schools in Sydney that are administered by the New South Wales Department of Education. 14 of the 17 selective secondary schools in New South Wales are based in Sydney.

Public vocational education and training in Sydney are run by TAFE New South Wales and began with the opening of the Sydney Technical College in 1878. The college became the Sydney Institute in 1992 and now operates alongside its sister TAFE facilities across the Sydney metropolitan area, namely the Northern Sydney Institute, the Western Sydney Institute, and the South Western Sydney Institute. At the 2011 census, 2.4% of Sydney residents are enrolled in a TAFE course.

===Health===

The first hospital in the new colony was a collection of tents at The Rocks. Many of the convicts that survived the trip suffered from dysentery, smallpox, scurvy, and typhoid. Healthcare facilities remained inadequate despite the arrival of a prefabricated hospital with the Second Fleet and the construction of new hospitals at Parramatta, Windsor, and Liverpool in the 1790s.

Governor Macquarie arranged for the construction of Sydney Hospital, completed in 1816. Parts of the facility have been repurposed for use as Parliament House but the hospital itself still operates. The city&#x27;s first emergency department was established at Sydney Hospital in 1870. Demand for emergency medical care increased from 1895 with the introduction of an ambulance service. The Sydney Hospital also housed Australia&#x27;s first teaching facility for nurses, the Nightingale Wing, established with the input of Florence Nightingale in 1868.

Healthcare was recognised as a right in the early 1900s and Sydney&#x27;s public hospitals came under the oversight of the Government of New South Wales. The administration of healthcare across Sydney is handled by eight local health districts: Central Coast, Illawarra Shoalhaven, Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains, Northern Sydney, South Eastern Sydney, South Western Sydney, and Western Sydney. The Prince of Wales Hospital was established in 1852 and became the first of several major hospitals to be opened. St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital was founded in 1857, followed by Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in 1880, the Prince Henry Hospital in 1881, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1882, the Royal North Shore Hospital in 1885, the St George Hospital in 1894, and the Nepean Hospital in 1895. Westmead Hospital in 1978 was the last major facility to open.

===Transport===
====Roads====
The motor vehicle, more than any other factor, has determined the pattern of Sydney&#x27;s urban development since World War II. The growth of low-density housing in the city&#x27;s outer suburbs has made car ownership necessary for hundreds of thousands of households. The percentage of trips taken by car has increased from 13% in 1947 to 50% in 1960 and 70% in 1971. The most important roads in Sydney were the nine Metroads, including the Sydney Orbital Network. Sydney&#x27;s reliance on motor vehicles and its sprawling road network has been criticised by proponents of mass public transport and high-density housing. The Light Horse Interchange in western Sydney is the largest in the southern hemisphere.

There can be up to 350,000 cars using Sydney&#x27;s roads simultaneously during peak hour, leading to significant traffic congestion. 84.9% of Sydney households own a motor vehicle and 46.5% own two or more. With a rate of 26.3% in 2014, Sydney has the highest utilisation of public transport for travel to work of any Australian capital. In contrast, in 2014 only 25.2% of working residents in the City of Sydney use a car, whilst 15.8% take a train, 13.3% use a bus, and 25.3% walk. Several significant infrastructure projects have been completed since. The CBD features a series of alleyways and lanes that provide off-street vehicular access to city buildings and as well as pedestrian routes through city buildings.

====Suburban trains====

Established in 1906, Central station is the largest and busiest railway station in the state and is the main hub of the city&#x27;s rail network. Sydney Trains is the suburban rail service. Its tracks form part of the New South Wales railway network. It serves 168 stations across the city and had an annual ridership of 302 million passenger journeys in 2023–24. Sydney&#x27;s railway was first constructed in 1854 with progressive extension to the network to serve both freight and passengers. The main station is the Central railway station in the southern part of the CBD. In the 1850s and 1860s, the railway reached areas that are now outer suburbs of Sydney.

==== Metro ====

Sydney Metro, a driverless rapid transit system separate from the suburban commuter network, commenced operation in May 2019 and was extended through the city to Sydenham on 19 August 2024. This line will be extended to Bankstown in 2025 and a new line through the inner west to Parramatta is planned to be built by 2030. It currently serves 21 stations. A line to serve the greater west is planned for 2026 and will include a station for the second international airport.

====Light rail====
Sydney once had one of the largest tram networks in the British Empire after London. It served routes covering . The internal combustion engine made buses more flexible than trams and consequently more popular, leading to the progressive closure of the network with the final tram operating in 1961. From 1930 there were 612 buses across Sydney carrying 90 million passengers per annum.

In 1997, the Inner West Light Rail opened between Central station and Wentworth Park. It was extended to Lilyfield in 2000 and then Dulwich Hill in 2014. It links the Inner West and Darling Harbour with Central station and facilitated 9.1 million journeys in the 2016–17 financial year. A second, the CBD and South East Light Rail line serving the CBD and Eastern Suburbs opened in 2019–2020. A light rail line serving Western Sydney opened in 2024.

====Buses====
Bus services are conducted by private operators under contract to Transport for NSW. Integrated tickets called Opal cards operate on bus routes. In total, nearly 225 million boardings were recorded across the bus network. NightRide is a nightly bus service that operate between midnight and 5am.

====Ferries====
At the time the Sydney Harbour Bridge opened in 1932, the city&#x27;s ferry service was the largest in the world. Patronage declined from 37 million passengers in 1945 to 11 million in 1963 but has recovered somewhat in recent years. From its hub at Circular Quay, the ferry network extends from Manly to Parramatta. Ferries in sydney are operated by Transdev Sydney Ferries and operates 10 routes.

====Airports====
Sydney Airport, officially &quot;Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport&quot;, is located in Mascot. It services 46 international and 23 domestic destinations. As the busiest airport in Australia, it handled 37.9 million passengers in 2013 and 530,000 tonnes of freight in 2011.
A second airport, Western Sydney Airport, is under construction at Badgerys Creek and will open in late 2026, at a cost of $2.5 billion.Notably, it will not feature a curfew, unlike Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport, which imposes a suspension of all aircraft operations between 11pm and 6am. Bankstown Airport is Sydney&#x27;s second busiest airport, and serves general aviation, charter and some scheduled cargo flights. Bankstown is also the fourth busiest airport in Australia by number of aircraft movements. Port Botany has surpassed Port Jackson as the city&#x27;s major shipping port. Cruise ship terminals are located at Sydney Cove and White Bay.

===Utilities===

Obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times. A catchment called the Tank Stream sourced water from what is now the CBD but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s. The Botany Swamps Scheme was one of several ventures during the mid-1800s that saw the construction of wells, tunnels, steam pumping stations, and small dams to service Sydney&#x27;s growing population.

The Upper Nepean Scheme came into operation in 1886. It transports water from the Nepean, Cataract, and Cordeaux rivers and continues to service about 15% of Sydney&#x27;s water needs. Dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935. In 1977 the Shoalhaven Scheme brought several more dams into service.

The state-owned corporation WaterNSW now manages eleven major dams: Warragamba, one of the largest domestic water supply dams in the world, Woronora, Cataract, Cordeaux, Nepean, Avon, Wingecarribee Reservoir, Fitzroy Falls Reservoir, Tallowa, the Blue Mountains Dams, and Prospect Reservoir. Water is collected from five catchment areas covering and total storage amounts to . The Sydney Desalination Plant came into operation in 2010. WaterNSW supplies bulk water to Sydney Water, a state-owned corporation that operates water distribution, sewerage and storm water management services.

Sydney&#x27;s electricity infrastructure is maintained by Ausgrid and Endeavour Energy. Their combined networks include over 815,000 poles and of cables. Submarine communications cable systems in Sydney include the Australia–Japan Cable, Telstra Endeavour and the Southern Cross Cable, which link Australia and countries in the Pacific.

==Environmental issues and pollution reduction==

===Air quality===

As climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for Australia, Sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution and emissions and maintaining water quality. The release of the Metropolitan Air Quality Scheme (MAQS) led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in Sydney, allowing the government to form appropriate responses.

The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season significantly impacted outer Sydney and dramatically reduced air quality, leading to a smoky haze that lingered for days. The air quality was 11 times the hazardous level in some days, worse than New Delhi&#x27;s; it was compared to &quot;smoking 32 cigarettes&quot; by Brian Oliver, a respiratory diseases scientist at the University of Technology Sydney. Since Sydney is surrounded by bushland and forest, bushfires can ring the region in a natural phenomena that is labelled &quot;ring of fire&quot;.

The City of Sydney became the first council in Australia to achieve formal certification as carbon-neutral in 2008. The city has reduced its 2007 carbon emissions by 6% and since 2006 has reduced carbon emissions from city buildings by up to 20%. The &quot;Sustainable Sydney 2030&quot; program presented a guide to reducing energy in homes and offices by 30%. Reductions in energy consumption have slashed energy bills by $30 million a year. Solar panels have been established on many CBD buildings to minimise carbon pollution by around 3,000 tonnes a year.

The city also has an &quot;urban forest growth strategy&quot;, in which it aims to regularly increase the tree coverage in the city by frequently planting trees with strong leaf density and vegetation to provide cleaner air and create moisture during hot weather, thus lowering city temperatures. Sydney has also become a leader in the development of green office buildings and enforcing the requirement of all building proposals to be energy-efficient. The One Central Park development, completed in 2013, is an example of this implementation.

===Car-dependency===

Australian cities are some of the most car-dependent cities in the world, especially by world city standards, although Sydney&#x27;s is the lowest of Australia&#x27;s major cities at 66%. Sydney also has the highest usage of public transport in an Australian city, at 27%–comparable with New York City, Shanghai and Berlin. Despite its high ranking for an Australian city, Sydney has a low level of mass-transit services, with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl, thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency.

Strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit, initiating the development of high density housing and introducing a fleet of 10 new electric cars, the largest order of the pollution-free vehicle in Australia. Electric cars do not produce carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide, which contribute to climate change. Cycling trips increased by 113% across Sydney&#x27;s inner-city from 2010 to 2015, at which point about 2,000 bikes were passing through top peak-hour intersections on an average weekday. Transport developments in the north-west and east of the city have been designed to encourage use of the expanding public transportation system.

<text>A sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting. Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt and can be straight or curved. A thrusting sword tends to have a straighter blade with a pointed tip. A slashing sword is more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. The precise definition of a sword varies by historical epoch and geographic region.

Historically, the sword developed in the Bronze Age, evolving from the dagger; the earliest specimens date to about 1600 BC. The later Iron Age sword remained fairly short and without a crossguard. The spatha, as it developed in the Late Roman army, became the predecessor of the European sword of the Middle Ages, at first adopted as the Migration Period sword, and only in the High Middle Ages, developed into the classical arming sword with crossguard. The word &quot;sword&quot; continues the Old English, &quot;&quot;.

The use of a sword is known as swordsmanship or, in a modern context, as fencing. In the early modern period, western sword design diverged into two forms, the thrusting swords and the sabres.

Thrusting swords such as the rapier and eventually the smallsword were designed to impale their targets quickly and inflict deep stab wounds. Their long and straight yet light and well balanced design made them highly maneuverable and deadly in a duel but fairly ineffective when used in a slashing or chopping motion. A well aimed lunge and thrust could end a fight in seconds with just the sword&#x27;s point, leading to the development of a fighting style which closely resembles modern fencing.

Slashing swords such as the sabre and similar blades such as the cutlass were built more heavily and were more typically used in warfare. Built for slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often from horseback, the sabre&#x27;s long curved blade and slightly forward weight balance gave it a deadly character all its own on the battlefield. Most sabres also had sharp points and double-edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier in a cavalry charge. Sabres continued to see battlefield use until the early 20th century. The US Navy M1917 Cutlass used in World War I was kept in their armory well into World War II and many Marines were issued a variant called the M1941 Cutlass as a makeshift jungle machete during the Pacific War.

Non-European weapons classified as swords include single-edged weapons such as the Middle Eastern scimitar, the Chinese &quot;dao&quot; and the related Japanese &quot;katana&quot;. The Chinese &quot;jiàn&quot; is an example of a non-European double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-edged Iron Age sword.

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===

====Bronze Age====


The first weapons that can be described as &quot;swords&quot; date to around 3300 BC. They have been found in Arslantepe, Turkey, are made from arsenical bronze, and are about long. Some of them are inlaid with silver.

The sword developed from the knife or dagger. The sword became differentiated from the dagger during the Bronze Age (&quot;c.&quot; 3000 BC), when copper and bronze weapons were produced with long leaf-shaped blades and with hilts consisting of an extension of the blade in handle form. A knife is unlike a dagger in that a knife has only one cutting surface, while a dagger has two cutting surfaces. Construction of longer blades became possible during the 3rd millennium BC in the Middle East, first in arsenic copper, then in tin-bronze.

Blades longer than were rare and not practical until the late Bronze Age because the Young&#x27;s modulus (stiffness) of bronze is relatively low, and consequently longer blades would bend easily. The development of the sword out of the dagger was gradual; the first weapons that can be classified as swords without any ambiguity are those found in Minoan Crete, dated to about 1700 BC, reaching a total length of more than . These are the &quot;type A&quot; swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.

One of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of swords of the European Bronze Age was the &quot;Naue II&quot; type (named for Julius Naue who first described them), also known as &quot;Griffzungenschwert&quot; (lit. &quot;grip-tongue sword&quot;). This type first appears in c. the 13th century BC in Northern Italy (or a general Urnfield background), and survives well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries. During its lifetime, metallurgy changed from bronze to iron, but not its basic design.

Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as Ugarit, beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the Bronze Age collapse. Naue II swords could be as long as 85 cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70 cm range. Robert Drews linked the Naue Type II Swords, which spread from Southern Europe into the Mediterranean, with the Bronze Age collapse. Naue II swords, along with Nordic full-hilted swords, were made with functionality and aesthetics in mind. The hilts of these swords were beautifully crafted and often contained false rivets in order to make the sword more visually appealing. Swords coming from northern Denmark and northern Germany usually contained three or more fake rivets in the hilt.

Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age Shang dynasty. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring States period and Qin dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer, lower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see sword of Goujian). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high tin bronze (17–21% tin) which is very hard and breaks if stressed too far, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends if stressed too far. Although iron swords were made alongside bronze, it was not until the early Han period that iron completely replaced bronze.

In the Indian subcontinent, earliest available Bronze age swords of copper were discovered in the Indus Valley civilization sites in the northwestern regions of South Asia. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the Ganges-Jamuna Doab region of Indian subcontinent, consisting of bronze but more commonly copper. Diverse specimens have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to times between 1700 and 1400 BC. Other swords from this period in India have been discovered from Kallur, Raichur.

====Iron Age====

Iron became increasingly common from the 13th century BC. Before that the use of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipping of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.

Ancient swords are often found at burial sites. The sword was often placed on the right side of the corpse. Many times the sword was kept over the corpse. In many late Iron Age graves, the sword and the scabbard were bent at 180 degrees. It was known as killing the sword. Thus they might have considered swords as the most potent and powerful object.

====Indian antiquity====
High-carbon steel for swords, which would later appear as Damascus steel, was likely introduced in India around the mid-1st millennium BC. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; mentions swords of Indian iron and steel being exported from ancient India to ancient Greece. Blades from the Indian subcontinent made of Damascus steel also found their way into Persia.

====Greco-Roman antiquity====
By the time of Classical Antiquity and the Parthian and Sassanid Empires in Iran, iron swords were common. The Greek &quot;xiphos&quot; and the Roman &quot;gladius&quot; are typical examples of the type, measuring some . The late Roman Empire introduced the longer &quot;spatha&quot; (the term for its wielder, &quot;spatharius&quot;, became a court rank in Constantinople), and from this time, the term &quot;longsword&quot; is applied to swords comparatively long for their respective periods.

Swords from the Parthian and Sassanian Empires were quite long, the blades on some late Sassanian swords being just under a metre long.

Swords were also used to administer various physical punishments, such as non-surgical amputation or capital punishment by decapitation. The use of a sword, an honourable weapon, was regarded in Europe since Roman times as a privilege reserved for the nobility and the upper classes.

====Persian antiquity====
In the first millennium BC, the Persian armies used a sword that was originally of Scythian design called the &quot;akinaka&quot; (acinaces). However, the great conquests of the Persians made the sword more famous as a Persian weapon, to the extent that the true nature of the weapon has been lost somewhat as the name &quot;akinaka&quot; has been used to refer to whichever form of sword the Persian army favoured at the time.

It is widely believed that the original &quot;akinaka&quot; was a 35 to 45 cm (14 to 18 inch) double-edged sword. The design was not uniform and in fact identification is made more on the nature of the scabbard than the weapon itself; the scabbard usually has a large, decorative mount allowing it to be suspended from a belt on the wearer&#x27;s right side. Because of this, it is assumed that the sword was intended to be drawn with the blade pointing downwards ready for surprise stabbing attacks.

In the 12th century, the Seljuq dynasty had introduced the curved &quot;shamshir&quot; to Persia, and this was in extensive use by the early 16th century.

====Chinese antiquity====
Chinese iron swords made their first appearance in the later part of the Western Zhou dynasty, but iron and steel swords were not widely used until the 3rd century BC Han dynasty. The Chinese &quot;dao&quot; (刀 pinyin dāo) is single-edged, sometimes translated as sabre or broadsword, and the &quot;jian&quot; (劍 or 剑 pinyin jiàn) is double-edged. The &quot;zhanmadao&quot; (literally &quot;horse chopping sword&quot;) is an extremely long, anti-cavalry sword from the Song dynasty era.

===Middle Ages===

====Europe====

=====Early and High Middle Ages=====

During the Middle Ages, sword technology improved, and the sword became a very advanced weapon. The spatha type remained popular throughout the Migration period and well into the Middle Ages. Vendel Age spathas were decorated with Germanic artwork (not unlike the Germanic bracteates fashioned after Roman coins). The Viking Age saw again a more standardized production, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.

Around the 10th century, the use of properly quenched hardened and tempered steel started to become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish &#x27;Ulfberht&#x27; blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality. Charles the Bald tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by Vikings in raids against the Franks.

Wootz steel (which is also known as Damascus steel) was a unique and highly prized steel developed on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular cementite in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.

It was only from the 11th century that Norman swords began to develop the crossguard (quillons). During the Crusades of the 12th to 13th century, this cruciform type of arming sword remained essentially stable, with variations mainly concerning the shape of the pommel. These swords were designed as cutting weapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter improvements in armour, especially the 14th-century change from mail to plate armour.

It was during the 14th century, with the growing use of more advanced armour, that the hand and a half sword, also known as a &quot;bastard sword&quot;, came into being. It had an extended grip that meant it could be used with either one or two hands. Though these swords did not provide a full two-hand grip they allowed their wielders to hold a shield or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow.

In the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol of the word of God. The names given to many swords in mythology, literature, and history reflected the high prestige of the weapon and the wealth of the owner.

=====Late Middle Ages=====
From around 1300 to 1500, in concert with improved armour, innovative sword designs evolved more and more rapidly. The main transition was the lengthening of the grip, allowing two-handed use, and a longer blade. By 1400, this type of sword, at the time called &quot;langes Schwert&quot; (longsword) or &quot;spadone&quot;, was common, and a number of 15th- and 16th-century &quot;Fechtbücher&quot; offering instructions on their use survive. Another variant was the specialized armour-piercing swords of the estoc type. The longsword became popular due to its extreme reach and its cutting and thrusting abilities.

The estoc became popular because of its ability to thrust into the gaps between plates of armour. The grip was sometimes wrapped in wire or coarse animal hide to provide a better grip and to make it harder to knock a sword out of the user&#x27;s hand.

A number of manuscripts covering longsword combat and techniques dating from the 13th–16th centuries exist in German, Italian, and English, providing extensive information on longsword combatives as used throughout this period. Many of these are now readily available online.

In the 16th century, the large zweihänder was used by the elite German and Swiss mercenaries known as doppelsöldners. &quot;Zweihänder&quot;, literally translated, means two-hander. The &quot;zweihänder&quot; possesses a long blade, as well as a huge guard for protection. It is estimated that some &quot;zweihänder&quot; swords were over long, with the one ascribed to Frisian warrior Pier Gerlofs Donia being long. The gigantic blade length was perfectly designed for manipulating and pushing away enemy polearms, which were major weapons around this time, in both Germany and Eastern Europe. &quot;Doppelsöldners&quot; also used &quot;katzbalgers&quot;, which means &#x27;cat-gutter&#x27;. The &quot;katzbalger&#x27;s&quot; S-shaped guard and blade made it perfect for bringing in when the fighting became too close to use a &quot;zweihänder&quot;.

Civilian use of swords became increasingly common during the late Renaissance, with duels being a preferred way to honourably settle disputes.

The side-sword was a type of war sword used by infantry during the Renaissance of Europe. This sword was a direct descendant of the knightly sword. Quite popular between the 16th and 17th centuries, they were ideal for handling the mix of armoured and unarmoured opponents of that time. A new technique of placing one&#x27;s finger on the &quot;ricasso&quot; to improve the grip (a practice that would continue in the rapier) led to the production of hilts with a guard for the finger. This sword design eventually led to the development of the civilian rapier, but it was not replaced by it, and the side-sword continued to be used during the rapier&#x27;s lifetime. As it could be used for both cutting and thrusting, the term &quot;cut and thrust sword&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with side-sword. As rapiers became more popular, attempts were made to hybridize the blade, sacrificing the effectiveness found in each unique weapon design. These are still considered side-swords and are sometimes labeled &quot;sword rapier&quot; or &quot;cutting rapier&quot; by modern collectors.

Side-swords used in conjunction with bucklers became so popular that it caused the term swashbuckler to be coined. This word stems from the new fighting style of the side-sword and buckler which was filled with much &quot;swashing and making a noise on the buckler&quot;.

Within the Ottoman Empire, the use of a curved sabre called the &quot;yatagan&quot; started in the mid-16th century. It would become the weapon of choice for many in Turkey and the Balkans.

The sword in this time period was the most personal weapon, the most prestigious, and the most versatile for close combat, but it came to decline in military use as technology, such as the crossbow and firearms changed warfare. However, it maintained a key role in civilian self-defence.

====Middle East====
The earliest evidence of curved swords, or scimitars (and other regional variants as the Arabian &quot;saif&quot;, the Persian &quot;shamshir&quot; and the Turkic &quot;kilij&quot;) is from the 9th century, when it was used among soldiers in the Khurasan region of Persia.

====Africa====
The &quot;takoba&quot; is a type of broadsword originating in the western Sahel, descended from various Byzantine and Islamic swords. It has a straight double-edged blade measuring about one meter in length, usually imported from Europe.

Abyssinian swords related to the Persian &quot;shamshir&quot; are known as &quot;shotel&quot;. The Asante people adopted swords under the name of &quot;akrafena&quot;. They are still used today in ceremonies, such as the Odwira festival.

====East Asia====
As steel technology improved, single-edged weapons became popular throughout Asia. Derived from the Chinese &quot;jian&quot; or &quot;dao&quot;, the Korean &quot;hwandudaedo&quot; are known from the early medieval Three Kingdoms. Production of the Japanese &quot;tachi&quot;, a precursor to the &quot;katana&quot;, is recorded from c. AD 900 (see Japanese sword).
Japan was famous for the swords it forged in the early 13th century for the class of warrior-nobility known as the Samurai. Western historians have said that Japanese &quot;katana&quot; were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history. The types of swords used by the Samurai included the &quot;ōdachi&quot; (extra long field sword), &quot;tachi&quot; (long cavalry sword), &quot;katana&quot; (long sword), and &quot;wakizashi&quot; (shorter companion sword for &quot;katana&quot;). Japanese swords that pre-date the rise of the samurai caste include the &quot;tsurugi&quot; (straight double-edged blade) and &quot;chokutō&quot; (straight one-edged blade). Japanese swordmaking reached the height of its development in the 15th and 16th centuries, when samurai increasingly found a need for a sword to use in closer quarters, leading to the creation of the modern &quot;katana&quot;. High quality Japanese swords have been exported to neighboring Asian countries since before the 11th century. From the 15th century to the 16th century, more than 200,000 swords were exported, reaching a quantitative peak, but these were simple swords made exclusively for mass production, specialized for export and lending to conscripted farmers (&quot;ashigaru&quot;).

====South Asia====
The &quot;khanda&quot; is a double-edge straight sword. It is often featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. Some communities venerate the weapon as a symbol of Shiva. It is a common weapon in the martial arts in the Indian subcontinent. The &quot;khanda&quot; often appears in Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the high-quality steel. This gave the blade a very hard cutting edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.
The &quot;firangi&quot; (, derived from the Arabic term for a Western European, a &quot;Frank&quot;) was a sword type which used blades manufactured in Western Europe and imported by the Portuguese, or made locally in imitation of European blades. Because of its length the &quot;firangi&quot; is usually regarded as primarily a cavalry weapon. The sword has been especially associated with the Marathas, who were famed for their cavalry. However, the &quot;firangi&quot; was also widely used by Sikhs and Rajputs.

The &quot;talwar&quot; () is a type of curved sword from India and other countries of the Indian subcontinent, it was adopted by communities such as Rajputs, Sikhs and Marathas, who favored the sword as their main weapon. It became more widespread in the medieval era.

The &quot;urumi&quot; ( , lit. curling blade; ; Hindi: ) is a &quot;sword&quot; with a flexible whip-like blade.

====Southeast Asia====

In Indonesia, the images of Indian style swords can be found in Hindu gods statues from ancient Java circa 8th to 10th century. However the native types of blade known as &quot;kris&quot;, &quot;parang&quot;, &quot;klewang&quot; and &quot;golok&quot; were more popular as weapons. These daggers are shorter than a sword but longer than a common dagger.
In the Philippines, traditional large swords known as &quot;kampilans&quot; and &quot;panabas&quot; were used in combat by the natives. A notable wielder of the &quot;kampilan&quot; was Lapu-Lapu, the king of Mactan and his warriors who defeated the Spaniards and killed Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan at the Battle of Mactan on 27 April 1521. Traditional swords in the Philippines were immediately banned, but the training in swordsmanship was later hidden from the occupying Spaniards by practices in dances. But because of the banning, Filipinos were forced to use swords that were disguised as farm tools. &quot;Bolos&quot; and baliswords were used during the revolutions against the colonialists not only because ammunition for guns was scarce, but also for concealability while walking in crowded streets and homes. &quot;Bolos&quot; were also used by young boys who joined their parents in the revolution and by young girls and their mothers in defending the town while the men were on the battlefields. During the Philippine–American War in events such as the Battle of Balangiga, most of an American company was hacked to death or seriously injured by &quot;bolo&quot;-wielding guerillas in Balangiga, Samar. When the Japanese took control of the country, several American special operations groups stationed in the Philippines were introduced to Filipino martial arts and swordsmanship, leading to this style reaching America despite the fact that natives were reluctant to allow outsiders in on their fighting secrets.

====Pre-Columbian Americas====
The &quot;macuahuitl&quot; is a wooden broadsword and club that was utilized by various Mesoamerican civilizations, such as those of the Aztecs, Maya, Olmecs, Toltecs, and Mixtecs.

====Pacific Islands====
In the Gilbert Islands, the native Kiribati people have developed a type of broadsword made from shark teeth, which serves a similar function to the &quot;leiomano&quot; used by the Native Hawaiians.

===Early modern history===

====Military sword====
A single-edged type of sidearm used by the Hussites was popularized in 16th-century Germany under its Czech name &quot;dusack&quot;, also known as &quot;Säbel auf Teutsch gefasst&quot; (&quot;sabre fitted in the German manner&quot;). A closely related weapon is the &quot;schnepf&quot; or Swiss sabre used in Early Modern Switzerland.

The cut-and-thrust mortuary sword was used after 1625 by cavalry during the English Civil War. This (usually) two-edged sword sported a half-basket hilt with a straight blade some 90–105 cm long. Later in the 17th century, the swords used by cavalry became predominantly single-edged. The so-called walloon sword (&quot;épée wallone&quot;) was common in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and Baroque era. Its hilt was ambidextrous with shell-guards and knuckle-bow that inspired 18th-century continental hunting hangers. Following their campaign in the Netherlands in 1672, the French began producing this weapon as their first regulation sword. Weapons of this design were also issued to the Swedish army from the time of Gustavus Adolphus until as late as the 1850s.

====Duelling sword====
The rapier is believed to have evolved either from the Spanish &quot;espada ropera&quot; or from the swords of the Italian nobility somewhere in the later part of the 16th century. The rapier differed from most earlier swords in that it was not a military weapon but a primarily civilian sword. Both the rapier and the Italian schiavona developed the crossguard into a basket-shaped guard for hand protection.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the shorter small sword became an essential fashion accessory in European countries and the New World, though in some places such as the Scottish Highlands large swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy men and military officers carried one slung from a belt. Both the small sword and the rapier remained popular dueling swords well into the 18th century.

As the wearing of swords fell out of fashion, canes took their place in a gentleman&#x27;s wardrobe. This developed to the gentlemen in the Victorian era to use the umbrella. Some examples of canes—those known as sword canes or swordsticks—incorporate a concealed blade. The French martial art &quot;la canne&quot; developed to fight with canes and swordsticks and has now evolved into a sport. The English martial art singlestick is very similar.
With the rise of the pistol duel, the duelling sword fell out of fashion long before the practice of duelling itself. By about 1770, English duelists enthusiastically adopted the pistol, and sword duels dwindled. However, the custom of duelling with epées persisted well into the 20th century in France. Such modern duels were not fought to the death; the duellists&#x27; aim was instead merely to draw blood from the opponent&#x27;s sword arm.

===Late modern history===

====Military sidearm====
Towards the end of its useful life, the sword served more as a weapon of self-defence than for use on the battlefield, and the military importance of swords steadily decreased during the Modern Age. Even as a personal sidearm, the sword began to lose its preeminence in the early 19th century, reflecting the development of reliable handguns.

However, swords were still normally carried in combat by cavalrymen and by officers of other branches throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, both in colonial and European warfare. For example, during the Aceh War the Acehnese &quot;klewangs&quot;, a sword similar to the machete, proved very effective in close quarters combat with Dutch troops, leading the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army to adopt a heavy cutlass, also called &quot;klewang&quot; (very similar in appearance to the US Navy Model 1917 Cutlass) to counter it. Mobile troops armed with carbines and klewangs succeeded in suppressing Aceh resistance where traditional infantry with rifle and bayonet had failed. From that time on until the 1950s the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, Royal Dutch Army, Royal Dutch Navy and Dutch police used these cutlasses called Klewang.
Swords continued in general peacetime use by cavalry of most armies during the years prior to World War I. The British Army formally adopted a completely new design of cavalry sword in 1908, almost the last change in British Army weapons before the outbreak of the war. At the outbreak of World War I infantry officers in all combatant armies then involved (French, German, British, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, Belgian and Serbian) still carried swords as part of their field equipment. On mobilization in August 1914 all serving British Army officers were required to have their swords sharpened as the only peacetime use of the weapon had been for saluting on parade. The high visibility and limited practical use of the sword however led to it being abandoned within weeks, although most cavalry continued to carry sabres throughout the war. While retained as a symbol of rank and status by at least senior officers of infantry, artillery and other branches, the sword was usually left with non-essential baggage when units reached the front line. It was not until the late 1920s and early 1930s that this historic weapon was finally discarded for all but ceremonial purposes by most remaining horse mounted regiments of Europe and the Americas.

In China troops used the long anti-cavalry &quot;miao dao&quot; well into the Second Sino-Japanese War. The last units of British heavy cavalry switched to using armoured vehicles as late as 1938. Swords and other dedicated melee weapons were used occasionally by many countries during World War II, but typically as a secondary weapon as they were outclassed by coexisting firearms. A notable exception was the Imperial Japanese Army where, for cultural reasons, all officers and warrant officers carried the shin-gunto (&quot;new military sword&quot;) into battle from 1934 until 1945.

====Ceremonial use====
Swords are commonly worn as a ceremonial item by officers in many military and naval services throughout the world. Occasions to wear swords include any event in dress uniforms where the rank-and-file carry arms: parades, reviews, courts-martial, tattoos, and changes of command. They are also commonly worn for officers&#x27; weddings, and when wearing dress uniforms to church—although they are rarely actually worn in the church itself.

In the British forces they are also worn for any appearance at Court. In the United States, every Naval officer at or above the rank of Lieutenant Commander is required to own a sword, which can be prescribed for any formal outdoor ceremonial occasion; they are normally worn for changes of command and parades. For some Navy parades, cutlasses are issued to petty officers and chief petty officers.

In the U.S. Marine Corps every officer must own a sword, which is prescribed for formal parades and other ceremonies where dress uniforms are worn and the rank-and-file are under arms. On these occasions depending on their billet, Marine Non-Commissioned Officers (E-4 and above) may also be required to carry swords, which have hilts of a pattern similar to U.S. Naval officers&#x27; swords but are actually sabres. The USMC Model 1859 NCO Sword is the longest continuously issued edged weapon in the U.S. inventory

The Marine officer swords are of the Mameluke pattern which was adopted in 1825 in recognition of the Marines&#x27; key role in the capture of the Tripolitan city of Derna during the First Barbary War. Taken out of issue for approximately 20 years from 1855 until 1875, it was restored to service in the year of the Corps&#x27; centennial and has remained in issue since.

=====Religious=====
In the occult practices of Wicca, a sword or knife often referred to as an athame is used as a magical tool.

====Sword replicas====
The production of replicas of historical swords originates with 19th-century historicism. Contemporary replicas can range from cheap factory produced look-alikes to exact recreations of individual artifacts, including an approximation of the historical production methods.

Some kinds of swords are still commonly used today as weapons, often as a side arm for military infantry. The Japanese &quot;katana&quot;, &quot;wakizashi&quot; and &quot;tantō&quot; are carried by some infantry and officers in Japan and other parts of Asia and the &quot;kukri&quot; is the official melee weapon for Nepal. Other swords in use today are the sabre, the scimitar, the shortsword and the machete.
* In the case of a rat-tail tang, the maker welds a thin rod to the end of the blade at the crossguard; this rod goes through the grip.
* In traditional construction, Swordsmiths peened such tangs over the end of the pommel, or occasionally welded the hilt furniture to the tang and threaded the end for screwing on a pommel. This style is often referred to as a &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot; tang. Modern, less traditional, replicas often feature a threaded pommel or a pommel nut which holds the hilt together and allows dismantling.
* In a &quot;full&quot; tang (most commonly used in knives and machetes), the tang has about the same width as the blade, and is generally the same shape as the grip.

==Morphology==
The sword consists of the blade and the hilt. The term &quot;scabbard&quot; applies to the cover for the sword blade when not in use.

===Blade===
There is considerable variation in the detailed design of sword blades. The diagram opposite shows a typical Medieval European sword.

Early iron blades have rounded points due to the limited metallurgy of the time. These were still effective for thrusting against lightly armoured opponents. As armour advanced, blades were made narrower, stiffer and sharply pointed to defeat the armour by thrusting.

Dedicated cutting blades are wide and thin, and often have grooves known as fullers which lighten the blade at the cost of some of the blade&#x27;s stiffness. The edges of a cutting sword are almost parallel. Blades oriented for the thrust have thicker blades, sometimes with a distinct midrib for increased stiffness, with a strong taper and an acute point. The geometry of a cutting sword blade allows for acute edge angles. An edge with an acuter angle is more inclined to degrade quickly in combat situations than an edge with a more obtuse angle. Also, an acute edge angle is not the primary factor of a blade&#x27;s sharpness.

The part of the blade between the center of percussion (CoP) and the point is called the &quot;foible&quot; (weak) of the blade, and that between the center of balance (CoB) and the hilt is the &quot;forte&quot; (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the &quot;middle&quot;.

The &quot;ricasso&quot; or &quot;shoulder&quot; identifies a short section of blade immediately below the guard that is left completely unsharpened. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the German &quot;Zweihänder&quot;, a metal cover surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might grip it in one hand to wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter combat.
The ricasso normally bears the maker&#x27;s mark.

The tang is the extension of the blade to which the hilt is fitted.

On Japanese blades, the maker&#x27;s mark appears on the tang under the grip.

===Hilt===

The hilt is the collective term for the parts allowing for the handling and control of the blade; these consist of the grip, the pommel, and a simple or elaborate guard, which in post-Viking Age swords could consist of only a crossguard (called a cruciform hilt or quillons). The pommel was originally designed as a stop to prevent the sword slipping from the hand. From around the 11th century onward it became a counterbalance to the blade, allowing a more fluid style of fighting.
It can also be used as a blunt instrument at close range, and its weight affects the centre of percussion. In later times a &quot;sword knot&quot; or &quot;tassel&quot; was sometimes added. By the 17th century, with the growing use of firearms and the accompanying decline in the use of armour, many rapiers and dueling swords had developed elaborate basket hilts, which protect the palm of the wielder and rendered the gauntlet obsolete. By contrast, Japanese swords of the early modern period customarily used a small disc guard, or .

In late medieval and Renaissance era European swords, a flap of leather called the &quot;chappe&quot; or &quot;rain guard&quot; was attached to a sword&#x27;s crossguard at the base of the hilt to protect the mouth of the scabbard and prevent water from entering.

===Sword scabbards and suspension===
Common accessories to the sword include the scabbard and baldric, known as a &#x27;sword belt&#x27;.
* The scabbard, also known as the sheath, is a protective cover often provided for the sword blade. Scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade&#x27;s point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.
* A sword belt is a belt with an attachment for the sword&#x27;s scabbard, used to carry it when not in use. It is usually fixed to the scabbard of the sword, providing a fast means of drawing the sword in battle. Examples of sword belts include the Balteus used by the Roman legionary. Swords and sword belts continue in use for ceremonial occasions by military forces.

==Typology==
Sword typology is based on morphological criteria on the one hand (blade shape (cross-section, taper, and length), shape and size of the hilt and pommel), and age and place of origin on the other (Bronze Age, Iron Age, European (medieval, early modern, modern), Asian).

The relatively comprehensive Oakeshott typology was created by historian and illustrator Ewart Oakeshott as a way to define and catalogue European swords of the medieval period based on physical form, including blade shape and hilt configuration. The typology also focuses on the smaller, and in some cases contemporary, single-handed swords such as the arming sword.

===Single vs. double-edged===
As noted above, the terms longsword, broad sword, great sword, and Gaelic claymore are used relative to the era under consideration, and each term designates a particular type of sword.

====&quot;Jian&quot;====
In most Asian countries, a sword (&quot;jian&quot; 劍, geom (검), &quot;ken/tsurugi&quot; (剣) is a double-edged straight-bladed weapon, while a knife or sabre (&quot;dāo&quot; 刀, &quot;do&quot; (도), &quot;to/katana&quot; (刀) refers to a single-edged object.

====&quot;Kirpan&quot;====
Among the Sikhs, the sword is held in very high esteem. A single-edged sword is called a &quot;kirpan&quot;, and its double-edged counterpart a &quot;khanda&quot; or &quot;tegha&quot;.

====&quot;Churika&quot;====
The South Indian &quot;churika&quot; is a handheld double-edged sword traditionally used in the Malabar region of Kerala. It is also worshipped as the weapon of Vettakkorumakan, the hunter god in Hinduism.

====Backsword and falchion====
European terminology does give generic names for single-edged and double-edged blades but refers to specific types with the term &#x27;sword&#x27; covering them all. For example, the backsword may be so called because it is single-edged but the falchion which is also single-edged is given its own specific name.

===Single vs. two-handed use===
====Two-handed====
A two-handed sword is any sword that usually requires two hands to wield, or more specifically the very large swords of the 16th century.

Throughout history two-handed swords have generally been less common than their one-handed counterparts, one exception being their common use in Japan. Two-handed grips have two advantages: obviously they allow the strength of two hands to be used, not just one, but by spacing the hands apart they also allow a torque to be applied, rotating the sword in a slashing manner.

A two-handed grip may be needed for one of two reasons: either to wield a particularly large sword or else with the single-sided Japanese tachi for a slashing cut. Slashing swords may have distinctively long hilt grips to facilitate this.

====Hand and a half sword====
A Hand and a half sword, colloquially known as a &quot;bastard sword&quot;, was a sword with an extended grip and sometimes pommel so that it could be used with either one or two hands. Although these swords may not provide a full two-hand grip, they allowed its wielders to hold a shield or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow. These should not be confused with a longsword, two-handed sword, or Zweihänder, which were always intended to be used with two hands.

==Laws on carrying a sword==
The Visigothic Code of Ervig (680-687) made ownership of a sword mandatory for men joining the Visigothic army, regardless of whether the men were Goth or Roman. A number of Charlemagne capitularies made ownership of a sword mandatory, for example, those who owned a warhorse needed to also own a sword.

==In fiction==
In fantasy, magic swords often appear, based on their use in myth and legend. The science fiction counterpart to these is known as an energy sword (sometimes also referred to as a &quot;beam sword&quot; or &quot;laser sword&quot;), a sword whose blade consists of, or is augmented by, concentrated energy. A well known example of this type of sword is the lightsaber, shown in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

<text>In the part of mathematics referred to as topology, a surface is a two-dimensional manifold. Some surfaces arise as the boundaries of three-dimensional solid figures; for example, the sphere is the boundary of the solid ball. Other surfaces arise as graphs of functions of two variables; see the figure at right. However, surfaces can also be defined abstractly, without reference to any ambient space. For example, the Klein bottle is a surface that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space.

Topological surfaces are sometimes equipped with additional information, such as a Riemannian metric or a complex structure, that connects them to other disciplines within mathematics, such as differential geometry and complex analysis. The various mathematical notions of surface can be used to model surfaces in the physical world.

==In general==
In mathematics, a surface is a geometrical shape that resembles a deformed plane. The most familiar examples arise as boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, such as spheres. The exact definition of a surface may depend on the context. Typically, in algebraic geometry, a surface may cross itself (and may have other singularities), while, in topology and differential geometry, it may not.

A surface is a two-dimensional space; this means that a moving point on a surface may move in two directions (it has two degrees of freedom). In other words, around almost every point, there is a &quot;coordinate patch&quot; on which a two-dimensional coordinate system is defined. For example, the surface of the Earth resembles (ideally) a two-dimensional sphere, and latitude and longitude provide two-dimensional coordinates on it (except at the poles and along the 180th meridian).

The concept of surface is widely used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other disciplines, primarily in representing the surfaces of physical objects. For example, in analyzing the aerodynamic properties of an airplane, the central consideration is the flow of air along its surface.

==Definitions and first examples==
A &quot;(topological) surface&quot; is a topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the Euclidean plane E2. Such a neighborhood, together with the corresponding homeomorphism, is known as a &quot;(coordinate) chart&quot;. It is through this chart that the neighborhood inherits the standard coordinates on the Euclidean plane. These coordinates are known as &quot;local coordinates&quot; and these homeomorphisms lead us to describe surfaces as being &quot;locally Euclidean&quot;.

In most writings on the subject, it is often assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that as a topological space a surface is also nonempty, second-countable, and Hausdorff. It is also often assumed that the surfaces under consideration are connected.

The rest of this article will assume, unless specified otherwise, that a surface is nonempty, Hausdorff, second-countable, and connected.

More generally, a &quot;(topological) surface with boundary&quot; is a Hausdorff topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to some open subset of the closure of the upper half-plane H2 in C. These homeomorphisms are also known as &quot;(coordinate) charts&quot;. The boundary of the upper half-plane is the &quot;x&quot;-axis. A point on the surface mapped via a chart to the &quot;x&quot;-axis is termed a &quot;boundary point&quot;. The collection of such points is known as the &quot;boundary&quot; of the surface which is necessarily a one-manifold, that is, the union of closed curves. On the other hand, a point mapped to above the &quot;x&quot;-axis is an &quot;interior point&quot;. The collection of interior points is the &quot;interior&quot; of the surface which is always non-empty. The closed disk is a simple example of a surface with boundary. The boundary of the disc is a circle.

The term &quot;surface&quot; used without qualification refers to surfaces without boundary. In particular, a surface with empty boundary is a surface in the usual sense. A surface with empty boundary which is compact is known as a &#x27;closed&#x27; surface. The two-dimensional sphere, the two-dimensional torus, and the real projective plane are examples of closed surfaces.

The Möbius strip is a surface on which the distinction between clockwise and counterclockwise can be defined locally, but not globally. In general, a surface is said to be &quot;orientable&quot; if it does not contain a homeomorphic copy of the Möbius strip; intuitively, it has two distinct &quot;sides&quot;. For example, the sphere and torus are orientable, while the real projective plane is not (because the real projective plane with one point removed is homeomorphic to the open Möbius strip).

In differential and algebraic geometry, extra structure is added upon the topology of the surface. This added structure can be a smoothness structure (making it possible to define differentiable maps to and from the surface), a Riemannian metric (making it possible to define length and angles on the surface), a complex structure (making it possible to define holomorphic maps to and from the surface—in which case the surface is called a Riemann surface), or an algebraic structure (making it possible to detect singularities, such as self-intersections and cusps, that cannot be described solely in terms of the underlying topology).

==Extrinsically defined surfaces and embeddings==
Historically, surfaces were initially defined as subspaces of Euclidean spaces. Often, these surfaces were the locus of zeros of certain functions, usually polynomial functions. Such a definition considered the surface as part of a larger (Euclidean) space, and as such was termed &quot;extrinsic&quot;.

In the previous section, a surface is defined as a topological space with certain properties, namely Hausdorff and locally Euclidean. This topological space is not considered a subspace of another space. In this sense, the definition given above, which is the definition that mathematicians use at present, is &quot;intrinsic&quot;.

A surface defined as intrinsic is not required to satisfy the added constraint of being a subspace of Euclidean space. It may seem possible for some surfaces defined intrinsically to not be surfaces in the extrinsic sense. However, the Whitney embedding theorem asserts every surface can in fact be embedded homeomorphically into Euclidean space, in fact into E4: The extrinsic and intrinsic approaches turn out to be equivalent.

In fact, any compact surface that is either orientable or has a boundary can be embedded in E3; on the other hand, the real projective plane, which is compact, non-orientable and without boundary, cannot be embedded into E3 (see Gramain). Steiner surfaces, including Boy&#x27;s surface, the Roman surface and the cross-cap, are models of the real projective plane in E3, but only the Boy surface is an immersed surface. All these models are singular at points where they intersect themselves.

The Alexander horned sphere is a well-known pathological embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere.
The chosen embedding (if any) of a surface into another space is regarded as extrinsic information; it is not essential to the surface itself. For example, a torus can be embedded into E3 in the &quot;standard&quot; manner (which looks like a bagel) or in a knotted manner (see figure). The two embedded tori are homeomorphic, but not isotopic: They are topologically equivalent, but their embeddings are not.

The image of a continuous, injective function from R2 to higher-dimensional Rn is said to be a parametric surface. Such an image is so-called because the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;- directions of the domain R2 are 2 variables that parametrize the image. A parametric surface need not be a topological surface. A surface of revolution can be viewed as a special kind of parametric surface.

If &quot;f&quot; is a smooth function from R3 to R whose gradient is nowhere zero, then the locus of zeros of &quot;f&quot; does define a surface, known as an &quot;implicit surface&quot;. If the condition of non-vanishing gradient is dropped, then the zero locus may develop singularities.
==Construction from polygons==
Each closed surface can be constructed from an oriented polygon with an even number of sides, called a fundamental polygon of the surface, by pairwise identification of its edges. For example, in each polygon below, attaching the sides with matching labels (&quot;A&quot; with &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; with &quot;B&quot;), so that the arrows point in the same direction, yields the indicated surface.

Any fundamental polygon can be written symbolically as follows. Begin at any vertex, and proceed around the perimeter of the polygon in either direction until returning to the starting vertex. During this traversal, record the label on each edge in order, with an exponent of -1 if the edge points opposite to the direction of traversal. The four models above, when traversed clockwise starting at the upper left, yield

* sphere: formula_1
* real projective plane: formula_2
* torus: formula_3
* Klein bottle: formula_4.
Note that the sphere and the projective plane can both be realized as quotients of the 2-gon, while the torus and Klein bottle require a 4-gon (square).

The expression thus derived from a fundamental polygon of a surface turns out to be the sole relation in a presentation of the fundamental group of the surface with the polygon edge labels as generators. This is a consequence of the Seifert–van Kampen theorem.

Gluing edges of polygons is a special kind of quotient space process. The quotient concept can be applied in greater generality to produce new or alternative constructions of surfaces. For example, the real projective plane can be obtained as the quotient of the sphere by identifying all pairs of opposite points on the sphere. Another example of a quotient is the connected sum.

==Connected sums==
The connected sum of two surfaces &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, denoted &quot;M&quot; # &quot;N&quot;, is obtained by removing a disk from each of them and gluing them along the boundary components that result. The boundary of a disk is a circle, so these boundary components are circles. The Euler characteristic formula_5 of is the sum of the Euler characteristics of the summands, minus two:

:formula_6

The sphere S is an identity element for the connected sum, meaning that . This is because deleting a disk from the sphere leaves a disk, which simply replaces the disk deleted from &quot;M&quot; upon gluing.

Connected summation with the torus T is also described as attaching a &quot;handle&quot; to the other summand &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;M&quot; is orientable, then so is . The connected sum is associative, so the connected sum of a finite collection of surfaces is well-defined.

The connected sum of two real projective planes, , is the Klein bottle K. The connected sum of the real projective plane and the Klein bottle is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus; in a formula, . Thus, the connected sum of three real projective planes is homeomorphic to the connected sum of the real projective plane with the torus. Any connected sum involving a real projective plane is nonorientable.

== Closed surfaces ==
A closed surface is a surface that is compact and without boundary. Examples of closed surfaces include the sphere, the torus and the Klein bottle. Examples of non-closed surfaces include an open disk (which is a sphere with a puncture), an open cylinder (which is a sphere with two punctures), and the Möbius strip.

A surface embedded in three-dimensional space is closed if and only if it is the boundary of a solid. As with any closed manifold, a surface embedded in Euclidean space that is closed with respect to the inherited Euclidean topology is &quot;not&quot; necessarily a closed surface; for example, a disk embedded in formula_7 that contains its boundary is a surface that is topologically closed but not a closed surface.

=== Classification of closed surfaces ===
The &quot;classification theorem of closed surfaces&quot; states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:
# the sphere,
# the connected sum of &quot;g&quot; tori for &quot;g&quot; ≥ 1,
# the connected sum of &quot;k&quot; real projective planes for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1.

The surfaces in the first two families are orientable. It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number &quot;g&quot; of tori involved is called the &quot;genus&quot; of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of &quot;g&quot; tori is .

The surfaces in the third family are nonorientable. The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of &quot;k&quot; of them is .

It follows that a closed surface is determined, up to homeomorphism, by two pieces of information: its Euler characteristic, and whether it is orientable or not. In other words, Euler characteristic and orientability completely classify closed surfaces up to homeomorphism.

Closed surfaces with multiple connected components are classified by the class of each of their connected components, and thus one generally assumes that the surface is connected.

=== Monoid structure ===
Relating this classification to connected sums, the closed surfaces up to homeomorphism form a commutative monoid under the operation of connected sum, as indeed do manifolds of any fixed dimension. The identity is the sphere, while the real projective plane and the torus generate this monoid, with a single relation , which may also be written , since . This relation is sometimes known as &#x27; after Walther von Dyck, who proved it in , and the triple cross surface is accordingly called &#x27;.

Geometrically, connect-sum with a torus () adds a handle with both ends attached to the same side of the surface, while connect-sum with a Klein bottle () adds a handle with the two ends attached to opposite sides of an orientable surface; in the presence of a projective plane (), the surface is not orientable (there is no notion of side), so there is no difference between attaching a torus and attaching a Klein bottle, which explains the relation.

=== Proof ===
The classification of closed surfaces has been known since the 1860s, and today a number of proofs exist.

Topological and combinatorial proofs in general rely on the difficult result that every compact 2-manifold is homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, which is of interest in its own right. The most common proof of the classification is , which brings every triangulated surface to a standard form. A simplified proof, which avoids a standard form, was discovered by John H. Conway circa 1992, which he called the &quot;Zero Irrelevancy Proof&quot; or &quot;ZIP proof&quot; and is presented in .

A geometric proof, which yields a stronger geometric result, is the uniformization theorem. This was originally proven only for Riemann surfaces in the 1880s and 1900s by Felix Klein, Paul Koebe, and Henri Poincaré.

== Surfaces with boundary ==
Compact surfaces, possibly with boundary, are simply closed surfaces with a finite number of holes (open discs that have been removed). Thus, a connected compact surface is classified by the number of boundary components and the genus of the corresponding closed surface – equivalently, by the number of boundary components, the orientability, and Euler characteristic. The genus of a compact surface is defined as the genus of the corresponding closed surface.

This classification follows almost immediately from the classification of closed surfaces: removing an open disc from a closed surface yields a compact surface with a circle for boundary component, and removing &quot;k&quot; open discs yields a compact surface with &quot;k&quot; disjoint circles for boundary components. The precise locations of the holes are irrelevant, because the homeomorphism group acts &quot;k&quot;-transitively on any connected manifold of dimension at least 2.

Conversely, the boundary of a compact surface is a closed 1-manifold, and is therefore the disjoint union of a finite number of circles; filling these circles with disks (formally, taking the cone) yields a closed surface.

The unique compact orientable surface of genus &quot;g&quot; and with &quot;k&quot; boundary components is often denoted formula_8 for example in the study of the mapping class group.

== Non-compact surfaces ==
Non-compact surfaces are more difficult to classify. As a simple example, a non-compact surface can be obtained by puncturing (removing a finite set of points from) a closed manifold. On the other hand, any open subset of a compact surface is itself a non-compact surface; consider, for example, the complement of a Cantor set in the sphere, otherwise known as the Cantor tree surface. However, not every non-compact surface is a subset of a compact surface; two canonical counterexamples are the Jacob&#x27;s ladder and the Loch Ness monster, which are non-compact surfaces with infinite genus.

A non-compact surface &quot;M&quot; has a non-empty space of ends &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;), which informally speaking describes the ways that the surface &quot;goes off to infinity&quot;. The space &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is always topologically equivalent to a closed subspace of the Cantor set. &quot;M&quot; may have a finite or countably infinite number Nh of handles, as well as a finite or countably infinite number &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; of projective planes. If both &quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; are finite, then these two numbers, and the topological type of space of ends, classify the surface &quot;M&quot; up to topological equivalence. If either or both of &quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;p&quot; is infinite, then the topological type of M depends not only on these two numbers but also on how the infinite one(s) approach the space of ends. In general the topological type of M is determined by the four subspaces of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) that are limit points of infinitely many handles and infinitely many projective planes, limit points of only handles, limit points of only projective planes, and limit points of neither.

== Assumption of second-countability ==

If one removes the assumption of second-countability from the definition of a surface, there exist (necessarily non-compact) topological surfaces having no countable base for their topology. Perhaps the simplest example is the Cartesian product of the long line with the space of real numbers.

Another surface having no countable base for its topology, but &quot;not&quot; requiring the Axiom of Choice to prove its existence, is the Prüfer manifold, which can be described by simple equations that show it to be a real-analytic surface. The Prüfer manifold may be thought of as the upper half plane together with one additional &quot;tongue&quot; &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; hanging down from it directly below the point (&quot;x&quot;,0), for each real &quot;x&quot;.

In 1925, Tibor Radó proved that all Riemann surfaces (i.e., one-dimensional complex manifolds) are necessarily second-countable (Radó&#x27;s theorem). By contrast, if one replaces the real numbers in the construction of the Prüfer surface by the complex numbers, one obtains a two-dimensional complex manifold (which is necessarily a 4-dimensional real manifold) with no countable base.

==Surfaces in geometry==
Polyhedra, such as the boundary of a cube, are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry. It is also possible to define &quot;smooth surfaces&quot;, in which each point has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to some open set in E2. This elaboration allows calculus to be applied to surfaces to prove many results.

Two smooth surfaces are diffeomorphic if and only if they are homeomorphic. (The analogous result does not hold for higher-dimensional manifolds.) Thus closed surfaces are classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.

Smooth surfaces equipped with Riemannian metrics are of foundational importance in differential geometry. A Riemannian metric endows a surface with notions of geodesic, distance, angle, and area. It also gives rise to Gaussian curvature, which describes how curved or bent the surface is at each point. Curvature is a rigid, geometric property, in that it is not preserved by general diffeomorphisms of the surface. However, the famous Gauss–Bonnet theorem for closed surfaces states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature &quot;K&quot; over the entire surface &quot;S&quot; is determined by the Euler characteristic:
:formula_9
This result exemplifies the deep relationship between the geometry and topology of surfaces (and, to a lesser extent, higher-dimensional manifolds).

Another way in which surfaces arise in geometry is by passing into the complex domain. A complex one-manifold is a smooth oriented surface, also called a Riemann surface. Any complex nonsingular algebraic curve viewed as a complex manifold is a Riemann surface. In fact, every compact orientable surface is realizable as a Riemann surface. Thus compact Riemann surfaces are characterized topologically by their genus: 0, 1, 2, ... On the other hand, the genus does not characterize the complex structure. For example, there are uncountably many non-isomorphic compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1 (the elliptic curves).

Complex structures on a closed oriented surface correspond to conformal equivalence classes of Riemannian metrics on the surface. One version of the uniformization theorem (due to Poincaré) states that any Riemannian metric on an oriented, closed surface is conformally equivalent to an essentially unique metric of constant curvature. This provides a starting point for one of the approaches to Teichmüller theory, which provides a finer classification of Riemann surfaces than the topological one by Euler characteristic alone.

A &quot;complex surface&quot; is a complex two-manifold and thus a real four-manifold; it is not a surface in the sense of this article. Neither are algebraic curves defined over fields other than the complex numbers,
nor are algebraic surfaces defined over fields other than the real numbers.

<doc id="27873" wikidata="Q229102" url="?curid=27873" title="Surjective function">
<text>In mathematics, a surjective function (also known as surjection, or onto function ) is a function such that, for every element of the function&#x27;s codomain, there exists one element in the function&#x27;s domain such that . In other words, for a function , the codomain is the image of the function&#x27;s domain . It is not required that be unique; the function may map one or more elements of to the same element of .

The term &quot;surjective&quot; and the related terms &quot;injective&quot; and &quot;bijective&quot; were introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki, a group of mainly French 20th-century mathematicians who, under this pseudonym, wrote a series of books presenting an exposition of modern advanced mathematics, beginning in 1935. The French word &quot;&quot; means &quot;over&quot; or &quot;above&quot;, and relates to the fact that the image of the domain of a surjective function completely covers the function&#x27;s codomain.

Any function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to the image of its domain. Every surjective function has a right inverse assuming the axiom of choice, and every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The composition of surjective functions is always surjective. Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection.

==Definition==

A surjective function is a function whose image is equal to its codomain. Equivalently, a function formula_1 with domain formula_2 and codomain formula_3 is surjective if for every formula_4 in formula_3 there exists at least one formula_6 in formula_2 with formula_8. Surjections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow (), as in formula_9.

Symbolically,

:If formula_10, then formula_1 is said to be surjective if

:formula_12.

==Examples==

* For any set &quot;X&quot;, the identity function id&quot;X&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is surjective.
* The function defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot; mod 2 (that is, even integers are mapped to 0 and odd integers to 1) is surjective.
* The function defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 2&quot;x&quot; + 1 is surjective (and even bijective), because for every real number &quot;y&quot;, we have an &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;: such an appropriate &quot;x&quot; is (&quot;y&quot; − 1)/2.
* The function defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;3 − 3&quot;x&quot; is surjective, because the pre-image of any real number &quot;y&quot; is the solution set of the cubic polynomial equation &quot;x&quot;3 − 3&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot; = 0, and every cubic polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root. However, this function is not injective (and hence not bijective), since, for example, the pre-image of &quot;y&quot; = 2 is {&quot;x&quot; = −1, &quot;x&quot; = 2}. (In fact, the pre-image of this function for every &quot;y&quot;, −2 ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ 2 has more than one element.)
* The function defined by &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 is &quot;not&quot; surjective, since there is no real number &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;2 = −1. However, the function defined by (with the restricted codomain) &quot;is&quot; surjective, since for every &quot;y&quot; in the nonnegative real codomain &quot;Y&quot;, there is at least one &quot;x&quot; in the real domain &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;y&quot;.
* The natural logarithm function is a surjective and even bijective (mapping from the set of positive real numbers to the set of all real numbers). Its inverse, the exponential function, if defined with the set of real numbers as the domain and the codomain, is not surjective (as its range is the set of positive real numbers). 
* The matrix exponential is not surjective when seen as a map from the space of all &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrices to itself. It is, however, usually defined as a map from the space of all &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; matrices to the general linear group of degree &quot;n&quot; (that is, the group of all &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; invertible matrices). Under this definition, the matrix exponential is surjective for complex matrices, although still not surjective for real matrices.
* The projection from a cartesian product to one of its factors is surjective, unless the other factor is empty.
* In a 3D video game, vectors are projected onto a 2D flat screen by means of a surjective function.

==Properties==
A function is bijective if and only if it is both surjective and injective.

If (as is often done) a function is identified with its graph, then surjectivity is not a property of the function itself, but rather a property of the mapping. This is, the function together with its codomain. Unlike injectivity, surjectivity cannot be read off of the graph of the function alone.

===Surjections as right invertible functions===
The function is said to be a right inverse of the function if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) = &quot;y&quot; for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;g&quot; can be undone by &quot;f&quot;). In other words, &quot;g&quot; is a right inverse of &quot;f&quot; if the composition of &quot;g&quot; and &quot;f&quot; in that order is the identity function on the domain &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;g&quot;. The function &quot;g&quot; need not be a complete inverse of &quot;f&quot; because the composition in the other order, , may not be the identity function on the domain &quot;X&quot; of &quot;f&quot;. In other words, &quot;f&quot; can undo or &quot;reverse&quot; &quot;g&quot;, but cannot necessarily be reversed by it.

Every function with a right inverse is necessarily a surjection. The proposition that every surjective function has a right inverse is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

If is surjective and &quot;B&quot; is a subset of &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;f&quot; −1(&quot;B&quot;)) = &quot;B&quot;. Thus, &quot;B&quot; can be recovered from its preimage .

For example, in the first illustration in the gallery, there is some function &quot;g&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) = 4. There is also some function &quot;f&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(4) = &quot;C&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t matter that &quot;g&quot; is not unique (it would also work if &quot;g&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) equals 3); it only matters that &quot;f&quot; &quot;reverses&quot; &quot;g&quot;.

===Surjections as epimorphisms===
A function is surjective if and only if it is right-cancellative: given any functions , whenever &quot;g&quot; &quot;f&quot; = &quot;h&quot; &quot;f&quot;, then &quot;g&quot; = &quot;h&quot;. This property is formulated in terms of functions and their composition and can be generalized to the more general notion of the morphisms of a category and their composition. Right-cancellative morphisms are called epimorphisms. Specifically, surjective functions are precisely the epimorphisms in the category of sets. The prefix &quot;epi&quot; is derived from the Greek preposition &quot;ἐπί&quot; meaning &quot;over&quot;, &quot;above&quot;, &quot;on&quot;.

Any morphism with a right inverse is an epimorphism, but the converse is not true in general. A right inverse &quot;g&quot; of a morphism &quot;f&quot; is called a section of &quot;f&quot;. A morphism with a right inverse is called a split epimorphism.

===Surjections as binary relations===
Any function with domain &quot;X&quot; and codomain &quot;Y&quot; can be seen as a left-total and right-unique binary relation between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; by identifying it with its function graph. A surjective function with domain &quot;X&quot; and codomain &quot;Y&quot; is then a binary relation between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; that is right-unique and both left-total and right-total.

===Cardinality of the domain of a surjection===
The cardinality of the domain of a surjective function is greater than or equal to the cardinality of its codomain: If is a surjective function, then &quot;X&quot; has at least as many elements as &quot;Y&quot;, in the sense of cardinal numbers. (The proof appeals to the axiom of choice to show that a function
 satisfying &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)) = &quot;y&quot; for all &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; exists. &quot;g&quot; is easily seen to be injective, thus the formal definition of |&quot;Y&quot;| ≤ |&quot;X&quot;| is satisfied.)

Specifically, if both &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are finite with the same number of elements, then is surjective if and only if &quot;f&quot; is injective.

Given two sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the notation is used to say that either &quot;X&quot; is empty or that there is a surjection from &quot;Y&quot; onto &quot;X&quot;. Using the axiom of choice one can show that and together imply that |&quot;Y&quot;| = |&quot;X&quot;|, a variant of the Schröder–Bernstein theorem.

===Composition and decomposition===
The composition of surjective functions is always surjective: If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are both surjective, and the codomain of &quot;g&quot; is equal to the domain of &quot;f&quot;, then is surjective. Conversely, if is surjective, then &quot;f&quot; is surjective (but &quot;g&quot;, the function applied first, need not be). These properties generalize from surjections in the category of sets to any epimorphisms in any category.

Any function can be decomposed into a surjection and an injection: For any function there exist a surjection and an injection such that &quot;h&quot; = &quot;g&quot; &quot;f&quot;. To see this, define &quot;Y&quot; to be the set of preimages where &quot;z&quot; is in . These preimages are disjoint and partition &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;f&quot; carries each &quot;x&quot; to the element of &quot;Y&quot; which contains it, and &quot;g&quot; carries each element of &quot;Y&quot; to the point in &quot;Z&quot; to which &quot;h&quot; sends its points. Then &quot;f&quot; is surjective since it is a projection map, and &quot;g&quot; is injective by definition.

===Induced surjection and induced bijection===
Any function induces a surjection by restricting its codomain to its range. Any surjective function induces a bijection defined on a quotient of its domain by collapsing all arguments mapping to a given fixed image. More precisely, every surjection can be factored as a projection followed by a bijection as follows. Let &quot;A&quot;/~ be the equivalence classes of &quot;A&quot; under the following equivalence relation: &quot;x&quot; ~ &quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). Equivalently, &quot;A&quot;/~ is the set of all preimages under &quot;f&quot;. Let &quot;P&quot;(~) : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot;/~ be the projection map which sends each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;A&quot; to its equivalence class [&quot;x&quot;]~, and let &quot;f&quot;&quot;P&quot; : &quot;A&quot;/~ → &quot;B&quot; be the well-defined function given by &quot;f&quot;&quot;P&quot;([&quot;x&quot;]~) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Then &quot;f&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;P&quot; o &quot;P&quot;(~).

== The set of surjections ==
Given fixed finite sets and , one can form the set of surjections . The cardinality of this set is one of the twelve aspects of Rota&#x27;s Twelvefold way, and is given by formula_13, where formula_14 denotes a Stirling number of the second kind.

<doc id="27875" wikidata="Q180619" url="?curid=27875" title="Stephen Jay Gould">
<text>Stephen Jay Gould ( ; September 10, 1941 – May 20, 2002) was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science. He was one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation. Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, after which he divided his time teaching between there and Harvard.

Gould&#x27;s most significant contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching speciation. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.

Most of Gould&#x27;s empirical research was based on the land snail genera &quot;Poecilozonites&quot; and &quot;Cerion&quot;. He also made important contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, receiving broad professional recognition for his book &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot;. In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or &quot;non-overlapping magisteria&quot;) whose authorities do not overlap.

Gould was known by the general public mainly for his 300 popular essays in &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine, and his numerous books written for both the specialist and non-specialist.
In April 2000, the US Library of Congress named him a &quot;Living Legend&quot;.

==Biography==
Stephen Jay Gould was born in Queens, New York, on September 10, 1941. His father Leonard was a court stenographer and a World War II veteran of the United States Navy. His mother Eleanor was an artist, whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the city&#x27;s Garment District. Gould and his younger brother Peter were raised in Bayside, a middle-class neighborhood in the northeastern section of Queens. He attended P.S. 26 elementary school and graduated from Jamaica High School.

When Gould was five years old his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History, where he first encountered &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. &quot;I had no idea there were such things—I was awestruck,&quot; Gould once recalled. It was in that moment that he decided to become a paleontologist.

Raised in a secular Jewish home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called an agnostic. When asked directly if he was an agnostic in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, he responded:

Though he &quot;had been brought up by a Marxist father&quot; he stated that his father&#x27;s politics were &quot;very different&quot; from his own. In describing his own political views, he has said they &quot;tend to the left of center.&quot; According to Gould the most influential political books he read were C. Wright Mills&#x27; &quot;The Power Elite&quot; and the political writings of Noam Chomsky.

While attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice. When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked. Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and sexism.

Interspersed throughout his scientific essays for &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine, Gould frequently referred to his non-scientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained an avid New York Yankees fan throughout his life. As an adult he was fond of science fiction movies, but often lamented their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and delighted in city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.

=== Marriage and family ===
Gould married artist Deborah Lee on October 3, 1965. Gould met Lee while they were students together at Antioch College. They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan, and were married for 30 years. His second marriage in 1995 was to artist and sculptor Rhonda Roland Shearer.

===First bout of cancer===
In July 1982 Gould was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer affecting the abdominal lining (the peritoneum). This cancer is frequently found in people who have ingested or inhaled asbestos fibers, a mineral which was used in the construction of Harvard&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology. After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for &quot;Discover&quot; magazine in 1985 titled &quot;The Median Isn&#x27;t the Message&quot;, which discusses his reaction to reading that &quot;mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery.&quot; In his essay, he describes the actual significance behind this fact, and his relief upon recognizing that statistical averages are useful abstractions, and by themselves do not encompass &quot;our actual world of variation, shadings, and continua.&quot;

Gould was also an advocate of medical cannabis. When undergoing his cancer treatments he smoked marijuana to help alleviate the long periods of intense and uncontrollable nausea. According to Gould, the drug had a &quot;most important effect&quot; on his eventual recovery. He later complained that he could not understand how &quot;any humane person would withhold such a beneficial substance from people in such great need simply because others use it for different purposes.&quot; On August 5, 1998, Gould&#x27;s testimony assisted in the successful lawsuit of HIV activist Jim Wakeford, who sued the Government of Canada for the right to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes.

===Final illness and death===
In February 2002, a lesion was found on Gould&#x27;s chest radiograph, and oncologists diagnosed him with stage IV cancer. Gould died 10 weeks later on May 20, 2002, from a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, an aggressive form of cancer which had already spread to his brain, liver, and spleen. This cancer was unrelated to his previous bout of abdominal cancer in 1982, though it is also associated with asbestos exposure. He died in his home &quot;in a bed set up in the library of his SoHo loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved.&quot;

==Scientific career==
Gould began his higher education at Antioch College, graduating with a double major in geology and philosophy in 1963. During this time, he also studied at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. After completing graduate work at Columbia University in 1967 under the guidance of Norman Newell, he was immediately hired by Harvard University, where he worked until the end of his life (1967–2002). In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the institution&#x27;s Museum of Comparative Zoology.

In 1982, Harvard awarded him the title of Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. That same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1983, he was awarded a fellowship at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he later served as president (1999–2001). The AAAS news release cited his &quot;numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science.&quot; He also served as president of the Paleontological Society (1985–1986) and of the Society for the Study of Evolution (1990–1991).

In 1989, Gould was elected into the body of the National Academy of Sciences. Through 1996–2002 Gould was Vincent Astor Visiting research professor of biology at New York University. In 2001, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year for his lifetime of work. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Darwin–Wallace Medal, along with 12 other recipients. (Until 2008, this medal had been awarded every 50 years by the Linnean Society of London.)

===Punctuated equilibrium===
Early in his career, Gould and his colleague Niles Eldredge developed the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which describes the rate of speciation in the fossil record as occurring relatively rapidly, which then alternates to a longer period of evolutionary stability. It was Gould who coined the term &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot; though the theory was originally presented by Eldredge in his doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and his article published the previous year on allopatric speciation.

According to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar &quot;in the central logic of Darwinian theory.&quot; Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was &quot;of great interest to biology generally,&quot; it merely modified neo-Darwinism in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before.
Other biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been &quot;unexpected by most evolutionary biologists&quot; and &quot;had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.&quot;

Comparisons were made to George Gaylord Simpson&#x27;s work in &quot;Tempo and Mode in Evolution&quot; (1941), in which he also illustrated relatively sudden changes along evolutionary lines. Simpson describes the paleontological record as being characterized by predominantly gradual change (which he termed horotely), although he also documented examples of slow (bradytely), and rapid (tachytely) rates of evolution. Punctuated equilibrium and phyletic gradualism are not mutually exclusive (as Simpson&#x27;s work demonstrates), and examples of each have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to Richard Dawkins has been oversold by the media.
Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as &quot;evolution by jerks&quot;,
which prompted Gould to describe phyletic gradualism as &quot;evolution by creeps.&quot;

===Evolutionary developmental biology===

Gould made significant contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work &quot;Ontogeny and Phylogeny&quot;. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould&#x27;s influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.

===Selectionism and sociobiology===
Gould was a champion of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.

====Against &quot;Sociobiology&quot;====
In 1975, Gould&#x27;s Harvard colleague E. O. Wilson introduced his analysis of animal behavior (including human behavior) based on a sociobiological framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary basis. In response, Gould, Richard Lewontin, and others from the Boston area wrote the subsequently well-referenced letter to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; entitled, &quot;Against &#x27;Sociobiology&#x27;&quot;. This open letter criticized Wilson&#x27;s notion of a &quot;deterministic view of human society and human action.&quot;

But Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior, and later wrote: &quot;Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism—previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior... Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.&quot;

====Spandrels and the Panglossian paradigm====

With Richard Lewontin, Gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled, &quot;The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm&quot;,
which introduced the architectural term &quot;spandrel&quot; into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a triangular space which exists over the haunches of an arch. Spandrels—more often called pendentives in this context—are found particularly in classical architecture, especially Byzantine and Renaissance churches.

When visiting Venice in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels of the San Marco cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as &quot;necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches.&quot; Gould and Lewontin thus defined &quot;spandrels&quot; in the evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed examples include the &quot;masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive use of an umbilicus as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality.&quot;

In Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;, Dr. Pangloss is portrayed as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that &quot;all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds&quot;. Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology.
An illustrative example of Gould&#x27;s approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd&#x27;s case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways. Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay &quot;Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples,&quot; prompted by Lloyd&#x27;s earlier work.

Gould was criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett for using the term spandrel instead of pendentive, a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of &quot;American Scientist&quot;, noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in architectural theory. Mark concluded, &quot;Gould and Lewontin&#x27;s misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett&#x27;s critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question.&quot;

===Evolutionary progress===
Gould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term &quot;progress&quot;. Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution&#x27;s drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because life is constrained to begin with a simple starting point (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with parasites.

In a review of &quot;Full House&quot;, Richard Dawkins approved of Gould&#x27;s general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a &quot;tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive.&quot;

===Cultural evolution===
Gould&#x27;s arguments against progress in evolutionary biology did not extend towards a notion of progress in general or notions of cultural evolution. In &quot;Full House&quot;, Gould compares two notions of progress against one another. While the first concept of progress, evolutionary progress, is argued to be invalid for a number of biological considerations, Gould permits that evolution may operate in human cultural evolution through a Lamarckian mechanism. Gould goes on to argue that the disappearance of the 0.400 batting average in baseball is paradoxically due to the inclusion of better players in the league, rather than players becoming worse over time. In his view such a process is likely reflective in a number of cultural phenomena including sports, the visual arts, and music where, unlike in biological systems, the realm of aesthetic possibilities is constrained by a &quot;right wall&quot; of human limits and aesthetic preferences. Gould later goes on to state that his arguments for biological evolution should not be applied to cultural change lest they be employed by, &quot;so-called &#x27;political correctness&#x27; as a doctrine that celebrates all indigenous practice, and therefore permits no distinctions, judgements, or analyses.&quot;

===Cladistics===
Gould never embraced cladistics as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.

===Technical work on land snails===

Most of Gould&#x27;s empirical research pertained to land snails. He focused his early work on the Bermudian genus &quot;Poecilozonites&quot;, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus &quot;Cerion&quot;. According to Gould &quot;&quot;Cerion&quot; is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they&#x27;re not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we&#x27;d learn something general about the evolution of form.&quot;

Given &quot;Cerion&quot; extensive geographic diversity, Gould later lamented that if Christopher Columbus had only catalogued a single &quot;Cerion&quot; it would have ended the scholarly debate about which island Columbus had first set foot on in America.

===Influence===
Gould is one of the most frequently cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His 1979 &quot;spandrels&quot; paper has been cited more than 5,000 times. In &quot;Paleobiology&quot;—the flagship journal of his own speciality—only Charles Darwin and George Gaylord Simpson have been cited more often. Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science. Historian Ronald Numbers has been quoted as saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t say much about Gould&#x27;s strengths as a scientist, but for a long time I&#x27;ve regarded him as the second most influential historian of science (next to Thomas Kuhn).&quot; Gould&#x27;s undergraduate course, Science B-16: History of the Earth and Life, was taught in a Harvard Science Center lecture hall with a 250-seat capacity. Science B-16 was so oversubscribed that an annual lottery was held to see which students would be allowed to enroll in the course. If a student was denied course enrollment three times, then their fourth entry into the lottery provided them with a guaranteed seat in the class.

===&quot;The Structure of Evolutionary Theory&quot;===
Shortly before his death, Gould published &quot;The Structure of Evolutionary Theory&quot; (2002), a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory. In an interview for the Dutch TV series &quot;Of Beauty and Consolation&quot; Gould remarked, &quot;In a couple of years I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It&#x27;s going to be far too long, and it&#x27;s only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I&#x27;ve struggled with all my life.&quot;

===As a public figure===
Gould became widely known through his popular essays on evolution in the &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled &quot;This View of Life&quot; (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;) from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays. Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as &quot;Ever Since Darwin&quot; and &quot;The Panda&#x27;s Thumb&quot;, &quot;Hen&#x27;s Teeth and Horse&#x27;s Toes&quot;, and &quot;The Flamingo&#x27;s Smile&quot;.

A passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book &quot;Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville&quot; (2003).

Although a self-described Darwinist, Gould&#x27;s emphasis was less gradualist and reductionist than most neo-Darwinists. He fiercely opposed many aspects of sociobiology and its intellectual descendant evolutionary psychology. He devoted considerable time to fighting against creationism, creation science, and intelligent design. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot;. Gould later developed the term &quot;non-overlapping magisteria&quot; (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other&#x27;s realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books &quot;Rocks of Ages&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister&#x27;s Pox&quot; (2003). In a 1982 essay for &quot;Natural History&quot; Gould wrote:

Gould also spoke out against creationist misuse of his work and theory, especially with respect to how his theory of punctuated equilibrium relates to the presence of transitional fossils or forms:

An anti-evolution petition drafted by the Discovery Institute inspired the National Center for Science Education to create a pro-evolution counterpart called &quot;Project Steve,&quot; which is named in Gould&#x27;s honor. In 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Gould for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s &quot;Pantheon of Skeptics&quot; created to remember the legacy of deceased CSI fellows and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

Gould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on television. In 1984 Gould received his own &quot;NOVA&quot; special on PBS. Other appearances included interviews on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Talkback Live&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and regular appearances on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; show. Gould was also a guest in all seven episodes of the Dutch talk series &quot;A Glorious Accident&quot;, in which he appeared with his close friend Oliver Sacks.

Gould was featured prominently as a guest in Ken Burns&#x27;s PBS documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;, as well as PBS&#x27;s &quot;Evolution&quot; series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential Children&#x27;s Television Workshop television show &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot;, where he made frequent guest appearances.

Since 2013, Gould has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

In 1997, he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the episode &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot;, Lisa finds a skeleton that many people believe is an apocalyptic angel. Lisa contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton&#x27;s DNA. The fossil is discovered to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall. During production, the only phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as the &quot;world&#x27;s most brilliant paleontologist&quot;. In 2002, the show paid tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the season 13 finale to his memory. Gould had died two days before the episode aired.

== The &quot;Darwin Wars&quot; ==
Gould received many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural history, but a number of biologists felt his public presentations were out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking. The public debates between Gould&#x27;s supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed &quot;The Darwin Wars&quot; by several commentators.

John Maynard Smith, the eminent British evolutionary biologist, was among Gould&#x27;s strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould&#x27;s acceptance of species selection as a major component of biological evolution. In a review of Daniel Dennett&#x27;s book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, Maynard Smith wrote that Gould &quot;is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.&quot; But Maynard Smith was not consistently negative, writing in a review of &quot;The Panda&#x27;s Thumb&quot; that &quot;Stephen Gould is the best writer of popular science now active... Often he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these.&quot; Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould&#x27;s reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.

One reason for criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than natural selection, mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, Gould&#x27;s works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists as &quot;proof&quot; that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved. Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.

The conflicts between Richard Dawkins and Gould were popularized by philosopher Kim Sterelny in his 2001 book &quot;Dawkins vs. Gould&quot;. Sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues, including the prominence of gene selection in evolution. Dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated multi-level selection, which includes selection amongst genes, nucleic acid sequences, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades.

Dawkins accused Gould of deliberately underplaying the differences between rapid gradualism and macromutation in his published accounts of punctuated equilibrium. He also devoted entire chapters to critiquing Gould&#x27;s account of evolution in his books &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; and &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot;, as did Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;. Other biologists contemporary to Gould went further, as in the case of Robert Trivers who classified it as &quot;intellectual fraud&quot;.

===Cambrian fauna===
In his book &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1989) Gould famously described the Cambrian fauna of the Burgess Shale, emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs, their sudden appearance, and the role chance played in determining which members survived. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role contingency has in shaping the broader pattern of evolution.

His view of contingency was criticized by Simon Conway Morris in his 1998 book &quot;The Crucible of Creation&quot;. Conway Morris stressed members of the Cambrian fauna that resemble modern taxa. He also argued that convergent evolution has a tendency to produce &quot;similarities of organization&quot; and that the forms of life are restricted and channelled. In his book &quot;Life&#x27;s Solution&quot; (2003) Conway Morris argued that the appearance of human-like animals is also likely. Paleontologist Richard Fortey noted that prior to the release of &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;, Conway Morris shared a similar thesis to Gould&#x27;s, but after &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more deterministic position on the history of life.

Paleontologists Derek Briggs and Richard Fortey have also argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as stem groups of living taxa, though this is still a subject of intense research and debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists.

Richard Dawkins disagrees with the view that new phyla suddenly appeared in the Cambrian, arguing that for a new phylum &quot;to spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported any such notion.&quot; In the &quot;Structure of Evolutionary Theory&quot; Gould stresses the difference between phyletic splitting and large anatomical transitions, noting that the two events may be separated by millions of years. Gould argues that no paleontologist regards the Cambrian explosion &quot;as a genealogical event—that is as the actual time of initial splitting&quot;, but rather it &quot;marks an anatomical transition in the overt phenotypes of bilaterian organisms.&quot;

=== Opposition to sociobiology and evolutionary psychology ===
Gould also had a long-running public feud with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists concerning the disciplines of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, both of which Gould and Lewontin opposed, but which Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Steven Pinker advocated. These debates reached their climax in the 1970s, and included strong opposition from groups such as the Sociobiology Study Group and Science for the People. Pinker accuses Gould, Lewontin, and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being &quot;radical scientists&quot;, whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science. Gould stated that he made &quot;no attribution of motive in Wilson&#x27;s or anyone else&#x27;s case&quot; but cautioned that all human beings are influenced, especially unconsciously, by our personal expectations and biases. He wrote:

Gould&#x27;s primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through culture as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible. Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as &quot;biological potentiality vs. biological determinism.&quot; Gould stated that the human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility &quot;permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous… Violence, sexism, and general nastiness &quot;are&quot; biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biological—and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish.&quot;

=== &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; (1981) ===
Gould was the author of &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; (1981), a history and inquiry of psychometrics and intelligence testing, generating perhaps the greatest controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread praise and extensive criticism. Gould investigated the methods of nineteenth century craniometry, as well as the history of psychological testing. Gould wrote that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in biological determinism, the view that &quot;social and economic differences between human groups—primarily races, classes, and sexes—arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology.&quot; The book was reprinted in 1996 with the addition of a new foreword and a critical review of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.

In 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists criticized Gould&#x27;s claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements, arguing that his analysis of Morton was influenced by his opposition to racism. The group&#x27;s paper was reviewed in an editorial in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which pointed out that the paper&#x27;s authors might have been influenced by their own motivations, recommending a degree of caution, stating &quot;the critique leaves the majority of Gould&#x27;s work unscathed,&quot; and noted that &quot;because they couldn&#x27;t measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately. The journal stated that Gould&#x27;s opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton&#x27;s data, but also noted that &quot;Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, to whom Morton donated his collection of skulls, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias and did not accept Gould&#x27;s theory &quot;that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias.&quot;

In 2014, the group&#x27;s paper was critically reviewed in the journal &quot;Evolution &amp; Development&quot; by University of Pennsylvania philosopher professor Michael Weisberg, who tended to support Gould&#x27;s original accusations, concluding that &quot;there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton&#x27;s measurements&quot;. Weisberg concludes that although Gould did make several errors and overstated his case in a number of places, Morton&#x27;s work &quot;remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences&quot;. In 2015, biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Banta published an article arguing that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from Morton&#x27;s data. They agreed with Gould, and disagreed with the 2011 study, insofar as Morton&#x27;s study was seriously flawed, but they agreed with the 2011 study insofar as Gould&#x27;s analysis was in many ways not better than Morton&#x27;s. University of Pennsylvania anthropology doctoral student Paul Wolff Mitchell published an analysis of Morton&#x27;s original, unpublished data, which neither Gould nor subsequent commentators had directly addressed. Mitchell concluded that Gould&#x27;s specific argument about Morton&#x27;s unconscious bias in measurement is not supported, but that it was true, as Gould had claimed, that Morton&#x27;s racial biases influenced how he reported and interpreted his measurements, arguing that Morton&#x27;s interpretation of his data was arbitrary and tendentious: Morton investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap. A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected almost identical skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton&#x27;s on the basis of this overlap, arguing strongly against any conception of a racial hierarchy.

==Non-overlapping magisteria==

In his book &quot;Rocks of Ages&quot; (1999), Gould put forward what he described as &quot;a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion.&quot; He defines the term &quot;magisterium&quot; as &quot;a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution.&quot; The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover &quot;the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry.&quot; He suggests that &quot;NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism&quot; and that NOMA is &quot;a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria.&quot;

This view has not been without criticism, however. In his book &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, Richard Dawkins argues that the division between religion and science is not so simple as Gould claims, as few religions exist without claiming the existence of miracles, which &quot;by definition violate the principles of science.&quot; Dawkins also opposes the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values, and therefore has no authority to claim a magisterium of its own. He goes on to say that he believes Gould is &quot;bending over backwards to be nice to an unworthy but powerful opponent&quot;. Similarly, humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz argues that Gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about questions of ethics. In fact, Kurtz claims that science is a much better method than religion for determining moral principles.

==Publications==

===Articles===
Gould&#x27;s publications were numerous. One review of his publications between 1965 and 2000 noted 479 peer-reviewed papers, 22 books, 300 essays, and 101 &quot;major&quot; book reviews.

<text>Skíðblaðnir (Old Norse: , &#x27;assembled from thin pieces of wood&#x27;), sometimes anglicized as Skidbladnir or Skithblathnir, is the best of ships in Norse mythology. It is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. All sources note that the ship is the finest of ships, and the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Prose Edda&quot; attest that it is owned by the god Freyr, while the euhemerized account in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; attributes it to the magic of Odin. Both &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; attribute to it the ability to be folded up—as cloth may be—into one&#x27;s pocket when not needed.

==Attestations==
References to the ship occur in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. The ship is mentioned twice in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and both incidents therein occur in the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;. In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Odin (disguised as &quot;Grímnir&quot;), tortured, starved, and thirsty, imparts in the young Agnar cosmological knowledge, including information about the origin of the ship Skíðblaðnir:

&quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; is mentioned several times in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, where it appears in the books &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;. The first mention of &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; occurs in chapter 43, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (king Gylfi in disguise) that the god Odin is an important deity. High quotes the second of the above-mentioned &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanzas in support.

The boat is first directly addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; is the best of ships, what there is to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact &quot;Naglfar&quot;, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one&#x27;s pocket. Gangleri comments that &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.

The next mention of the ship occurs in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; where, in chapter 6, poetic ways of referring to Freyr are provided. Among other names, Freyr is referred to as &quot;possessor of &quot;Skidbladnir&quot; and of the boar known as Gullinbursti&quot;. The first of the two &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanzas mentioned above is then provided as reference.

In chapter 35, a myth explaining &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot;″s creation is provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once cut off the goddess&#x27;s Sif&#x27;s hair in an act of mischief. Sif&#x27;s husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi&#x27;s sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki&#x27;s wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot;, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one&#x27;s pocket at will.

&quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot; receives a final mention in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; where, in chapter 75, it appears on a list of ships.

The ship gets a single mention in the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; book &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;. In chapter 7, a euhemerized Odin is said to have had various magical abilities, including that &quot;he was also able with mere words to extinguish fires, to calm the sea, and to turn the winds any way he pleased. He had a ship called &quot;Skíthblathnir&quot; with which he sailed over great seas. It could be folded together like a cloth.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The animated television series &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; features a digital submarine named &quot;Skidbladnir&quot;, named this way due to the Nordic ship&#x27;s efficiency and usefulness.

In the 2018 game &quot;God of War&quot;, Skiðblaðnir is mentioned by name, but it is not seen. In its 2022 sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;, Skiðblaðnir is a magical boat that was owned by the Vanir God Freyr, who then gave it to Kratos to use whenever he wants. As it was made by the Vanir Gods, Skiðblaðnir was given the ability to fly and to fold itself when not in use.

<text>In Norse mythology, Sleipnir (Old Norse: &quot;slippy&quot; or &quot;the slipper&quot;) is an eight-legged horse ridden by Odin. Sleipnir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Sleipnir is Odin&#x27;s steed, is the child of Loki and Svaðilfari, is described as the best of all horses, and is sometimes ridden to the location of Hel. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; contains extended information regarding the circumstances of Sleipnir&#x27;s birth, and details that he is grey in color.

Sleipnir is also mentioned in a riddle found in the 13th century legendary saga &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, in the 13th-century legendary saga &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; as the ancestor of the horse Grani, and book I of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, contains an episode considered by many scholars to involve Sleipnir. Sleipnir is generally accepted as depicted on two 8th century Gotlandic image stones: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone.

Scholarly theories have been proposed regarding Sleipnir&#x27;s potential connection to shamanic practices among the Norse pagans. In modern times, Sleipnir appears in Icelandic folklore as the creator of Ásbyrgi, in works of art, literature, software, and in the names of ships.

==Attestations==

===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Sleipnir appears or is mentioned in the poems &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, and &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. In &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Grimnir (Odin in disguise and not yet having revealed his identity) tells the boy Agnar in verse that Sleipnir is the best of horses (&quot;Odin is the best of the Æsir, Sleipnir of horses&quot;). In &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, the valkyrie Sigrdrífa tells the hero Sigurðr that runes should be cut &quot;on Sleipnir&#x27;s teeth and on the sledge&#x27;s strap-bands.&quot; In &quot;Baldrs draumar&quot;, after the Æsir convene about the god Baldr&#x27;s bad dreams, Odin places a saddle on Sleipnir and the two proceed to the location of Hel. The &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; section of &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; says that Loki produced &quot;the wolf&quot; with Angrboða, produced Sleipnir with Svaðilfari, and thirdly &quot;one monster that was thought the most baleful, who was descended from Býleistr&#x27;s brother.&quot;

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Sleipnir is first mentioned in chapter 15 where the enthroned figure of High says that every day the Æsir ride across the bridge Bifröst, and provides a list of the Æsir&#x27;s horses. The list begins with Sleipnir: &quot;best is Sleipnir, he is Odin&#x27;s, he has eight legs.&quot; In chapter 41, High quotes the &quot;Grímnismál&quot; stanza that mentions Sleipnir.

In chapter 42, Sleipnir&#x27;s origins are described. Gangleri (described earlier in the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and what there is to tell about it. High expresses surprise at Gangleri&#x27;s lack of knowledge about Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set &quot;right at the beginning of the gods&#x27; settlement when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall&quot; about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki&#x27;s influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.

The gods declare that Loki would deserve a horrible death if he could not find a scheme that would cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threatened to attack him. Loki, afraid, swore oaths that he would devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it would cost himself. That night, the builder drove out to fetch stone with his stallion Svaðilfari, and out from a wood ran a mare. The mare neighed at Svaðilfari, and &quot;realizing what kind of horse it was,&quot; Svaðilfari became frantic, neighed, tore apart his tackle, and ran towards the mare. The mare ran to the wood, Svaðilfari followed, and the builder chased after. The two horses ran around all night, causing the building work to be held up for the night, and the previous momentum of building work that the builder had been able to maintain was not continued.

When the Æsir realize that the builder is a hrimthurs, they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and kills the builder by smashing the builder&#x27;s skull into shards with the hammer Mjöllnir. However, Loki had &quot;such dealings&quot; with Svaðilfari that &quot;somewhat later&quot; Loki gave birth to a grey foal with eight legs; the horse Sleipnir, &quot;the best horse among gods and men.&quot;

In chapter 49, High describes the death of the god Baldr. Hermóðr agrees to ride to Hel to offer a ransom for Baldr&#x27;s return, and so &quot;then Odin&#x27;s horse Sleipnir was fetched and led forward.&quot; Hermóðr mounts Sleipnir and rides away. Hermóðr rides for nine nights in deep, dark valleys where Hermóðr can see nothing. The two arrive at the river Gjöll and then continue to Gjöll bridge, encountering a maiden guarding the bridge named Móðguðr. Some dialogue occurs between Hermóðr and Móðguðr, including that Móðguðr notes that recently there had ridden five battalions of dead men across the bridge that made less sound than he. Sleipnir and Hermóðr continue &quot;downwards and northwards&quot; on the road to Hel, until the two arrive at Hel&#x27;s gates. Hermóðr dismounts from Sleipnir, tightens Sleipnir&#x27;s girth, mounts him, and spurs Sleipnir on. Sleipnir &quot;jumped so hard and over the gate that it came nowhere near.&quot; Hermóðr rides up to the hall, and dismounts from Sleipnir. After Hermóðr&#x27;s pleas to Hel to return Baldr are accepted under a condition, Hermóðr and Baldr retrace their path backward and return to Asgard.

In chapter 16 of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, a kenning given for Loki is &quot;relative of Sleipnir.&quot; In chapter 17, a story is provided in which Odin rides Sleipnir into the land of Jötunheimr and arrives at the residence of the jötunn Hrungnir. Hrungnir asks &quot;what sort of person this was&quot; wearing a golden helmet, &quot;riding sky and sea,&quot; and says that the stranger &quot;has a marvellously good horse.&quot; Odin wagers his head that no horse as good could be found in all of Jötunheimr. Hrungnir admitted that it was a fine horse, yet states that he owns a much longer-paced horse; Gullfaxi. Incensed, Hrungnir leaps atop Gullfaxi, intending to attack Odin for Odin&#x27;s boasting. Odin gallops hard ahead of Hrungnir, and, in his, fury, Hrungnir finds himself having rushed into the gates of Asgard. In chapter 58, Sleipnir is mentioned among a list of horses in &quot;Þorgrímsþula&quot;: &quot;Hrafn and Sleipnir, splendid horses [...]&quot;. In addition, Sleipnir occurs twice in kennings for &quot;ship&quot; (once appearing in chapter 25 in a work by the skald Refr, and &quot;sea-Sleipnir&quot; appearing in chapter 49 in &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason).

===&quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;===

In &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, the poem &quot;Heiðreks gátur&quot; contains a riddle that mentions Sleipnir and Odin:

:36. Gestumblindi said:
:&quot;Who are the twain
:that on ten feet run?
:three eyes they have,
:but only one tail.
:Alright guess now
:this riddle, Heithrek!&quot;

:Heithrek said:
:&quot;Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,
:and guessed it is:
:that is Odin riding on Sleipnir.&quot;
===&quot;Völsunga saga&quot;===
In chapter 13 of &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, the hero Sigurðr is on his way to a wood and he meets a long-bearded old man he had never seen before. Sigurd tells the old man that he is going to choose a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old man says that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltjörn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and handsome grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from &quot;Sleipnir&#x27;s kin&quot; and that &quot;he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse.&quot; The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds that the old man was none other than (the god) Odin.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===

Sleipnir is generally considered as appearing in a sequence of events described in book I of &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

In book I, the young Hadingus encounters &quot;a certain man of great age who had lost an eye&quot; who allies him with Liserus. Hadingus and Liserus set out to wage war on Lokerus, ruler of Kurland. Meeting defeat, the old man takes Hadingus with him onto his horse as they flee to the old man&#x27;s house, and the two drink an invigorating draught. The old man sings a prophecy, and takes Hadingus back to where he found him on his horse. During the ride back, Hadingus trembles beneath the old man&#x27;s mantle, and peers out of its holes. Hadingus realizes that Sleipnir is running over the sea: &quot;and he saw that before the steps of the horse lay the sea; but was told not to steal a glimpse of the forbidden thing, and therefore turned his amazed eyes from the dread spectacle of the roads that he journeyed.&quot;

In book II, Biarco mentions Odin and Sleipnir: &quot;If I may look on the awful husband of Frigg, howsoever he be covered in his white shield, and guide his tall steed, he shall in no way go safe out of Leire; it is lawful to lay low in war the war-waging god.&quot;

==Archaeological record==
Two of the 8th century picture stones from the island of Gotland, Sweden depict eight-legged horses, which are thought by most scholars to depict Sleipnir: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone. Both stones feature a rider sitting atop an eight-legged horse, which some scholars view as Odin. Above the rider on the Tjängvide image stone is a horizontal figure holding a spear, which may be a valkyrie, and a female figure greets the rider with a cup. The scene has been interpreted as a rider arriving at the world of the dead. The mid-7th century Eggja stone bearing the Odinic name &quot;haras&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;army god&#x27;) may be interpreted as depicting Sleipnir. The English Runic Inscription 2 (11th century) is also believed by some scholars to depict Sleipnir.

==Theories==

John Lindow theorizes that Sleipnir&#x27;s &quot;connection to the world of the dead grants a special poignancy to one of the kennings in which Sleipnir turns up as a horse word,&quot; referring to the skald Úlfr Uggason&#x27;s usage of &quot;sea-Sleipnir&quot; in his &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;, which describes the funeral of Baldr. Lindow continues that &quot;his use of Sleipnir in the kenning may show that Sleipnir&#x27;s role in the failed recovery of Baldr was known at that time and place in Iceland; it certainly indicates that Sleipnir was an active participant in the mythology of the last decades of paganism.&quot; Lindow adds that the eight legs of Sleipnir &quot;have been interpreted as an indication of great speed or as being connected in some unclear way with cult activity.&quot;

Hilda Ellis Davidson says that &quot;the eight-legged horse of Odin is the typical steed of the shaman&quot; and that in the shaman&#x27;s journeys to the heavens or the underworld, a shaman &quot;is usually represented as riding on some bird or animal.&quot; Davidson says that while the creature may vary, the horse is fairly common &quot;in the lands where horses are in general use, and Sleipnir&#x27;s ability to bear the god through the air is typical of the shaman&#x27;s steed&quot; and cites an example from a study of shamanism by Mircea Eliade of an eight-legged foal from a story of a Buryat shaman. Davidson says that while attempts have been made to connect Sleipnir with hobby horses and steeds with more than four feet that appear in carnivals and processions, but that &quot;a more fruitful resemblance seems to be on the bier on which a dead man is carried in the funeral procession by four bearers; borne along thus, he may be described as riding on a steed with eight legs.&quot; As an example, Davidson cites a funeral dirge from the Gondi people in India as recorded by Verrier Elwin, stating that &quot;it contains references to Bagri Maro, the horse with eight legs, and it is clear from the song that it is the dead man&#x27;s bier.&quot; Davidson says that the song is sung when a distinguished Muria dies, and provides a verse:

:What horse is this?
:It is the horse of Bagri Maro.
:What should we say of its legs?
:This horse has eight legs.
:What should we say of its heads?
:This horse has four heads. . . .
:Catch the bridle and mount the horse.

Davidson adds that the representation of Odin&#x27;s steed as eight-legged could arise naturally out of such an image, and that &quot;this is in accordance with the picture of Sleipnir as a horse that could bear its rider to the land of the dead.&quot;

Ulla Loumand cites Sleipnir and the flying horse Hófvarpnir as &quot;prime examples&quot; of horses in Norse mythology as being able to &quot;mediate between earth and sky, between Ásgarðr, Miðgarðr and Útgarðr and between the world of mortal men and the underworld.&quot;

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture&quot; theorizes that Sleipnir&#x27;s eight legs may be the remnants of horse-associated divine twins found in Indo-European cultures and ultimately stemming from Proto-Indo-European religion. The encyclopedia states that &quot;[...] Sleipnir is born with an extra set of legs, thus representing an original pair of horses. Like Freyr and Njörðr, Sleipnir is responsible for carrying the dead to the otherworld.&quot; The encyclopedia cites parallels between the birth of Sleipnir and myths originally pointing to a Celtic goddess who gave birth to the Divine horse twins. These elements include a demand for a goddess by an unwanted suitor (the hrimthurs demanding the goddess Freyja) and the seduction of builders.

==Modern influence==

According to Icelandic folklore, the horseshoe-shaped canyon Ásbyrgi located in Jökulsárgljúfur National Park, northern Iceland was formed by Sleipnir&#x27;s hoof. Sleipnir is depicted with Odin on Dagfin Werenskiold&#x27;s wooden relief &quot;Odin på Sleipnir&quot; (1945–1950) on the exterior of the Oslo City Hall in Oslo, Norway. Sleipnir has been and remains a popular name for ships in northern Europe, and Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story entitled &quot;Sleipner, late Thurinda&quot; (1888) features a horse named Sleipner. A statue of Sleipnir (1998) stands in Wednesbury, England, a town which takes its name from the Anglo-Saxon version of Odin, Wōden.

<doc id="27884" wikidata="Q79025" url="?curid=27884" title="Walter Scott">
<text>Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet (15 August 1771 – 21 September 1832), was a Scottish novelist, poet and historian. Many of his works remain classics of European and Scottish literature, notably the novels &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1819), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817), &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814), &quot;Old Mortality&quot; (1816), &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&quot; (1818), and &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1819), along with the narrative poems &quot;Marmion&quot; (1808) and &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; (1810). He had a major impact on European and American literature.

As an advocate and legal administrator by profession, he combined writing and editing with his daily work as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire. He was prominent in Edinburgh&#x27;s Tory establishment, active in the Highland Society, long time a president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820–1832), and a vice president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1827–1829). His knowledge of history and literary facility equipped him to establish the historical novel genre as an exemplar of European Romanticism. He became a baronet of Abbotsford in the County of Roxburgh, Scotland, on 22 April 1820; the title became extinct upon his son&#x27;s death in 1847.

==Early life==
Walter Scott was born on 15 August 1771, in a third-floor apartment on College Wynd in the Old Town, Edinburgh, a narrow alleyway leading from the Cowgate to the gates of the old University of Edinburgh. He was the ninth child (six having died in infancy) of Walter Scott (1729–1799), a member of a cadet branch of the Clan Scott and a Writer to the Signet, and his wife Anne Rutherford, a sister of Daniel Rutherford and a descendant both of the Clan Swinton and of the Haliburton family (descent from which granted Walter&#x27;s family the hereditary right of burial in Dryburgh Abbey).

Walter was, through the Haliburtons, a cousin of the London property developer James Burton (d. 1837), who was born with the surname &#x27;Haliburton&#x27;, and of the same&#x27;s son the architect Decimus Burton. Walter became a member of the Clarence Club, of which the Burtons were members.
A childhood bout of polio in 1773 left Scott lame, a condition that would greatly affect his life and writing.

To improve his lameness he was sent in 1773 to live in the rural Scottish Borders, at his paternal grandparents&#x27; farm at Sandyknowe, by the ruin of Smailholm Tower, the earlier family home. Here, he was taught to read by his aunt Jenny Scott and learned from her the speech patterns and many of the tales and legends that later marked much of his work. In January 1775, he returned to Edinburgh, and that summer with his aunt Jenny took spa treatment at Bath in Somerset, southern England, where they lived at 6 South Parade. In the winter of 1776, he went back to Sandyknowe, with another attempt at a water cure at Prestonpans the following summer.

In 1778, Scott returned to Edinburgh for private education to prepare him for school and joined his family in their new house, one of the first to be built in George Square. In October 1779, he began at the Royal High School in Edinburgh (in High School Yards). He was by then well able to walk and explore the city and the surrounding countryside. His reading included chivalric romances, poems, history and travel books. He was given private tuition by James Mitchell in arithmetic and writing, and learned from him the history of the Church of Scotland with emphasis on the Covenanters.

In 1783, his parents, believing he had outgrown his strength, sent him to stay for six months with his aunt Jenny at Kelso in the Scottish Borders: there he attended Kelso Grammar School, where he met James Ballantyne and his brother John, who later became his business partners and printers.

===Appearance===
As a result of his early polio infection, Scott had a pronounced limp. He was described in 1820 as &quot;tall, well formed (except for one ankle and foot which made him walk lamely), neither fat nor thin, with forehead very high, nose short, upper lip long and face rather fleshy, complexion fresh and clear, eyes very blue, shrewd and penetrating, with hair now silvery white&quot;. Although a determined walker, he experienced greater freedom of movement on horseback.

==Student==

Scott began studying classics at the University of Edinburgh in November 1783, at the age of 12, a year or so younger than most fellow students. In March 1786, aged 14, he began an apprenticeship in his father&#x27;s office to become a Writer to the Signet. At school and university Scott had become a friend of Adam Ferguson, whose father Professor Adam Ferguson hosted literary salons. Scott met the blind poet Thomas Blacklock, who lent him books and introduced him to the Ossian cycle of poems by James Macpherson. During the winter of 1786–1787, a 15-year-old Scott met the Scots poet Robert Burns at one of these salons, their only meeting. When Burns noticed a print illustrating the poem &quot;The Justice of the Peace&quot; and asked who had written it, Scott alone named the author as John Langhorne and was thanked by Burns. Scott describes the event in his memoirs, where he whispers the answer to his friend Adam, who tells Burns; another version of the event appears in &quot;Literary Beginnings&quot;.

When it was decided that he would become a lawyer, he returned to the university to study law, first taking classes in moral philosophy (under Dugald Stewart) and universal history (under Alexander Fraser Tytler) in 1789–1790. During this second university spell Scott became prominent in student intellectual activities: he co-founded the Literary Society in 1789 and was elected to the Speculative Society the following year, becoming librarian and secretary-treasurer a year after.

After completing his law studies, Scott took up law in Edinburgh. He made his first visit as a lawyer&#x27;s clerk to the Scottish Highlands, directing an eviction. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1792. He had an unsuccessful love suit with Williamina Belsches of Fettercairn, who married Scott&#x27;s friend Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet. In February 1797, the threat of a French invasion persuaded Scott and many of his friends to join the Royal Edinburgh Volunteer Light Dragoons, where he served into the early 1800s, and was appointed quartermaster and secretary. The daily drill practices that year, starting at 5 a.m., indicate the determination with which the role was undertaken.

==Literary career, marriage and family==

Scott was prompted to take up a literary career by enthusiasm in Edinburgh in the 1790s for modern German literature. Recalling the period in 1827, Scott said that he &quot;was German-mad.&quot; In 1796, he produced English versions of two poems by Gottfried August Bürger, &quot;Der wilde Jäger&quot; and &quot;Lenore&quot;, published as &quot;The Chase, and William and Helen&quot;. Scott responded to the German interest at the time in national identity, folk culture and medieval literature, which linked with his own developing passion for traditional balladry. A favourite book since childhood had been Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;. During the 1790s he would search in manuscript collections and on Border &quot;raids&quot; for ballads from oral performance. With help from John Leyden, he produced a two-volume &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; in 1802, containing 48 traditional ballads and two imitations apiece by Leyden and himself. Of the 48 traditionals, 26 were published for the first time. An enlarged edition appeared in three volumes the following year. With many of the ballads, Scott fused different versions into more coherent texts, a practice he later repudiated. The &quot;Minstrelsy&quot; was the first and most important of a series of editorial projects over the next two decades, including the medieval romance &quot;Sir Tristrem&quot; (which Scott attributed to Thomas the Rhymer) in 1804, the works of John Dryden (18 vols, 1808), and the works of Jonathan Swift (19 vols, 1814).

On a trip to the English Lake District with old college friends, he met Charlotte Charpentier (Anglicised to &quot;Carpenter&quot;), a daughter of Jean Charpentier of Lyon in France and a ward of Lord Downshire in Cumberland, an Anglican. After three weeks&#x27; courtship, Scott proposed and they were married on Christmas Eve 1797 in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Carlisle (now the nave of Carlisle Cathedral). After renting a house in Edinburgh&#x27;s George Street, they moved to nearby South Castle Street. Their eldest child, Sophia, was born in 1799, and later married John Gibson Lockhart. Four of their five children survived Scott himself. His eldest son Sir Walter Scott, 2nd Baronet (1801–1847), inherited his father&#x27;s estates and possessions: on 3 February 1825 he married Jane Jobson, only daughter of William Jobson of Lochore (died 1822) by his wife Rachel Stuart (died 1863), heiress of Lochore and a niece of Lady Margaret Ferguson. In 1799 Scott was appointed Sheriff-Depute of the County of Selkirk, based at the courthouse in the Royal Burgh of Selkirk. In his early married days Scott earned a decent living from his work as a lawyer, his salary as Sheriff-Depute, his wife&#x27;s income, some revenue from his writing, and his share of his father&#x27;s modest estate.
After the younger Walter was born in 1801, the Scotts moved to a spacious three-storey house at 39 North Castle Street, which remained his Edinburgh base until 1826, when it was sold by the trustees appointed after his financial ruin. From 1798, Scott had spent summers in a cottage at Lasswade, where he entertained guests, including literary figures. It was there his career as an author began. There were nominal residency requirements for his position of Sheriff-Depute, and at first he stayed at a local inn during the circuit. In 1804, he ended his use of the Lasswade cottage and leased the substantial house of Ashestiel, from Selkirk, sited on the south bank of the River Tweed and incorporating an ancient tower house.

At Scott&#x27;s insistence the first edition of &quot;Minstrelsy&quot; was printed by his friend James Ballantyne at Kelso. In 1798 James had published Scott&#x27;s version of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot; in his newspaper &quot;The Kelso Mail&quot;, and in 1799 included it and the two Bürger translations in a privately printed anthology, &quot;Apology for Tales of Terror&quot;. In 1800 Scott suggested that Ballantyne set up business in Edinburgh and provided a loan for him to make the transition in 1802. In 1805, they became partners in the printing business, and from then until the financial crash of 1826 Scott&#x27;s works were routinely printed by the firm.

Scott was known for his fondness of dogs, and owned several throughout his life. Upon his death, one newspaper noted &quot;of all the great men who have loved dogs no one ever loved them better or understood them more thoroughly&quot;. The best known of Scott&#x27;s dogs were Maida, a large stag hound reported to be his favourite dog, and Spice, a Dandie Dinmont terrier described as having asthma, to which Scott gave particular care. In a diary entry written at the height of his financial woes, Scott described dismay at the prospect of having to sell them: &quot;The thoughts of parting from these dumb creatures have moved me more than any of the reflections I have put down&quot;.

==The poet==

Between 1805 and 1817 Scott produced five long, six-canto narrative poems, four shorter independently published poems, and many small metrical pieces. Scott was by far the most popular poet of the time until Lord Byron published the first two cantos of &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; in 1812 and followed them up with his exotic oriental verse narratives.

&quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; (1805), in medieval romance form, grew out of Scott&#x27;s plan to include a long original poem of his own in the second edition of the &quot;Minstrelsy&quot;: it was to be &quot;a sort of Romance of Border Chivalry &amp; inchantment&quot;. He owed the distinctive irregular accent in four-beat metre to Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Christabel&quot;, which he had heard recited by John Stoddart. (It was not to be published until 1816.) Scott was able to draw on his unrivalled familiarity with Border history and legend acquired from oral and written sources beginning in his childhood to present an energetic and highly coloured picture of 16th-century Scotland, which both captivated the general public and with its voluminous notes also addressed itself to the antiquarian student. The poem has a strong moral theme, as human pride is placed in the context of the last judgment with the introduction of a version of the &quot;Dies irae&quot; at the end. The work was an immediate success with almost all the reviewers and with readers in general, going through five editions in one year. 
The most celebrated lines are the ones that open the final stanza: 
Three years after &quot;The Lay&quot; Scott published &quot;Marmion&quot; (1808) telling a story of corrupt passions leading up as a disastrous climax to the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The main innovation involves prefacing each of the six cantos with an epistle from the author to a friend: William Stewart Rose, The Rev. John Marriot, William Erskine, James Skene, George Ellis, and Richard Heber: the epistles develop themes of moral positives and special delights imparted by art. In an unprecedented move, the publisher Archibald Constable purchased the copyright of the poem for a thousand guineas at the beginning of 1807, when only the first had been completed. Constable&#x27;s faith was justified by the sales: the three editions published in 1808 sold 8,000 copies. The verse of &quot;Marmion&quot; is less striking than that of &quot;The Lay&quot;, with the epistles in iambic tetrameters and the narrative in tetrameters with frequent trimeters. The reception by the reviewers was less favourable than that accorded &quot;The Lay&quot;: style and plot were both found faulty, the epistles did not link up with the narrative, there was too much antiquarian pedantry, and Marmion&#x27;s character was immoral. The most familiar lines in the poem sum up one of its main themes: &quot;O what a tangled web we weave,/ When first we practice to deceive&quot;

Scott&#x27;s meteoric poetic career peaked with his third long narrative, &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; (1810), which sold 20,000 copies in the first year. The reviewers were fairly favourable, finding the defects noted in &quot;Marmion&quot; largely absent. In some ways it is more conventional than its predecessors: the narrative is entirely in iambic tetrameters and the story of the transparently disguised James V (King of Scots 1513‒42) predictable: Coleridge wrote to Wordsworth: &#x27;The movement of the Poem... is between a sleeping Canter and a Marketwoman&#x27;s trot – but it is endless – I seem never to have made any way – I never remember a narrative poem in which I felt the sense of Progress so languid.&quot; But the metrical uniformity is relieved by frequent songs and the Perthshire Highland setting is presented as an enchanted landscape, which caused a phenomenal increase in the local tourist trade. Moreover, the poem touches on a theme that was to be central to the Waverley Novels: the clash between neighbouring societies in different stages of development.

The remaining two long narrative poems, &quot;Rokeby&quot; (1813), set in the Yorkshire estate of that name belonging to Scott&#x27;s friend J. B. S. Morritt during the Civil War period, and &quot;The Lord of the Isles&quot; (1815), set in early 14th-century Scotland and culminating in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Both works had generally favourable receptions and sold well, but without rivalling the huge success of &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;. Scott also produced four minor narrative or semi-narrative poems between 1811 and 1817: &quot;The Vision of Don Roderick&quot; (1811, celebrating Wellington&#x27;s successes in the Peninsular Campaign, with profits donated to Portuguese war sufferers); &quot;The Bridal of Triermain&quot; (published anonymously in 1813); &quot;The Field of Waterloo&quot; (1815); and &quot;Harold the Dauntless&quot; (published anonymously in 1817).

Throughout his creative life Scott was an active reviewer. Although himself a Tory he reviewed for &quot;The Edinburgh Review&quot; between 1803 and 1806, but that journal&#x27;s advocacy of peace with Napoleon led him to cancel his subscription in 1808. The following year, at the height of his poetic career, he was instrumental in establishing a Tory rival, &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; to which he contributed reviews for the rest of his life.

In 1813 Scott was offered the position of Poet Laureate. He declined, feeling that &quot;such an appointment would be a poisoned chalice,&quot; as the Laureateship had fallen into disrepute due to the decline in quality of work suffered by previous title holders, &quot;as a succession of poetasters had churned out conventional and obsequious odes on royal occasions.&quot; He sought advice from the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, who counselled him to retain his literary independence. The position went to Scott&#x27;s friend, Robert Southey.

==The novelist==

===Gothic novel===
Scott was influenced by Gothic romance, and had collaborated in 1801 with &#x27;Monk&#x27; Lewis on &quot;Tales of Wonder&quot;.

===Historic romances===
Scott&#x27;s career as a novelist was attended with uncertainty. The first few chapters of &quot;Waverley&quot; were complete by roughly 1805, but the project was abandoned as a result of unfavourable criticism from a friend. Soon after, Scott was asked by the publisher John Murray to posthumously edit and complete the last chapter of an unfinished romance by Joseph Strutt. Published in 1808 and set in 15th-century England, &quot;Queenhoo Hall&quot; was not a success due to its archaic language and excessive display of antiquarian information. The success of Scott&#x27;s Highland narrative poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; in 1810 seems to have put it into his head to resume the narrative and have his hero Edward Waverley journey to Scotland. Although &quot;Waverley&quot; was announced for publication at that stage, it was again laid by and not resumed until late 1813, then published in 1814. Only a thousand copies were printed, but the work was an immediate success and 3,000 more were added in two further editions the same year. &quot;Waverley&quot; turned out to be the first of 27 novels (eight published in pairs), and by the time the sixth of them, &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, was published, the print run for the first edition had been increased to 10,000 copies, which became the norm.

Given Scott&#x27;s established status as a poet and the tentative nature of &quot;Waverley&quot;″s emergence, it is not surprising that he followed a common practice in the period and published it anonymously. He continued this until his financial ruin in 1826, the novels mostly appearing as &quot;By the Author of &quot;Waverley&quot;&quot; (or variants thereof) or as &quot;Tales of My Landlord&quot;. It is not clear why he chose to do this (no fewer than eleven reasons have been suggested), especially as it was a fairly open secret, but as he himself said, with Shylock, &quot;such was my humour.&quot;
Scott was an almost exclusively historical novelist. Only one of his 27 novels – &quot;Saint Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot; – has a wholly modern setting. The settings of the others range from 1794 in &quot;The Antiquary&quot; back to 1096 or 1097, the time of the First Crusade, in &quot;Count Robert of Paris&quot;. Sixteen take place in Scotland. The first nine, from &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814) to &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot; (1819), all have Scottish locations and 17th- or 18th-century settings. Scott was better versed in his material than anyone: he could draw on oral tradition and a wide range of written sources in his ever-expanding library (many of the books rare and some unique copies). In general it is these pre-1820 novels that have drawn the attention of modern critics – especially: &quot;Waverley&quot;, with its presentation of the 1745 Jacobites drawn from the Highland clans as obsolete and fanatical idealists; &quot;Old Mortality&quot; (1816) with its treatment of the 1679 Covenanters as fanatical and often ridiculous (prompting John Galt to produce a contrasting picture in his novel &quot;Ringan Gilhaize&quot; in 1823); &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&quot; (1818) with its low-born heroine Jeanie Deans making a perilous journey to Richmond in 1737 to secure a promised royal pardon for her sister, falsely accused of infanticide; and the tragic &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1819), with its stern account of a declined aristocratic family, with Edgar Ravenswood and his fiancée as victims of the wife of an upstart lawyer in a time of political power-struggle before the Act of Union in 1707.
In 1820, in a bold move, Scott shifted period and location for &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820) to 12th-century England. This meant he was dependent on a limited range of sources, all of them printed: he had to bring together material from different centuries and invent an artificial form of speech based on Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. The result is as much myth as history, but the novel remains his best-known work, the most likely to be found by the general reader. Eight of the subsequent 17 novels also have medieval settings, though most are set towards the end of the era, for which Scott had a better supply of contemporaneous sources. His familiarity with Elizabethan and 17th-century English literature, partly resulting from editorial work on pamphlets and other minor publications, meant that four of his works set in the England of that period – &quot;Kenilworth&quot; (1821), &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; and &quot;Peveril of the Peak&quot; (1821), and &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1826) – present rich pictures of their societies. The most generally esteemed of Scott&#x27;s later fictions, though, are three short stories: a supernatural narrative in Scots, &quot;Wandering Willie&#x27;s Tale&quot; in &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; (1824), and &quot;The Highland Widow&quot; and &quot;The Two Drovers&quot; in &quot;Chronicles of the Canongate&quot; (1827).

Crucial to Scott&#x27;s historical thinking is the concept that very different societies can move through the same stages as they develop, and that humanity is basically unchanging, or as he puts it in the first chapter of &quot;Waverley&quot; that there are &quot;passions common to men in all stages of society, and which have alike agitated the human heart, whether it throbbed under the steel corslet of the fifteenth century, the brocaded coat of the eighteenth, or the blue frock and white dimity waistcoat of the present day.&quot; It was one of Scott&#x27;s main achievements to give lively, detailed pictures of different stages of Scottish, British, and European society while making it clear that for all the differences in form, they took the same human passions as those of his own age. His readers could therefore appreciate the depiction of an unfamiliar society, while having no difficulty in relating to the characters.

Scott is fascinated by striking moments of transition between stages in societies. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in a discussion of Scott&#x27;s early novels, found that they derive their &quot;long-sustained &quot;interest&quot;&quot; from &quot;the contest between the two great moving Principles of social Humanity – religious adherence to the Past and the Ancient, the Desire &amp; the admiration of Permanence, on the one hand; and the Passion for increase of Knowledge, for Truth as the offspring of Reason, in short, the mighty Instincts of &quot;Progression&quot; and &quot;Free-agency&quot;, on the other.&quot; This is clear, for example, in &quot;Waverley&quot;, as the hero is captivated by the romantic allure of the Jacobite cause embodied in Bonnie Prince Charlie and his followers before accepting that the time for such enthusiasms has passed and accepting the more rational, humdrum reality of Hanoverian Britain. Another example appears in 15th-century Europe in the yielding of the old chivalric world view of Charles, Duke of Burgundy to the Machiavellian pragmatism of Louis XI. Scott is intrigued by the way different stages of societal development can exist side by side in one country. When Waverley has his first experience of Highland ways after a raid on his Lowland host&#x27;s cattle, it &quot;seemed like a dream ... that these deeds of violence should be familiar to men&#x27;s minds, and currently talked of, as falling with the common order of things, and happening daily in the immediate neighbourhood, without his having crossed the seas, and while he was yet in the otherwise well-ordered island of Great Britain.&quot; A more complex version of this comes in Scott&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Guy Mannering&quot; (1815), which &quot;set in 1781‒2, offers no simple opposition: the Scotland represented in the novel is at once backward and advanced, traditional and modern – it is a country in varied stages of progression in which there are many social subsets, each with its own laws and customs.&quot;

Scott&#x27;s process of composition can be traced through the manuscripts (mostly preserved), the more fragmentary sets of proofs, his correspondence, and publisher&#x27;s records. He did not create detailed plans for his stories, and the remarks by the figure of &quot;the Author&quot; in the Introductory Epistle to &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; probably reflect his own experience: &quot;I think there is a dæmon who seats himself on the feather of my pen when I begin to write, and leads it astray from the purpose. Characters expand under my hand; incidents are multiplied; the story lingers, while the materials increase – my regular mansion turns out a Gothic anomaly, and the work is complete long before I have attained the point I proposed.&quot; Yet the manuscripts rarely show major deletions or changes of direction, and Scott could clearly keep control of his narrative. That was important, for as soon as he had made fair progress with a novel he would start sending batches of manuscript to be copied (to preserve his anonymity), and the copies were sent to be set up in type. (As usual at the time, the compositors would supply the punctuation.) He received proofs, also in batches, and made many changes at that stage, but these were almost always local corrections and enhancements.

As the number of novels grew, they were republished in small collections: &quot;Novels and Tales&quot; (1819: &quot;Waverley&quot; to &quot;A Tale of Montrose&quot;); &quot;Historical Romances&quot; (1822: &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; to &quot;Kenilworth&quot;); &quot;Novels and Romances&quot; (1824 [1823]: &quot;The Pirate&quot; to &quot;Quentin Durward&quot;); and two series of &quot;Tales and Romances&quot; (1827: &quot;St Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot; to &quot;Woodstock&quot;; 1833: &quot;Chronicles of the Canongate&quot; to &quot;Castle Dangerous&quot;). In his last years Scott marked up interleaved copies of these collected editions to produce a final version of what were now officially the &quot;Waverley Novels&quot;, often called his &#x27;Magnum Opus&#x27; or &#x27;Magnum Edition&#x27;. Scott provided each novel with an introduction and notes and made mostly piecemeal adjustments to the text. Issued in 48 smart monthly volumes between June 1829 and May 1833 at a modest price of five shillings (60p) these were an innovative and profitable venture aimed at a wide readership: the print run was an astonishing 30,000.

In a &quot;General Preface&quot; to the &quot;Magnum Edition&quot;, Scott wrote that one factor prompting him to resume work on the &quot;Waverley&quot; manuscript in 1813 had been a desire to do for Scotland what had been done in the fiction of Maria Edgeworth, &quot;whose Irish characters have gone so far to make the English familiar with the character of their gay and kind-hearted neighbours of Ireland, that she may be truly said to have done more towards completing the Union, than perhaps all the legislative enactments by which it has been followed up [the Act of Union of 1801].&quot; Most of Scott&#x27;s readers were English: with &quot;Quentin Durward&quot; (1823) and &quot;Woodstock&quot; (1826), for example, some 8000 of the 10,000 copies of the first edition went to London. In the Scottish novels the lower-class characters normally speak Scots, but Scott is careful not to make the Scots too dense, so that those unfamiliar with it can follow the gist without understanding every word. Some have also argued that although Scott was formally a supporter of the Union with England (and Ireland) his novels have a strong nationalist subtext for readers attuned to that wavelength.

Scott&#x27;s new career as a novelist in 1814 did not mean he abandoned poetry. The Waverley Novels contain much original verse, including familiar songs such as &quot;Proud Maisie&quot; from &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian&quot; (Ch. 41) and &quot;Look not thou on Beauty&#x27;s charming&quot; from &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (Ch. 3). In most of the novels Scott preceded each chapter with an epigram or &quot;motto&quot;; most of these are in verse, and many are of his own composition, often imitating other writers such as Beaumont and Fletcher.

==Recovery of the Crown Jewels, baronetcy, and ceremonial pageantry==

Prompted by Scott, the Prince Regent (the future George IV) gave Scott and other officials permission in a Royal Warrant dated 28 October 1817 to conduct a search for the Crown Jewels (&quot;Honours of Scotland&quot;). During the Protectorate under Cromwell these had been hidden away, but had subsequently been used to crown Charles II. They were not used to crown subsequent monarchs, but were regularly taken to sittings of Parliament, to represent the absent monarch, until the Act of Union 1707. So the honours were stored in Edinburgh Castle, but their large locked box was not opened for more than 100 years, and stories circulated that they had been &quot;lost&quot; or removed. On 4 February 1818, Scott and a small military team opened the box and &quot;unearthed&quot; the honours from the Crown Room of Edinburgh Castle. On 19 August 1818 through Scott&#x27;s effort, his friend Adam Ferguson was appointed Deputy Keeper of the &quot;Scottish Regalia&quot;. The Scottish patronage system swung into action and after elaborate negotiations the Prince Regent granted Scott the title of baronet: in April 1820 he received the baronetcy in London, becoming Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet.

After George&#x27;s accession, the city council of Edinburgh invited Scott, at the sovereign&#x27;s behest, to stage-manage the 1822 visit of King George IV to Scotland. In spite of having only three weeks to work with, Scott created a spectacular, comprehensive pageant, designed not only to impress the King, but in some way to heal the rifts that had destabilised Scots society. Probably fortified by his vivid depiction of the pageant staged for the reception of Queen Elizabeth in &quot;Kenilworth&quot; he and his &quot;production team&quot; mounted what in modern days would be a PR event, with the King dressed in tartan and greeted by his people, many of them also in similar tartan ceremonial dress. This form of dress, proscribed after the Jacobite rising of 1745, became one of the seminal, potent and ubiquitous symbols of Scottish identity.

==Financial problems and death==
In 1825, a UK-wide banking crisis resulted in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing business, of which Scott was the only partner with a financial interest. Its debts of £130,000 () caused his very public ruin. Rather than declare himself bankrupt or accept any financial support from his many supporters and admirers (including the King himself), he placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors and set out to write his way out of debt. To add to his burdens, his wife Charlotte died in 1826.

Despite these events or because of them, Scott kept up his prodigious output. Between 1826 and 1832 he produced six novels, two short stories and two plays, eleven works or volumes of non-fiction, and a journal, along with several unfinished works. The non-fiction included the &quot;Life of Napoleon Buonaparte&quot; in 1827, two volumes of the &quot;History of Scotland&quot; in 1829 and 1830, and four instalments of the series entitled &quot;Tales of a Grandfather – Being Stories Taken From Scottish History&quot;, written one per year over the period 1828–1831, among several others. Finally, Scott had recently been inspired by the diaries of Samuel Pepys and Lord Byron, and he began keeping a journal over the period, which was published in 1890 as &quot;The Journal of Sir Walter Scott&quot;.
By then Scott&#x27;s health was failing, and on 29 October 1831, in a vain search for improvement, he set off on a voyage to Malta and Naples on board &quot;HMS Barham&quot;, a frigate put at his disposal by the Admiralty. He was welcomed and celebrated wherever he went. On his journey home he boarded the steamboat &quot;Prins Frederik&quot; going from Cologne to Rotterdam. While on board he had a final stroke near Emmerich. After local treatment, a steamboat took him to the steamship &quot;Batavier&quot;, which left for England on 12 June. By pure coincidence, Mary Martha Sherwood was also on board. She would later write about this encounter. After he was landed in England, Scott was transported back to die at Abbotsford on 21 September 1832. He was 61.

Scott was buried in Dryburgh Abbey, where his wife had earlier been interred. Lady Scott had been buried as an Episcopalian; at Scott&#x27;s own funeral, three ministers of the Church of Scotland officiated at Abbotsford and the service at Dryburgh was conducted by an Episcopal clergyman.

Although Scott died owing money, his novels continued to sell, and the debts encumbering his estate were discharged shortly after his death.

==Religion==
Scott was raised as a Presbyterian in the Church of Scotland. He was ordained as an elder in Duddingston Kirk in 1806, and sat in the General Assembly for a time as representative elder of the burgh of Selkirk. In adult life he also adhered to the Scottish Episcopal Church: he seldom attended church but read the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; services in family worship.

Scott was one of the last individuals cursed by the Muggletonian movement on account of his reviling Muggletonianism.

==Freemasonry==
Scott&#x27;s father was a Freemason, being a member of Lodge St David, No. 36 (Edinburgh), and Scott also became a Freemason in his father&#x27;s Lodge in 1801, albeit only after the death of his father.

==Abbotsford House==

When Scott was a boy, he sometimes travelled with his father from Selkirk to Melrose, where some of his novels are set. At a certain spot, the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the Battle of Melrose (1526).

During the summers from 1804, Scott made his home at the large house of Ashestiel, on the south bank of the River Tweed, north of Selkirk. When his lease on this property expired in 1811, he bought Cartley Hole Farm, downstream on the Tweed nearer Melrose. The farm had the nickname of &quot; Hole&quot;, and Scott renamed it &quot;Abbotsford&quot; after a neighbouring ford used by the monks of Melrose Abbey. Following a modest enlargement of the original farmhouse in 1811–12, massive expansions took place in 1816–19 and 1822–24. Scott described the resulting building as &#x27;a sort of romance in Architecture&#x27; and &#x27;a kind of Conundrum Castle to be sure&#x27;. With his architects William Atkinson and Edward Blore Scott was a pioneer of the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, and Abbotsford is festooned with turrets and stepped gabling. Through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour, trophies of the chase, a library of more than 9,000 volumes, fine furniture, and still finer pictures. Panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colours added to the beauty of the house.

It is estimated that the building cost Scott more than £25,000 (). More land was purchased until Scott owned nearly . In 1817 as part of the land purchases Scott bought the nearby mansion-house of Toftfield for his friend Adam Ferguson to live in along with his brothers and sisters and on which, at the ladies&#x27; request, he bestowed the name of Huntlyburn. Ferguson commissioned Sir David Wilkie to paint the Scott family resulting in the painting &quot;The Abbotsford Family&quot; in which Scott is seated with his family represented as a group of country folk. Ferguson is standing to the right with the feather in his cap and Thomas Scott, Scott&#x27;s Uncle, is behind. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818.

Abbotsford later gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded in 1834 in memory of Sir Walter Scott.

==Reputation==
===Later assessment===
Although he continued to be extremely popular and widely read, both at home and abroad, Scott&#x27;s critical reputation declined in the last half of the 19th century as serious writers turned from romanticism to realism, and Scott began to be regarded as an author suitable for children. This trend accelerated in the 20th century. For example, in his classic study &quot;Aspects of the Novel&quot; (1927), E. M. Forster harshly criticized Scott&#x27;s clumsy and slapdash writing style, &quot;flat&quot; characters, and thin plots. In contrast, the novels of Scott&#x27;s contemporary Jane Austen, once appreciated only by a discerning few (including, as it happened, Scott himself) rose steadily in critical esteem, though Austen, as a female writer, was still faulted for her narrow (&quot;feminine&quot;) choice of subject matter, which, unlike Scott, avoided the grand historical themes traditionally viewed as masculine.

Nevertheless, Scott&#x27;s importance as an innovator continued to be recognised. He was acclaimed as the inventor of the genre of the modern historical novel (which others trace to Jane Porter, whose work in the genre predates Scott&#x27;s) and the inspiration for enormous numbers of imitators and genre writers both in Britain and on the European continent. In the cultural sphere, Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels played a significant part in the movement (begun with James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot; cycle) in rehabilitating the public perception of the Scottish Highlands and its culture, which had been formerly been viewed by the southern mind as a barbaric breeding ground of hill bandits, religious fanaticism, and Jacobite risings.

Scott served as chairman of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and was also a member of the Royal Celtic Society. His own contribution to the reinvention of Scottish culture was enormous, even though his re-creations of the customs of the Highlands were fanciful at times. Through the medium of Scott&#x27;s novels, the violent religious and political conflicts of the country&#x27;s recent past could be seen as belonging to history—which Scott defined, as the subtitle of &quot;Waverley&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Tis Sixty Years Since&quot;) indicates, as something that happened at least 60 years earlier. His advocacy of objectivity and moderation and his strong repudiation of political violence on either side also had a strong, though unspoken, contemporary resonance in an era when many conservative English speakers lived in mortal fear of a revolution in the French style on British soil. Scott&#x27;s orchestration of King George IV&#x27;s visit to Scotland, in 1822, was a pivotal event intended to inspire a view of his home country that accentuated the positive aspects of the past while allowing the age of quasi-medieval blood-letting to be put to rest, while envisioning a more useful, peaceful future.

After Scott&#x27;s work had been essentially unstudied for many decades, a revival of critical interest began in the middle of the 20th century. While F. R. Leavis had disdained Scott, seeing him as a thoroughly bad novelist and a thoroughly bad influence (&quot;The Great Tradition&quot; [1948]), György Lukács (&quot;The Historical Novel&quot; [1937, trans. 1962]) and David Daiches (&quot;Scott&#x27;s Achievement as a Novelist&quot; [1951]) offered a Marxian political reading of Scott&#x27;s fiction that generated a great deal of interest in his work. These were followed in 1966 by a major thematic analysis covering most of the novels by Francis R. Hart (&quot;Scott&#x27;s Novels: The Plotting of Historic Survival&quot;). Scott has proved particularly responsive to Postmodern approaches, most notably to the concept of the interplay of multiple voices highlighted by Mikhail Bakhtin, as suggested by the title of the volume with selected papers from the Fourth International Scott Conference held in Edinburgh in 1991, &quot;Scott in Carnival&quot;. Scott is now increasingly recognised not only as the principal inventor of the historical novel and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature, but also as a writer of a depth and subtlety who challenges his readers as well as entertaining them.

===Memorials and commemoration===

During his lifetime, Scott&#x27;s portrait was painted by Sir Edwin Landseer and fellow Scots Sir Henry Raeburn and James Eckford Lauder. In 1824 by C R Leslie later engraved by M I Danforth in 1829. After Watts Souvenir of 1829 was published Close friends and family said &quot;That it was the best engraving that had yet appeared of the likeness of the author of Waverley&quot; Watts Souvenir 1829 

Post Scott&#x27;s life, 1833, W J Thompson painted a miniature for a gold memorial locket shown in William John Thompson. 
In Edinburgh, the 61.1-metre-tall Victorian Gothic spire of the Scott Monument was designed by George Meikle Kemp. It was completed in 1844, 12 years after Scott&#x27;s death, and dominates the south side of Princes Street. Scott is also commemorated on a stone slab in Makars&#x27; Court, outside The Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, along with other prominent Scottish writers; quotes from his work are also visible on the Canongate Wall of the Scottish Parliament building in Holyrood. There is a tower dedicated to his memory on Corstorphine Hill in the west of the city and Edinburgh&#x27;s Waverley railway station, opened in 1854, takes its name from his first novel.

In Glasgow, Walter Scott&#x27;s Monument dominates the centre of George Square, the main public square in the city. Designed by David Rhind in 1838, the monument features a large column topped by a statue of Scott.
There is a statue of Scott in New York City&#x27;s Central Park.

Numerous Masonic Lodges have been named after Scott and his novels. For example: Lodge Sir Walter Scott, No. 859 (Perth, Australia) and Lodge Waverley, No. 597, (Edinburgh, Scotland).

The annual Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction was created in 2010 by the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, whose ancestors were closely linked to Sir Walter Scott. At £25,000, it is one of the largest prizes in British literature. The award has been presented at Scott&#x27;s historic home, Abbotsford House.

Scott has been credited with rescuing the Scottish banknote. In 1826, there was outrage in Scotland at the attempt of Parliament to prevent the production of banknotes of less than five pounds. Scott wrote a series of letters to the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Journal&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Malachi Malagrowther&quot; for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes. This provoked such a response that the Government was forced to relent and allow the Scottish banks to continue printing pound notes. This campaign is commemorated by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the Bank of Scotland. The image on the 2007 series of banknotes is based on the portrait by Henry Raeburn.

During and immediately after World War I there was a movement spearheaded by President Wilson and other eminent people to inculcate patriotism in American school children, especially immigrants, and to stress the American connection with the literature and institutions of the &quot;mother country&quot; of Great Britain, using selected readings in middle school textbooks. Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; continued to be required reading for many American high school students until the end of the 1950s.

A bust of Scott is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. Twelve streets in Vancouver, British Columbia are named after Scott&#x27;s books or characters.

In The Inch district of Edinburgh, some 30 streets developed in the early 1950s are named for Scott (Sir Walter Scott Avenue) and for characters and places from his poems and novels. Examples include Saddletree Loan (after Bartoline Saddletree, a character in &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;), Hazelwood Grove (after Charles Hazelwood, a character in &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;) and Redgauntlet Terrace (after the 1824 novel of that name).

==Influence==
Walter Scott had an immense impact throughout Europe. &quot;His historical fiction ... created for the first time a sense of the past as a place where people thought, felt and dressed differently&quot;. His historical romances &quot;influenced Balzac, Dostoevsky, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Dumas, Pushkin, and many others; and his interpretation of history was seized on by Romantic nationalists, particularly in Eastern Europe&quot;. Also highly influential were the early translations into French by Defauconpret.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon was a great admirer of Scott and, on his death, she wrote two tributes to him: &quot;On Walter Scott&quot; in the Literary Gazette, and &quot;Sir Walter Scott&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833. Towards the end of her life she began a series called &quot;The Female Picture Gallery&quot; with a series of character analyses based on the women in Scott&#x27;s works.

Victor Hugo, in his 1823 essay, &quot;Sir Walter Scott: Apropos of Quentin Durward&quot;, writes:
Alessandro Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1827) has similarities with Walter Scott&#x27;s historic novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, although evidently distinct.

In Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;La Fanfarlo&quot; (1847), poet Samuel Cramer says of Scott:

In the novella, however, Cramer proves as deluded a romantic as any hero in one of Scott&#x27;s novels.

Jane Austen, in a letter to her nephew James Edward Austen on 16 December 1816, writes:
In Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1817) Anne Elliot and Captain James Benwick discuss the &quot;richness of the present age&quot; of poetry, and whether &quot;Marmion&quot; or &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; is the more preferred work.

Mary Shelley, while researching for her historical novel &quot;The Fortunes of Perkin Warbeck&quot; (1830), wrote a letter to Walter Scott on 25 May 1829, asking him for information on any works or manuscripts he knew about Perkin Warbeck, she concludes the letter:
In Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847) St. John Rivers gives a copy of &quot;Marmion&quot; to Jane to provide her &quot;evening solace&quot; during her stay in her small lodging.

Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was influenced by the novels of Walter Scott. In particular, according to Juliet Barker, &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817) had a significant influence on Brontë&#x27;s novel, which, though &quot;regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel ... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott&#x27;s Border country&quot;. &quot;Rob Roy&quot; is set &quot;in the wilds of Northumberland, among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones&quot;, while Cathy Earnshaw &quot;has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations&quot; (Barker p. 501).

In Anne Brontë&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1848) the narrator, Gilbert Markham, brings an elegantly bound copy of &quot;Marmion&quot; as a present to the independent &quot;tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (Helen Graham) whom he is courting, and is mortified when she insists on paying for it.

In George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Middlemarch&quot; (1871), Mr. Trumbull remarks to Mary Garth: 
Thomas Hardy, in his 1888 essay, &quot;The Profitable Reading of Fiction&quot;, writes:
The many other British novelists whom Scott influenced included Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Charles Kingsley, and Robert Louis Stevenson. He also shaped children&#x27;s writers like Charlotte Yonge and G. A. Henty.

Nathaniel Hawthorne, in a letter to his sister Elizabeth on 31 October 1820, writes:
Edgar Allan Poe, an admirer of Scott, was particularly captivated with &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;, calling it &quot;that purest, and most enthralling of fictions&quot;, and &quot;the master novel of Scott.&quot;

In a speech delivered at Salem, Massachusetts, on 6 January 1860, to raise money for the families of the executed abolitionist John Brown and his followers, Ralph Waldo Emerson calls Brown an example of true chivalry, which consists not in noble birth but in helping the weak and defenseless and declares that &quot;Walter Scott would have delighted to draw his picture and trace his adventurous career.&quot;

Henry James, in his 1864 essay, &quot;Fiction and Sir Walter Scott&quot;, writes:
In his 1870 memoir, &quot;Army Life in a Black Regiment&quot;, New England abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson (later editor of Emily Dickinson), described how he wrote down and preserved Negro spirituals or &quot;shouts&quot; while serving as a colonel in the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first authorized Union Army regiment recruited from freedmen during the Civil War. He wrote that he was &quot;a faithful student of the Scottish ballads, and had always envied Sir Walter the delight of tracing them out amid their own heather, and of writing them down piecemeal from the lips of aged crones.&quot;

According to Marx&#x27;s daughter Eleanor, Scott was &quot;an author to whom Karl Marx again and again returned, whom he admired and knew as well as he did Balzac and Fielding.&quot;

Mark Twain, in his 1883 &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;, satirized the impact of Scott&#x27;s writings, declaring with humorous hyperbole that Scott &quot;had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it existed before the [American Civil] war&quot; that he is &quot;in great measure responsible for the war.&quot; He goes on to coin the term &quot;Sir Walter Scott disease&quot;, describing a respect for aristocracy, a social acceptance of duels and vendettas, and a taste for fantasy and romanticism, which he blames for the South&#x27;s lack of advancement. Twain also targeted Scott in &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, where he names a sinking boat the &quot;Walter Scott&quot; (1884); and, in &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1889), the main character repeatedly utters &quot;Great Scott!&quot; as an oath; by the end of the book, however, he has become absorbed in the world of knights in armour, reflecting Twain&#x27;s ambivalence on the topic.

In &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1908) by Lucy Maude Montgomery, as Anne is bringing in the cows from pasture:
The idyllic Cape Cod retreat of suffragists Verena Tarrant and Olive Chancellor in Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1886) is called Marmion, evoking what James considered the Quixotic idealism of such social reformers.

In &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; by Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Ramsey glances at her husband:
Virginia Woolf, in a letter to Hugh Walpole on 12 September 1932, writes:
John Cowper Powys described Walter Scott&#x27;s romances as &quot;by far the most powerful literary influence of my life&quot;. This can be seen particularly in his two historical novels, &quot;&quot;, set during the end of Roman rule in Britain, and &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;.

In 1951, science-fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote &quot;Breeds There a Man...?&quot;, a short story with a title alluding vividly to Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; (1805). In Harper Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1960), the protagonist&#x27;s brother is made to read Walter Scott&#x27;s book &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; to the ailing Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. In &quot;Mother Night&quot; (1961) by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., memoirist and playwright Howard W. Campbell Jr. prefaces his text with the six lines beginning &quot;Breathes there the man...&quot; In &quot;Knights of the Sea&quot; (2010) by Canadian author Paul Marlowe, there are several references to &quot;Marmion&quot;, as well as an inn named after &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, and a fictitious Scott novel entitled &quot;The Beastmen of Glen Glammoch&quot;.

===The other arts===

Although Scott&#x27;s own appreciation of music was basic, to say the least, he had a considerable influence on composers. Some 90 operas based to some extent on his poems and novels have been traced, the most celebrated being Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La donna del lago&quot; (1819, based on &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;) and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (1835, based on &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;). Others include Donizetti&#x27;s 1829 opera &quot;Il castello di Kenilworth&quot; based on &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, Georges Bizet&#x27;s La jolie fille de Perth (1867, based on &quot;The Fair Maid of Perth&quot;), and Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1891).

Many of Scott&#x27;s songs were set to music by composers throughout the 19th century. Seven from &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; were set in German translations by Schubert, one of them being &#x27;Ellens dritter Gesang&#x27; popularly known as &#x27;Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Ave Maria&quot;&#x27;. Three lyrics, also in translation, appear from Beethoven in his &quot;Twenty-Five Scottish Songs&quot;, Op. 108. Other notable musical responses include three overtures: &quot;Waverley&quot; (1828) and &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1831) by Berlioz, and &quot;The Land of the Mountain and the Flood&quot; (1887, alluding to &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;) by Hamish MacCunn. &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; from &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; was set to music around 1812 by the songwriter James Sanderson ( – ). See the Wikipedia article &quot;Hail to the Chief.&quot;

The Waverley Novels are full of eminently paintable scenes and many 19th-century artists responded to them. Among the outstanding paintings of Scott subjects are: Richard Parkes Bonington&#x27;s &quot;Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leicester&quot; (&quot;c.&quot; 1827) from &quot;Kenilworth&quot; in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Enlèvement de Rebecca&quot; (1846) from &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; and Millais&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1878) in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.

Walter Scott features as a character in Sara Sheridan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fair Botanists&quot; (2021).

<doc id="27885" wikidata="Q14118" url="?curid=27885" title="Savoy">
<text>Savoy (; ) is a cultural-historical region in the Western Alps. Situated on the cultural boundary between Occitania and Piedmont, the area extends from Lake Geneva in the north to the Dauphiné in the south and west and to the Aosta Valley in the east.

Savoy emerged as the feudal County of Savoy ruled by the House of Savoy during the 11th to 14th centuries.
The original territory, also known as &quot;ducal Savoy&quot; or &quot;Savoy proper&quot;, is largely co-terminous with the modern French Savoie and Haute-Savoie &quot;départements&quot;, but the historical expansion of Savoyard territories, as the Duchy of Savoy (1416–1860) included parts of what is now western Italy and southwestern Switzerland. The current border between France and Italy is due to the Plombières Agreement of 1858, which in preparation for the unification of Italy ceded western Savoy to France, while the eastern territories in Piedmont and Liguria were retained by the House of Savoy, which was to become the ruling dynasty of Italy.

==Geography==
In modern France, Savoy is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. Following its annexation to France in 1860, the territory of Savoy was divided administratively into two separate departments, Savoie and Haute-Savoie.

The traditional capital remains Chambéry (in Italian: Ciamberì from the Latin: Camberia), on the rivers Leysse and Albane, hosting the castle of the House of Savoy and the Savoyard senate. The state included six districts:
* Savoie Propre, sometimes known as Ducal Savoy (capital Chambéry)
* Chablais (capital Thonon-les-Bains)
* Faucigny (capital Bonneville)
* Tarentaise (capital Moûtiers)
* Maurienne (capital Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne)
* Genevois (capital Annecy)

The County and Duchy of Savoy incorporated Turin and other territories in Piedmont, a region in northwestern Italy that borders Savoy, which were also possessions of the House of Savoy. The capital of the Duchy remained at the traditional Savoyard capital of Chambéry until 1563, when it was moved to Turin.

==History==

===Early history===

The region was occupied by the Allobroges, a Gallic people that the Roman Republic subdued in 121 BC. The name &quot;Savoy&quot; stems from the Late Latin &quot;Sapaudia&quot;, referring to a fir, or upland, forest. The word is likely ultimately from Gaulish – sapin itself is a blend of Gaulish &quot;sappos&quot; (fir tree) and Latin &quot;pinus&quot; (pine tree). It is first recorded in Ammianus Marcellinus (354), to describe the southern part of &quot;Maxima Sequanorum&quot;. According to the &quot;Chronica Gallica&quot; of 452, the Burgundians were settled in the territory of Sapaudia in 443, after the Burgundian defeat by Flavius Aetius.

===Early and High Middle Ages===
By the 8th century, the territory that would later become known as Savoy was part of Francia, and at the division of Francia at the Treaty of Verdun in 843, it became part of the short-lived kingdom of Middle Francia. After only 12 years, at the death of Lothair I in 855, Middle Francia was divided into Lotharingia north of the Alps, Italy south of the Alps, and the parts of Burgundy in the Western Alps, inherited by Charles of Provence. This latter territory comprised what would become known as Savoy and Provence. For a short time, this province fell to the Arabs.

From the 10th to 14th century, parts of what would ultimately become Savoy remained within the Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles. Beginning in the 11th century, the gradual rise to power of the House of Savoy is reflected in the increasing territory of their County of Savoy between 1003 and 1416.

The County of Savoy was detached &quot;de jure&quot; from the Kingdom of Arles by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1361. It acquired the County of Nice in 1388, and in 1401 added the County of Geneva, the area of Geneva except for the city proper, which was ruled by its prince-bishop, nominally under the duke&#x27;s rule: the bishops of Geneva, by unspoken agreement, came from the House of Savoy until 1533.

===Duchy of Savoy===
On 19 February 1416 Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, made the County of Savoy an independent duchy, with Amadeus VIII as the first duke. Straddling the Alps, Savoy lay within two competing spheres of influence, a French sphere and a North Italian one. At the time of the Renaissance, Savoy showed only modest development. Its towns were few and small. Savoy derived its subsistence from agriculture. The geographic location of Savoy was also of military importance. During the interminable wars between France and Spain over the control of northern Italy, Savoy was important to France because it provided access to Italy. Savoy was important to Spain because it served as a buffer between France and the Spanish held lands in Italy. In 1563 Emmanuel Philibert moved the capital from Chambéry to Turin, which was less vulnerable to French interference.

Vaud was annexed by Bern in 1536, and Savoy officially ceded Vaud to Bern in the Treaty of Lausanne of 30 October 1564.

In 1714, as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession, Savoy was technically subsumed into the Kingdom of Sicily, then (after that island was traded to Austria for Sardinia) the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1720. While the heads of the House of Savoy were known as the Kings of Sardinia, Turin remained their capital.

===French Revolutionary Wars===
Savoy was occupied by French revolutionary forces between 1792 and 1815. The entire region was first created to form the département of Mont-Blanc. In 1798, it was then divided between the departments of Mont-Blanc and Léman (French name of Lake Geneva). In 1801, Savoy officially left the Holy Roman Empire. On 13 September 1793 the combined forces of Savoy, Piedmont and Aosta Valley fought against and lost to the occupying French forces at the Battle of Méribel (Sallanches).

Two-thirds of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the First Restoration of 1814 following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication; approximately one-third of Savoy, including the two most important cities of Chambéry and Annecy, remained in France. Following Napoleon&#x27;s brief return to power during the Hundred Days and subsequent defeat at Waterloo, the remaining one-third of Savoy was restored to the Kingdom of Sardinia at the Congress of Vienna to strengthen Sardinia as a buffer state on France&#x27;s southeastern border.

===Modern history===

====Annexation to France====

The French Second Republic first attempted to annex Savoy in 1848. A corps of 1,500 was dispatched from Lyon and invaded Savoy on 3 April, occupying Chambéry (capital city) and proclaiming the annexation to France. On learning about the invasion countrymen rushed to Chambéry. The corps were chased away by the local population. Five Frenchmen were killed and 800 captured.

On 21 July 1858 in Plombières-les-Bains, Vosges, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, met in secret with Napoleon III to secure French military support against the Austrian Empire during the conflicts associated with the Italian unification. During the discussion, Cavour promised that Sardinia would cede the County of Nice and Duchy of Savoy to the Second French Empire. Though this was a secret arrangement, it quickly became widely known.

The treaty annexing Nice and Savoy to France was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 (Treaty of Turin). In the northern provinces of the Chablais and Faucigny, there was some support for annexation to neighboring Switzerland, with which the northern provinces had longstanding economic ties. To help reduce the attractiveness of Switzerland, the French government conceded a Free-Trade Zone that maintained the longstanding duty-free relationship of northern Savoyard communes to Geneva. After the treaty was already signed, a plebiscite was held on 22–23 April. Employing universal male suffrage, voters in the ceded provinces were offered the option of voting &quot;Yes&quot; to approve the treaty and join France or voting &quot;No&quot; and rejecting the treaty. Voters were not permitted the options of either joining Switzerland, remaining with Italy, or regaining its independence, were the source of some opposition. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of vote-rigging, notably by the British government, which opposed continental expansion by its traditional French enemy. The correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; in Savoy who was in Bonneville on 22 April called the vote &quot;the lowest and most immoral farce(s) which was ever played in the history of nations&quot;. He finished his letter with those words: I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this trip, which will show clearly what the vote was in this part of Savoy. The vote was the bitterest irony ever made on popular suffrage. The ballot-box in the hands of those very authorities who issued the proclamations; no control possible; even travellers suspected and dogged lest they should pry into the matter; all opposition put down by intimidation, and all liberty of action completely taken away. One can really scarcely reproach the Opposition with having given up the game; there was too great force used against them. As for the result of the vote, therefore, no one need trouble himself about it; it will be just as brilliant as that in Nice. The only danger is lest the Savoy authorities in their zeal should fare as some of the French did in the vote of 1852, finding to their surprise rather more votes than voters inscribed on the list. In his letter to the ambassador of Vienna Lord Augustus Loftus, the then–Foreign Secretary, Lord John Russell, said, &quot;Voting in Savoy and Nice a farce ... we are neither entertained or edified&quot;.

The annexation was promulgated on 14 June 1860. On 23 August 1860 and 7 March 1861, two agreements were signed between the Second French Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia to settle the remaining issues concerning the annexation.

This was part of a secret agreement (the Plombières Agreement) brokered between the French emperor Napoleon III and the Count Camillo of Cavour (Prime Minister of Sardinia at that time) that allowed the final steps in the process of unification of Italy. Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s dynasty, the House of Savoy, retained its Italian lands of Piedmont and Liguria and became the ruling dynasty of Italy.

====20th century====
In 1919, contrary to the annexation treaty, France officially ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the Congress of Vienna, and also eliminated the free trade zone – both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in World War I. France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the Treaty of Turin regarding the provinces of Savoy and Nice.

In 1960, the term &quot;annexation&quot; having acquired negative connotations in France, particularly after Germany&#x27;s 1871 annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, the annexation was renamed &quot;Rattachement de la Savoie à la France&quot; (Incorporation of Savoy to France). It was the latter term which was used by the French authorities during the festivities celebrating the 100th anniversary of the annexation. Daniel Rops of the French Academy justified the new title with these words:

Savoy has begun to solemnize the feasts in 1960, commemorating the centenary of its incorporation (&quot;rattachement&quot;) to France. It is on purpose that the word incorporation (&quot;rattachement&quot;) is highlighted here: the Savoyards attach great value to it, and it is the only one they have resolved to use in the official terminology of the Centenary. In that, they are infinitely right. Yesterday another term that was used: annexation. Looking at it more closely it was wrong! Can we say annexation when we talk about a decision which was approved by 130,889 voters over 135,449? [...]. Savoy was not annexed [...] but actually incorporated freely and by the will of its inhabitants.

A former French deputy, P. Taponnier, spoke of the annexation:

In late March 1860, the betrothal ceremony of Savoy to France took place in Tuileries Palace [...], a ceremony which was a pact of love and fidelity [...] it is with free consent that she [Savoy] gave itself to France by a solemn plebiscite of which our leaders can ignore neither the terms nor the commitments. [...] May the bells of our cities [...] in Savoy vibrate in unison to glorify, in this magnificent Centenary, the indefectible commitment of Savoy to France. The Savoyards did not feel Italian. Besides, they spoke French. This explains why in 1858–1859 when rumours ran of the Plombières secret agreement, where Napoleon III and Cavour decided of the fate of Savoy, the Savoyards themselves took the initiative to ask for the incorporation (&quot;rattachement&quot;). [...] Incorporation, not annexation [...] The incorporation was an act of free will, in the logical order of geography and history [...].

==Politics==
===Modern regionalist politics===

Since the mid-20th century, regionalist movements have appeared in Savoy much as in other historic provinces of France. The &quot;Mouvement Région Savoie&quot; (Savoy Regional Movement) was founded in December 1971 as a &#x27;movement&#x27; (rather than a traditional political party) in favour of regional autonomy. Unlike other historic provinces, including Normandy and Brittany, Savoy does not currently have its own region within France and is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. In the 1996 local elections, the Savoy Regional Movement received 19,434 votes; it received 4,849 in the 1998 regional elections. A new non-party organisation, &quot;La Région Savoie, j’y crois !&quot; (&quot;I believe in the Savoy Region!&quot;), was founded in 1998. The organisation campaigns for the replacement of the Savoie and Haute-Savoie departments with a regional government, separate from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, with greater devolved powers.

A very marginal separatist movement has also appeared in Savoy within the past twenty years, most prominently represented by the &quot;Ligue Savoisienne&quot;, founded in 1994. In the March 1998 regional elections, 1 seat (out of 23) was won by Patrice Abeille, leader of the Ligue, which won a total of 17,865 votes across the two departments. In 2004, &quot;Waiting for Freedom in Savoy&quot; was founded to promote the peaceful separatist cause to young people.

According to surveys conducted in 2000, between 41% and 55% of the population were in favour of the proposal for a separate Savoy region. Towards the end of 2005, Hervé Gaymard called for Savoie to be given special status, similar to a French region, under his proposed &quot;Conseil des Pays de Savoie&quot;.

===Modern historiographical debates===

In recent years, sparked by the tiny Savoyard separatist movement, much attention has been focused on questioning the validity of the 1860 annexation. The Ligue Savoisienne, for example, rejects the Treaty of Turin and subsequent plebiscite as null and void, arguing that the plebiscite did not meet the standards of a free and fair vote. Today, historians generally acknowledge that the plebiscite of 1860 did feature irregularities, but they also affirm that the annexation instrument was the Treaty of Turin and not the plebiscite, whose main purpose was to demonstrate favorable public opinion in Savoy for the annexation after the signature of the treaty. In an interview for the newspaper &quot;Le Dauphiné Libéré&quot;, Sylvain Milbach, a historian at the University of Savoy, qualifies the vote as Napoleonic, but also argues that a completely free and fair vote would not have dramatically changed the outcome, as the majority of Savoyards wished to become French. This is today the official stance of the General Council of Savoie.

<doc id="27886" wikidata="Q23111" url="?curid=27886" title="Suffolk">
<text>Suffolk ( ) is a ceremonial county in the East of England and East Anglia. It is bordered by Norfolk to the north, the North Sea to the east, Essex to the south, and Cambridgeshire to the west. Ipswich is the largest settlement and the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 758,556. After Ipswich (144,957) in the south, the largest towns are Lowestoft (73,800) in the northeast and Bury St Edmunds (40,664) in the west. Suffolk contains five local government districts, which are part of a two-tier non-metropolitan county administered by Suffolk County Council.

The Suffolk coastline, which includes parts of the Suffolk &amp; Essex Coast &amp; Heaths National Landscape, is a complex habitat, formed by London Clay and crag underlain by chalk and therefore susceptible to erosion. It contains several deep estuaries, including those of the rivers Blyth, Deben, Orwell, Stour, and Alde/Ore; the latter is long and separated from the North Sea by Orford Ness, a large spit. 

Large parts of the coast are backed by heath and wetland habitats, such as Sandlings. The northeast of the county contains part of the Broads, a network of rivers and lakes which is a national park. Inland, the landscape is flat and gently undulating, and contains part of Thetford Forest on the Norfolk border and Dedham Vale National Landscape on the Essex border.

It is also known for its extensive farming and has largely arable land. Newmarket is known for horse racing, and Felixstowe is one of the largest container ports in Europe.

== History ==
=== Administration ===

The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Suffolk, and East Anglia generally, occurred on a large scale, possibly following a period of depopulation by the previous inhabitants, the Romanised descendants of the Iceni. By the fifth century, they had established control of the region. The Anglo-Saxon inhabitants later became the &quot;north folk&quot; and the &quot;south folk&quot;, from which developed the names &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;.

Suffolk was divided into four separate Quarter Sessions divisions, which met at Beccles, Bury St Edmunds, Ipswich and Woodbridge. In 1860, the number of divisions was reduced to two, when the Beccles, Ipswich and Woodbridge divisions merged into an East Suffolk division, administered from Ipswich, and the old Bury St Edmunds division became the West Suffolk division. Under the Local Government Act 1888, the two divisions were made the separate administrative counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk;

On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, East Suffolk, West Suffolk, and Ipswich were merged to form the unified county of Suffolk. The county was divided into several local government districts: Babergh, Forest Heath, Borough of Ipswich, Mid Suffolk, Borough of St Edmundsbury, Suffolk Coastal, and Waveney. This act also transferred some land near Great Yarmouth to Norfolk. As introduced in Parliament, the Local Government Act would have transferred Newmarket and Haverhill to Cambridgeshire and Colchester from Essex; such changes were not included when the act was passed into law. In 2019, Forest Heath and St Edmundsbury merged to form West Suffolk district, while Waveney and Suffolk Coastal formed East Suffolk district.

== Archaeology ==

West Suffolk, like nearby East Cambridgeshire, is renowned for archaeological finds from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Bronze Age artefacts have been found in the area between Mildenhall and West Row, in Eriswell and in Lakenheath.

In the east of the county is Sutton Hoo, the site of one of England&#x27;s most significant Anglo-Saxon archaeological finds, a ship burial containing a collection of treasures including a sword of state, helmet, gold and silver bowls, jewellery and a lyre.

The Hoxne Hoard, to date the largest assembly of late Roman silver and gold discovered in Britain, was found near the village of Hoxne in 1992.

While carrying out surveys before installing a pipeline in 2014, archaeologists for Anglian Water discovered nine skeletons and four cremation pits, at Bardwell, Barnham, Pakenham and Rougham, all near Bury St Edmunds. Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman and Medieval items were also unearthed, along with the nine skeletons believed to be of the late or Post-Roman Britain. Experts said the five-month project had recovered enough artefacts to fill half a shipping container, and that the discoveries had shed new light on their understanding of the development of small rural communities.

In 2019 an excavation of a 4th-century Roman burial in Great Whelnetham uncovered unusual burial practices. Of 52 skeletons found, a large number had been decapitated, which archaeologists claimed gave new insight into Roman traditions. The burial ground includes the remains of men, women and children who likely lived in a nearby settlement. The fact that up to 40% of the bodies were decapitated represents &quot;quite a rare find&quot;.

A survey in 2020 named Suffolk the third best place in the UK for aspiring archaeologists, and showed that the area was especially rich in finds from the Roman period, with over 1500 objects found in the preceding year.

In July 2020, metal detectorist Luke Mahoney found 1,061 silver hammered coins, estimated to be worth £100,000, in Ipswich. The coins dated back to the 15th–17th century, according to experts.

In 2020, archaeologists discovered a 7th century Anglo-Saxon cemetery with 17 cremations and 191 burials in Oulton, near Lowestoft. The graves contained the remains of men, women and children, as well as artefacts including small iron knives, silver pennies, wrist clasps, strings of amber and glass beads. According to Andrew Peachey, who carried out the excavations, the skeletons had mostly vanished because of the highly acidic soil. They were preserved as brittle shapes and &quot;sand silhouettes&quot;.

== Suffolk Pink ==
Villages and towns in Suffolk are renowned for historic, pink-washed halls and cottages, which has become known far and wide as &quot;Suffolk Pink&quot;. Decorative paint colours found in the county can range from a pale shell shade, to a deep blush brick colour.

According to research, Suffolk Pink dates back to the 14th century, when these shades were developed by local dyers by adding natural substances to a traditional limewash mix. Additives used in this process include pig or ox blood with buttermilk, elderberries and sloe juice.

Locals and historians often state that a true Suffolk Pink should be a &quot;deep dusky terracotta shade&quot;, rather than the more popular pastel hue of modern times. This has caused controversy in the past when home and business-owners alike have been reprimanded for using colours deemed incorrect, with some being forced to repaint to an acceptable shade. In 2013, famous chef Marco Pierre White had his 15th-century hotel, The Angel, in Lavenham, decorated a shade of pink that was not traditional Suffolk Pink. He was required by local authorities to repaint.

In another example of Suffolk taking its colours seriously, a homeowner in Lavenham was obligated to paint their Grade I listed cottage Suffolk Pink, to make it match a neighbouring property. The local council said it wanted all of the cottages on that particular part of the road to be the same colour, because they were a single building historically (300 years earlier).

The historic Suffolk Pink colour has also inspired the name of a British apple.

== Geography ==

Suffolk is also home to nature reserves, such as the RSPB site at Minsmere, and Trimley Marshes, a wetland under the protection of Suffolk Wildlife Trust. The clay plateau inland, deeply intercut by rivers, is often referred to as &#x27;High Suffolk&#x27;.

The west of the county lies on more resistant Cretaceous chalk. This chalk is responsible for a sweeping tract of largely downland landscapes that stretches from Dorset in the south west to Dover in the south east and north through East Anglia to the Yorkshire Wolds. The chalk is less easily eroded so forms the only significant hills in the county. The highest point in the county is Great Wood Hill, with an elevation of .

The county flower is the oxlip.

== Demography ==

According to estimates by the Office for National Statistics, the population of Suffolk in 2014 was 738,512, split almost evenly between males and females. Roughly 22% of the population was aged 65 or older, and 90.84% were White British.

Historically, the county&#x27;s population has mostly been employed as agricultural workers. An 1835 survey showed Suffolk to have 4,526 occupiers of land employing labourers, 1,121 occupiers not employing labourers, 33,040 labourers employed in agriculture, 676 employed in manufacture, 18,167 employed in retail trade or handicraft, 2,228 &#x27;capitalists, bankers etc.&#x27;, 5,336 labourers (non-agricultural), 4,940 other males aged over 20, 2,032 male servants and 11,483 female servants.

A traditional nickname for people from Suffolk is &quot;Suffolk Fair-Maids&quot;, referring to the supposed beauty of its female inhabitants in the Middle Ages. Another is &quot;Silly Suffolk&quot;, often assumed to be derived from the Old English word &quot;sælig&quot; in the meaning &quot;blessed&quot;, referring to the long history of Christianity in the county. However, use of the term &quot;Silly Suffolk&quot; can actually be dated to no earlier than 1819, and its alleged medieval origins have been shown to be mythical.

== Economy ==

The majority of agriculture in Suffolk is either agronomy or mixed farming. Farm sizes vary from anything around 80 acres (32 hectares) to over 8,000. Soil types vary from heavy clays to light sands. Crops grown include winter wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, winter and spring beans and linseed, although smaller areas of rye and oats can be found growing in areas with lighter soils along with a variety of vegetables.

The continuing importance of agriculture in the county is reflected in the Suffolk Show, which is held annually in May at Ipswich. Although latterly somewhat changed in nature, this remains primarily an agricultural show.

Companies based in Suffolk include Greene King Brewery and Branston Pickle in Bury St Edmunds. Birds Eye has its largest UK factory in Lowestoft, where all its meat products and frozen vegetables are processed. Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuit company has a base in Sudbury. The UK horse racing industry is based in Newmarket. There are two United States Air Force bases in the west of the county close to the A11. Sizewell B nuclear power station is at Sizewell on the coast near Leiston. Bernard Matthews Farms have some processing units in the county, specifically Holton. Southwold is the home of Adnams Brewery. The Port of Felixstowe is the largest container port in the United Kingdom. Other ports include Port of Lowestoft and Port of Ipswich, run by Associated British Ports. BT Group plc has its main research and development facility at Martlesham Heath.

== Education ==
=== Primary, secondary and further education ===
Suffolk has a comprehensive education system with fourteen independent schools. Unusually for the UK, some of Suffolk had a 3-tier school system in place with primary schools (ages 4–9), middle schools (ages 9–13) and upper schools (ages 13–16). However, a 2006 Suffolk County Council study concluded that Suffolk should move to the two-tier school system used in the majority of the UK. For the purpose of conversion to two-tier, the three-tier system was divided into four geographical area groupings and corresponding phases. The first phase was the conversion of schools in Lowestoft and Haverhill in 2011, followed by schools in north and west Suffolk in 2012. The remainder of the changeovers to two-tier took place from 2013, for those schools that stayed within local government control, and did not become Academies and/or free schools. The majority of schools thus now (2019) operate the more common primary to high school (11–16).

Many of the county&#x27;s upper schools have a sixth form and most further education colleges in the county offer A-level courses. In terms of school population, Suffolk&#x27;s individual schools are large with the Ipswich district with the largest school population and Forest Heath the smallest, with just two schools. In 2013, a letter said that &quot;...nearly a fifth of the schools inspected were judged inadequate. This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages.&quot;

The Royal Hospital School near Ipswich is the largest independent boarding school in Suffolk. Other boarding schools within Suffolk include Barnardiston Hall Preparatory School, Culford School, Finborough School, Framlingham College, Ipswich High School, Ipswich School, Orwell Park School, Saint Felix School and Woodbridge School.

The Castle Partnership Academy Trust in Haverhill is the county&#x27;s only All-through Academy Chain. Comprising Castle Manor Academy and Place Farm Primary Academy, the Academy Trust supports all-through education and provides opportunities for young people aged 3 to 18.

Sixth form colleges in the county include Lowestoft Sixth Form College and One in Ipswich. Suffolk is home to considerably more education colleges, which include: Lowestoft College, Easton &amp; Otley College, Suffolk New College and Northgate Sixth Form (Ipswich), Abbeygate Sixth Form, Thurston Community College (Beyton Campus) and West Suffolk College (Bury St Edmunds).

===Tertiary education===
The county has one university, the University of Suffolk, which became an independent institution with degree awarding powers and university status in 2016. The university operates at five sites, with its central hub in Ipswich. Others include Lowestoft, Bury St. Edmunds, and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The university is organised in four academic schools and in had students. 88% of the student body are aged over 21 and 46% of university students are male.

==Culture==
===Arts===

Founded in 1948 by Benjamin Britten, the annual Aldeburgh Festival is one of the UK&#x27;s major classical music festivals. Originating in Aldeburgh, it has been held at the nearby Snape Maltings since 1967. Since 2006, Henham Park, has been home to the annual Latitude Festival. This mainly open-air festival, which has grown considerably in size and scope, includes popular music, comedy, poetry and literary events. 

The FolkEast festival is held at Glemham Hall in August and attracts international acoustic, folk and roots musicians whilst also championing local businesses, heritage and crafts. In 2015 it was also home to the first instrumental festival of musical instruments and makers. More recently, LeeStock Music Festival has been held in Sudbury. A celebration of the county, &quot;Suffolk Day&quot;, was instigated in 2017.

===Dialect===
The Suffolk dialect is very distinctive. Epenthesis and yod-dropping is common, along with non-conjugation of verbs.

===Sport===
====Football====
The county&#x27;s sole professional football club is Ipswich Town. Formed in 1878, the club were Football League First Division champions in 1961–62, FA Cup winners in 1977–78 and UEFA Cup winners in 1980–81; as of the 2024–25 season, Ipswich Town play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. The club has as part of its crest the Suffolk Punch, a now endangered breed of draught horse native to the county. The next highest ranked team in Suffolk is Needham Market, who participate in the National League North, the sixth tier of English football.

====Horse racing====
The town of Newmarket is the headquarters of British horseracing – home to the largest cluster of training yards in the country and many key horse racing organisations including the National Stud, and Newmarket Racecourse. Tattersalls bloodstock auctioneers and the National Horseracing Museum are also in the town. Point to point racing takes place at Higham and Ampton.

====Speedway====
Motorcycle speedway racing has been staged in Suffolk since at least the 1950s, following the construction of the Foxhall Stadium, just outside Ipswich, home of the Ipswich Witches. The Witches are currently members of the Premier League, the UK&#x27;s first division. National League team Mildenhall Fen Tigers are also from Suffolk.

====Cricket====
Suffolk County Cricket Club compete in the Eastern Division of the Minor Counties Championship. The club has won the championship three times outright and has shared the title one other time as well as winning the MCCA Knockout Trophy once. Home games are played in Bury St Edmunds, Copdock, Exning, Framlingham, Ipswich and Mildenhall.

=== Flag ===

The Suffolk flag is a banner of arms of the coat of arms which were attributed to Edmund the Martyr, a medieval king of East Anglia. It consists of two gold arrows passing through a gold crown or with heraldic description as &quot;Azure two Arrows in saltire, points downwards, enfiled with an ancient Crown Or&quot;.

== Suffolk in popular culture ==
Novels set in Suffolk include parts of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens, &quot;The Fourth Protocol&quot;, by Frederick Forsyth, &quot;Unnatural Causes&quot; by P.D. James, Dodie Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot; by W. G. Sebald, and among Arthur Ransome&#x27;s children&#x27;s books, &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Mean to Go to Sea, Coot Club&quot; and &quot;Secret Water&quot; take place in part in the county. Roald Dahl&#x27;s short story &quot;The Mildenhall Treasure&quot; is set in Mildenhall.

A TV series about a British antiques dealer, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, was filmed in various locations in Suffolk. The reality TV series &quot;Space Cadets&quot; was filmed in Rendlesham Forest, although the producers fooled participants into believing that they were in Russia. Several towns and villages in the county have been used for location filming of other television programmes and cinema films. These include the BBC Four TV series &quot;Detectorists&quot;, an episode of &quot;Kavanagh QC,&quot; and the films &quot;Iris and&quot; &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot;.

<doc id="27888" wikidata="Q193115" url="?curid=27888" title="Scylla">
<text>In Greek mythology, Scylla ( ; , ) is a legendary, man-eating monster who lives on one side of a narrow channel of water, opposite her counterpart, the sea-swallowing monster Charybdis. The two sides of the strait are within an arrow&#x27;s range of each other—so close that sailors attempting to avoid the whirlpools of Charybdis would pass dangerously close to Scylla and vice versa.

Scylla is first attested in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where Odysseus and his crew encounter her and Charybdis on their travels. Later myth provides an origin story as a beautiful nymph who gets turned into a monster.

Book Three of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; associates the strait where Scylla dwells with the Strait of Messina between Calabria, a region of Southern Italy, and Sicily. The coastal town of Scilla in Calabria takes its name from the mythological figure of Scylla and it is said to be the home of the nymph.

The idiom &quot;between Scylla and Charybdis&quot; has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly undesirable or risky outcomes, similar to &quot;between a rock and a hard place&quot;.

==Parentage==
The parentage of Scylla varies according to author. Homer, Ovid, Apollodorus, Servius, and a scholiast on Plato, all name Crataeis as the mother of Scylla. Neither Homer nor Ovid mentions a father, but Apollodorus says that the father was either Trienus (probably a textual corruption of Triton) or Phorcus (a variant of Phorkys). Similarly, the Plato scholiast, perhaps following Apollodorus, gives the father as Tyrrhenus or Phorcus, while Eustathius on Homer, &quot;Odyssey&quot; 12.85, gave the father as Triton, or Poseidon and Crataeis as the parents.

Other authors have Hecate as Scylla&#x27;s mother. The Hesiodic &quot;Megalai Ehoiai&quot; gives Hecate and Apollo as the parents of Scylla, while Acusilaus says that Scylla&#x27;s parents were Hecate and Phorkys (so also schol. &quot;Odyssey&quot; 12.85).

Perhaps trying to reconcile these conflicting accounts, Apollonius of Rhodes says that Crataeis was another name for Hecate, and that she and Phorcys were the parents of Scylla. Likewise, Semos of Delos says that Crataeis was the daughter of Hecate and Triton, and mother of Scylla by Deimos. Stesichorus (alone) names Lamia as the mother of Scylla, possibly the Lamia who was the daughter of Poseidon, while according to Hyginus, Scylla was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna.

== Narratives ==
According to John Tzetzes and Servius&#x27; commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but the jealous Nereid Amphitrite turned her into a terrible monster by poisoning the water of the spring where Scylla would bathe.

A similar story is found in Hyginus, according to whom Scylla was loved by Glaucus, but Glaucus himself was also loved by the goddess sorceress Circe. While Scylla was bathing in the sea, the jealous Circe poured a baleful potion into the sea water which caused Scylla to transform into a frightful monster with six dog forms springing from her thighs. In this form, she attacked Odysseus&#x27; ship, robbing him of his companions.

In a late Greek myth, recorded in Eustathius&#x27; commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.

===Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; XII, Odysseus is advised by Circe to sail closer to Scylla, for Charybdis could drown his whole ship: &quot;Hug Scylla&#x27;s crag—sail on past her—top speed! Better by far to lose six men and keep your ship than lose your entire crew.&quot; She also tells Odysseus to ask Scylla&#x27;s mother, the river nymph Crataeis, to prevent Scylla from pouncing more than once. Odysseus successfully navigates the strait, but when he and his crew are momentarily distracted by Charybdis, Scylla snatches six sailors off the deck and devours them alive.
===Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;===
According to Ovid, the fisherman-turned-sea god Glaucus falls in love with the beautiful Scylla, but she is repulsed by his piscine form and flees to a promontory where he cannot follow. When Glaucus goes to Circe to request a love potion that will win Scylla&#x27;s affections, the enchantress herself becomes enamored with him. Meeting with no success, Circe becomes hatefully jealous of her rival and therefore prepares a vial of poison and pours it into the sea pool where Scylla regularly bathed, transforming her into a thing of terror even to herself.

The story was later adapted into a five-act tragic opera, &quot;Scylla et Glaucus&quot; (1746), by the French composer Jean-Marie Leclair.

===Keats&#x27; &quot;Endymion&quot;===
In John Keats&#x27; loose retelling of Ovid&#x27;s version of the myth of Scylla and Glaucus in Book 3 of &quot;Endymion&quot; (1818), the evil Circe does not transform Scylla into a monster but merely murders the beautiful nymph. Glaucus then takes her corpse to a crystal palace at the bottom of the ocean where lie the bodies of all lovers who have died at sea. After a thousand years, she is resurrected by Endymion and reunited with Glaucus.

==Paintings==
At the Carolingian abbey of Corvey in Westphalia, a unique ninth-century wall painting depicts, among other things, Odysseus&#x27; fight with Scylla. This illustration is not noted elsewhere in medieval arts.

In the Renaissance and after, it was the story of Glaucus and Scylla that caught the imagination of painters across Europe. In Agostino Carracci&#x27;s 1597 fresco cycle of &quot;The Loves of the Gods&quot; in the Farnese Gallery, the two are shown embracing, a conjunction that is not sanctioned by the myth. More orthodox versions show the maiden scrambling away from the amorous arms of the god, as in the oil on copper painting of Fillipo Lauri and the oil on canvas by Salvator Rosa in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen.

Other painters picture them divided by their respective elements of land and water, as in the paintings of the Flemish Bartholomäus Spranger (1587), now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Some add the detail of Cupid aiming at the sea-god with his bow, as in the painting of Laurent de la Hyre (1640/4) in the J. Paul Getty Museum and that of Jacques Dumont le Romain (1726) at the Musée des beaux-arts de Troyes. Two cupids can also be seen fluttering around the fleeing Scylla in the late painting of the scene by J. M. W. Turner (1841), now in the Kimbell Art Museum.

Peter Paul Rubens shows the moment when the horrified Scylla first begins to change, under the gaze of Glaucus (), while Eglon van der Neer&#x27;s 1695 painting in the Rijksmuseum shows Circe poisoning the water as Scylla prepares to bathe. There are also two Pre-Raphaelite treatments of the latter scene by John Melhuish Strudwick (1886) and John William Waterhouse (&quot;Circe Invidiosa&quot;, 1892).

<doc id="27893" wikidata="Q5571872" url="?curid=27893" title="Glossary of patience terms">
<text>Games of patience, or (card) solitaires as they are usually called in North America, have their own &#x27;language&#x27; of specialised terms such as &quot;building down&quot;, &quot;packing&quot;, &quot;foundations&quot;, &quot;talon&quot; and &quot;tableau&quot;. Once learnt they are helpful in describing, succinctly and accurately, how the games are played. Patience games are usually for a single player, although a small number have been designed for two and, in rare cases, three or even four players. They are games of skill or chance or a combination of the two. There are three classes of patience grouped by object.

The most frequent object is to arrange the cards either in ascending sequence (e.g. from Ace to King) or descending sequence. Occasionally both forms of sequence are aimed at in the same game. The card forming the starting point of the required sequence is known as the foundation card and the sequence or family is said to be &#x27;built up&#x27; on such card. In some cases foundation cards are picked out and placed in position beforehand; in others they are only laid down as they come to hand in course of play. In some instances the cards forming the sequence must be of the same suit as the foundation card; in others suit is disregarded. Some games permit the provisional formation of auxiliary sequences (descending or ascending), i.e. groups of cards in succession but not yet ripe to be played to the families or sequences on the foundation cards. A second object of many patiences is merely to &#x27;pair&#x27; cards. The cards thus paired are thrown aside and, if the player is able, under the limitations of the particular game, to throw out all the cards in this way, the game is won. A third object is to throw out or dispose of any two cards which together form a particular number, say eleven or thirteen–the player&#x27;s success, as before, depending on being able to get rid of all the cards in this manner.

It will be obvious that the endeavour to arrange, pair, or combine the cards of a whole pack is a difficult task, varying in degree according to the rules of the particular game. The player must therefore be prepared for a good many failures even when close to success. Hence why the name &#x27;patience games&#x27; has been give to recreations of this description.


== A ==
; alternating colours, alternating color, alternate colours, alternate colors
: Placing red on black cards or black on red cards alternately.

; available
: A card that is available may be picked up and laid down elsewhere.

; available cards
: Those that are not blocked or covered by other cards, &quot;i.e.&quot;, not forbidden by the particular rules of each game, to be used.

; auxiliary sequence
: A pile of cards that is packed on a depot within the tableau in readiness for being built in the reverse order on the foundations when the time is right.

== B == 
; base, base card
: See foundation card.

; batch
: A number of cards dealt at one time.

; below
: A card is below another if it is nearer to the bottom of the playing board or to the player. See also beneath.

; beneath 
: A card is beneath another if it is covered or overlapped by it. See also below.

; black (suits)
: The suits of Clubs and Spades.

; blocked
: The situation when no more legal moves can be made. In some instances the game is automatically lost; in others a grace may be used to unblock the game. Also chockered.

; build
: To place one card on the top of the other in sequence, or otherwise, according to the rules. To place cards in their final location, in stacks or cascades according to the rules.

; build down
: To place cards one on top of another in descending sequence. Cards may be &#x27;built downward&#x27;, e.g. from King to Ace.

; build up
: To place cards one on top of another in ascending sequence. Cards may be &#x27;built upward&#x27;, e.g. from Ace to King.

; buried
: See covered.

== C ==
; cascade
: Cards are built on one another, starting from the bottom up. Each card&#x27;s value and suit is face up, and should be able to be viewed by the player. However, only the top card is available for play. It is most commonly found in addition games.

; cells
: In computer games, such as freeCell, cells allow only one card at a time to be placed in them. Any card can be put in a cell. Same as space and formerly known as a depot.

; chockered
: See blocked. 

; chocker, chockering
: To become, or becoming, chockered or blocked.

; closed
: A game of incomplete information in which cards that cannot be played are discarded to a wastepile. See also open and half-open.

<text>In classical Greek mythology, Syrinx () was an Arcadian nymph and a follower of Artemis, known for her chastity. Being pursued by Pan, she fled into the river Ladon, and at her own request was metamorphosed into a reed from which Pan then made his panpipes.

== Mythology ==
=== Story ===
Syrinx was a beautiful wood nymph who had many times attracted the attention of satyrs, and fled their advances in turn. She worshipped Artemis, the goddess of wilderness, and, like her, had vowed to remain a virgin for all of time. Pursued by the amorous god Pan, she ran to a river&#x27;s edge and asked for assistance from the river nymphs. In answer, she was transformed into hollow water reeds that made a haunting sound when the god&#x27;s frustrated breath blew across them. Pan cut the reeds to fashion the first set of panpipes, which were thenceforth known as &quot;&quot;. The word &quot;syringe&quot; is derived from this word.

=== Authors ===
Ovid includes the story of Pan and Syrinx in Book One of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, where it is told by Mercury to Argus in the course of lulling him asleep in order to kill him. The myth is also preserved in the works of some anonymous Greek paradoxographer.

The story is also told in Achilles Tatius&#x27; novel &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; where the eponymous heroine is subjected to a virginity test by entering a cave where Pan has left syrinx pipes that will sound a melody if she passes. This has similarities with another myth Achilles wrote down, that of Rhodopis, who was transformed into a fountain that served as a virginity testing place for maidens.

Longus makes reference to Syrinx in his tale of &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; in Book 2:34. Whilst the description of the tale here is modified to that of Ovid, it nevertheless incorporates Pan&#x27;s desire to have her. Longus, however, makes no reference to Syrinx receiving aid from the Nymphs in his version, instead Syrinx hides from Pan in amongst some reeds and disappears into the marsh. Upon realising what had happened to Syrinx, Pan created the first set of panpipes from the reeds she was transformed into, forcing her to be with him for the rest of his days.

== Representations ==

=== In literature ===
The story became popular among artists and writers in the 19th century. Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a poem entitled &quot;A Musical Instrument&quot; describing Pan&#x27;s ruinous actions in creating the musical pipes. The Victorian artist and poet Thomas Woolner wrote &quot;Silenus&quot;, a long narrative poem about the myth, in which Syrinx becomes the lover of Silenus, but drowns when she attempts to escape rape by Pan. As a result of the crime, Pan is transmuted into a demon figure and Silenus becomes a drunkard. Amy Clampitt&#x27;s poem &quot;Syrinx&quot; refers to the myth by relating the whispering of the reeds to the difficulties of language.

The story was used as a central theme by Aifric Mac Aodha in her poetry collection &quot;Gabháil Syrinx&quot;.

Samuel R. Delany features an instrument called a syrynx in his science-fiction novel &quot;Nova&quot;.

Syrinx is the name of one of the main characters in the Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy of space opera novels by British author Peter F. Hamilton. In the trilogy, Syrinx is a member of the transhumanist future society known as Edenism, and serves as the captain of the &quot;Oenone&quot;, a living starship.

A 1972 poem by James Merrill, titled &quot;Syrinx&quot;, draws on several aspects on the mythological tale, with the poet himself identifying with the celebrated nymph, desiring to become not just a &quot;reed&quot; but a &quot;thinking reed&quot; (in contrast to a &quot;thinking stone&quot;, as critic Helen Vendler has observed, noting the influence of a Wallace Stevens lyric, &quot;Le Monocle de Mon Oncle&quot;). The poet aspires to return to his &quot;scarred case&quot; with minimal suffering inflicted by &quot;the great god Pain&quot;, a play of words on the Greek god Pan. &quot;Syrinx&quot; is the final poem in Merrill&#x27;s 1972 collection, &quot;Braving the Elements&quot;.

=== In philosophy ===
In &quot;Dark Places of Wisdom&quot;, Peter Kingsley discusses in some detail the use of the word in Parmenides&#x27; poem and in association with the ancient practice of incubation.

=== In art ===

The British Victorian artist Arthur Hacker depicted Syrinx in his 1892 nude. This painting in oil on canvas is currently on display in Manchester Art Gallery.

A sculpture of Syrinx created in 1925 by sculptor William McMillan is displayed at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.

Sculptor Adolph Wolter was commissioned in 1973 to create a replacement for a stolen sculpture of Syrinx in Indianapolis, United States. This work was a replacement for a similar statue by Myra Reynolds Richards that had been stolen. The sculpture sits in University Park located in the city&#x27;s Indiana World War Memorial Plaza.

Abraham Jannsens painted Syrinx in 1620 as part of &quot;Pan and Syrinx&quot;.

=== In music ===
Claude Debussy based his 1913 &quot;Syrinx&quot; (Debussy) on Pan&#x27;s sadness over losing his love. The piece is still popular today; it was used as incidental music in the play &quot;Psyché&quot; by Gabriel Mourey.

The story of Pan and Syrinx is the inspiration for the first movement in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s work for solo oboe, Six Metamorphoses after Ovid first performed in 1951. Britten titled the movement, &quot;Pan: who played upon the reed pipe which was Syrinx, his beloved.&quot;

Maurice Ravel incorporated the character of the Syrinx into his ballet &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;.

Gustav Holst alludes to the story of Pan and Syrinx in the opening of his Choral Symphony, which draws from the text of John Keats&#x27; 1818 poem &quot;Endymion.&quot;

French Baroque composer Michel Pignolet de Montéclair composed &quot;Pan et Syrinx&quot;, a cantata for voice and ensemble (No. 4 of &quot;Second livre de cantates&quot;).

Danish composer Carl Nielsen composed &quot;Pan and Syrinx&quot; (&quot;Pan og Syrinx&quot;), Op. 49, FS 87.

The British folk-rock band Oberon included a flute solo called &quot;Syrinx&quot; on its 1970 album, &quot;A Midsummer&#x27;s Night Dream.&quot;

Canadian electronic progressive rock band Syrinx took their name from the legend.

Canadian progressive rock band Rush have a movement titled &quot;The Temples of Syrinx&quot; in their song &quot;2112&quot; on their album &quot;2112&quot;. The song is about a dystopian futuristic society in which the arts, particularly music, have been suppressed by the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx.

Related to the Rush reference, Maryland based rockers Clutch mention the Temples of Syrinx in their song &quot;10001110101&quot; from their album &quot;Robot Hive/Exodus&quot;.
