<text>A quarantine is a restriction on the movement of people, animals, and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a communicable disease, yet do not have a confirmed medical diagnosis. It is distinct from medical isolation, in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population.

The concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include the village of Eyam in 1665 during the bubonic plague outbreak in England; East Samoa during the 1918 flu pandemic; the Diphtheria outbreak during the 1925 serum run to Nome, the 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak, the SARS pandemic, the Ebola pandemic and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020.

Ethical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country; in some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of biosecurity; for example, Australian biosecurity is governed by the single overarching &quot;Biosecurity Act 2015&quot;.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word &quot;quarantine&quot; comes from &quot;quarantena&quot; or &quot;quarantaine&quot;, meaning &quot;forty days&quot;, used in the Venetian language in the 14th and 15th centuries and also in France. The word is designated in the period during which all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the Black Death plague. The &quot;quarantena&quot; followed the &quot;trentino&quot;, or &quot;thirty-day isolation&quot; period, first imposed in 1377 in the Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia).

Merriam-Webster gives various meanings to the noun form, including &quot;a period of 40 days&quot;, several relating to ships, &quot;a state of enforced isolation&quot;, and as &quot;a restriction on the movement of people and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of disease or pests&quot;. The word is also used as a verb.

Quarantine is distinct from medical isolation, in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population.

Quarantine may be used interchangeably with &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, and although the terms are related, &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; refers to the restriction of movement of people into or out of a defined geographic area, such as a community, in order to prevent an infection from spreading.

==History==

===Ancient===
An early mention of isolation occurs in the Biblical book of Leviticus, written in the 7th century BC or perhaps earlier, which describes the procedure for separating out people infected with the skin disease Tzaraath. The medical nature of this isolation is, however, disputed. As traditional exegesis (dated 700 CE) sees it as a punishment for trespassing one of several negative commandment, most notably Evil Speech. A more recent hypothesis postulates that the infected are required to isolate themselves in order to prevent spread of disease (although the Bible does not imply contagiousness of &quot;Tzaraath&quot;):

Moses ordered that dwellings from which infected Jews had gone should be inspected before being occupied again, and that people recovering from contagious disease were not to be allowed to go abroad until examined.

===Medieval Islamic world===
A hadith attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad advised individuals present in a region with a plague outbreak to remain in place, and advised healthy individuals to avoid traveling there. The Persian Muslim polymath Avicenna argued for controlling &quot;the spread of diseases&quot; in his medical encyclopedia The Canon [Al-Qanun] of Medicine, published in 1025. He also recommended quarantine for patients with infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis.

Since the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire has isolated travellers coming from epidemic areas during the Bubonic plague. A quarantine involved isolating healthy travellers for a period of time so that it could be ascertained if they were sick or not.

The mandatory quarantine of special groups of patients, including those with leprosy, started early in Islamic history. In the early 8th century the sixth Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I segregated lepers from the general population, with some later sources crediting the caliph with opening a hospital. The separation of lepers from the general population was also practiced in the Moroccan city of Fez, where lepers were relocated to a cave system outside of the city. Dedicated leprosariums were built in the time of the Ottoman sultan Murad II in the 15th century, with some of the facilities operating for centuries.

===Medieval Europe===
The word &quot;quarantine&quot; originates from &quot;quarantena&quot;, the Venetian language form, meaning &quot;forty days&quot;. This is due to the 40-day isolation of ships and people practised as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague. Between 1348 and 1359, the Black Death wiped out an estimated 30% of Europe&#x27;s population, and a significant percentage of Asia&#x27;s population. Such a disaster led governments to establish measures of containment to handle recurrent epidemics. A document from 1377 states that before entering the city-state of Ragusa in Dalmatia (modern Dubrovnik in Croatia), newcomers had to spend 30 days (a &quot;trentine&quot;) in a restricted place (originally nearby islands) waiting to see whether the symptoms of Black Death would develop. In 1448 the Venetian Senate prolonged the waiting period to 40 days, thus giving birth to the term &quot;quarantine&quot;. The forty-day quarantine proved to be an effective formula for handling outbreaks of the plague. Dubrovnik was the first city in Europe to set up quarantine sites such as the Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik where arriving ship personnel were held for up to 40 days. According to current estimates, the bubonic plague had a 37-day period from infection to death; therefore, the European quarantines would have been highly successful in determining the health of crews from potential trading and supply ships.

Other diseases lent themselves to the practice of quarantine before and after the devastation of the plague. Those affected by leprosy were historically isolated long-term from society. Quarantine systems were enacted to prevent the spread of syphilis in Zurich in the 15th and 16th centuries, the advent of yellow fever in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and the arrival of Asiatic cholera in 1831.

Venice took the lead in measures to check the spread of plague, having appointed three guardians of public health in the first years of the Black Death (1348). The next record of preventive measures comes from Reggio/Modena in 1374. Venice founded the first lazaret (on a small island adjoining the city) in 1403. In 1467 Genoa followed the example of Venice, and in 1476 the old leper hospital of Marseille was converted into a plague hospital. The great lazaret of Marseille, perhaps the most complete of its kind, was founded in 1526 on the island of Pomègues. The practise at all the Mediterranean lazarets did not differ from the English procedure in the Levantine and North African trade. On the arrival of cholera in 1831 some new lazarets were set up at western ports; notably, a very extensive establishment near Bordeaux. Afterwards, they were used for other purposes.

===Modern history===

Epidemics of yellow fever ravaged urban communities in North America throughout the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, the best-known examples being the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic and outbreaks in Georgia (1856) and Florida (1888). Cholera and smallpox epidemics continued throughout the nineteenth century, and plague epidemics affected Honolulu and San Francisco from 1899 until 1901. State governments generally relied on the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; as a geographic quarantine measure to control the movement of people into and out of affected communities. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, some communities instituted protective sequestration (sometimes referred to as &quot;reverse quarantine&quot;) to keep the infected from introducing influenza into healthy populations. Additionally, the nature of the influenza virus that caused the 1918 pandemic gave rise to a public awareness of the dichotomy between &quot;crowd&quot; and &quot;home&quot; diseases. Simply quarantining the sick in isolation was ineffective in halting the spread of the disease, and new quarantine standards that extended regulations to public spaces became increasingly more common. Most Western countries implemented a range of containment strategies, including isolation, surveillance, and the closure of schools, churches, theatres, and public events.
People were prevented from entering the Ashanti Empire at border checkpoints if they exhibited symptoms of smallpox. Those who discovered symptoms of the disease after entering Ashanti were quarantined in remote villages. In the 1830s, both the Ottoman Empire and Egypt established new quarantine systems. In 1831, Mehmet Ali of Egypt founded the Quarantine Board in Alexandria. In 1838, the Ottoman government installed the Supreme Council of Health, including the Quarantine Administration, in Istanbul. These two institutions set up permanent quarantines throughout the eastern Mediterranean, based on the western Mediterranean quarantine model. For example, at the port of İzmir, all ships and their cargo would be inspected and those suspected of carrying the plague would be towed to separate docks and their personnel housed in separate buildings for a determined period of time. In Thessaly, along the Greek-Turkish border, all travellers entering and exiting the Ottoman Empire would be quarantined for 9–15 days. Upon appearance of the plague, the quarantine stations would be militarised and the Ottoman army would be involved in border control and disease monitoring.

====International conventions 1852–1927====
Since 1852, several conferences were held involving European powers, with a view to uniform action in keeping out infection from the East and preventing its spread within Europe. All but that of 1897 were concerned with cholera. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by the United Kingdom for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta, and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.

The Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the Suez Canal route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.

A multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912. This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter. It was signed by 40 countries, and consisted of 160 articles. Ratifications by 16 of the signatories were exchanged in Paris on 7 October 1920. Another multilateral convention was signed in Paris on 21 June 1926, to replace that of 1912. It was signed by 58 countries worldwide, and consisted of 172 articles.

In Latin America, a series of regional sanitary conventions were concluded. Such a convention was concluded in Rio de Janeiro on 12 June 1904. A sanitary convention between the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay was concluded in Montevideo on 21 April 1914. The convention covers cases of Asiatic cholera, oriental plague and yellow fever. It was ratified by the Uruguayan government on 13 October 1914, by the Paraguayan government on 27 September 1917 and by the Brazilian government on 18 January 1921.

Sanitary conventions were also concluded between European states. A Soviet-Latvian sanitary convention was signed on 24 June 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 18 October 1923. A bilateral sanitary convention was concluded between the governments of Latvia and Poland on 7 July 1922, for which ratifications were exchanged on 7 April 1925. Another was concluded between the governments of Germany and Poland in Dresden on 18 December 1922, and entered into effect on 15 February 1923. Another one was signed between the governments of Poland and Romania on 20 December 1922. Ratifications were exchanged on 11 July 1923. The Polish government also concluded such a convention with the Soviet government on 7 February 1923, for which ratifications were exchanged on 8 January 1924. A sanitary convention was also concluded between the governments of Poland and Czechoslovakia on 5 September 1925, for which ratifications were exchanged on 22 October 1926. A convention was signed between the governments of Germany and Latvia on 9 July 1926, for which ratifications were exchanged on 6 July 1927.

In 1897, the incubation period for this disease was determined and this was to be adopted for administrative purposes. The incubation period was comparatively short, some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a majority. The principle of disease notification was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify other governments of the existence of plague within their jurisdictions and state the measures of prevention being carried out to prevent its spread. The area declared infected was limited to the district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no spread. It was decided during the prevalence of plague, every country had the right to close its land borders to traffic. At the Red Sea, it was decided after discussion a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the incubation period of the disease and that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal up in quarantine at Port Said by night or by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal in quarantine and subject only to the landing of those who have plague.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of Andrew Speaker (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and Kaci Hickox (Ebola, 2014). During the 1957–58 influenza pandemic and the 1968 flu pandemic, several countries implemented measures to control spread of the disease. In addition, the World Health Organization applied a global influenza surveillance network.

During the 1994 plague in India, many people were quarantined. Vessels and aircraft carrying passengers were fumigated.

In the SARS epidemic, thousands of Chinese people were quarantined and checkpoints to take temperatures were set up.

Moving infected patients to isolation wards and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was ended in 2016; members of the 8th WHO Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China has employed mass quarantines – firstly of the city of Wuhan and subsequently of all of the Hubei province (population 55.5 million) – in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. After a few weeks, the Italian government imposed lockdowns for the entire country (more than 60 million people) in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease there. India quarantined itself from the world for a period of one month. Most governments around the world restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak. By late 2020, the virus had already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.

== Signals and flags ==
Plain yellow, green, and even black flags have been used to symbolise disease in both ships and ports, with the colour yellow having a longer historical precedent, as a colour of marking for houses of infection, previous to its use as a maritime marking colour for disease. The former flag used for the purpose was the &quot;Lima&quot; (L) flag, which is a mixture of yellow and black flags previously used. It is sometimes called the &quot;yellow jack&quot; but this was also a name for yellow fever, which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the colour of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag). The plain yellow flag (&quot;Quebec&quot; or Q in international maritime signal flags) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in &quot;quarantine&quot;, but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite—a ship that &#x27;requests free pratique&#x27;, i.e. that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.

Ships in quarantine today would fly either the Q flag alone, meaning &quot;My vessel is &#x27;healthy&#x27; and I request free pratique&quot;, or the double Q flag (QQ), meaning &quot;I require health clearance&quot;.

==Ethical and practical considerations==
The quarantining of people often raises questions of civil rights, especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of Mary Mallon (also known as Typhoid Mary), a typhoid fever carrier who was arrested and quarantined in 1907 and later spent the last 23 years and 7 months of her life in medical isolation at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island.

===The United Nations and the Siracusa Principles===
Guidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in the Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights and adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 1984. The Siracusa Principles state that restrictions on human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must meet standards of legality, evidence-based necessity, proportionality, and gradualism, noting that public health can be used as grounds for limiting certain rights if the state needs to take measures &#x27;aimed at preventing disease or injury or providing care for the sick and injured.&#x27; Limitations on rights (such as quarantine) must be &#x27;strictly necessary,&#x27; meaning that they must:
* respond to a pressing public or social need (health)
* proportionately pursue a legitimate aim (prevent the spread of infectious disease)
* be the least restrictive means required for achieving the purpose of the limitation
* be provided for and carried out in accordance with the law
* be neither arbitrary nor discriminatory
* only limit rights that are within the jurisdiction of the state seeking to impose the limitation.

In addition, when quarantine is imposed, public health ethics specify that:
* all restrictive actions must be well-supported by data and scientific evidence
* all information must be made available to the public
* all actions must be explained clearly to those whose rights are restricted and to the public
* all actions must be subject to regular review and reconsideration.

Finally, the state is ethically obligated to guarantee that:
* infected people will not be threatened or abused
* basic needs such as food, water, medical care, and preventive care will be provided
* communication with loved ones and with caretakers will be permitted
* constraints on freedom will be applied equally, regardless of social considerations
* patients will be compensated fairly for economic and material losses, including salary.

===Psychological impact===

Quarantine can have adverse psychological effects on the quarantined, including post-traumatic stress, confusion, and anger. According to a &quot;Rapid Review&quot; published in The Lancet in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.&quot; Although youngsters appear to be less vulnerable to COVID-19, the side effects of the pandemic can be devastating. Quarantine from the pandemic led to an increase the prevalence of violence in the family, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Children and adolescents may be highly exposed to biopsychosocial stressors generated by the pandemic and once population&#x27;s containment measures to reduce virus spread are required, they could be potentially affected by the disruption in daily life routine as a result of social isolation and their unseasoned ability to conceive and comprehend the short- and long-term consequences of this outbreak.

===Short-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination===
Quarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected anthrax attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a decontamination shower. For example, an article entitled &quot;Daily News workers quarantined&quot; describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.

The February–March 2003 issue of &quot;HazMat Magazine&quot; suggests that people be &quot;locked in a room until proper decon could be performed&quot;, in the event of &quot;suspect anthrax&quot;.

&quot;Standard-Times&quot; senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:
The purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a vector.

New developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the ambulance bus, mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.

==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==
===Australia===

Biosecurity in Australia is governed by the &quot;Biosecurity Act 2015&quot;. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods, and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from DAFF. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$444, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$444,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.

Australia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome—including the Torres Strait—is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians. As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world. If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.

===Canada===
There are three quarantine Acts of Parliament in Canada: &quot;Quarantine Act&quot; (humans), &quot;Health of Animals Act&quot; (animals), and &quot;Plant Protection Act&quot; (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the &quot;Quarantine Act&quot;.

Under the &quot;Quarantine Act&quot;, all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with communicable diseases or vectors, they must disclose their whereabouts to a Border Services Officer. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any peace officer may arrest without warrant.

A QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.

Under the &quot;Health of Animals Act&quot; and &quot;Plant Protection Act&quot;, inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.

Each province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.

===Hong Kong===

Under the &quot;Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance&quot; (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.

The law allows for health officers who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected, and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.

Under the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the Civil Aid Service, or member of the Auxiliary Medical Service can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.

===United Kingdom===
To reduce the risk of introducing rabies from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an HM Customs and Excise pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as Pet Passports, where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate vaccinations.

====British maritime quarantine rules 1711–1896====

The plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the (9 Ann. c. 2). The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the Baltic region. A second act of Parliament, the Quarantine Act 1721 (8 Geo. 1. c. 10), was due to the prevalence of plague at Marseille and other places in Provence, France. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in continental Europe, and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in Messina. A rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into the Levant Trade Act 1752, an act regulating trade with the Levant, and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic region. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine and Customs Act 1788 (28 Geo. 3. c. 34) was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823–24 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act of Parliament making quarantine only at discretion of the privy council, which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe, despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865–66, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean bill of health from the Black Sea and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.

After the passing of the Quarantine Act 1710 the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an indemnity. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a &quot;foul bill&quot; (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the lazarets of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa, or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 Stangate Creek (on the Medway) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of floating hulks were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to dews) having been done previously on the ship&#x27;s deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of Royal Customs and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic region had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a yellow flag in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four leagues of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man.

After 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near Chatham (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with hides from Mogador in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the Nore, the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship&#x27;s deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the Public Health Act 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the Local Government Board the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the Public Health Act 1875.

British regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to yellow fever, plague and cholera. Officers of Her Majesty&#x27;s Customs, as well as of Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and the Board of Trade (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the port sanitary authority. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and bilge-water and water-ballast pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.

===United States===
In the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments. States (and tribal governments recognised by the federal government) have primary authority to quarantine people within their boundaries. Federal jurisdiction only applies to people moving across state or national borders, or people on federal property.

====Federal rules====

Communicable diseases for which apprehension, detention, or conditional release of people are authorised must be specified in Executive Orders of the President. As of 2014, these include Executive Orders 13295 13375, and 13674; the latest executive order specifies the following infectious diseases: cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral haemorrhagic fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American, and others not yet isolated or named), severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), and influenza from a novel or re-emergent source.

The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for quarantine decisions, specifically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. As of 21 March 2017, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulations specify:
* All commercial passenger flights must report deaths or illnesses to the CDC.
* Individuals must apply for a travel permit if they are under a Federal quarantine, isolation, or conditional release order.
* When an individual who is moving between U.S. states is &quot;reasonably believed to be infected&quot; with a quarantinable communicable disease in a &quot;qualifying stage&quot;, the CDC may apprehend or examine that individual for potential infection.

====US quarantine facilities====
The Division of Global Migration Health (DGMH) of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) operates small quarantine facilities at a number of US ports of entry. As of 2014, these included one land crossing (in El Paso, Texas) and 19 international airports.

Besides the port of entry where it is located, each station is also responsible for quarantining potentially infected travellers entering through any ports of entry in its assigned region. These facilities are fairly small; each one is operated by a few staff members and capable of accommodating 1–2 travellers for a short observation period. Cost estimates for setting up a temporary larger facility, capable of accommodating 100 to 200 travellers for several weeks, have been published by the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) in 2008 of the Transportation Research Board.

====US quarantine of imported goods====
The United States puts immediate quarantines on imported products if a contagious disease is identified and can be traced back to a certain shipment or product. All imports will also be quarantined if the disease appears in other countries. According to Title 42 U.S.C. §§264 and 266 , these statutes provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services peacetime and wartime authority to control the movement of people into and within the United States to prevent the spread of communicable disease.
====History of quarantine laws in the US====

Quarantine law began in Colonial America in 1663, when in an attempt to curb an outbreak of smallpox, the city of New York established a quarantine. In the 1730s, the city built a quarantine station on the Bedloe&#x27;s Island. The Philadelphia Lazaretto was the first quarantine hospital in the United States, built in 1799, in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. There are similar national landmarks such as the Columbia River Quarantine Station, Swinburne Island and Angel Island. The Pest House in Concord, Massachusetts was used as early as 1752 to quarantine those with cholera, tuberculosis and smallpox.

In early June 1832, during the cholera epidemic in New York, Governor Enos Throop called a special session of the Legislature for 21 June, to pass a Public Health Act by both Houses of the State Legislature. It included to a strict quarantine along the Upper and Lower New York-Canadian frontier. In addition, New York City Mayor Walter Browne established a quarantine against all peoples and products of Europe and Asia, which prohibited ships from approaching closer than 300 yards to the city, and all vehicles were ordered to stop 1.5 miles away.

The Immigrant Inspection Station on Ellis Island, built in 1892, is often mistakenly assumed to have been a quarantine station, however its marine hospital (Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital) only qualified as a contagious disease facility to handle less virulent diseases like measles, trachoma and less advanced stages of tuberculosis and diphtheria; those affected by smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, leprosy or typhoid fever, could neither be received nor treated there.

Mary Mallon was quarantined in 1907 under the Greater New York Charter, Sections 1169–1170, which permitted the New York City Board of Health to &quot;remove to a proper place...any person sick with any contagious, pestilential or infectious disease.&quot;

During the 1918 flu pandemic, people were also quarantined. Most commonly suspect cases of infectious diseases are requested to voluntarily quarantine themselves, and Federal and local quarantine statutes only have been uncommonly invoked since then, including for a suspected smallpox case in 1963.

The 1944 Public Health Service Act &quot;to apprehend, detain, and examine certain infected persons who are peculiarly likely to cause the interstate spread of disease&quot; clearly established the federal government&#x27;s quarantine authority for the first time. It gave the United States Public Health Service responsibility for preventing the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States, and expanded quarantine authority to include incoming aircraft. The act states that &quot;...any individual reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage and...if found to be infected, may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary.&quot;

No federal quarantine orders were issued from 1963 until 2020, as American citizens were evacuated from China during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Notable quarantines==
===Eyam village, 1665 (plague)===
Eyam was a village in Britain that imposed a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; on itself to stop the spread of the bubonic plague to other communities in 1665. The plague ran its course over 14 months and one account states that it killed at least 260 villagers. The church in Eyam has a record of 273 individuals who were victims of the plague.

===Convict ship &quot;Surry&quot;, Sydney Harbour, 1814 (typhoid)===
On 28 July 1814, the convict ship &quot;Surry&quot; arrived in Sydney Harbour from England. Forty-six people had died of typhoid during the voyage, including 36 convicts, and the ship was placed in quarantine on the North Shore. Convicts were landed, and a camp was established in the immediate vicinity of what is now Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli. This was the first site in Australia to be used for quarantine purposes.

===&#x27;Typhoid Mary&#x27; (US), 1907–1910 and 1915–1938===
Mary Mallon was a cook who was found to be a carrier of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, the cause of typhoid fever, and was forcibly isolated from 1907 to 1910. At least 53 cases of the infection were traced to her, and three deaths. Subsequently, she spent a further 23 years in isolation prior to her death in 1938. The presence of the bacteria in her gallbladder was confirmed on autopsy.

===East Samoa, 1918 (flu pandemic)===
During the 1918 flu pandemic, the then Governor of American Samoa, John Martin Poyer, imposed a full protective sequestration of the islands from all incoming ships, successfully preventing influenza from infecting the population and thus achieving zero deaths within the territory. In contrast, the neighbouring New Zealand-controlled Western Samoa was among the hardest hit, with a 90% infection rate and over 20% of its adults dying from the disease. This failure by the New Zealand government to prevent and contain the Spanish Flu subsequently rekindled Samoan anti-colonial sentiments that led to its eventual independence.

===Gruinard Island, 1942–1990 (anthrax)===
In 1942, during World War II, British forces tested out their biological weapons program on Gruinard Island and infected it with anthrax. Subsequently, a quarantine order was placed on the island. The quarantine was lifted in 1990, when the island was declared safe, and a flock of sheep was released onto the island.

===Apollo series space explorers, 1969–1971===
Between 24 July 1969 and 9 February 1971, the astronauts of Apollo 11, Apollo 12, and Apollo 14, were quarantined (in each case for a total of 21 days) after returning to Earth, initially where they were recovered, and then were transferred to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory, to prevent possible interplanetary contamination by microorganisms from the Moon. All lunar samples were also held in the biosecure environment of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory for initial assay.

===Yugoslavia, 1972 (smallpox)===
The 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak was the final outbreak of smallpox in Europe. The World Health Organization fought the outbreak with extensive quarantine and a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, and the government instituted martial law.

===Case of Kaci Hickox&#x27; return to US, 2014 (Ebola)===
In 2014, Kaci Hickox, a Doctors Without Borders nurse from Maine, legally battled 21-day quarantines imposed by the states of New Jersey and Maine after returning home from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. &quot;Hickox was sequestered in a medical tent for days because New Jersey announced new Ebola regulations the day she arrived. She eventually was allowed to travel to Maine, where the state sought to impose a &#x27;voluntary quarantine&#x27; before trying and failing to create a buffer between her and others. A state judge rejected attempts to restrict her movements, saying she posed no threat as long as she wasn&#x27;t demonstrating any symptoms of Ebola. Hickox said health care professionals like those at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – not politicians like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Maine Gov. Paul LePage – should be in charge of making decisions that are grounded in science, not fear.&quot;

===COVID-19 pandemic, 2020–2023===

During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple governmental actors enacted quarantines in an effort to curb the rapid spread of the virus. Quarantine-like restrictions on movement included curfews and restrictions variously described as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns or lockdowns.

On 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later—around a third of the world&#x27;s population.

====Hubei====
In Hubei, the origin of the epidemic, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was imposed on Wuhan and other major cities in China, affecting around 500 million people, which is unprecedented in scale in human history, to limit the rate of spread of the disease. The &#x27;lockdown&#x27; of Wuhan, and subsequently a wider-scale &#x27;lockdown&#x27; throughout Hubei province, began on 23 January 2020. At this stage, the spread of the virus in mainland China was running at approximately 50% growth in cases per day. On 8 February, the daily rate of spread fell below 10%. 

====Italy====
As the outbreak spread there, beginning 22 February 2020, a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; was imposed on a group of at least 10 different municipalities in Northern Italy, effectively quarantining more than 50,000 people. This followed a second day when the declared detected cases leapt enormously (the period from 21 to 23 February saw daily increases of 567%, 295% and 90% respectively). A week later the rate of increase of cases in Italy was significantly reduced (the period from 29 February to 4 March saw daily increases of 27%, 50%, 20%, 23%, and 23%).

On 8 March 2020, a much wider region of Northern Italy was placed under quarantine restrictions, involving around 16 million people. On the next day, the quarantine was extended to the whole of Italy, effective on 10 March 2020, placing roughly 60 million people under quarantine.

A team of Chinese experts, together with some 31 tonnes of supplies, arrived in Rome on 13 March 2020 to help Italy fight the virus.

On 22 March 2020, Russia sent nine Ilyushin 76 planes with expert virologists, epidemiologists, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals in a humanitarian aid operation that Italian media dubbed &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;.

Eventually the lockdown was extended until 3 May, although starting from 14 April stationery shops, bookshops, and children clothing&#x27;s shops were allowed to open.

On 26 April 2020, the so-called &quot;Phase 2&quot; was announced, to start from 4 May. Movements across regions were still forbidden, while movements between municipalities were allowed only to visit relatives or for work and health reasons. Moreover, closed factories could re-open, but schools, bars, restaurants, and barbers were still closed.

As at 4 May 2020, when new cases were running around 0.5%, ( persons) per day and consistently falling, it was expected that museums and retailers might reopen from 18 May, while hairdressers, bars and restaurants were expected to reopen fully on 1 June.

Regional lockdowns were subsequently imposed as further waves of the virus spread through the country.

====Rest of Europe====

As cases of the virus spread to and took hold in more European countries, many followed the earlier examples of China and Italy and began instituting policies of lockdown. Notable among these were Ireland (where schools were closed in mid March for the rest of the month, and limits were set on sizes of meetings), Spain (where a lockdown was announced on 14 March), Czech Republic, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Poland, Turkey, and France, while the United Kingdom noticeably lagged behind in adopting such measures.

As of 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people were in lockdown across Europe.

====Rest of the world====
In the immediate context of the start of the pandemic in Wuhan, countries neighbouring or close to China adopted a cautious approach. For example, Sri Lanka, Macau, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Japan, and South Korea had all imposed some degree of lockdown by 19 February. As countries across the world reported escalating case numbers and deaths, more and more countries began to announce travel restrictions and lockdowns. Africa and Latin America were relatively delayed in the spread of the virus, but even on these continents, countries began to impose travel bans and lockdowns. Brazil and Mexico began lockdowns in late February and much of the rest of Latin America followed suit in early March. Much of Africa was on lockdown by the start of April. Kenya, for example, blocked certain international flights and subsequently placed a ban on &#x27;global&#x27; meetings.

, more than 280 million people, or about 86% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, 59 million people were in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in lockdown in India.

== Self-quarantine ==

Self-quarantine (or &quot;self-isolation&quot;) is a popular term that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which spread to most countries in 2020. Citizens able to do so were encouraged to stay home to limit the spread of the disease. Health specialists advise that self-quarantine lasts 14 days. Two weeks gives the necessary time for them to determine whether or not they will become ill and become contagious to others.

==Other uses==
U.S. President John F. Kennedy euphemistically referred to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s interdiction of shipping en route to Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis as a &quot;quarantine&quot; rather than a blockade, because a quarantine is a legal act in peacetime, whereas a blockade is defined as an act of aggression under the U.N. Charter.

In computer science, &quot;quarantining&quot; describes putting files infected by computer viruses into a special directory, so as to eliminate the threat they pose, without irreversibly deleting them.

The Spanish term for quarantine, &quot;(la) cuarentena&quot;, refers also to the period of postpartum confinement in which a new mother and her baby are sheltered from the outside world.

<text>A quasar ( ) is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is sometimes known as a quasi-stellar object, abbreviated QSO. The emission from an AGN is powered by accretion onto a supermassive black hole with a mass ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, surrounded by a gaseous accretion disc. Gas in the disc falling towards the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The radiant energy of quasars is enormous; the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than that of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Quasars are usually categorized as a subclass of the more general category of AGN. The redshifts of quasars are of cosmological origin.

The term originated as a contraction of &quot;quasi-stellar &quot;[star-like]&quot; radio source&quot;—because they were first identified during the 1950s as sources of radio-wave emission of unknown physical origin—and when identified in photographic images at visible wavelengths, they resembled faint, star-like points of light. High-resolution images of quasars, particularly from the Hubble Space Telescope, have shown that quasars occur in the centers of galaxies, and that some host galaxies are strongly interacting or merging galaxies. As with other categories of AGN, the observed properties of a quasar depend on many factors, including the mass of the black hole, the rate of gas accretion, the orientation of the accretion disc relative to the observer, the presence or absence of a jet, and the degree of obscuration by gas and dust within the host galaxy.

About a million quasars have been identified with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and between 2-3 million identified in photometric catalogs. The nearest known quasar is about 600 million light-years from Earth, while the record for the most distant known AGN is at a redshift of 10.1, corresponding to a comoving distance of 31.6 billion light-years, or a look-back time of 13.2 billion years.

Quasar discovery surveys have shown that quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10 billion years ago. Concentrations of multiple quasars are known as large quasar groups and may constitute some of the largest known structures in the universe if the observed groups are good tracers of mass distribution.

==Naming==
The term &quot;quasar&quot; was first used in an article by astrophysicist Hong-Yee Chiu in May 1964, in &quot;Physics Today&quot;, to describe certain astronomically puzzling objects:

==History of observation and interpretation ==


=== Background ===
Between 1917 and 1922, it became clear from work by Heber Doust Curtis, Ernst Öpik and others that some objects (&quot;nebulae&quot;) seen by astronomers were in fact distant galaxies like the Milky Way. But when radio astronomy began in the 1950s, astronomers detected, among the galaxies, a small number of anomalous objects with properties that defied explanation.

The objects emitted large amounts of radiation of many frequencies, but no source could be located optically, or in some cases only a faint and point-like object somewhat like a distant star. The spectral lines of these objects, which identify the chemical elements of which the object is composed, were also extremely strange and defied explanation. Some of them changed their luminosity very rapidly in the optical range and even more rapidly in the X-ray range, suggesting an upper limit on their size, perhaps no larger than the Solar System. This implies an extremely high power density. Considerable discussion took place over what these objects might be. They were described as &quot;quasi-stellar&quot; [meaning: star-like] &quot;radio sources&quot;, or &quot;quasi-stellar objects&quot; (QSOs), a name which reflected their unknown nature, and this became shortened to &quot;quasar&quot;.

=== Early observations (1960s and earlier) ===
The first quasars (3C 48 and 3C 273) were discovered in the late 1950s, as radio sources in all-sky radio surveys. They were first noted as radio sources with no corresponding visible object. Using small telescopes and the Lovell Telescope as an interferometer, they were shown to have a very small angular size. By 1960, hundreds of these objects had been recorded and published in the Third Cambridge Catalogue while astronomers scanned the skies for their optical counterparts. In 1963, a definite identification of the radio source 3C 48 with an optical object was published by Allan Sandage and Thomas A. Matthews. Astronomers had detected what appeared to be a faint blue star at the location of the radio source and obtained its spectrum, which contained many unknown broad emission lines. The anomalous spectrum defied interpretation.

British-Australian astronomer John Bolton made many early observations of quasars, including a breakthrough in 1962. Another radio source, 3C 273, was predicted to undergo five occultations by the Moon. Measurements taken by Cyril Hazard and John Bolton during one of the occultations using the Parkes Radio Telescope allowed Maarten Schmidt to find a visible counterpart to the radio source and obtain an optical spectrum using the Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar. This spectrum revealed the same strange emission lines. Schmidt was able to demonstrate that these were likely to be the ordinary spectral lines of hydrogen redshifted by 15.8%, at the time, a high redshift (with only a handful of much fainter galaxies known with higher redshift). If this was due to the physical motion of the &quot;star&quot;, then 3C 273 was receding at an enormous velocity, around , far beyond the speed of any known star and defying any obvious explanation. Nor would an extreme velocity help to explain 3C 273&#x27;s huge radio emissions. If the redshift was cosmological (now known to be correct), the large distance implied that 3C 273 was far more luminous than any galaxy, but much more compact. Also, 3C 273 was bright enough to detect on archival photographs dating back to the 1900s; it was found to be variable on yearly timescales, implying that a substantial fraction of the light was emitted from a region less than 1 light-year in size, tiny compared to a galaxy.

Although it raised many questions, Schmidt&#x27;s discovery quickly revolutionized quasar observation. The strange spectrum of 3C 48 was quickly identified by Schmidt, Greenstein and Oke as hydrogen and magnesium redshifted by 37%. Shortly afterwards, two more quasar spectra in 1964 and five more in 1965 were also confirmed as ordinary light that had been redshifted to an extreme degree. While the observations and redshifts themselves were not doubted, their correct interpretation was heavily debated, and Bolton&#x27;s suggestion that the radiation detected from quasars were ordinary spectral lines from distant highly redshifted sources with extreme velocity was not widely accepted at the time.

=== Development of physical understanding (1960s) ===
An extreme redshift could imply great distance and velocity but could also be due to extreme mass or perhaps some other unknown laws of nature. Extreme velocity and distance would also imply immense power output, which lacked explanation. The small sizes were confirmed by interferometry and by observing the speed with which the quasar as a whole varied in output, and by their inability to be seen in even the most powerful visible-light telescopes as anything more than faint starlike points of light. But if they were small and far away in space, their power output would have to be immense and difficult to explain. Equally, if they were very small and much closer to this galaxy, it would be easy to explain their apparent power output, but less easy to explain their redshifts and lack of detectable movement against the background of the universe.

Schmidt noted that redshift is also associated with the expansion of the universe, as codified in Hubble&#x27;s law. If the measured redshift was due to expansion, then this would support an interpretation of very distant objects with extraordinarily high luminosity and power output, far beyond any object seen to date. This extreme luminosity would also explain the large radio signal. Schmidt concluded that 3C 273 could either be an individual star around 10 km wide within (or near to) this galaxy, or a distant active galactic nucleus. He stated that a distant and extremely powerful object seemed more likely to be correct.

Schmidt&#x27;s explanation for the high redshift was not widely accepted at the time. A major concern was the enormous amount of energy these objects would have to be radiating, if they were distant. In the 1960s no commonly accepted mechanism could account for this. The currently accepted explanation, that it is due to matter in an accretion disc falling into a supermassive black hole, was only suggested in 1964 by Edwin E. Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich, and even then it was rejected by many astronomers, as at this time the existence of black holes at all was widely seen as theoretical.

Various explanations were proposed during the 1960s and 1970s, each with their own problems. It was suggested that quasars were nearby objects, and that their redshift was not due to the expansion of space but rather to light escaping a deep gravitational well. This would require a massive object, which would also explain the high luminosities. However, a star of sufficient mass to produce the measured redshift would be unstable and in excess of the Hayashi limit. Quasars also show forbidden spectral emission lines, previously only seen in hot gaseous nebulae of low density, which would be too diffuse to both generate the observed power and fit within a deep gravitational well. There were also serious concerns regarding the idea of cosmologically distant quasars. One strong argument against them was that they implied energies that were far in excess of known energy conversion processes, including nuclear fusion. There were suggestions that quasars were made of some hitherto unknown stable form of antimatter in similarly unknown types of region of space, and that this might account for their brightness. Others speculated that quasars were a white hole end of a wormhole, or a chain reaction of numerous supernovae.

Eventually, starting from about the 1970s, many lines of evidence (including the first X-ray space observatories, knowledge of black holes and modern models of cosmology) gradually demonstrated that the quasar redshifts are genuine and due to the expansion of space, that quasars are in fact as powerful and as distant as Schmidt and some other astronomers had suggested, and that their energy source is matter from an accretion disc falling onto a supermassive black hole. This included crucial evidence from optical and X-ray viewing of quasar host galaxies, finding of &quot;intervening&quot; absorption lines, which explained various spectral anomalies, observations from gravitational lensing, Gunn&#x27;s 1971 finding that galaxies containing quasars showed the same redshift as the quasars, and Kristian&#x27;s 1973 finding that the &quot;fuzzy&quot; surrounding of many quasars was consistent with a less luminous host galaxy.

This model also fits well with other observations suggesting that many or even most galaxies have a massive central black hole. It would also explain why quasars are more common in the early universe: as a quasar draws matter from its accretion disc, there comes a point when there is less matter nearby, and energy production falls off or ceases, as the quasar becomes a more ordinary type of galaxy.

The accretion-disc energy-production mechanism was finally modeled in the 1970s, and black holes were also directly detected (including evidence showing that supermassive black holes could be found at the centers of this and many other galaxies), which resolved the concern that quasars were too luminous to be a result of very distant objects or that a suitable mechanism could not be confirmed to exist in nature. By 1987 it was &quot;well accepted&quot; that this was the correct explanation for quasars, and the cosmological distance and energy output of quasars was accepted by almost all researchers.

===Modern observations (1970s and onward)===
Later it was found that not all quasars have strong radio emission; in fact only about 10% are &quot;radio-loud&quot;. Hence the name &quot;QSO&quot; (quasi-stellar object) is used (in addition to &quot;quasar&quot;) to refer to these objects, further categorized into the &quot;radio-loud&quot; and the &quot;radio-quiet&quot; classes. The discovery of the quasar had large implications for the field of astronomy in the 1960s, including drawing physics and astronomy closer together.

In 1979, the gravitational lens effect predicted by Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity was confirmed observationally for the first time with images of the double quasar 0957+561.

A study published in February 2021 showed that there are more quasars in one direction (towards Hydra) than in the opposite direction, seemingly indicating that the Earth is moving in that direction. But the direction of this dipole is about 28° away from the direction of the Earth&#x27;s motion relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation.

In March 2021, a collaboration of scientists, related to the Event Horizon Telescope, presented, for the first time, a polarized-based image of a black hole, specifically the black hole at the center of Messier 87, an elliptical galaxy approximately 55 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo, revealing the forces giving rise to quasars.

== Current understanding==
It is now known that quasars are distant but extremely luminous objects, so any light that reaches the Earth is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe.

Quasars inhabit the centers of active galaxies and are among the most luminous, powerful, and energetic objects known in the universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way, which contains 200–400 billion stars. This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of gamma-rays. With high-resolution imaging from ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope, the &quot;host galaxies&quot; surrounding the quasars have been detected in some cases. These galaxies are normally too dim to be seen against the glare of the quasar, except with special techniques. Most quasars, with the exception of 3C 273, whose average apparent magnitude is 12.9, cannot be seen with small telescopes.

Quasars are believed—and in many cases confirmed—to be powered by accretion of material into supermassive black holes in the nuclei of distant galaxies, as suggested in 1964 by Edwin Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich. Light and other radiation cannot escape from within the event horizon of a black hole. The energy produced by a quasar is generated the black hole, by gravitational stresses and immense friction within the material nearest to the black hole, as it orbits and falls inward. The huge luminosity of quasars results from the accretion discs of central supermassive black holes, which can convert between 5.7% and 32% of the mass of an object into energy, compared to just 0.7% for the p–p chain nuclear fusion process that dominates the energy production in Sun-like stars. Central masses of 105 to 109 solar masses have been measured in quasars by using reverberation mapping. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy, that do not have an active center and do not show any activity similar to a quasar, are confirmed to contain a similar supermassive black hole in their nuclei (galactic center). Thus it is now thought that all large galaxies have a black hole of this kind, but only a small fraction have sufficient matter in the right kind of orbit at their center to become active and power radiation in such a way as to be seen as quasars.

This also explains why quasars were more common in the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black-hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.

The matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole, which will cause the matter to collect into an accretion disc. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter. In fact, it has been suggested that a quasar could form when the Andromeda Galaxy collides with the Milky Way galaxy in approximately 3–5 billion years.

In the 1980s, unified models were developed in which quasars were classified as a particular kind of active galaxy, and a consensus emerged that in many cases it is simply the viewing angle that distinguishes them from other active galaxies, such as blazars and radio galaxies.

The highest-redshift quasar known () is UHZ1, with a redshift of approximately 10.1, which corresponds to a comoving distance of approximately 31.7 billion light-years from Earth (these distances are much larger than the distance light could travel in the universe&#x27;s 13.8-billion-year history because the universe is expanding).

It is now understood that many quasars are triggered by the collisions of galaxies, which drives the mass of the galaxies into the supermassive black holes at their centers.

== Properties ==
More than quasars have been found (as of July 2023), most from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All observed quasar spectra have redshifts between 0.056 and 10.1 (as of 2024), which means they range between 600 million and 30 billion light-years away from Earth. Because of the great distances to the farthest quasars and the finite velocity of light, they and their surrounding space appear as they existed in the very early universe.

The power of quasars originates from supermassive black holes that are believed to exist at the core of most galaxies. The Doppler shifts of stars near the cores of galaxies indicate that they are revolving around tremendous masses with very steep gravity gradients, suggesting black holes.

Although quasars appear faint when viewed from Earth, they are visible from extreme distances, being the most luminous objects in the known universe. The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C 273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From a distance of about 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as the Sun. This quasar&#x27;s luminosity is, therefore, about 4 trillion (4) times that of the Sun, or about 100 times that of the total light of giant galaxies like the Milky Way. This assumes that the quasar is radiating energy in all directions, but the active galactic nucleus is believed to be radiating preferentially in the direction of its jet. In a universe containing hundreds of billions of galaxies, most of which had active nuclei billions of years ago but only seen today, it is statistically certain that thousands of energy jets should be pointed toward the Earth, some more directly than others. In many cases it is likely that the brighter the quasar, the more directly its jet is aimed at the Earth. Such quasars are called blazars.

The hyperluminous quasar APM 08279+5255 was, when discovered in 1998, given an absolute magnitude of −32.2. High-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope and the 10 m Keck Telescope revealed that this system is gravitationally lensed. A study of the gravitational lensing of this system suggests that the light emitted has been magnified by a factor of ~10. It is still substantially more luminous than nearby quasars such as 3C 273.

Quasars were much more common in the early universe than they are today. This discovery by Maarten Schmidt in 1967 was early strong evidence against steady-state cosmology and in favor of the Big Bang cosmology. Quasars show the locations where supermassive black holes are growing rapidly (by accretion). Detailed simulations reported in 2021 showed that galaxy structures, such as spiral arms, use gravitational forces to &#x27;put the brakes on&#x27; gas that would otherwise orbit galaxy centers forever; instead the braking mechanism enabled the gas to fall into the supermassive black holes, releasing enormous radiant energies. These black holes co-evolve with the mass of stars in their host galaxy in a way not fully understood at present. One idea is that jets, radiation and winds created by the quasars shut down the formation of new stars in the host galaxy, a process called &quot;feedback&quot;. The jets that produce strong radio emission in some quasars at the centers of clusters of galaxies are known to have enough power to prevent the hot gas in those clusters from cooling and falling on to the central galaxy.

Quasars&#x27; luminosities are variable, with time scales that range from months to hours. This means that quasars generate and emit their energy from a very small region, since each part of the quasar would have to be in contact with other parts on such a time scale as to allow the coordination of the luminosity variations. This would mean that a quasar varying on a time scale of a few weeks cannot be larger than a few light-weeks across. The emission of large amounts of power from a small region requires a power source far more efficient than the nuclear fusion that powers stars. The conversion of gravitational potential energy to radiation by infalling to a black hole converts between 6% and 32% of the mass to energy, compared to 0.7% for the conversion of mass to energy in a star like the Sun. It is the only process known that can produce such high power over a very long term. (Stellar explosions such as supernovas and gamma-ray bursts, and direct matter–antimatter annihilation, can also produce very high power output, but supernovae only last for days, and the universe does not appear to have had large amounts of antimatter at the relevant times.)

Since quasars exhibit all the properties common to other active galaxies such as Seyfert galaxies, the emission from quasars can be readily compared to those of smaller active galaxies powered by smaller supermassive black holes. To create a luminosity of 1040 watts (the typical brightness of a quasar), a supermassive black hole would have to consume the material equivalent of 10 solar masses per year. The brightest known quasars devour 1000 solar masses of material every year (equivalent to 10 Earths per second). Quasar luminosities can vary considerably over time, depending on their surroundings. Since it is difficult to fuel quasars for many billions of years, after a quasar finishes accreting the surrounding gas and dust, it becomes an ordinary galaxy.

Radiation from quasars is partially &quot;nonthermal&quot; (i.e., not due to black-body radiation), and approximately 10% are observed to also have jets and lobes like those of radio galaxies that also carry significant (but poorly understood) amounts of energy in the form of particles moving at relativistic speeds. Extremely high energies might be explained by several mechanisms (see Fermi acceleration and Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration). Quasars can be detected over the entire observable electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray and even gamma rays. Most quasars are brightest in their rest-frame ultraviolet wavelength of 121.6 nm Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, but due to the tremendous redshifts of these sources, that peak luminosity has been observed as far to the red as 900.0 nm, in the near infrared. A minority of quasars show strong radio emission, which is generated by jets of matter moving close to the speed of light. When viewed downward, these appear as blazars and often have regions that seem to move away from the center faster than the speed of light (superluminal expansion). This is an optical illusion due to the properties of special relativity.

Quasar redshifts are measured from the strong spectral lines that dominate their visible and ultraviolet emission spectra. These lines are brighter than the continuous spectrum. They exhibit Doppler broadening corresponding to mean speed of several percent of the speed of light. Fast motions strongly indicate a large mass. Emission lines of hydrogen (mainly of the Lyman series and Balmer series), helium, carbon, magnesium, iron and oxygen are the brightest lines. The atoms emitting these lines range from neutral to highly ionized, leaving it highly charged. This wide range of ionization shows that the gas is highly irradiated by the quasar, not merely hot, and not by stars, which cannot produce such a wide range of ionization.

Like all (unobscured) active galaxies, quasars can be strong X-ray sources. Radio-loud quasars can also produce X-rays and gamma rays by inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by the radio-emitting electrons in the jet.

&quot;Iron quasars&quot; show strong emission lines resulting from low-ionization iron (Fe ), such as IRAS 18508-7815.

=== Spectral lines, reionization, and the early universe===


Quasars also provide some clues as to the end of the Big Bang&#x27;s reionization. The oldest known quasars (&quot;z&quot; = 6) display a Gunn–Peterson trough and have absorption regions in front of them indicating that the intergalactic medium at that time was neutral gas. More recent quasars show no absorption region, but rather their spectra contain a spiky area known as the Lyman-alpha forest; this indicates that the intergalactic medium has undergone reionization into plasma, and that neutral gas exists only in small clouds.

The intense production of ionizing ultraviolet radiation is also significant, as it would provide a mechanism for reionization to occur as galaxies form. Despite this, current theories suggest that quasars were not the primary source of reionization; the primary causes of reionization were probably the earliest generations of stars, known as Population III stars (possibly 70%), and dwarf galaxies (very early small high-energy galaxies) (possibly 30%).

Quasars show evidence of elements heavier than helium, indicating that galaxies underwent a massive phase of star formation, creating population III stars between the time of the Big Bang and the first observed quasars. Light from these stars may have been observed in 2005 using NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope, although this observation remains to be confirmed.

== Quasar subtypes ==
The taxonomy of quasars includes various subtypes representing subsets of the quasar population having distinct properties.

* Radio-loud quasars are quasars with powerful jets that are strong sources of radio-wavelength emission. These make up about 10% of the overall quasar population.
* Radio-quiet quasars are those quasars lacking powerful jets, with relatively weaker radio emission than the radio-loud population. The majority of quasars (about 90%) are radio-quiet.
* Broad absorption-line (BAL) quasars are quasars whose spectra exhibit broad absorption lines that are blue-shifted relative to the quasar&#x27;s rest frame, resulting from gas flowing outward from the active nucleus in the direction toward the observer. Broad absorption lines are found in about 10% of quasars, and BAL quasars are usually radio-quiet. In the rest-frame ultraviolet spectra of BAL quasars, broad absorption lines can be detected from ionized carbon, magnesium, silicon, nitrogen, and other elements.
* Type 2 (or Type II) quasars are quasars in which the accretion disc and broad emission lines are highly obscured by dense gas and dust. They are higher-luminosity counterparts of Type 2 Seyfert galaxies. 
* Red quasars are quasars with optical colors that are redder than normal quasars, thought to be the result of moderate levels of dust extinction within the quasar host galaxy. Infrared surveys have demonstrated that red quasars make up a substantial fraction of the total quasar population.
* Optically violent variable (OVV) quasars are radio-loud quasars in which the jet is directed toward the observer. Relativistic beaming of the jet emission results in strong and rapid variability of the quasar brightness. OVV quasars are also considered to be a type of blazar.
* Weak emission line quasars are quasars having unusually faint emission lines in the ultraviolet/visible spectrum.

==Role in celestial reference systems==
Because quasars are extremely distant, bright, and small in apparent size, they are useful reference points in establishing a measurement grid on the sky.
The International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) is based on hundreds of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 arcsecond or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise than the best optical measurements.

==Multiple quasars==
A grouping of two or more quasars on the sky can result from a chance alignment, where the quasars are not physically associated, from actual physical proximity, or from the effects of gravity bending the light of a single quasar into two or more images by gravitational lensing.

When two quasars appear to be very close to each other as seen from Earth (separated by a few arcseconds or less), they are commonly referred to as a &quot;double quasar&quot;. When the two are also close together in space (i.e. observed to have similar redshifts), they are termed a &quot;quasar pair&quot;, or as a &quot;binary quasar&quot; if they are close enough that their host galaxies are likely to be physically interacting.

As quasars are overall rare objects in the universe, the probability of three or more separate quasars being found near the same physical location is very low, and determining whether the system is closely separated physically requires significant observational effort. The first true triple quasar was found in 2007 by observations at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. LBQS 1429-008 (or QQQ J1432-0106) was first observed in 1989 and at the time was found to be a double quasar. When astronomers discovered the third member, they confirmed that the sources were separate and not the result of gravitational lensing. This triple quasar has a redshift of &quot;z&quot; = 2.076. The components are separated by an estimated 30–50 kiloparsecs (roughly 97,000–160,000 light-years), which is typical for interacting galaxies. In 2013, the second true triplet of quasars, QQQ J1519+0627, was found with a redshift &quot;z&quot; = 1.51, the whole system fitting within a physical separation of 25 kpc (about 80,000 light-years).

The first true quadruple quasar system was discovered in 2015 at a redshift &quot;z&quot; = 2.0412 and has an overall physical scale of about 200 kpc (roughly 650,000 light-years).

A multiple-image quasar is a quasar whose light undergoes gravitational lensing, resulting in double, triple or quadruple images of the same quasar. The first such gravitational lens to be discovered was the double-imaged quasar Q0957+561 (or Twin Quasar) in 1979.
An example of a triply lensed quasar is PG1115+08.
Several quadruple-image quasars are known, including the Einstein Cross and the Cloverleaf Quasar, with the first such discoveries happening in the mid-1980s.

<text>Quinquagesima (), in the Western Christian Churches, is the last pre-Lenten Sunday, being the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, and the first day of Carnival (also known as Shrovetide). It is also called Quinquagesima Sunday, Quinquagesimae, Estomihi, Shrove Sunday, Pork Sunday, or the Sunday next before Lent.

Being the Lord&#x27;s Day before the start of the Lenten season, it is known for meat consumption as people feast before starting their fast on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent. Historically Lutheran countries such as Denmark mark Quinquagesima Sunday as the peak of the Fastelavn. After attending the Divine Service on Shrove Sunday, congregants enjoy Shrovetide buns (fastelavnsboller). Children often dress up and collect money from people while singing. Christians in these nations carry Shrovetide rods (fastelavnsris), which &quot;branches decorated with sweets, little presents, etc., that are used to decorate the home or give to children.&quot;

In the Revised Common Lectionary the Sunday before Lent is designated &quot;Transfiguration Sunday&quot;, and the gospel reading is the story of the Transfiguration of Jesus from Matthew, Mark, or Luke. Some churches whose lectionaries derive from the Revised Common Lectionary, e.g. the Church of England, use these readings but do not designate the Sunday &quot;Transfiguration Sunday&quot;.

== Etymology and date ==
The name Quinquagesima originates from Latin &quot;quinquagesimus&quot; (fiftieth). This is in reference to the fifty days before Easter Day using inclusive counting which counts both Sundays (normal counting would count only one of these). Since the forty days of Lent do not include Sundays, the first day of Lent, Ash Wednesday, succeeds Quinquagesima Sunday by only three days.

The name Estomihi is derived from the incipit or opening words of the Introit for the Sunday, &quot;Esto mihi in Deum protectorem, et in locum refugii, ut salvum me facias&quot;, (&quot;Be Thou unto me a God, a Protector, and a place of refuge, to save me&quot;) Psalms 31:3

The earliest Quinquagesima Sunday can occur is February 1 and the latest is March 7.

== Significance ==
=== Western Christianity ===
==== Roman Catholic Church ====
In the Roman Catholic Church, the terms for this Sunday and the two immediately before it (Sexagesima and Septuagesima Sundays) were eliminated in the reforms following the Second Vatican Council, and these Sundays are part of Ordinary Time.

According to the reformed Roman Rite Roman Catholic calendar, this Sunday is now known by its number within Ordinary Time — fourth through ninth, depending upon the date of Easter. The earlier form of the Roman Rite, with its references to Quinquagesima Sunday, and to the Sexagesima and Septuagesima Sundays, continues to be observed in some communities.

In traditional lectionaries, the Sunday concentrates on , &quot;Jesus took the twelve aside and said, &#x27;Lo, we go to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man shall be fulfilled&#x27; ... The disciples, however, understood none of this,&quot; which from verse 35 is followed by Luke&#x27;s version of Healing the blind near Jericho. The passage presages the themes of Lent and Holy Week.

In most churches, palms blessed on Palm Sunday of the previous year are burned on this day after the last Mass of the day, the ashes of these burned palms are used for the liturgy of Ash Wednesday.

==== Lutheran Churches ====

In Lutheranism is combined with (Paul&#x27;s praise of love).

Composers writing cantatas for Estomihi Sunday include:
* Johann Sebastian Bach: BWV 22, 23, 127 and 159 (see Church cantata (Bach)#Estomihi)
* Christoph Graupner: 25 cantatas (see List of cantatas by Christoph Graupner#GWV 1119)
* Georg Philipp Telemann: 21 extant cantatas, including TWV (&quot;Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst&quot;).

Lutheran countries such as Denmark mark Quinquagesima Sunday as the peak of the Fastelavn. After attending the Mass on Shrove Sunday, congregants enjoy Shrovetide buns (fastelavnsboller), &quot;round sweet buns that are covered with icing and filled with cream and/or jam.&quot; Children often dress up and collect money from people while singing. They also practice the tradition of hitting a barrel, which represents fighting Satan; after doing this, children enjoy the sweets inside the barrel. Lutheran Christians in these nations carry Shrovetide rods (fastelavnsris), which &quot;branches decorated with sweets, little presents, etc., that are used to decorate the home or give to children.&quot;

====Anglican Communion====
This Sunday has different names in the two different calendars used in the Church of England: in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; calendar (1662) this Sunday is known as &quot;Quinquagesima&quot;, while in the &quot;Common Worship&quot; calendar (2000) it is known as the &quot;Next Sunday before Lent&quot;. In this latter calendar it is part of the period of Ordinary Time that falls between the feasts of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple (the end of the Epiphany season) and Ash Wednesday.

====Methodism====
In the United Methodist Church and the Global Methodist Church this Sunday is known as &quot;Transfiguration Sunday&quot; and is the last of the &quot;Sundays after Epiphany&quot;. The liturgical color used will typically be white, and some churches may observe the practice of burning the previous year&#x27;s palms to create the ashes for &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;.

=== Eastern Christianity and Oriental Christianity ===
==== Eastern Orthodox Church ====
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, its equivalent, the Sunday before Great Lent, is called &quot;Forgiveness Sunday&quot;, &quot;Maslenitsa Sunday&quot;, or &quot;Cheesefare Sunday&quot;. The latter name comes because this Sunday concludes Maslenitsa, the week in which butter and cheese may be eaten, which are prohibited during Great Lent. The former name derives from the fact that this Sunday is followed by a special Vespers called &quot;Forgiveness Vespers&quot; which opens Great Lent.

On this day, the Eastern Orthodox Church Christians at the liturgy listen to the Gospel speaking of forgiveness of sins, fasting, and the gathering of treasures in heaven. On this day, all Orthodox Christians ask each other for forgiveness to begin the Great Lent with a good heart, to focus on the spiritual life, to purify the heart from sin in confession, and to meet Easter - the day of the Resurrection of Jesus with a pure heart.
This is the last day before Lent when non-lenten food is eaten.

Its size is disputed; some botanists treat it as consisting of only one species, &quot;Quassia amara&quot; from tropical South America, while others treat it in a wide circumscription as a pantropical genus containing up to 40 species of trees and shrubs.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was first published in Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s book &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; ed. 2. on page 553 in 1762.

The genus was named after a former slave from Suriname, Graman Quassi in the eighteenth century. He discovered the medicinal properties of the bark of &quot;Quassia amara&quot;.

In 1962, Dutch botanist Hans Peter Nooteboom (1934–2022) had taken a very broad view of the genus &quot;Quassia&quot; and included therein various genera including, &quot;Hannoa&quot; , &quot;Odyendyea&quot; , &quot;Pierreodendron&quot; , &quot;Samadera&quot; , &quot;Simaba&quot; and &quot;Simarouba&quot; . Then in 2007, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses was carried out on members of the Simaroubaceae family. It found that genus &quot;Samadera&quot; was a sister to Clade V and that genus &quot;Quassia&quot; was also a sister to Clade V but they had separate lineages. This suggested the splitting up of genera &quot;Quassia&quot; again, with all Nooteboom&#x27;s synonyms listed above being resurrected as independent genera. This includes &quot;Samadera indica&quot; as the accepted name for &quot;Quassia indica&quot;. The ornamental &quot;Quassia amara&quot; , which is occasionally planted in Singapore, remains in genus &quot;Quassia&quot;.

==Distribution==
Members of the genus are found in the Tropics throughout the world. Countries and regions where species are native include: Andaman Islands, Angola, Bangladesh, Belize, Benin, Bismarck Archipelago, Borneo, northern and northeastern Brazil, Burkina, Cabinda, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gulf of Guinea Islands, Honduras, India, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Laos, Leeward Islands, Liberia, Madagascar, Malaya, Mali, Central, Southeast and Southwest Mexico, Myanmar, New Guinea, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Northern Territory, Panamá, Philippines, Queensland, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Tanzania, Togo, Trinidad-Tobago, Uganda, Venezuela, Vietnam, Windward Islands, Zambia, and Zaïre.

The plant is naturalised in the following places: Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Jawa, and Puerto Rico.

==Species==
The only accepted species of the genus, by Plants of the World Online as of November 2023 is: &quot;Quassia amara&quot; 

Although World Flora Online accepts 16 species;

*&quot;Quassia africana&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia amara&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia arnhemensis&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia baileyana&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia bidwillii&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia borneensis&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia cedron&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia crustacea&quot; 

*&quot;Quassia harmandiana&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia indica&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia maiana&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia pohliana&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia sanguinea&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia schweinfurthii&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia undulata&quot; 
*&quot;Quassia versicolor&quot; 
There are also taxa that have not been assigned a formal status:

*&quot;Quassia&quot; sp. &#x27;Moonee Creek&#x27;, unplaced – Australia 
*&quot;Quassia&quot; sp. &#x27;Mount Nardi&#x27;, unplaced – Australia
The genus has been verified by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service (Germplasm Resources Information Network) and they only list 6 species; &quot;Quassia amara&quot;, &quot;Quassia cedron&quot; (syn. &quot;Simaba cedron&quot;, &quot;Quassia excelsa&quot; (syn. &quot;Picrasma excelsa&quot;), &quot;Quassia indica&quot; (syn. &quot;Samadera indica&quot; ), &quot;Quassia simarouba&quot; (syn. &quot;Simarouba amara&quot; ) and &quot;Quassia undulata&quot;.

==Uses==
It is the source of the quassinoids such as quassin and neo-quassin.
&quot;Simalikalactone D&quot; is a quassinoid that is extracted from &quot;Quassia africana&quot; for antiviral properties.

<text>Quisling (, ) is a term used in Scandinavian languages and in English to mean a citizen or politician of an occupied country who collaborates with an enemy occupying force – or more generally as a synonym for &quot;traitor&quot; or collaborator. The word originates from the surname of the Norwegian war-time leader Vidkun Quisling (1887–1945), who headed a domestic Nazi collaborationist regime during World War II.

==Origin==
Use of Vidkun Quisling&#x27;s surname as a term predates World War II. The first recorded use of the term was by Norwegian Labour Party politician Oscar Torp in a 2 January 1933 newspaper interview, where he used it as a general term for Quisling&#x27;s followers. Quisling was at this point in the process of establishing the Nasjonal Samling (National Unity) party, a fascist party modelled on the German Nazi Party. Further uses of the term were made by Aksel Sandemose, in a newspaper article in in 1934, and by the newspaper &quot;Vestfold Arbeiderblad&quot;, in 1936. The term with the opposite meaning, a Norwegian patriot, is .

==Popularization in World War II==
The use of the name as a term for collaborators or traitors in general probably came about upon Quisling&#x27;s unsuccessful 1940 coup d&#x27;état, when he attempted to seize power and make Norway cease resisting the invading Germans. The term was widely introduced to an English-speaking audience by the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot;. It published an editorial on 19 April 1940 titled &quot;Quislings everywhere&quot;, in which it was asserted that &quot;To writers, the word Quisling is a gift from the gods. If they had been ordered to invent a new word for traitor... they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters. Aurally it contrives to suggest something at once slippery and tortuous.&quot; The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; picked up the term four days after &quot;The Times&quot; editorial was published. &quot;The War Illustrated&quot; discussed &quot;potential Quislings&quot; among the Dutch during the German invasion of the Netherlands. Subsequently, the BBC brought the word into common use internationally.

Chips Channon described how during the Norway Debate of 7–8 May 1940, he and other Conservative MPs who supported Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Neville Chamberlain called those who voted against a motion of no confidence &quot;Quislings&quot;. Chamberlain&#x27;s successor Winston Churchill used the term while addressing a conference of Allied delegates at St. James&#x27;s Palace on 12 June 1941, when he said: &quot;A vile race of Quislings—to use a new word which will carry the scorn of mankind down the centuries—is hired to fawn upon the conqueror, to collaborate in his designs and to enforce his rule upon their fellow countrymen while groveling low themselves.&quot; He used the term again in an address to both houses of Congress in the United States of America on 26 December 1941. Commenting upon the effect of a number of Allied victories against Axis forces, and moreover the United States&#x27; decision to enter the war, Churchill opined: &quot;Hope has returned to the hearts of scores of millions of men and women, and with that hope there burns the flame of anger against the brutal, corrupt invader. And still more fiercely burn the fires of hatred and contempt for the filthy Quislings whom he has suborned.&quot; The term subsequently entered the language and became a target for political cartoonists.

In his work &quot;The Yugoslav peoples fight to live&quot;, Josip Broz Tito made several descriptions of his enemies as Quislings, including General Milan Nedić (&quot;the Serbian Quisling&quot;) and Dr. Ante Pavelić (&quot;the criminal Croatian Quisling ... a creature of Mussolini and Hitler&quot;).

In the United States, it was used often. In the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Tom Turk and Daffy&quot; (1944), it was uttered by a Thanksgiving turkey whose presence is betrayed to Porky Pig by Daffy Duck. In the American film &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943), about the Resistance in Norway, the heroine&#x27;s brother is often described as a quisling.

===Verb form===
The back-formed verb, &quot;to quisle&quot; () exists, and gave rise to a much less common version of the noun: &quot;quisler&quot;. However, the verb form was rare even during World War II and has entirely disappeared from contemporary usage.

==Postwar use==
&quot;Quisling&quot; was applied to some who cooperated with communist takeovers. As an illustration, the renegade social democrat Zdeněk Fierlinger of Czechoslovakia was frequently derided as &quot;Quislinger&quot; for his collaboration with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

A 1966 &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip shows Lucy dragging Linus out of Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse yelling &quot;Traitor! &quot;Quisling!&quot; Squealer!&quot; at Snoopy for betraying him hiding there.

In a Doctor Who story, Day of the Daleks (1972), the Doctor calls a man who collaborates with the Daleks a Quisling.

&quot;The Patriot Game&quot;, one of the best known songs to emerge from the Irish nationalist struggle, includes the line &quot;...those quislings who sold out the Patriot Game&quot; in some versions (although the original uses &quot;cowards&quot; and other versions substitute &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;traitors&quot;).

In the Norwegian television series &quot;Occupied&quot;, Norwegians who are seen as collaborating with the Russian invaders and later with European Union peacekeepers are called Quislings.

Max Brooks&#x27; 2006 novel &quot;World War Z&quot; features survivors who lose their minds due to the apocalypse and pretend to be zombies themselves, even going so far as to biting and eating other survivors. These zombie-like survivors are called Quislings.

In the epilogue of &quot;Farnham&#x27;s Freehold&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein, a sign is posted listing available goods and services. One of the items listed is &quot;Jerked Quisling (by the neck)&quot;.

==21st century==
In the early 21st century, the term demonstrated continued currency as it was used by some American writers to describe President Donald Trump and his associates based on the idea that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. For example, in a June 2018 &quot;New York Times&quot; column, Paul Krugman called US President Trump a &quot;quisling&quot;, in reference to what Krugman described as Trump&#x27;s &quot;serv[ing] the interests of foreign masters at his own country&#x27;s expense&quot; and &quot;defend[ing] Russia while attacking our closest allies&quot;. Other publications also applied the term. For instance, Joe Scarborough in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (&quot;These are desperate times for the quislings of Trump&quot;), Rich Lowry in &quot;Politico&quot; (&quot;The GOP elite... is the quisling establishment&quot;), former United States Mint director Philip N. Diehl in &quot;The Hill&quot; (&quot;The historical reference that more aptly applies to pro-Trump Republicans is that of the Quislings&quot;), David Driesen in &quot;History News Network&quot; (&quot;Trump seeks a government of quislings&quot;), Dick Polman on NPR station WHYY-FM (&quot;Ever since last summer, most Republicans have marinated in their cowardice... The next step toward home-grown tyranny – the quisling phase – has already begun&quot;), and so forth.

On 7 July 2020, Lord Chris Patten, former governor of Hong Kong, described Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong as a &quot;lamentable Quisling figure in Hong Kong&#x27;s history&quot;. On 10 February 2022, Patten expanded his use of the term &quot;Quislings&quot; to describe Lam, the Hong Kong Police Force, and the Judiciary of Hong Kong, during a debate on Nationality and Borders Bill.

<doc id="25247" wikidata="Q4063215" url="?curid=25247" title="Quill">
<text>A quill is a writing tool made from a moulted flight feather (preferably a primary wing-feather) of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen/metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.

As with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.

==Description==
The shaft of a flight feather is long and hollow, making it an obvious candidate for being crafted into a pen. The process of making a quill from a feather involves curing the shaft to harden it, then fashioning its tip into a nib using a pen knife or other small cutting tool.

A quill pen is in effect a hollow tube which has one closed end, and has one open end at which part of the tube wall extends into a sharp point and has in it a thin slit leading to this point.

The hollow shaft of the feather (the &quot;calamus&quot;) acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip through the slit by capillary action.

In a carefully prepared quill, the slit does not widen through wetting with ink and drying. It will retain its shape adequately, requiring only infrequent sharpening; it can be used repeatedly until there is little left of it.

==Sources==

The strongest quills come from the primary flight feathers discarded by birds during their annual moult. Although some have claimed that feathers from the left wing are better suited to right-handed writers because the feather curves away from the sight line, over the back of the hand, the quill barrel is cut to six or seven inches in length so no such consideration of curvature or &#x27;sight-line&#x27; is necessary. Additionally, writing with the left hand in the era in which the quill was popular was discouraged, and quills were never sold as left- and right-handed, only by their size and species.

Goose feathers are most commonly used; scarcer, more expensive swan feathers are used for larger lettering. Depending on availability and strength of the feather, as well as quality and characteristic of the line wanted by the writer, other feathers used for quill-pen making include those from the crow, eagle, owl, turkey, and hawk too. Crow feathers were particularly useful as quills when fine work, such as accounting books, was required. Each bird could supply only about 10 to 12 good-quality quills.

On a true quill, the barbs are stripped off completely on the trailing edge. (The pinion for example only has significant barbs on one side of the barrel.) Later, a fashion developed for stripping partially and leaving a decorative top of a few barbs. The fancy, fully-plumed quill is mostly a Hollywood invention and has little basis in reality. Most, if not all, manuscript illustrations of scribes show a quill devoid of decorative barbs, or at least mostly stripped.
==Uses==
Quill pens were used to write the vast majority of medieval manuscripts. Quill pens were also used to write &quot;Magna Carta&quot; and the Declaration of Independence. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson bred geese specially at Monticello to supply his tremendous need for quills.
Quill pens are still used today mainly by professional scribes and calligraphers.

Quills are also used as the plectrum material in string instruments, particularly the harpsichord.

From the 17th to 19th centuries, the central tube of the quill was used as a priming tube (filled with gunpowder) for cannon fire.

==History==

The quill pen evolved from the reed pen, of Egyptian origin. Quills were the primary writing instrument in the Barbarian Kingdoms from the 6th to the 19th century. The best quills were usually made from goose, swan, and later turkey feathers. Quills went into decline after the invention of the metal pen, mass production beginning in Great Britain as early as 1822 by John Mitchell of Birmingham. In the Eastern Mediterranean and much of the Islamic world, quills were not used as writing implements. Only reed pens were used as writing implements.

Quill pens were the instrument of choice during the medieval era due to their compatibility with parchment and vellum. Before this, the reed pen had been used, but a finer letter was achieved on animal skin using a cured quill. Other than written text, they were often used to create figures, decorations, and images on manuscripts, although many illuminators and painters preferred fine brushes for their work. The variety of different strokes in formal hands was accomplished by good penmanship as the tip was square cut and rigid, exactly as it is today with modern steel pens.

It was much later, in the 1600s, with the increased popularity of writing, especially in the copperplate script promoted by the many printed manuals available from the &#x27;Writing Masters&#x27;, that quills became more pointed and flexible.

Quills are denominated from the order in which they are fixed in the wing; the first is favoured by the expert calligrapher, the second and third quills also being satisfactory, together with the pinion feather. The 5th and 6th feathers are also used. No other feather on the wing would be considered suitable by a professional scribe.

Information can be obtained on the techniques of curing and cutting quills:

An accurate account of the Victorian process by William Bishop, from research with one of the last London quill dressers, is recorded in the &quot;Calligrapher&#x27;s Handbook&quot; cited on this page.

==As a symbol==

From the 19th century in radical and socialist symbolism, quills have been used to symbolize clerks and intelligentsia. Some notable examples are the Radical Civic Union, the Czech National Social Party in combination with the hammer, symbol of the labour movement, or the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro.

Quills appear on the seals of the United States Census Bureau and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. They also appear in the coats of arms of several US Army Adjutant general units which focus on administrative duties.

Quills are on the coats of arms of a number of municipalities such as Bargfeld-Stegen in Germany and La Canonja in Spain.

Three books and a quill pen are the symbols of Saint Hilary of Poitiers.

==Quill and pen knives==
A quill knife was the original primary tool used for cutting and sharpening quills, a process known as &quot;dressing&quot;.

Following the decline of the quill in the 1820s, after the introduction of the maintenance-free, mass-produced steel dip nib by John Mitchell, knives were still manufactured but became known as desk knives, stationery knives or latterly as the name stuck &quot;pen&quot; knives.

There is a small but significant difference between a pen knife and a quill knife, in that the quill knife has a blade that is flat on one side and convex on the other which facilitates the round cuts required to shape a quill.

A &quot;pen&quot; knife by contrast has two flat sides. This distinction is not recognised by modern traders, dealers or collectors, who define a quill knife as any small knife with a fixed or hinged blade, including such items as ornamental fruit knives.

==Today==
While quills are rarely used as writing instruments in the modern day, they are still being produced as specialty items, mostly for hobbyists. Such quills tend to have metal nibs or are sometimes even outfitted with a ballpoint pen inside to remove the need for a separate source of ink.

According to the Supreme Court Historical Society, 20 goose-quill pens, neatly crossed, are placed at the four counsel tables each day the U.S. Supreme Court is in session; &quot;most lawyers appear before the Court only once, and gladly take the quills home as souvenirs.&quot; This has been done since the earliest sessions of the Court.

In the Jewish tradition quill pens, called &quot;kulmus&quot; (), are used by scribes to write Torah Scrolls, Mezuzot, and Tefillin.

==Music==
Plectra for psalteries and lutes can be cut similarly to writing pens. The rachis, the portion of the stem between the barbs, not the calamus, of the primary flight feathers of birds of the &quot;Corvidae&quot; was preferred for harpsichords. In modern instruments, plastic is more common, but they are often still called &quot;quills&quot;. The lesiba uses a quill attached to a string to produce sound.

<doc id="25248" wikidata="Q849136" url="?curid=25248" title="Quo vadis?">
<text>Quo vadis? (, ) is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;Where are you going?&quot; It is commonly translated, quoting the KJV translation of John 13:36, as &quot;Whither goest thou?&quot;

The phrase originates from the Christian tradition regarding Saint Peter&#x27;s first words to the risen Christ during their encounter along the Appian Way. According to the apocryphal Acts of Peter (Vercelli Acts XXXV; late 2nd century AD), as Peter flees from crucifixion in Rome at the hands of the government, he meets the risen Jesus along the road outside the city. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, &quot;&quot;Quo vadis?&quot; He replies, &quot;Romam eo iterum crucifigī&quot;&quot; (&quot;I am going to Rome to be crucified again&quot;). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred by being crucified upside-down. The Church of Domine Quo Vadis in Rome is built where the meeting between Peter and Jesus traditionally took place.
The words &quot;quo vadis&quot; as a question also occur at least seven times in the Latin Vulgate.

== Meaning as used idiomatically ==
When used idiomatically, in ordinary day-to-day language, the phrase usually is spoken or written to inquire about someone&#x27;s purpose, ambitions, or decisions in a particular situation. It may also be employed to encourage introspection or to express surprise or confusion regarding someone&#x27;s actions or decisions. In general, this phrase prompts individuals to consider their direction and purpose [especially when questionable], urging them to reflect on their goals or to assess the consequences of their choices.

The reply of Jesus &quot;Romam eo iterum crucifigī&quot; is also used idiomatically in modern language to symbolize the return to something that is harmful or hurtful to oneself. Just how Jesus in the apocryphal story is returning to Rome to be crucified again, it is used in the same way where an individual, though knowing that a certain place, person, or thing has been a cause of hurt or harm in the past, they still return to it. Thus, one might say that an individual is &quot;returning to Rome&quot; when that individual is knowingly returning to something which causes either physical or mental harm, akin to how Jesus was returning to Rome to be crucified again.

== In culture ==

The Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel &quot;Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero&quot; (published in installments between 1895 and 96). The book in turn has been made into motion pictures several times, including a 1951 version that was nominated for eight Academy Awards. For this and other novels, Sienkiewicz received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Literature.

In a season four episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; entitled &quot;Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?&quot; the reference pertains to Jesus Christ. A shellshocked officer arrives at the hospital believing he is the Christ. He has numerous conversations with the characters, including Father Mulcahy. He ultimately leaves the MASH unit for an evacuation hospital, still unrecovered.

&quot;Quo Vadis, Aida?&quot; is a film by director Jasmila Žbanić about the Srebrenica massacre.

Quo Vadis has also been used as a name by many companies and groups. Quo Vadis is the name of a restaurant in London. A students’ club at University of Pittsburgh, established in 1944 to give tours of the Nationality Rooms, is called Quo Vadis.

<text>Qantas Airways Limited, or simply Qantas ( ), is the flag carrier of Australia, and the country&#x27;s largest airline by fleet size, international flights, and international destinations in Australia and Oceania. A founding member of the Oneworld airline alliance, it is the only airline in the world that flies to all seven continents, with it operating flights to Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America and South America from its hubs in Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane. It also flies to over 60 domestic destinations across Australia.

Qantas is the world&#x27;s third-oldest airline by foundation date and the oldest airline in the English-speaking world — being founded in November 1920. &quot;Qantas&quot; is an acronym of the airline&#x27;s original name, Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, as it originally served Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is popularly nicknamed &quot;The Flying Kangaroo&quot; and has the official slogan &quot;Spirit of Australia&quot;.

Qantas is based in the Sydney suburb of Mascot, adjacent to its main hub at Sydney Airport. , Qantas Group had a 60.8% share of the Australian domestic market. Various subsidiary airlines operate to regional centres and on some trunk routes within Australia, as well as some short haul international flights under the QantasLink banner. Qantas owns Jetstar, a low-cost airline that operates both international services from Australia and domestic services within Australia and New Zealand. It holds stakes in a number of other Jetstar-branded airlines in Asia, as well as Alliance Airlines and Fiji Airways.

==History==


Qantas was founded in Winton, Queensland on 16 November 1920 by Hudson Fysh, Paul McGinness and Fergus McMaster as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited. The airline&#x27;s first aircraft was an Avro 504K. It moved its headquarters to Longreach, Queensland in 1921 and Brisbane, Queensland in 1930.

===QEA era===
In 1934, QANTAS and Britain&#x27;s Imperial Airways, a forerunner of British Airways, formed a new company, Qantas Empire Airways Limited (QEA). In December 1934, the new airline began operations, flying between Brisbane and Darwin. QEA flew internationally from May 1935, when the service from Darwin was extended to Singapore. Imperial Airways operated the rest of the service through to London. When World War II began, enemy action and accidents destroyed half of the fleet of ten. Most of the fleet was taken over by the Australian government for war service.

In 1943, flying boat services resumed, with flights between the Swan River at Crawley in Perth, Western Australia and Koggala Lake in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. This linked up with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, BOAC, the successor airline to Imperial Airways, service to London. Qantas&#x27; kangaroo logo was first used on the &quot;Kangaroo Route&quot;, begun in 1944, from Sydney to Karachi, where BOAC crews took over for the rest of the journey to the UK.

In 1947, QEA was nationalised by the Australian government led by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley. QANTAS Limited was then wound up. After nationalisation, Qantas&#x27; remaining domestic network, in Queensland, was transferred to the nationally owned Trans-Australia Airlines, leaving Qantas with a purely international network. Shortly after nationalisation, QEA began its first services outside the British Empire, to Tokyo. Services to Hong Kong began around the same time. In 1957, a head office, Qantas House, opened in Sydney.

===Jet age===
In June 1959, Qantas entered the jet age when the first Boeing 707–138 was delivered. On 14 September 1992, Qantas merged with nationally owned domestic airline, Australian Airlines, renamed from Trans-Australia Airlines in 1986. Australian Airlines&#x27;s aircraft started to be rebranded as Qantas aircraft in 1993. Qantas was gradually privatised between 1993 and 1997. Under legislation passed to allow the privatisation, Qantas must be at least 51% owned by Australian shareholders.

=== Oneworld and Jetstar ===
In 1998, Qantas co-founded the Oneworld alliance with American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, and Cathay Pacific, with other airlines joining subsequently.

With the entry of new discount airline Virgin Blue, now Virgin Australia, into the domestic market in 2000, Qantas&#x27; market share fell. Qantas created the budget Jetstar in 2001 to compete. The main domestic competitor to Qantas, Ansett Australia, collapsed in September 2001.

Qantas briefly revived the Australian Airlines name as a short-lived international budget airline between 2002 and 2006. This subsidiary was shut down in favour of expanding Jetstar internationally, including to New Zealand. In 2004, the Qantas group expanded into the Asian budget airline market with Jetstar Asia, in which Qantas owns a minority stake. In 2007, a similar model was used for an investment into Jetstar Pacific, headquartered in Vietnam, and Jetstar Japan, launched in 2012.

In December 2006, Qantas was the subject of a failed bid from a consortium calling itself Airline Partners Australia. In 2008, merger talks with British Airways did not proceed to an agreement. In 2011, industrial relations dispute between Qantas and the Transport Workers Union of Australia resulted in the grounding of all Qantas aircraft and a lock-out of the airline&#x27;s staff for two days.

On 25 March 2018, a Qantas Boeing 787 flew non-stop between Australia and Europe, connecting the two continents by air for the first time, with the arrival in London of Flight 9 (QF9). QF9 was a 17-hour, 14,498 km (9,009-mile) journey from Perth Airport in Western Australia to London Heathrow.

On 20 October 2019, Qantas Airways completed the longest commercial flight to date, between New York City and Sydney using a Boeing 787–9 Dreamliner in 19 hours and 20 minutes.

=== COVID-19 ===
On 19 March 2020, Qantas suspended about 60% of domestic flights, put two thirds of its employees on leave, suspended all international flights and grounded more than 150 of its aircraft from the end of March until at least 31 May 2020, following expanded COVID-19 pandemic government travel restrictions. To survive the pandemic, Qantas axed 6,000 jobs and announced a plan to raise A$1.9 billion in new capital. Qantas offloaded its 30% stake in Jetstar Pacific to Vietnam Airlines, retiring the Jetstar brand in Vietnam.

In July 2020, Qantas retired its last Boeing 747-438ER, after almost 49 years of continuous operation of the type—the first 747-238B was introduced in August 1971. All twelve Airbus A380s were placed in storage, ten at Mojave Air &amp; Space Port and two at Los Angeles International Airport, for a minimum of three years. The pilots of the last Boeing 747 flight to Mojave Desert via Los Angeles traced the shape of the iconic Qantas logo in the flight path before the jet continued on its journey.

In November 2020, Qantas issued a public statement expressing their intention to require passengers traveling overseas to provide proof of COVID-19 inoculation. As per the statement made by Alan Joyce, the airline&#x27;s CEO, the presence of a COVID-19 vaccine would be considered indispensable for the purpose of travel. Joyce expressed their intention to potentially modify the terms and conditions, to specify that anyone traveling internationally must have a vaccination before embarking. Qantas also announced a cut of 2,000 jobs to limit its financial losses.

In August 2021, Qantas required all of its 22,000 employees to be fully vaccinated against the virus.

In May 2022, Qantas ordered twelve A350-1000 aircraft from Airbus, to be used in non-stop flights from Sydney to London in late 2025. In the same month, Qantas agreed terms to purchase Alliance Airlines. In April 2023, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) opposed the takeover.

By April 2024 Qantas had returned ten of its original twelve A380s to service, with all serviceable aircraft having undergone major refurbishment work to enhance the onboard soft furnishings.

=== Non-stop flight routes ===
In August 2022, Qantas Airways announced plans to compete in June 2023 with Air New Zealand on the non-stop Auckland–New York route. Qantas flights would originate in Sydney, before flying in 2025 on a non-stop Sydney–New York route, as part of Project Sunrise. Qantas aims to eliminate the &quot;tyranny of distance&quot; by developing non-stop flight routes connecting Australian cities to New York City, and to London. In February 2023, Qantas announced soaring profits of A$1.7bn for the second half of 2022, after experiencing losses due to COVID. In a development described by ABC News as a &quot;mammoth protest vote&quot;, on 3 November 2023 nearly 83% of Qantas shareholders voted against the airline&#x27;s remuneration report.

==Destinations, routes and codeshare agreements==

=== Destinations ===

Qantas operates regular services from Australia to destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Its domestic network serves all Australian states, along with the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and the external territory of Norfolk Island. In addition, Qantas also operates &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; charters to Antarctica from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, and formerly from Adelaide, Canberra, and Hobart, in partnership with Melbourne-based company Antarctica Flights. It first flew these Antarctic flightseeing trips in 1977. They were suspended for a number of years due to the crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 on Mount Erebus in 1979. Qantas restarted the flights in 1994. Although these flights do not touch down, they require specific polar operations and crew training due to factors like sector whiteout, which contributed to the 1979 Air New Zealand disaster.

=== Fifth-freedom routes ===
As of 2024, Qantas operates the following fifth-freedom services between the following cities:

* Singapore and London–Heathrow (part of flights QF1 and QF2 from/to Sydney)
* Auckland and New York–JFK (part of flights QF3 and QF4 from/to Sydney)

=== &#x27;International&#x27; domestic routes to and from Perth ===
Qantas uses Perth as a transit point for its European services between Sydney and Paris (QF33 and QF34), as well as for a seasonal service between Sydney and Rome (QF5 and QF6). These flights depart and arrive at the international terminal at Sydney Airport despite the Sydney-Perth segment of these flights being domestic. As Qantas is an Australian airline, it is permitted to carry, and sells tickets for domestic passengers intending to fly solely between Sydney and Perth. Qantas issues domestic passengers on these flights with an orange &#x27;D&#x27; sticker that allows them to bypass customs and immigration, and passports are not necessary for these passengers.

=== Codeshare agreements ===
, Qantas had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
==Fleet==
=== Current fleet ===
, the Qantas Group and its subsidiaries operate 308 aircraft, including 85 aircraft by Jetstar Airways; 90 by the various QantasLink-branded airlines and eight by Express Freighters Australia (on behalf of Qantas Freight).

The group also has over 150 narrow-body and 36 wide-body aircraft firm orders , across the Airbus A220, Airbus A320neo, Airbus A321neo, Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 families to replace the existing fleet over the following decade, with these aircraft being distributed amongst Qantas, QantasLink and Jetstar.

International Economy class is available on all Qantas mainline passenger aircraft.

Seat pitch is usually and seat width ranges from . Layouts are 3–3 on the 737, 2-4-2 on the A330, and 3-3-3 on the B787-9. On the A380, the layout is 3-4-3 and there are four self-service snack bars located in between cabins.

In 2019, Qantas began retrofitting its Airbus A380 aircraft with new Economy seats containing new seat cushions and improved inflight entertainment, as offered on Airbus A330 and Boeing 787 aircraft. The new aircraft will have fewer economy seats compared to the previous configuration due to an increase in the number of premium seats.

===In-flight entertainment===
All Qantas mainline aircraft contain some form of video and audio entertainment. Qantas has several types of in-flight entertainment (IFE) systems installed on its aircraft.

==== Audio-video entertainment systems ====
The &quot;Total Entertainment System&quot; by Rockwell Collins was available on selected domestic and international aircraft between 2000 and 2019. This AVOD system included personal LCD screens in all classes, located in the seat back for economy and business class, and in the armrest for premium economy and first class.

The Mainscreen System is available on selected Boeing 737–800 aircraft. This entertainment system, introduced gradually between 2002 and 2011, has overhead video screens as the main form of entertainment. Movies are shown on the screens on longer flights and TV programmes on shorter flights. A news telecast will usually be shown at the start of each flight. Audio options are less varied than on Q, iQ or the Total Entertainment System.

The &quot;iQ&quot; inflight entertainment system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation is available on selected Airbus A380 and Boeing 737–800 aircraft. This AVOD experience, introduced in 2008, is based on the Panasonic Avionics system and features expanded entertainment options, touch screens and new communications-related features such as Wi-Fi and mobile phone functionality, as well as increased support for electronics (such as USB and iPod connectivity).

The &quot;Q&quot; inflight entertainment system by Panasonic Avionics Corporation is available on all Airbus A330-300, A330-200, Boeing 787 and selected Airbus A380 aircraft. This audio video on demand (AVOD) experience, introduced in 2014 and updated in 2018 on selected aircraft, is based on the Panasonic eX3 system and features extensive entertainment options; enhanced touch screens; and communications-related features such as Wi-Fi and mobile phone functionality; as well as increased support for electronics (such as USB and iPod connectivity). The &quot;my flight&quot; feature offers access to maps, playlists, and a service timeline showing when drinks and meals will be served and the best time for resting on long-haul flights.

In 2024, Qantas selected Panasonic&#x27;s OLED 4K &#x27;Astrova&#x27; seatback screen to be equipped on its Airbus A350 fleet to be delivered from 2026. The entertainment system will feature &quot;high-fidelity multi-channel spatial audio technology&quot; and Bluetooth connectivity allowing for passengers to connect their personal wireless earbuds or headphones. The Astrova IFE system will also deliver 100 W of mobile device and laptop fast-charging via USB-C, available through all phases of flight.

==== Wireless entertainment systems and Wi-Fi ====
Q Streaming is an in-flight entertainment system in which entertainment is streamed to iPads or personal devices available in all classes on selected aircraft. A selection of movies, TV, music, and a kids&#x27; choice are available.

In 2007, Qantas conducted a trial for use of mobile telephones with AeroMobile, during domestic services for three months on a Boeing 767. During the trial, passengers were allowed to send and receive text messages and emails but were not able to make or receive calls.

In July 2015, Qantas signed a deal with American cable network HBO to provide over 120 hours of television programming in-flight from the network on its aircraft, as well as original lifestyle and entertainment programming from both Foxtel and the National Geographic Channel. In August 2022, it was announced that the airline had partnered with Network 10 owner Paramount to launch the Paramount+ service on its in-flight entertainment systems.

In 2017, Qantas began offering complimentary Wi-Fi on its domestic aircraft. The services utilises NBN Co Sky Muster satellites to deliver higher speeds than generally offered by onboard Wi-Fi. Previously, in July 2007, Qantas announced that Wi-Fi would be available on its long haul A380s and 747-400s although that system ultimately did not proceed following trials.

In 2023, Qantas began offering complimentary Wi-Fi on select international flights. Qantas aims to have complimentary Wi-Fi on all of its international aircraft by 2026. The Wi-Fi will be available to all customers free of charge, regardless of class, ticket or frequent flyer tier, as is the case with the airline&#x27;s domestic Wi-Fi.

==== News media ====
Until 2014, the Australian Nine Network provided a news bulletin for Qantas entitled &quot;Nine&#x27;s Qantas Inflight News&quot;, which was the same broadcast as Nine&#x27;s &quot;Early Morning News&quot;, however Nine lost the contract to Sky News Australia in 2014. In 2022, Qantas ended its contract with Sky News and signed an agreement with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s ABC News to provide inflight digital news services for Qantas passengers.

==== Inflight magazine ====
&quot;Qantas: The Australian Way&quot; is the airline&#x27;s in-flight magazine. In mid-2015, the magazine ended a 14-year publishing deal with Bauer Media, switching its publisher to Medium Rare.

==Services==

===Qantas Frequent Flyer===

The Qantas frequent-flyer program is aimed at rewarding customer loyalty. It is Australia&#x27;s largest loyalty program, with 16.4 million members as of June 2024. The program is long-standing, although the date of the actual inception has been a matter that has generated some commentary. Qantas state the program launched in 1987 although other sources claim what is the current program was launched in the early 1990s, with a Captain&#x27;s Club program existing before that.

== Design, hospitality, and lifestyle ==

=== Design ===
Beginning in the early 2000s, Qantas began working with industrial designer Marc Newson on cabin interiors, product design and first-class lounges. This collaboration resulted in the introduction of the Skybed business class seat in 2003 and led to Newson being named as the first Creative Director of Qantas in 2006. Newson was responsible for the design of the Qantas A380 fleet which first entered service in 2008, as well as the Sydney first class lounge.

Newson protégé David Caon, since 2016, has been enlisted by Qantas for product design. Caon has designed the cabins of current Qantas Boeing 787, A380 and A220 aircraft, as well as upcoming Airbus A350 and Airbus A321neo aircraft. Caon has also designed new international first and business lounges, domestic business and club lounges, regional lounges, furniture, and accessories. Furniture featured in Qantas first-class lounges and onboard has been manufactured by companies such as Poltrona Frau, Cappellini, Alessi, Tai Ping and Noritake. Qantas has also worked with Sydney&#x27;s Charles Perkins Centre to conduct research to determine optimal lighting conditions to reduce jetlag on long-haul flights and improve comfort and health &quot;before, during and after long-haul flights&quot;.

Qantas has received various awards for design.

=== Catering ===
Australian chef and entrepreneur Neil Perry has been responsible for the onboard and ground based culinary offerings of the airline since becoming the director of food, beverage, and service in 1997, and currently Qantas&#x27; catering operations are supplied by dnata. In 2022, to celebrate the 25-year collaboration with Perry, Qantas reintroduced a selection of his most popular inflight and lounge dishes. Qantas is currently the only airline in Australia to offer complimentary meals, snacks and beverages on all domestic flights, including regional QantasLink services.

===Uniform and grooming===

Paris-based Australian designer is responsible for the current Qantas uniforms that were unveiled on 16 April 2013. These were to replace the previous uniforms, dubbed colloquially as &quot;Morrissey&quot; by staff after the designer, Peter Morrissey. The new outfits feature a colour palette of black, red and fuchsia pink. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce stated that the new design &quot;speaks of Australian style on the global stage&quot; at the launch event that involved employees modelling the uniforms. Grant consulted with Qantas staff members over the course of one year to finalise the 35 styles that were eventually created. Not all employees were happy with the new uniform, however, with one flight attendant saying &quot;The uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do.&quot; In 2020 Grant also designed a Qantas branded athleisure-wear collection.

Qantas declared in 2023 that it had ended uniform rules based on gender. Female flight attendants are no longer required to wear high heels, male flight attendants can wear makeup, and flight attendants of any gender can wear the same type of jewelry and have long hair in a ponytail or bun. At the end of January 2025, Qantas announced plans to refresh the uniforms for its onboard crews. The airline says that they will now engage with several Australian designers to review the requirements and undertake a selection process for what will become the eleventh uniform in its history. The next uniform designer will be announced in the coming months with Qantas planning to debut the new design in 2027 alongside with Qantas’ huge fleet renewal program. Additionally, Qantas will start surveying its uniformed workforce to assist in developing the new outfits.

==Liveries==
===Indigenous art liveries===
Two Qantas aircraft are currently painted in an Indigenous Australian art scheme. One aircraft, a Boeing 737-800 registered as VH-XZJ, wears a livery called &quot;Mendoowoorrji&quot;, which was revealed in November 2013. The design was drawn from the late West Australian Aboriginal artist Paddy Bedford. The second, a Boeing 787 registered VH-ZND, is adorned in a paint scheme inspired by the late Emily Kame Kngwarreye&#x27;s 1991 painting &quot;Yam Dreaming&quot;. The adaptation of &quot;Yam Dreaming&quot; to the aircraft, led by Balarinji, a Sydney-based and Aboriginal-owned design firm, incorporates the red Qantas tailfin into the design, which includes white dots with red and orange tones. The design depicts the yam plant, an important and culturally significant symbol in Kngwarreye&#x27;s Dreaming stories, and a staple food source in her home region of Utopia. The design was applied to the aircraft during manufacture, prior to its delivery in March 2018 to Alice Springs Airport, situated 230 kilometres southeast of Utopia, where the aircraft was met by Kngwarreye&#x27;s descendants, the local community, and Qantas executives. The aircraft would later operate Qantas&#x27; inaugural nonstop services between Perth and London Heathrow, and between Melbourne and San Francisco, scheduled with Boeing 787 aircraft.

Australian Aboriginal art designs have previously adorned some Qantas aircraft; the first design was called &quot;Wunala Dreaming&quot;, which was unveiled in 1994 and had been painted on now-retired Boeing 747–400 and 747-400ER aircraft between 1994 and 2012. The &quot;motif&quot; was an overall-red design depicting ancestral spirits in the form of kangaroos travelling in the outback.

The second design was called &quot;Nalanji Dreaming&quot; and was depicted on a Boeing 747–300 from 1995 until its retirement in 2005. &quot;Nalanji Dreaming&quot; was a bright blue design inspired by rainforest landscape and tropical seas.

The third design was titled &quot;Yananyi Dreaming,&quot; and featured a depiction of Uluru. The scheme was designed by Uluru-based artist Rene Kulitja, in collaboration with Balarinji. It was painted on the 737 at the Boeing factory prior to its delivery in 2002. It was repainted into the standard livery in 2014.

===Retro Roo liveries===
In November 2014 the airline revealed that the 75th Boeing 737–800 jet to be delivered would carry a &#x27;retro-livery&#x27; based on the airline&#x27;s 1971 &#x27;ochre&#x27; colour scheme design featuring the iconic &#x27;Flying Kangaroo&#x27; on its tail and other aspects drawn from its 1970s fleet. The aircraft was delivered on 17 November.

Qantas announced a second 737–800 would receive a &#x27;retro roo&#x27; livery in October 2015. On 16 November 2015 the airline unveiled the second &#x27;retro roo&#x27; 737, bearing a replica livery from 1959 to celebrate the airline&#x27;s 95th birthday.
===Other liveries===
Several Qantas aircraft have been decorated with promotional liveries, promoting telecommunications company Optus; the Disney motion picture &quot;Planes&quot;; the Australian national association football team, the Socceroos; and the Australian national rugby union team, the Wallabies. Two aircraft – an Airbus A330-200 and a Boeing 747-400ER – were decorated with special liveries promoting the Oneworld airline alliance (of which Qantas is a member) in 2009. On 29 September 2014, nonstop Airbus A380 service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport was inaugurated using an A380 decorated with a commemorative cowboy hat and bandana on the kangaroo tail logo. Prior to the 2017 Sydney Mardi Gras, Qantas decorated one of its Airbus A330-300 aircraft with rainbow lettering and depicted a rainbow flag on the tail of the aircraft.

=== &#x27;World&#x27;s safest airline&#x27; awards ===
In addition to the above awards, Qantas has consistently ranked in either first or second place in the annual &quot;AirlineRatings.com&quot; &#x27;World&#x27;s Safest Airline&#x27; awards since their inception in 2014. The &#x27;Operational Safety Audit&#x27; from the International Air Transport Association, along with the International Civil Aviation Organisation &#x27;country audit&#x27; are used as benchmarks by AirlineRatings.com when determining annual rankings. Qantas was named the world&#x27;s safest airline from 2014 to 2017, from 2019 to 2021, and again in 2023, second to Air New Zealand in 2018, 2022 and 2024.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Company heads ===
The company heads of Qantas Airways Limited are only listed from 1993, when Qantas&#x27; shares once again traded on the stock exchange as a publicly listed company, following the Australian Government&#x27;s move to privatise the remaining 75% of the airline. Throughout Qantas&#x27; history, since 1920, there have been many structures, branding and variations including the name &#x27;Qantas&#x27;. Its current company structure was established in 1993, going from an unlisted public company in which the Commonwealth owned all of the shares, to a listed public company. A full list of Qantas chairpersons and managing directors can be found on the History of Qantas page.


===Business trends===
The key trends for the Qantas Group (Qantas Airways Ltd and Controlled Entities, which includes Jetstar and Qantas Cargo), are shown below, as at year ending 30 June:
=== Headquarters ===
Qantas&#x27; headquarters are located at the Qantas Centre in the suburb of Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales. In December 2013, a redevelopment of the headquarters was completed.

===Airline subsidiaries===
Qantas has operated a number of passenger airline subsidiaries since inception, including:

;Current
*QantasLink – Qantas&#x27; regional airline brand encompassing the operations of four Qantas subsidiary airlines (Eastern Australia Airlines, National Jet Systems, Network Aviation and Sunstate Airlines) and a contract carrier
* Jetstar – currently operating as Qantas&#x27; low-cost carrier
* Jetconnect – a wholly owned Qantas subsidiary established in 2002 that focused on trans-Tasman travel between New Zealand and Eastern Australia cities (Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney). The last of Jetconnect&#x27;s aircraft were transferred to the mainline fleet in October 2018
Qantas operates a freight service under the name Qantas Freight, which uses aircraft operated by Qantas subsidiary Express Freighters Australia and leases aircraft from Atlas Air. Qantas wholly owns the logistics-and-air-freight company Australian airExpress.

;Former
*Australia Asia Airlines – operated from 1990 to 1996 to allow Qantas to serve the Taiwanese market
* Impulse Airlines – an established airline bought by Qantas in 2001. Ceased operations in 2001 and its assets used to establish Jetstar Airways
* Australian Airlines – an international leisure airline that operated from 2002 to 2006, serving leisure destinations in Asia as well as Qantas international routes flown out of Cairns.

=== Minority airline equity interests ===
In addition to its wholly owned subsidiaries, Qantas also owns minority equity stakes in a number of other Australian and foreign airlines:
===Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders initiatives===
Qantas, through its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programme, has some links with the Aboriginal Australian community. In the Qantas Reconciliation Action Plan 2015 – 2018, Qantas revealed that 1 percent of all their staff are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Qantas employs a full-time Diversity Coordinator, who is responsible for the programme.

Qantas has also bought and donated Aboriginal art. An art installation at its passenger lounge in Brisbane features a painting by Jenna Lee. Qantas has had a number of its aircraft painted with the art of Aboriginal artist Emily Kame Kngwarreye and others with art inspired by Rene Kulitja and Paddy Bedford.

===Promotions and sponsorships===
An early television campaign, starting in 1969 and running for several decades, was aimed at American audiences. It featured a live koala, voiced by Howard Morris, who complained that too many tourists were coming to Australia and concluded &quot;I hate Qantas.&quot; The koala ads have been ranked among the greatest commercials of all time. A long-running advertising campaign features renditions by children&#x27;s choirs of Peter Allen&#x27;s &quot;I Still Call Australia Home&quot;, at various famous landmarks in Australia and foreign locations such as Venice. The song has been used in Qantas&#x27;s safety videos since 2018.

Qantas is the main sponsor of the Australia national rugby union team. Qantas sponsors the Socceroos, Australia&#x27;s national association football team. Qantas was the naming rights sponsor for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix from 2010 until 2012. In December 2011, Qantas signed a four-year deal with Australian cricket&#x27;s governing body Cricket Australia, to be the official carrier of the Australia national cricket team.

Qantas management has expressed strong support for Marriage Equality and LGBTIQ issues, with CEO Alan Joyce said to be, &quot;arguably the most prominent corporate voice in the marriage equality campaign&quot;. As official airline partner for the Sydney Mardi Gras, Qantas decorated one of its aircraft with rainbow wording and positioned a rainbow flag next to the tail&#x27;s flying kangaroo. Qantas also served pride cookies to its passengers. It had a rainbow roo float in the Mardi Gras parade.

There has been criticism of Qantas using its corporate power to prosecute the private interests on their staff and the community. Peter Dutton has said that chief executives such as Alan Joyce at Qantas should &quot;stick to their knitting&quot; rather than using the company&#x27;s brand to advocate for political causes. A senior church leader has made similar comments. Despite the criticism, Qantas will continue to advocate for marriage equality which will include offering customers specially commissioned rings with the phrase, &quot;until we all belong&quot;. This phrase will appear on Qantas boarding passes and other paraphernalia. The cost of the campaign by Qantas and other participating companies is expected to be more than $5 million.

Joyce has pledged Qantas will, &quot;continue social-justice campaigning&quot;, in relation to Israel Folau, sacked by Rugby Australia, which is financially supported by Qantas, following his social media postings on homosexuality.

===2010s structural change===
In August 2011, the company announced that following financial losses of A$200 million ($209 million) for the year ending June 2011 and a decline in market share, major structural changes would be made. One planned change that did not come to fruition was the plan to create a new Asia-based premium airline that would operate under a different name. In addition to this plan, Qantas announced it planned to cut 1,000 jobs. The reforms included route changes, in particular the cessation of services to London via Hong Kong and Bangkok. While Qantas still operated in these cities, onward flights to London would be via its Oneworld partner British Airways under a code-share service.

In 2012, Qantas reported an A$245 million full-year loss to the end of June 2012, citing high fuel prices, intense competition and industrial disputes. This was the first full year loss since Qantas was fully privatised 17 years previously, in 1995, and led to the airline cancelling its order of 35 new Boeing 787 aircraft, to reduce its spending. Qantas subsequently divested itself of its 50% holding of StarTrack, Australia&#x27;s largest road freight company, in part for acquiring full interest in Australian airExpress. In March 2012, Qantas set up Jetstar Hong Kong with China Eastern Airlines Corporation, which was intended to begin flights in 2013, but became embroiled in a protracted approval process.

Qantas and Emirates began an alliance on 31 March 2013, in which their combined carriers offered 98 flights per week to Dubai. In September 2013, the carrier predicted another A$250 million ( million) net loss for the half-year period that ended on 31 December and the implementation of further cost-cutting measures that would see the cut of 1,000 jobs within a year. S&amp;P downgraded Qantas credit from BBB− (the lowest investment grade) to BB+. Moody&#x27;s applied a similar downgrading a month later.

Losses continued into the 2014 reporting year, with the Qantas Group reporting a half year loss of A$235 million ( million) and an eventual full year loss of A$2.84 billion. In February 2014, additional cost-cutting measures to save A$2 billion, including the loss of 5,000 jobs that will see the workforce lowered from 32,000 to 27,000 by 2017 were announced. In May 2014, the company stated it expected to shed 2,200 jobs by June 2014, including those of 100 pilots. Qantas reduced the size of its fleet by retiring aircraft and deferring deliveries, and planned to sell some of its assets.

With 2,200 employees laid off by June 2014, another 1,800 job positions were planned to be cut by June 2015. Also during 2014, the &quot;Qantas Sale Act&quot;, under which the airline was privatised, was amended to repeal parts of section 7. That act limits foreign ownership of Qantas to 49 percent, with foreign airlines subject to further restrictions, including a 35-percent limit for all foreign airline shareholdings combined. A single foreign entity can hold no more than 25 percent of the airline&#x27;s shares.

Qantas returned to profit in 2015, announcing a A$557 million after tax profit in August 2015, in contrast with a A$2.84 billion loss the year earlier. In 2015, Qantas sold its lease of Terminal 3 at Sydney Airport, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport Corporation for $535 million. This meant Sydney Airport resumed operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas.

== Accidents and incidents ==
It is often claimed that Qantas has never had an aircraft crash. While it is true that the company has neither lost a jet airliner nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63 people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed. The last fatal accidents suffered by Qantas were in 1951, with three fatal crashes in five months. Qantas&#x27; safety record allows the airline to be officially known as the world&#x27;s safest airline for seven years in a row from 2012 until 2019 and again in 2021 and 2023.

Since the end of World War II, the following accidents and incidents have occurred:
* On 23 March 1946, an Avro Lancastrian registered G-AGLX disappeared while flying over the Indian Ocean. The BOAC-owned aircraft was being operated by Qantas on the Karachi—Sydney part of the two airlines&#x27; joint service from London to Sydney. It disappeared with seven passengers and crew on board between Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, approximately three hours before it was due to arrive at the Cocos islands.
* On 7 April 1949, an Avro Lancastrian registered VH-EAS swung on landing at Dubbo, New South Wales during a training flight, causing the gear to collapse. The aircraft was destroyed by fire, but the crew evacuated safely.
* On 16 July 1951, a de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover registered VH-EBQ crashed off the coast of New Guinea (in the Huon Gulf near the mouth of the Markham River) after the centre engine&#x27;s propeller failed. The pilot and the six passengers on board were killed.
* On 21 September 1951, a de Havilland DH.84 Dragon registered VH-AXL, crashed in mountainous country southeast of Arona in the central highlands of New Guinea, no passengers were on board, the pilot was killed.
* On 13 December 1951, a de Havilland DH.84 Dragon registered VH-URV crashed in mountainous country near Mount Hagen, central highlands of New Guinea. The pilot and the two passengers were killed. This is the last fatal accident suffered by Qantas.
* On 24 August 1960, a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation registered VH-EAC crashed on take-off at Mauritius en route to the Cocos Islands, Australia. The take-off was aborted following an engine failure, the aircraft ran off the runway, and was destroyed by fire. There were no fatalities.
* On 1 June 1989, Qantas Flight 5, a Boeing 747-200 operating from Sydney to Singapore was cruising at 32,000 ft about 900 km south-east of Derby when it sharply climbed 1500 ft. The pilots disengaged the auto-pilot and the aircraft sharply descended 1500 ft. Unrestrained passengers hit the cabin&#x27;s internal ceiling panels, leaving holes. The aircraft diverted to Darwin, where 47 passengers were taken to hospital with cuts, bruises, chest pains, concussion, fractured ribs and shock. Three passengers suffered spinal injuries.
* On 23 September 1999, Qantas Flight 1, a Boeing 747–400 registered VH-OJH, overran the runway while landing at Bangkok, Thailand, during a heavy thunderstorm. The aircraft came to a stop on a golf course, but without fatalities. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau criticised numerous inadequacies in Qantas&#x27; operational and training processes.
* On 25 July 2008, Qantas Flight 30, a Boeing 747–400 registered VH-OJK, suffered a ruptured fuselage and decompression as a result of an oxygen tank explosion over the South China Sea. En route from Hong Kong International Airport to Melbourne Airport, the aircraft made an emergency landing in the Philippines with no injuries.
* On 7 October 2008, an Airbus A330-300 registered VH-QPA, travelling from Singapore Changi Airport to Perth, Western Australia as Qantas Flight 72, suffered a rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch down manoeuvres causing serious injuries while from Learmonth. The aircraft safely landed in Learmonth, with 14 people requiring transportation by air ambulance to Perth. Another 30 people also required hospital treatment, while an additional 30 people had injuries not requiring hospital treatment. Initial investigations identified an inertial reference system fault in the Number-1 Air Data Inertial Reference Unit as the likely origin of the event. On receiving false indication of a very high angle of attack, the flight control systems commanded a pitch down movement, reaching a maximum of 8.5 degrees pitch down. The incident featured in a 7 News documentary.
* On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, an Airbus A380 registered VH-OQA, fitted with four Rolls-Royce Trent 972 engines, suffered an uncontained turbine disc failure of its left inboard engine shortly after taking off from Singapore Changi Airport en route to Sydney. The aircraft returned to Singapore and landed safely. None of the 440 passengers or 29 crew on board were injured.

===Extortion attempts===
On 26 May 1971 Qantas received a call from a &quot;Mr. Brown&quot; claiming that there was a bomb planted on a Hong Kong-bound jet and demanding $500,000 in unmarked $20 notes. The caller and threat were taken seriously when he directed police to an airport locker where a functional bomb was found. Arrangements were made to pick up the money in front of the head office of the airline in the heart of the Sydney business district. Qantas paid the money and it was collected, after which Mr. Brown called again, advising the &quot;bomb on the plane&quot; story was a hoax. The initial pursuit of the perpetrator was bungled by the New South Wales Police Force which, despite having been advised of the matter from the time of the first call, failed to establish adequate surveillance of the pick-up of the money. Directed not to use their radios (for fear of being &quot;overheard&quot;), the police were unable to communicate adequately.

Tipped off by a still-unidentified informer, the police arrested an Englishman, Peter Macari, finding more than $138,000 hidden in an Annandale property. Convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison, Macari served nine years before being deported to Britain. More than $224,000 remains unaccounted for. The 1986 telemovie &quot;Call Me Mr. Brown&quot;, directed by Scott Hicks and produced by Terry Jennings, relates to this incident. On 4 July 1997 a copycat extortion attempt was thwarted by police and Qantas security staff.

== Controversies ==

===Sex discrimination controversy===

In November 2005, it was revealed that Qantas had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to unaccompanied children. This led to accusations of discrimination. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when Mark Wolsay, who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand, was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that &quot;it was the airline&#x27;s policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children&quot;. Cameron Murphy of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties president criticised the policy and stated that &quot;there was no basis for the ban&quot;. He said it was wrong to assume that all adult males posed a danger to children. The policy has also been criticised for failing to take female abusers into consideration.

In 2010, when British Airways was successfully sued to change its child seating policy, Qantas argued again that banning men from sitting next to unaccompanied children &quot;reflected parents&#x27; concerns&quot;. In August 2012, the controversy resurfaced when a male passenger had to swap seats with a female passenger after the crew noticed he was sitting next to an unrelated girl travelling alone. The man felt discriminated against and humiliated before the other passengers as a possible paedophile. A Qantas spokesman defended the policy as consistent with that of other airlines in Australia and around the globe.

===Price fixing===
In 2006, a class action lawsuit, alleging price-fixing on air cargo freight, was commenced in Australia. The lawsuit was settled early in 2011 with Qantas agreeing to pay in excess of $21 million to settle the case.

Qantas has pleaded guilty to participating in a cartel that fixed the price of air cargo. Qantas Airways Ltd. was fined CAD$155,000 after it admitted that its freight division fixed surcharges on cargo exported on certain routes from Canada between May 2002 and February 2006. In July 2007, Qantas pleaded guilty in the United States to price fixing and was fined a total of $61 million through the Department of Justice investigation. The executive in charge was jailed for six months. Other Qantas executives were granted immunity after the airline agreed to co-operate with authorities.

In 2008, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission fined the airline $20 million for breaches of the acts associated with protecting consumers. In November 2010 Qantas was fined 8.8 million euros for its part in an air cargo cartel involving up to 11 other airlines. Qantas was fined NZ$6.5 million in April 2011 when it pleaded guilty in the New Zealand High Court to the cartel operation.

===Industrial disputes and 2011 grounding of fleet===
In response to ongoing industrial unrest over failed negotiations involving three unions (the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA), the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA) and the Transport Workers Union of Australia (TWU)), the company grounded its entire domestic and international fleet from 5 pm AEDT on 29 October 2011, and employees involved would be locked out from 8 p.m. AEDT on 31 October 2011. However, in the early hours of 31 October, Fair Work Australia ordered that all industrial action taken by Qantas and the involved trade unions be terminated immediately. The order was requested by the federal government amid fears that an extended period of grounding would do significant damage to the national economy, especially the tourism and mining sectors. It was reported that the grounding would have had a daily financial impact of A$20 million, and affected an estimated 68,000 customers worldwide.

In 2021, the Transport Workers Union took Qantas to court, over the dismissal of 1,685 baggage handlers and cleaners during the COVID-19 pandemic, whose roles were later outsourced. The TWU argued that the airline&#x27;s actions contravened the Fair Work Act. Qantas claimed it had to make the cuts to ensure the company&#x27;s survival during the pandemic. In July 2021, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in favour of the TWU. Qantas lost an appeal in May 2022. The case moved to the High Court of Australia in May 2023. In September 2023, the High Court ruled against Qantas, upholding the original Federal Court decision and leaving the airline liable for compensation. After the verdict, Qantas issued an apology to the sacked workers.

===Asylum seeker deportations===
Qantas has been subject to protests in relation to the deportation of asylum seekers, which led to disruptions of flights. In 2015 activists prevented the transfer of a Tamil man from Melbourne to Darwin (from where he was to be deported to Colombo) by refusing to take their seats on a Qantas flight. It was reported that Qantas banned the student from taking Qantas flights in the future. A nameless head of security from Qantas sent a letter to the Melbourne student&#x27;s email account saying her &quot;actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group&quot;.

Also in 2015, another Tamil man was to be sent from Melbourne to Darwin to later be deported. A protest by the man led to him not being put on the aircraft. A spokesman for Qantas said flight QF838 was delayed almost two hours. A spokesperson from Qantas stated that &quot;[s]afety and security is the number-one priority for all airlines and an aircraft is not the right place for people to conduct protests.&quot; Campaigners also asked Qantas to rule out deporting Iraqi man Saeed in 2017. Campaigners have asked Qantas not to participate in the high-profile deportation case of the Nadesalingam family. In response a Qantas spokesperson stated: &quot;We appreciate that this is a sensitive issue. The government and courts are best placed to make decisions on complex immigration matters, not airlines&quot;.

===Disputes with Perth Airport===

The airline has been in a number of disputes with the operators of Perth Airport. In 2018, the airport sued Qantas in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for allegedly underpaying their aeronautical service fees by $11.3 million. The suit was resolved in 2022 with Qantas forced to pay the airport the owed amount plus an additional $9 million. In 2020, Perth Airport had also threatened to cancel several of the airline&#x27;s leases over unpaid rent between February and May 2020; part of the rental dispute concerned Qantas alleging that Perth Airport had undervalued a Qantas-owned terminal that was sold back to the airport. Qantas had also drawn criticism from both Perth Airport and the Government of Western Australia for delaying an agreed move from their existing isolated terminals to a proposed new terminal in the airport&#x27;s central precinct; in May 2024, it was confirmed that the airline had come to an agreement to complete the move by 2031, six years after the original agreed timeframe of 2025.

===Complaints===

In April 2022, consumer advocacy group Choice lodged a complaint with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) concerning the airline&#x27;s flight credit policy for cancelled flights during the COVID-19 pandemic, which they alleged was &quot;unfair&quot; and saw customers issued with flight vouchers with short expiration dates that became unusable due to ongoing travel restrictions. Although more than $1 billion in credit had been claimed by Qantas and Jetstar customers by August 2023, that month the airline was hit with a class action lawsuit by customers still seeking refunds and compensation for flights cancelled during the pandemic.

In September 2022, &quot;Four Corners&quot; broadcast an episode titled &quot;The Inside Story Of the Chaos at Qantas&quot;, detailing passenger service issues and cost cutting by the company.

During an August 2023 Australian Senate committee hearing concerning the rising cost of living, CEO Alan Joyce was accused of &quot;misleading the Australian public&quot; with the airline&#x27;s flight credits scheme, among other issues with the carrier. On 31 August 2023, Qantas bowed to public pressure and announced the removal of expiry dates for flight credits issued up to 30 September 2021 as well as giving customers the option of a refund instead, with Joyce admitting in a statement that the airline&#x27;s implementation of the scheme led to &quot;people [losing] faith in the process&quot;.

In March 2023, a report by the ACCC found that the airline was the subject of almost 2,000 complaints over the previous year, with more than 1,300 complaints relating to flight cancellations. The report found that complaints about the airline had risen by 70% from the previous year, and that the ACCC receives more complaints about Qantas than any other business. In August 2023, the ACCC launched legal action against the airline in the Federal Court of Australia for allegedly continuing to advertise and sell tickets for more than 8,000 flights scheduled between May and July 2022 that were already cancelled, as well as delaying informing existing ticketholders of these cancellations.

Court filings showed that Qantas carried on selling tickets on 71,000 flights due to take off between May 2022 and May 2024 after deciding to scrap them. About 87,000 people bought tickets on the fake departures or were rebooked onto them. As many as 884,000 customers were not informed swiftly that they were down to travel on flights that had already been cancelled. The allegations led to the premature departure of Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce in 2023.

Qantas settled the lawsuit in May 2024, agreeing to pay A$120 million ($82 million) in fines and compensation for selling tickets on flights it had already decided to cancel. On 30 June 2024, Qantas began contacting customers to offer them compensation. Customers who booked Qantas flights scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 and 10 May 2024 that had already been cancelled will receive $225 for domestic and trans-Tasman flights, and $450 for international flights, on top of any other refund or alternative flight already offered.

<text>QED is a line-oriented computer text editor that was developed by Butler Lampson and L. Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley Timesharing System running on the SDS 940. It was implemented by L. Peter Deutsch and Dana Angluin between 1965 and 1966.

QED (for &quot;quick editor&quot;) addressed teleprinter usage, but systems &quot;for CRT displays [were] not considered, since many of their design considerations [were] quite different.&quot;

==Later implementations==
Ken Thompson later wrote a version for CTSS; this version was notable for introducing regular expressions. Thompson rewrote QED in BCPL for Multics. The Multics version was ported to the GE-600 system used at Bell Labs in the late 1960s under GECOS and later GCOS after Honeywell took over GE&#x27;s computer business. The GECOS-GCOS port used I/O routines written by A. W. Winklehoff. Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson and Brian Kernighan wrote the QED manuals used at Bell Labs.
Given that the authors were the primary developers of the Unix operating system, it is natural that QED had a strong influence on the classic UNIX text editors ed, sed and their descendants such as ex and sam, and more distantly AWK and Perl.

A version of QED named FRED (Friendly Editor) was written at the
University of Waterloo for Honeywell systems by Peter Fraser. A University of Toronto team consisting of Tom Duff, Rob Pike, Hugh Redelmeier, and David Tilbrook implemented a version of QED that runs on UNIX; David Tilbrook later included QED as part of his QEF tool set.

QED was also used as a character-oriented editor on the Norwegian-made Norsk Data systems, first Nord TSS, then Sintran III. It was implemented for the Nord-1 computer in 1971 by Bo Lewendal who after working with Deutsch and Lampson at Project Genie and at the Berkeley Computer Corporation, had taken a job with Norsk Data (and who developed the Nord TSS later in 1971).

<doc id="25257" wikidata="Q336347" url="?curid=25257" title="Qusay Hussein">
<text>Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Nasiri al-Tikriti (or Qusai, ; 17 May 1966 – 22 July 2003) was an Iraqi politician, military leader, and the second son of Saddam Hussein. He was appointed as his father&#x27;s heir apparent in 2000. He was also in charge of the Republican Guard, a branch of the Iraqi military. Although he had a lower public profile compared to his brother Uday, he was said to have had a key role in crushing opposition during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. Qusay, his son Mustafa, and his brother Uday were killed in a 2003 U.S. raid in Mosul.

==Biography==

Qusay was born in Baghdad in 1966 to Ba&#x27;athist revolutionary Saddam Hussein, who was in prison at the time, and his wife and cousin, Sajida Talfah. Some sources have said he was born in 1965, while others have said it was either 1967 or 1968. He was widely described to be a family man and an attorney in training.

He married loma Maher Abd al-Rashid; the daughter of Maher Abd al-Rashid, a top-ranking military official, and had four children: a daughter named Moj (born 1987) and sons Mustafa (1989–2003), Adnan (born 1991), Saddam (born 1997).
Qusay reportedly played a role in crushing the Shia uprising in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War and is also thought to have masterminded the destruction of the southern marshes of Iraq. The wholesale destruction of these marshes ended a centuries-old way of life that prevailed among the Shia Marsh Arabs who made the wetlands their home, and ruined the habitat for dozens of species of migratory birds. The Iraqi government stated that the action was intended to produce usable farmland, though a number of outsiders believe the destruction was aimed at the Marsh Arabs as retribution for their participation in the 1991 uprising.

Qusay was said to have been in charge of concealing chemical weapons from international inspectors. 

Uday was viewed as their father&#x27;s heir apparent until he sustained serious injuries in a 1996 assassination attempt. Unlike Uday, who was known for extravagance and erratic, violent behavior, Qusay kept a low profile.

Iraqi dissidents claimed that Qusay was responsible for the killing of many political activists. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Qusay Hussein ordered the killing of Khalis Mohsen al-Tikriti, an engineer at the military industrialization organization, because he believed Mohsen was planning to leave Iraq. In 1998, Iraqi opposition groups accused Qusay of ordering the execution of thousands of political prisoners, after hundreds of inmates were similarly executed to make room for new prisoners in crowded jails.

Hussein&#x27;s service in the Iraqi Republican Guard began around 2000. He had the final say in many military decisions unless Saddam intervened. It is believed that he became the supervisor of the Guard and the head of internal security forces (possibly the Special Security Organization), and had authority over other Iraqi military units.

Despite his cunning, Iraq&#x27;s Defense minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tai claimed that Qusay “knew nothing [about commanding military]. He understood only simple military things like a civilian. We prepared information and advice for him, and he&#x27;d accept it or not.”

Hours before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Qusay withdrew approximately $1 billion from the Iraqi central bank in Baghdad, acting on personal orders from Saddam. He arrived at the bank in Baghdad at 4am on 18 March, hours before the first US strikes, seized around $900 million in $100 bills and the equivalent of $100 million in euros, loaded them into three tractor-trailers, and left. This was considered the largest bank heist in history until 2011.

===Assassination attempt===
On 1 August 2002, Qusay was shot by members of the Iraqi National Congress during a motorcade journey. He received injuries to his arm. He was said to have survived a previous assassination attempt in 2001.

==Death==

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s closest aide and personal secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddam&#x27;s two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back. According to the smuggler who took them across the border, they came again after less than 48 hours. They said to the smuggler: &quot;A Syrian citizen will be waiting for a call from them and my mission is limited to bring them to the borders, not inside Syria.&quot; The smuggler said, &quot;They sought refuge with some of their acquaintances near the Rabia border center, and they already reached the outskirts of the city of Aleppo, and there, after replacing the broken tires of their car, the Syrian authorities, who ordered their return to Iraq, stopped them. Abd Hammoud was not staying with them, but he visited them for four days and on the fourth day they left the house. Accompanying Abid Hamid towards Mosul, there Uday and Qusay took refuge in the house of Nawaf al-Zaidan, joined by Mustafa Qusay, who was staying with his grandfather, Maher Abdul-Rashid. On 16 July 2003, he met with Qusay again, asked if he had an intention to get out of Iraq, to which Qusay replied, &#x27;This is no longer possible. I will stay in Iraq awaiting the instructions of the father.&#x27; During their time at the villa, the sheikh reportedly left Uday and Qusay playing video games for weeks. Seven days later, Uday, Qusay, Qusay&#x27;s 14-year-old son Mustafa, and their companion Abdul-Samad were killed.&quot; Abdul Halim Khaddam, the former vice-president of Syria, revealed that his country handed over the half-brother of Saddam Hussein to the American forces. They also deported the sons of the ousted president to Iraq and refused to receive the former foreign minister, Tariq Aziz.

On the afternoon of 22 July 2003, troops of the 101st Airborne 3/327th Infantry HQ and C-Company, aided by U.S. Special Forces, killed Qusay Hussein, his 14-year-old son Mustafa, his older brother Uday Hussein and a bodyguard during a raid on a house in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Acting on a tip provided the previous day from Nawaf al-Zaidan, an alleged cousin and friend of Saddam Hussein who had been sheltering the four in his home for numerous weeks, a special forces team attempted to apprehend everyone in the house at the time. After being fired upon, the special forces moved back and called for backup. After Task Force 121 members were wounded, the 3/327th Infantry surrounded and fired on the house with a TOW missile, Mk 19 grenade launcher, M2 machine guns and small arms. After about five hours of battle (the whole operation lasted 6 hours), the soldiers entered the house and found four dead, including the two brothers and their bodyguard. There were reports that Qusay Hussein&#x27;s 14-year-old son Mustafa was the fourth body found. Brigadier General Frank Helmick, the assistant commander of 101st Airborne, commented that all occupants of the house died during the gun battle before U.S. troops were able to enter.

Soldiers, who tried to enter the house three times, encountered small arms fire and grenades in the first two attempts. Uday, Qusay, and their guard protected the street and the first floor from the bathroom at the front of the house; Qusay&#x27;s son took cover from the bedroom in the back. The American forces then bombed the house many times and even fired missiles. Three adults were thought to have died due to the TOW missile fired into the front of the house. In the third attempt, the soldiers killed Qusay&#x27;s son after he fired at them.

Brigade commander Colonel Joe Anderson said an Arabic announcement was made at 10 A.M. on the day and called on people inside to come out peacefully. In response, the occupants opened fire. An experienced team of commandos tried to attack the building, but they had to retreat under fire. Four American soldiers were injured. Anderson then ordered his men to fire with 50-caliber heavy machine guns. Uday and Qusay Hussein refused to surrender even after a helicopter fired a rocket and the Strike Brigade fired 40mm grenades at them. The Colonel decided that more firepower was necessary to take down the brothers, leading to 12 TOW missiles being fired into the building.

After his sons&#x27; death, Saddam Hussein recorded a tape and said, &quot;Beloved Iraqis, your brothers Uday and Qusay, and Mustafa, the son of Qusay, took a stand of faith, which pleases God, makes a friend happy, and makes an enemy angry. They stood in the arena of jihad in Mosul, after a valiant battle with the enemy that lasted six hours. The armies of aggression mobilised all types of weapons of the ground forces against them and succeeded to harm them only when they used planes against the house where they were. Thus, they adopted a stand with which God has honoured this Hussein family so that the present would be a continuation of the brilliant, genuine, faithful, and honourable past. We thank God for what he has ordained for us when he honoured us with their martyrdom for his sake. We ask Almighty God to satisfy them and all the righteous martyrs after they satisfied him with their faithful Jihadist stand. Had Saddam Hussein had 100 children, other than Uday and Qusay, Saddam Hussein would have sacrificed them on the same path. God honoured us by their martyrdom. If you had killed Uday, Qusay, Mustafa, and another mujahideen man with them, all the youths of our nation and the youths of Iraq are Uday, Qusay, and Mustafa in the fields of jihad.&quot;

On 23 July 2003, the American command stated that it had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons from dental records. Because many Iraqis were skeptical of news of the deaths, the U.S. Government released photos of the corpses and allowed Iraq&#x27;s governing council to identify the bodies despite the U.S. objection to the publication of American corpses on Arab television. Both brothers had grown long beards to avoid detection. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians. For example, Qusay Hussein&#x27;s beard was shaved and gashes from the battle were removed. Qusay Hussein was the ace of clubs in the coalition forces&#x27; most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. His father was the ace of spades, and his brother was the ace of hearts.

The U.S. government also announced that the informant (possibly the owner of the villa, Nawaf al-Zaidan, in Mosul in which the brothers were killed) would receive the combined $30 million reward previously offered for their apprehension.

Qusay Hussein&#x27;s two other sons, Yahya Qusay and Yaqub Qusay, are presumed alive, but their whereabouts are unknown.

In 2017, his nephew Massoud claimed his body was stolen by the Iranian government although this was unproven.

<doc id="25263" wikidata="Q570948" url="?curid=25263" title="Quatrain">
<text>A quatrain is a type of stanza, or a complete poem, consisting of four lines.

Existing in a variety of forms, the quatrain appears in poems from the poetic traditions of various ancient civilizations including Persia, Ancient India, Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, and China, and continues into the 21st century, where it is seen in works published in many languages. 

This form of poetry has been continually popular in Iran since the medieval period, as Ruba&#x27;is form; an important faction of the vast repertoire of Persian poetry, with famous poets such as Omar Khayyam and Mahsati Ganjavi of Seljuk Persia writing poetry only in this format.

Michel de Nostredame (Nostradamus) used the quatrain form to deliver his famous &quot;prophecies&quot; in the 16th century.

There are fifteen possible rhyme schemes, but the most traditional and common are ABAA, AAAA, ABAB, and ABBA.

==Forms==
*The heroic stanza or elegiac stanza consists of the iambic pentameter, with the rhyme scheme of ABAB.
An example can be found in the following of Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd wind slowly o&#x27;er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
&lt;/poem&gt;
*The hymnal stanza consists of alternating rhymes with the iambic trimeter and the iambic tetrameter, with a rhyme scheme of ABCB.
An example can be found in Robert Burns, &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot;.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
O, my luve’s like a red, red rose,
That&#x27;s newly sprung in June;
O, my luve’s like the melodie
That&#x27;s sweetly played in tune.
&lt;/poem&gt;
*The memoriam stanza consists of the iambic tetrameter and a rhyme scheme of ABBA.
An example can be found in Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
So word by word, and line by line,
The dead man touch’d me from the past,
And all at once it seem’d at last
The living soul was flash’d on mine.
&lt;/poem&gt;
*An envelope stanza is when the same stanza starts and ends a poem with little change of wording, although this term is also used on stanzas that have a symmetrical rhyme scheme of ABBA.
An example can be found in William Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Tyger&quot;. (These are the first and last stanzas of the poem) 
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
In the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
Tyger Tyger burning bright,
In the forests of the night:
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry
&lt;/poem&gt;
*The ballad stanza consists of the iambic tetrameter with a rhyme scheme of ABCB (see ballad stanza for more details).
An example can be found in “La Belle Dame sans Merci” by John Keats.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
I saw pale kings and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
Thee hath in thrall!’
&lt;/poem&gt;
*The Ruba&#x27;i form of rhymed quatrain was favored by Persian-language poet Omar Khayyám, among others. This work was a major inspiration for Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;. The &quot;ruba&#x27;i&quot; was a particularly widespread verse form: the form &quot;rubaiyat&quot; reflects the plural. One of FitzGerald&#x27;s verses may serve to illustrate:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:3em&quot;&gt;
Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring
Your Winter garment of Repentance fling:
The Bird of Time has but a little way
To flutter—and the Bird is on the Wing.
&lt;/poem&gt;
*The Midnight Songs poetry form is from Fourth Century China, consisting of regular five-character lines, with each quatrain formed from a pair of rhymed couplets. The person matter involves the personal thoughts and feelings of a courtesan during the four seasons, into which the quatrains are individually assigned.
*Shairi (also known as Rustavelian Quatrain) is an AAAA rhyming form used mainly in &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot;.
*The Shichigon-zekku form used on Classical Chinese poetry and Japanese poetry. This type of quatrain uses a seven-character line length. Both rhyme and rhythm are key elements, although the former is not restricted to falling at the end of the phrase.
*Ballad meter (The examples from &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot; and &quot;The Wife of Usher&#x27;s Well&quot; are both examples of ballad meter.)
*Decasyllabic quatrain used by John Dryden in &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot;, William Davenant in &quot;Gondibert&quot;, and Thomas Gray
*Various hymns employ specific forms, such as the &quot;common meter&quot;, &quot;long meter&quot;, and &quot;short meter&quot;.
*In the Malay tradition, syair, pantun and pantoum are arranged in quatrains.

<text>In theoretical physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the study of the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons. Quarks are fundamental particles that make up composite hadrons such as the proton, neutron and pion. QCD is a type of quantum field theory called a non-abelian gauge theory, with symmetry group SU(3). The QCD analog of electric charge is a property called &quot;color&quot;. Gluons are the force carriers of the theory, just as photons are for the electromagnetic force in quantum electrodynamics. The theory is an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics. A large body of experimental evidence for QCD has been gathered over the years.

QCD exhibits three salient properties:
* Color confinement. Due to the force between two color charges remaining constant as they are separated, the energy grows until a quark–antiquark pair is spontaneously produced, turning the initial hadron into a pair of hadrons instead of isolating a color charge. Although analytically unproven, color confinement is well established from lattice QCD calculations and decades of experiments.
* Asymptotic freedom, a steady reduction in the strength of interactions between quarks and gluons as the energy scale of those interactions increases (and the corresponding length scale decreases). The asymptotic freedom of QCD was discovered in 1973 by David Gross and Frank Wilczek, and independently by David Politzer in the same year. For this work, all three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics.
*Chiral symmetry breaking, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an important global symmetry of quarks, detailed below, with the result of generating masses for hadrons far above the masses of the quarks, and making pseudoscalar mesons exceptionally light. Yoichiro Nambu was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for elucidating the phenomenon in 1960, a dozen years before the advent of QCD. Lattice simulations have confirmed all his generic predictions.

==Terminology==
Physicist Murray Gell-Mann coined the word &quot;quark&quot; in its present sense. It originally comes from the phrase &quot;Three quarks for Muster Mark&quot; in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce. On June 27, 1978, Gell-Mann wrote a private letter to the editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, in which he related that he had been influenced by Joyce&#x27;s words: &quot;The allusion to three quarks seemed perfect.&quot; (Originally, only three quarks had been discovered.)

The three kinds of charge in QCD (as opposed to one in quantum electrodynamics or QED) are usually referred to as &quot;color charge&quot; by loose analogy to the three kinds of color (red, green and blue) perceived by humans. Other than this nomenclature, the quantum parameter &quot;color&quot; is completely unrelated to the everyday, familiar phenomenon of color.

The force between quarks is known as the colour force (or color force) or strong interaction, and is responsible for the nuclear force.

Since the theory of electric charge is dubbed &quot;electrodynamics&quot;, the Greek word (, &quot;color&quot;) is applied to the theory of color charge, &quot;chromodynamics&quot;.

==History==

With the invention of bubble chambers and spark chambers in the 1950s, experimental particle physics discovered a large and ever-growing number of particles called hadrons. It seemed that such a large number of particles could not all be fundamental. First, the particles were classified by charge and isospin by Eugene Wigner and Werner Heisenberg; then, in 1953–56, according to strangeness by Murray Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko Nishijima (see Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula). To gain greater insight, the hadrons were sorted into groups having similar properties and masses using the &quot;eightfold way&quot;, invented in 1961 by Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne&#x27;eman. Gell-Mann and George Zweig, correcting an earlier approach of Shoichi Sakata, went on to propose in 1963 that the structure of the groups could be explained by the existence of three flavors of smaller particles inside the hadrons: the quarks. Gell-Mann also briefly discussed a field theory model in which quarks interact with gluons.

Perhaps the first remark that quarks should possess an additional quantum number was made as a short footnote in the preprint of Boris Struminsky in connection with the Ω− hyperon being composed of three strange quarks with parallel spins (this situation was peculiar, because since quarks are fermions, such a combination is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle):
Boris Struminsky was a PhD student of Nikolay Bogolyubov. The problem considered in this preprint was suggested by Nikolay Bogolyubov, who advised Boris Struminsky in this research. In the beginning of 1965, Nikolay Bogolyubov, Boris Struminsky and Albert Tavkhelidze wrote a preprint with a more detailed discussion of the additional quark quantum degree of freedom. This work was also presented by Albert Tavkhelidze without obtaining consent of his collaborators for doing so at an international conference in Trieste (Italy), in May 1965.

A similar mysterious situation was with the Δ++ baryon; in the quark model, it is composed of three up quarks with parallel spins. In 1964–65, Greenberg and Han–Nambu independently resolved the problem by proposing that quarks possess an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom, later called color charge. Han and Nambu noted that quarks might interact via an octet of vector gauge bosons: the gluons.

Since free quark searches consistently failed to turn up any evidence for the new particles, and because an elementary particle back then was &quot;defined&quot; as a particle that could be separated and isolated, Gell-Mann often said that quarks were merely convenient mathematical constructs, not real particles. The meaning of this statement was usually clear in context: He meant quarks are confined, but he also was implying that the strong interactions could probably not be fully described by quantum field theory.

Richard Feynman argued that high energy experiments showed quarks are real particles: he called them &quot;partons&quot; (since they were parts of hadrons). By particles, Feynman meant objects that travel along paths, elementary particles in a field theory.

The difference between Feynman&#x27;s and Gell-Mann&#x27;s approaches reflected a deep split in the theoretical physics community. Feynman thought the quarks have a distribution of position or momentum, like any other particle, and he (correctly) believed that the diffusion of parton momentum explained diffractive scattering. Although Gell-Mann believed that certain quark charges could be localized, he was open to the possibility that the quarks themselves could not be localized because space and time break down. This was the more radical approach of S-matrix theory.

James Bjorken proposed that pointlike partons would imply certain relations in deep inelastic scattering of electrons and protons, which were verified in experiments at SLAC in 1969. This led physicists to abandon the S-matrix approach for the strong interactions.

In 1973 the concept of color as the source of a &quot;strong field&quot; was developed into the theory of QCD by physicists Harald Fritzsch and Heinrich Leutwyler, together with physicist Murray Gell-Mann. In particular, they employed the general field theory developed in 1954 by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills (see Yang–Mills theory), in which the carrier particles of a force can themselves radiate further carrier particles. (This is different from QED, where the photons that carry the electromagnetic force do not radiate further photons.)

The discovery of asymptotic freedom in the strong interactions by David Gross, David Politzer and Frank Wilczek allowed physicists to make precise predictions of the results of many high energy experiments using the quantum field theory technique of perturbation theory. Evidence of gluons was discovered in three-jet events at PETRA in 1979. These experiments became more and more precise, culminating in the verification of perturbative QCD at the level of a few percent at LEP, at CERN.

The other side of asymptotic freedom is confinement. Since the force between color charges does not decrease with distance, it is believed that quarks and gluons can never be liberated from hadrons. This aspect of the theory is verified within lattice QCD computations, but is not mathematically proven. One of the Millennium Prize Problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute requires a claimant to produce such a proof. Other aspects of non-perturbative QCD are the exploration of phases of quark matter, including the quark–gluon plasma.

==Theory==

===Some definitions===

Every field theory of particle physics is based on certain symmetries of nature whose existence is deduced from observations. These can be
*local symmetries, which are the symmetries that act independently at each point in spacetime. Each such symmetry is the basis of a gauge theory and requires the introduction of its own gauge bosons.
*global symmetries, which are symmetries whose operations must be simultaneously applied to all points of spacetime.

QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory (or Yang–Mills theory) of the SU(3) gauge group obtained by taking the color charge to define a local symmetry.

Since the strong interaction does not discriminate between different flavors of quark, QCD has approximate flavor symmetry, which is broken by the differing masses of the quarks.

There are additional global symmetries whose definitions require the notion of chirality, discrimination between left and right-handed. If the spin of a particle has a positive projection on its direction of motion then it is called right-handed; otherwise, it is left-handed. Chirality and handedness are not the same, but become approximately equivalent at high energies.
*Chiral symmetries involve independent transformations of these two types of particle.
*Vector symmetries (also called diagonal symmetries) mean the same transformation is applied on the two chiralities.
*Axial symmetries are those in which one transformation is applied on left-handed particles and the inverse on the right-handed particles.

===Additional remarks: duality===
As mentioned, &quot;asymptotic freedom&quot; means that at large energy – this corresponds also to &quot;short distances&quot; – there is practically no interaction between the particles. This is in contrast – more precisely one would say &quot;dual&quot;– to what one is used to, since usually one connects the absence of interactions with &quot;large&quot; distances. However, as already mentioned in the original paper of Franz Wegner, a solid state theorist who introduced 1971 simple gauge invariant lattice models, the high-temperature behaviour of the &quot;original model&quot;, e.g. the strong decay of correlations at large distances, corresponds to the low-temperature behaviour of the (usually ordered!) &quot;dual model&quot;, namely the asymptotic decay of non-trivial correlations, e.g. short-range deviations from almost perfect arrangements, for short distances. Here, in contrast to Wegner, we have only the dual model, which is that one described in this article.

===Symmetry groups===
The color group SU(3) corresponds to the local symmetry whose gauging gives rise to QCD. The electric charge labels a representation of the local symmetry group U(1), which is gauged to give QED: this is an abelian group. If one considers a version of QCD with &quot;Nf&quot; flavors of massless quarks, then there is a global (chiral) flavor symmetry group SUL(&quot;Nf&quot;) × SUR(&quot;Nf&quot;) × UB(1) × UA(1). The chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken by the QCD vacuum to the vector (L+R) SUV(&quot;Nf&quot;) with the formation of a chiral condensate. The vector symmetry, UB(1) corresponds to the baryon number of quarks and is an exact symmetry. The axial symmetry UA(1) is exact in the classical theory, but broken in the quantum theory, an occurrence called an anomaly. Gluon field configurations called instantons are closely related to this anomaly.

There are two different types of SU(3) symmetry: there is the symmetry that acts on the different colors of quarks, and this is an exact gauge symmetry mediated by the gluons, and there is also a flavor symmetry that rotates different flavors of quarks to each other, or &quot;flavor SU(3)&quot;. Flavor SU(3) is an approximate symmetry of the vacuum of QCD, and is not a fundamental symmetry at all. It is an accidental consequence of the small mass of the three lightest quarks.

In the QCD vacuum there are vacuum condensates of all the quarks whose mass is less than the QCD scale. This includes the up and down quarks, and to a lesser extent the strange quark, but not any of the others. The vacuum is symmetric under SU(2) isospin rotations of up and down, and to a lesser extent under rotations of up, down, and strange, or full flavor group SU(3), and the observed particles make isospin and SU(3) multiplets.

The approximate flavor symmetries do have associated gauge bosons, observed particles like the rho and the omega, but these particles are nothing like the gluons and they are not massless. They are emergent gauge bosons in an approximate string description of QCD.

=== Lagrangian ===
The dynamics of the quarks and gluons are defined by the quantum chromodynamics Lagrangian. The gauge invariant QCD Lagrangian is

where formula_1 is the quark field, a dynamical function of spacetime, in the fundamental representation of the SU(3) gauge group, indexed by formula_2 and formula_3 running from formula_4 to formula_5; formula_6 is the Dirac adjoint of formula_7; formula_8 is the gauge covariant derivative; the γμ are Gamma matrices connecting the spinor representation to the vector representation of the Lorentz group.

Herein, the gauge covariant derivative formula_9couples the quark field with a coupling strength formula_10to the gluon fields via the infinitesimal SU(3) generators formula_11in the fundamental representation. An explicit representation of these generators is given by formula_12, wherein the formula_13are the Gell-Mann matrices.

The symbol formula_14 represents the gauge invariant gluon field strength tensor, analogous to the electromagnetic field strength tensor, &quot;F&quot;μν, in quantum electrodynamics. It is given by:

:formula_15

where formula_16 are the gluon fields, dynamical functions of spacetime, in the adjoint representation of the SU(3) gauge group, indexed by &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; running from formula_4 to formula_18; and &quot;fabc&quot; are the structure constants of SU(3) (the generators of the adjoint representation). Note that the rules to move-up or pull-down the &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;c&quot; indices are &quot;trivial&quot;, (+, ..., +), so that &quot;fabc&quot; = &quot;fabc&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;bc&quot; whereas for the &quot;μ&quot; or &quot;ν&quot; indices one has the non-trivial &quot;relativistic&quot; rules corresponding to the metric signature (+ − − −).

The variables &quot;m&quot; and &quot;g&quot; correspond to the quark mass and coupling of the theory, respectively, which are subject to renormalization.

An important theoretical concept is the &quot;Wilson loop&quot; (named after Kenneth G. Wilson). In lattice QCD, the final term of the above Lagrangian is discretized via Wilson loops, and more generally the behavior of Wilson loops can distinguish confined and deconfined phases.

===Fields===
Quarks are massive spin- fermions that carry a color charge whose gauging is the content of QCD. Quarks are represented by Dirac fields in the fundamental representation 3 of the gauge group SU(3). They also carry electric charge (either − or +) and participate in weak interactions as part of weak isospin doublets. They carry global quantum numbers including the baryon number, which is for each quark, hypercharge and one of the flavor quantum numbers.

Gluons are spin-1 bosons that also carry color charges, since they lie in the adjoint representation 8 of SU(3). They have no electric charge, do not participate in the weak interactions, and have no flavor. They lie in the singlet representation 1 of all these symmetry groups.

Each type of quark has a corresponding antiquark, of which the charge is exactly opposite. They transform in the conjugate representation to quarks, denoted formula_19.

===Dynamics===
According to the rules of quantum field theory, and the associated Feynman diagrams, the above theory gives rise to three basic interactions: a quark may emit (or absorb) a gluon, a gluon may emit (or absorb) a gluon, and two gluons may directly interact. This contrasts with QED, in which only the first kind of interaction occurs, since photons have no charge. Diagrams involving Faddeev–Popov ghosts must be considered too (except in the unitarity gauge).

===Area law and confinement===
Detailed computations with the above-mentioned Lagrangian show that the effective potential between a quark and its anti-quark in a meson contains a term that increases in proportion to the distance between the quark and anti-quark (formula_20), which represents some kind of &quot;stiffness&quot; of the interaction between the particle and its anti-particle at large distances, similar to the entropic elasticity of a rubber band (see below). This leads to &quot;confinement&quot;  of the quarks to the interior of hadrons, i.e. mesons and nucleons, with typical radii &quot;R&quot;c, corresponding to former &quot;Bag models&quot; of the hadrons The order of magnitude of the &quot;bag radius&quot; is 1 fm (= 10−15 m). Moreover, the above-mentioned stiffness is quantitatively related to the so-called &quot;area law&quot; behavior of the expectation value of the Wilson loop product &quot;P&quot;W of the ordered coupling constants around a closed loop &quot;W&quot;; i.e. formula_21 is proportional to the &quot;area&quot; enclosed by the loop. For this behavior the non-abelian behavior of the gauge group is essential.

==Methods==
Further analysis of the content of the theory is complicated. Various techniques have been developed to work with QCD. Some of them are discussed briefly below.

===Perturbative QCD===

This approach is based on asymptotic freedom, which allows perturbation theory to be used accurately in experiments performed at very high energies. Although limited in scope, this approach has resulted in the most precise tests of QCD to date.

===Lattice QCD===
Among non-perturbative approaches to QCD, the most well established is lattice QCD. This approach uses a discrete set of spacetime points (called the lattice) to reduce the analytically intractable path integrals of the continuum theory to a very difficult numerical computation that is then carried out on supercomputers like the QCDOC, which was constructed for precisely this purpose. While it is a slow and resource-intensive approach, it has wide applicability, giving insight into parts of the theory inaccessible by other means, in particular into the explicit forces acting between quarks and antiquarks in a meson. However, the numerical sign problem makes it difficult to use lattice methods to study QCD at high density and low temperature (e.g. nuclear matter or the interior of neutron stars).

===1/&quot;N&quot; expansion===

A well-known approximation scheme, the expansion, starts from the idea that the number of colors is infinite, and makes a series of corrections to account for the fact that it is not. Until now, it has been the source of qualitative insight rather than a method for quantitative predictions. Modern variants include the AdS/CFT approach.

===Effective theories===
For specific problems, effective theories may be written down that give qualitatively correct results in certain limits. In the best of cases, these may then be obtained as systematic expansions in some parameters of the QCD Lagrangian. One such effective field theory is chiral perturbation theory or ChiPT, which is the QCD effective theory at low energies. More precisely, it is a low energy expansion based on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of QCD, which is an exact symmetry when quark masses are equal to zero, but for the u, d and s quark, which have small mass, it is still a good approximate symmetry. Depending on the number of quarks that are treated as light, one uses either SU(2) ChiPT or SU(3) ChiPT. Other effective theories are heavy quark effective theory (which expands around heavy quark mass near infinity), and soft-collinear effective theory (which expands around large ratios of energy scales). In addition to effective theories, models like the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model and the chiral model are often used when discussing general features.

===QCD sum rules===
Based on an Operator product expansion one can derive sets of relations that connect different observables with each other.

==Experimental tests==
The notion of quark flavors was prompted by the necessity of explaining the properties of hadrons during the development of the quark model. The notion of color was necessitated by the puzzle of the . This has been dealt with in the section on the history of QCD.

The first evidence for quarks as real constituent elements of hadrons was obtained in deep inelastic scattering experiments at SLAC. The first evidence for gluons came in three-jet events at PETRA.

Several good quantitative tests of perturbative QCD exist:
* The running of the QCD coupling as deduced from many observations
* Scaling violation in polarized and unpolarized deep inelastic scattering
* Vector boson production at colliders (this includes the Drell–Yan process)
* Direct photons produced in hadronic collisions
* Jet cross sections in colliders
* Event shape observables at the LEP
* Heavy-quark production in colliders

Quantitative tests of non-perturbative QCD are fewer, because the predictions are harder to make. The best is probably the running of the QCD coupling as probed through lattice computations of heavy-quarkonium spectra. There is a recent claim about the mass of the heavy meson Bc . Other non-perturbative tests are currently at the level of 5% at best. Continuing work on masses and form factors of hadrons and their weak matrix elements are promising candidates for future quantitative tests. The whole subject of quark matter and the quark–gluon plasma is a non-perturbative test bed for QCD that still remains to be properly exploited.

One qualitative prediction of QCD is that there exist composite particles made solely of gluons called glueballs that have not yet been definitively observed experimentally. A definitive observation of a glueball with the properties predicted by QCD would strongly confirm the theory. In principle, if glueballs could be definitively ruled out, this would be a serious experimental blow to QCD. But, as of 2013, scientists are unable to confirm or deny the existence of glueballs definitively, despite the fact that particle accelerators have sufficient energy to generate them.

==Cross-relations to condensed matter physics==
There are unexpected cross-relations to condensed matter physics. For example, the notion of gauge invariance forms the basis of the well-known Mattis spin glasses, which are systems with the usual spin degrees of freedom formula_22 for &quot;i&quot; =1...,N, with the special fixed &quot;random&quot; couplings formula_23 Here the εi and εk quantities can independently and &quot;randomly&quot; take the values ±1, which corresponds to a most-simple gauge transformation formula_24 This means that thermodynamic expectation values of measurable quantities, e.g. of the energy formula_25 are invariant.

However, here the &quot;coupling degrees of freedom&quot; formula_26, which in the QCD correspond to the &quot;gluons&quot;, are &quot;frozen&quot; to fixed values (quenching). In contrast, in the QCD they &quot;fluctuate&quot; (annealing), and through the large number of gauge degrees of freedom the entropy plays an important role (see below).

For positive &quot;J&quot;0 the thermodynamics of the Mattis spin glass corresponds in fact simply to a &quot;ferromagnet in disguise&quot;, just because these systems have no &quot;frustration&quot; at all. This term is a basic measure in spin glass theory. Quantitatively it is identical with the loop product formula_27 along a closed loop &quot;W&quot;. However, for a Mattis spin glass – in contrast to &quot;genuine&quot; spin glasses – the quantity &quot;PW&quot; never becomes negative.

The basic notion &quot;frustration&quot; of the spin-glass is actually similar to the Wilson loop quantity of the QCD. The only difference is again that in the QCD one is dealing with SU(3) matrices, and that one is dealing with a &quot;fluctuating&quot; quantity. Energetically, perfect absence of frustration should be non-favorable and atypical for a spin glass, which means that one should add the loop product to the Hamiltonian, by some kind of term representing a &quot;punishment&quot;. In the QCD the Wilson loop is essential for the Lagrangian rightaway.

The relation between the QCD and &quot;disordered magnetic systems&quot; (the spin glasses belong to them) were additionally stressed in a paper by Fradkin, Huberman and Shenker, which also stresses the notion of duality.

A further analogy consists in the already mentioned similarity to polymer physics, where, analogously to Wilson loops, so-called &quot;entangled nets&quot; appear, which are important for the formation of the entropy-elasticity (force proportional to the length) of a rubber band. The non-abelian character of the SU(3) corresponds thereby to the non-trivial &quot;chemical links&quot;, which glue different loop segments together, and &quot;asymptotic freedom&quot; means in the polymer analogy simply the fact that in the short-wave limit, i.e. for formula_28 (where &quot;Rc&quot; is a characteristic correlation length for the glued loops, corresponding to the above-mentioned &quot;bag radius&quot;, while λw is the wavelength of an excitation) any non-trivial correlation vanishes totally, as if the system had crystallized.

There is also a correspondence between confinement in QCD – the fact that the color field is only different from zero in the interior of hadrons – and the behaviour of the usual magnetic field in the theory of type-II superconductors: there the magnetism is confined to the interior of the Abrikosov flux-line lattice, i.e., the London penetration depth &quot;λ&quot; of that theory is analogous to the confinement radius &quot;Rc&quot; of quantum chromodynamics. Mathematically, this correspondendence is supported by the second term, formula_29 on the r.h.s. of the Lagrangian.

<text>In computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as &quot;enqueue&quot;, and the operation of removing an element from the front is known as &quot;dequeue&quot;. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a &quot;peek&quot; or &quot;front&quot; operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection.
Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes. 

A queue has two ends, the top, which is the only position at which the push operation may occur, and the bottom, which is the only position at which the pop operation may occur. A queue may be implemented as circular buffers and linked lists, or by using both the stack pointer and the base pointer.

Queues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer.
Another usage of queues is in the implementation of breadth-first search.

==Queue implementation==
Theoretically, one characteristic of a queue is that it does not have a specific capacity. Regardless of how many elements are already contained, a new element can always be added. It can also be empty, at which point removing an element will be impossible until a new element has been added again.

Fixed-length arrays are limited in capacity, but it is not true that items need to be copied towards the head of the queue. The simple trick of turning the array into a closed circle and letting the head and tail drift around endlessly in that circle makes it unnecessary to ever move items stored in the array. If n is the size of the array, then computing indices modulo n will turn the array into a circle. This is still the conceptually simplest way to construct a queue in a high-level language, but it does admittedly slow things down a little, because the array indices must be compared to zero and the array size, which is comparable to the time taken to check whether an array index is out of bounds, which some languages do, but this will certainly be the method of choice for a quick and dirty implementation, or for any high-level language that does not have pointer syntax. The array size must be declared ahead of time, but some implementations simply double the declared array size when overflow occurs. Most modern languages with objects or pointers can implement or come with libraries for dynamic lists. Such data structures may have not specified a fixed capacity limit besides memory constraints. Queue &quot;overflow&quot; results from trying to add an element onto a full queue and queue &quot;underflow&quot; happens when trying to remove an element from an empty queue.

A &quot;bounded queue&quot; is a queue limited to a fixed number of items.

There are several efficient implementations of FIFO queues. An efficient implementation is one that can perform the operations—en-queuing and de-queuing—in O(1) time.
*Linked list
**A doubly linked list has O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends, so it is a natural choice for queues.
**A regular singly linked list only has efficient insertion and deletion at one end. However, a small modification—keeping a pointer to the &quot;last&quot; node in addition to the first one—will enable it to implement an efficient queue.
*A deque implemented using a modified dynamic array

===Queues and programming languages===
Queues may be implemented as a separate data type, or maybe considered a special case of a double-ended queue (deque) and not implemented separately. For example, Perl and Ruby allow pushing and popping an array from both ends, so one can use push and shift functions to enqueue and dequeue a list (or, in reverse, one can use unshift and pop), although in some cases these operations are not efficient.

C++&#x27;s Standard Template Library provides a &quot;codice_1&quot; templated class which is restricted to only push/pop operations. Since J2SE5.0, Java&#x27;s library contains a interface that specifies queue operations; implementing classes include and (since J2SE 1.6) . PHP has an SplQueue class and third party libraries like beanstalk&#x27;d and Gearman.

===Example===
A simple queue implemented in JavaScript:
class Queue {
 constructor() {
 this.items = [];

 enqueue(element) {
 this.items.push(element);

 dequeue() {
 return this.items.shift();
}
==Purely functional implementation==
Queues can also be implemented as a purely functional data structure. There are two implementations. The first one only achieves formula_1 per operation &quot;on average&quot;. That is, the amortized time is formula_1, but individual operations can take formula_3 where &quot;n&quot; is the number of elements in the queue. The second implementation is called a real-time queue and it allows the queue to be persistent with operations in O(1) worst-case time. It is a more complex implementation and requires lazy lists with memoization. 

===Amortized queue===

This queue&#x27;s data is stored in two singly-linked lists named formula_4 and formula_5. The list formula_4 holds the front part of the queue. The list formula_5 holds the remaining elements (a.k.a., the rear of the queue) &quot;in reverse order&quot;. It is easy to insert into the front of the queue by adding a node at the head of formula_4. And, if formula_5 is not empty, it is easy to remove from the end of the queue by removing the node at the head of formula_5. When formula_5 is empty, the list formula_4 is reversed and assigned to formula_5 and then the head of formula_5 is removed. 

The insert (&quot;enqueue&quot;) always takes formula_1 time. The removal (&quot;dequeue&quot;) takes formula_1 when the list formula_5 is not empty. When formula_5 is empty, the reverse takes formula_3 where formula_20 is the number of elements in formula_4. But, we can say it is formula_1 amortized time, because every element in formula_4 had to be inserted and we can assign a constant cost for each element in the reverse to when it was inserted. 

===Real-time queue===

The real-time queue achieves formula_1 time for all operations, without amortization. This discussion will be technical, so recall that, for formula_25 a list, formula_26 denotes its length, that &quot;NIL&quot; represents an empty list and formula_27 represents the list whose head is &quot;h&quot; and whose tail is &quot;t&quot;.

The data structure used to implement our queues consists of three singly-linked lists formula_28 where &quot;f&quot; is the front of the queue and &quot;r&quot; is the rear of the queue in reverse order. The invariant of the structure is that &quot;s&quot; is the rear of &quot;f&quot; without its formula_29 first elements, that is formula_30. The tail of the queue formula_31 is then almost formula_28 and
inserting an element &quot;x&quot; to formula_28 is almost formula_34. It is said almost, because in both of those results, formula_35. An auxiliary function formula_36 must then be called for the invariant to be satisfied. Two cases must be considered, depending on whether formula_37 is the empty list, in which case formula_38, or not. The formal definition is formula_39 and formula_40 where formula_41 is &quot;f&quot; followed by &quot;r&quot; reversed.

Let us call formula_42 the function which returns &quot;f&quot; followed by &quot;r&quot; reversed. Let us furthermore assume that formula_38, since it is the case when this function is called. More precisely, we define a lazy function formula_44 which takes as input three lists such that formula_38, and return the concatenation of &quot;f&quot;, of &quot;r&quot; reversed and of &quot;a&quot;. Then formula_46.
The inductive definition of rotate is formula_47 and formula_48. Its running time is formula_49, but, since lazy evaluation is used, the computation is delayed until the results are forced by the computation.

The list &quot;s&quot; in the data structure has two purposes. This list serves as a counter for formula_50, indeed, formula_51 if and only if &quot;s&quot; is the empty list. This counter allows us to ensure that the rear is never longer than the front list. Furthermore, using &quot;s&quot;, which is a tail of &quot;f&quot;, forces the computation of a part of the (lazy) list &quot;f&quot; during each &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;insert&quot; operation. Therefore, when formula_51, the list &quot;f&quot; is totally forced. If it was not the case, the internal representation of &quot;f&quot; could be some append of append of... of append, and forcing would not be a constant time operation anymore.

<doc id="25266" wikidata="Q217423" url="?curid=25266" title="Quake (video game)">
<text>Quake is a first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by GT Interactive in 1996. The first game in the &quot;Quake&quot; series, it was originally released for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, followed by Mac OS, Linux and Sega Saturn in 1997 and Nintendo 64 in 1998.

The game&#x27;s plot is centered around teleportation experiments, dubbed slipgates, which have resulted in an unforeseen invasion of Earth by a hostile force codenamed Quake, which commands a vast army of monsters. The player takes the role of a soldier (later dubbed Ranger), whose mission is to travel through the slipgates in order to find and destroy the source of the invasion. The game is split between futuristic military bases and medieval, gothic environments, featuring both science fiction and fantasy weaponry and enemies as the player battles possessed soldiers and demonic beasts such as ogres or armor-clad knights. &quot;Quake&quot; heavily takes inspiration from gothic fiction and in particular the works of H. P. Lovecraft. The game went through many revisions during development, and had originally been inspired by a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign held among id Software staff.

The successor to id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; series, &quot;Quake&quot; built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor. Unlike the &quot;Doom&quot; engine before it, the &quot;Quake&quot; engine offered full real-time 3D rendering and had early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL. After &quot;Doom&quot; helped popularize multiplayer deathmatches, &quot;Quake&quot; added various multiplayer options. Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update and software such as QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable. &quot;Quake&quot; featured music composed by Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails.

&quot;Quake&quot; is often cited as one of the best video games ever made. Despite its critical acclaim, &quot;Quake&quot;″s development was controversial in the history of id Software. Due to creative differences and a lack of leadership, the majority of the team left the company after the game&#x27;s release, including co-founder John Romero. An &quot;enhanced&quot; version of &quot;Quake&quot; was developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One consoles in August 2021, including the original game&#x27;s first two expansions and two episodes developed by MachineGames. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were released in October 2021.

==Gameplay==
===Single-player===
In &quot;Quake&quot; single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, &quot;Nightmare&quot;, was described by the game manual to be &quot;so bad that the entry is hidden, so people won&#x27;t wander in by accident&quot;.

&quot;Quake&quot; single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a &quot;low gravity&quot; level that challenges the player&#x27;s abilities in a different way). If the player&#x27;s character dies, they must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub &quot;START&quot; level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of &quot;Quake&quot;) has the most traditional layout with a boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the &quot;END&quot; level which contains a final puzzle.

===Multiplayer===
In multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player&#x27;s computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one duels, or organized teamplay with two or more players per team (or clan). Players frequently implement mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.

The gameplay in &quot;Quake&quot; was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game. Bunny hopping or strafe jumping allow faster movement, while rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to &quot;Quake&quot;″s appeal. Multiplayer &quot;Quake&quot; was one of the first games singled out as a form of electronic sport. A notable participant was Dennis Fong, who won John Carmack&#x27;s Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.

==Synopsis==
In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the protagonist, unnamed in &quot;Quake&quot; but referred to as Ranger in later games (voiced by Trent Reznor), who is sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy code-named &quot;Quake&quot;. The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a &quot;Slipgate&quot;; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the &quot;Human&quot; dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.

The sole surviving protagonist in &quot;Operation Counterstrike&quot; is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger&#x27;s main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of &quot;Quake&quot;; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.

The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or &quot;maps&quot;, divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game&#x27;s final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through the Slipgate or magical portals (in the case of the latter three episodes) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of gothic, medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of &quot;Doom&quot; (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game&#x27;s setting is inspired by dark fantasy influences, including H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the &quot;Spawn&quot; enemies are called &quot;Formless Spawn of Tsathoggua&quot; in the manual, the boss of the first episode is named Chthon, the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath and is explicitly stated to be an Old One, and the four episodes all have Lovecraftian names.

==Development==
===Design===
&quot;Quake&quot;&#x27;s development was troubled, and the game went through several incarnations over the course of its development.

====&quot;The Fight for Justice&quot; (1990-91)====
In the early 1990s, the staff at id Software had a private &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game, which would go on to inspire a number of elements in their titles over the following years. With John Carmack as DM, the campaign featured a group of adventurers named the Silver Shadow Band. The group were named for the silver dragon on which they flew, and each represented one of the core stats of the game. Among them was a powerful character named Quake, representing strength, who fought with a magic hammer capable of destroying buildings. Quake was accompanied by a floating magic artefact named the Hellgate Cube which attacked his foes with lightning bolts. John Romero described fighting alongside Quake as the most fun they had playing &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. The Silver Shadow Band did &quot;contract work for Justice, an even more powerful group&quot;. The original campaign concluded in early 1992, after Romero&#x27;s character made a deal with a demon, exchanging a book called the Demonomicron for a magic sword called the Daikatana, which resulted in a demonic invasion that wiped out the Material Plane.

A preview included with id Software&#x27;s first release, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, advertised a game entitled &quot;The Fight for Justice&quot; as a follow-up to the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, &quot;the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent&quot;, armed with thunderbolts and a &quot;Ring of Regeneration&quot;. Conceived as a VGA full-color side-scrolling role-playing video game, &quot;The Fight for Justice&quot; was never released. The team briefly explored making the project in 1991 but abandoned the idea as the technology for it simply did not exist at the time. The project was only in development for about two weeks.

====As a melee action game (1994-95)====
A return to the &quot;Quake&quot; concept was raised by John Romero in a meeting in late 1994, when discussing the next engine and main project after the completion of &quot;Doom II&quot;. Newer members of the team, including American McGee and Sandy Petersen, had not been present for the original D&amp;D campaign or game project, but were on board with the idea after it was explained to them, and the team was then in agreement about the broad direction of the title. In a December 1, 1994, post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, &quot;Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say &quot;action&quot;? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout – probably more so than Doom&quot;.

The team entered into an R&amp;D phase while Carmack was working on the engine. By 1995, the outline for the game included a medieval setting, hand-to-hand combat, thrown weapons, an area of effect attack with the hammer, and feeding souls to the Hellgate Cube. Some early information on &quot;Quake&quot; was released publicly, focusing on a Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer. A close up of Quake holding his hammer was on the cover of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; for the October 1995 issue, and screenshots showed medieval environments and a dragon. Romero revealed in 2023 that the dragon model was never actually implemented, and had simply been placed in the sky for the screenshot. The plan was for the game to have more role-playing-style elements. An &quot;Aztec&quot; style texture set was developed for the project, but the set was not used due to artistic opposition from American McGee, who preferred a more heavy metal themed look for his levels. This second texture set was used for the Vaults of Zin.

Before gameplay could be worked on in earnest, Carmack would need to build the game engine which was a significant undertaking, and took much longer than anticipated. Carmack was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model. Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things- the networking model first, used for a game which was otherwise in the &quot;Doom II&quot; engine, and then the 3D overhaul for a second title. The &quot;Quake&quot; engine popularized several major advances in the genre: polygonal models instead of prerendered sprites; full 3D level design instead of a 2.5D map; prerendered lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with QuakeC), which popularized fan-created modifications (mods).

====As a first person shooter (1995-96)====
Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers. Around fifty levels were developed during the R&amp;D process, but engine changes meant that the team was frequently having to redo work. Much of this needed to be scrapped by the time the engine was completed in late 1995. The team was burned out from the process, and raised the idea of using the existing demo levels for a first person shooter, as it would be faster and less risky. Romero opposed the change, but relented. The creative differences would ultimately lead to his departure from the company after completing &quot;Quake&quot;.

&quot;Quake&quot; was programmed by John Carmack, Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by American McGee, Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud and Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using Alias. Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a gun-butt. Shortly before release this was replaced with an axe. id Software released &quot;QTest&quot; on February 24, 1996, a technology demo limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions. &quot;QTest&quot; gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.

Morale on the project was low, and developers were under crunch from December 1995 through to release in June 1996. Romero has described the process as one of the hardest grinds of his career. He was the only member of the team to attend the office on launch day to upload the files.

=== Audio ===
&quot;Quake&quot;″s music and sound design was done by Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the &quot;Quake&quot; soundtrack &quot;is not music[;] it&#x27;s textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It&#x27;s been fun.&quot; The game includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the &quot;Nailgun&quot; and &quot;Super Nailgun&quot; decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.

The idea to use Nine Inch Nails for the soundtrack was raised by American McGee, who had been listening to their album &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; during his work on the game. Romero was initially skeptical as he had envisioned a more ambient tone, but was open to the idea of the band composing with that tone in mind. id approached the band&#x27;s agents, and the group had agreed to do the soundtrack by the following day as they were &quot;Doom&quot; fans and excited by the project. McGee handled the delivery of the soundtrack from there on. A legal issue that rose late in development with the record company meant that the code to play the audio from the CD was among the final changes made before release.

Some digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original shareware release. The 2021 enhanced version includes the soundtrack.

===Source ports===
====VQuake====
In late 1996, id Software released VQuake, a source port of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine to support hardware accelerated rendering on graphics cards using the Rendition Vérité chipset. Aside from the expected benefit of improved performance, VQuake offered numerous visual improvements over the original software-rendered &quot;Quake&quot;. It boasted full 16-bit color, bilinear filtering (reducing pixelation), improved dynamic lighting, optional anti-aliasing, and improved source code clarity, as the improved performance finally allowed the use of gotos to be abandoned in favor of proper loop constructs. As the name implied, VQuake was a proprietary source port specifically for the Vérité; consumer 3D acceleration was in its infancy at the time, and there was no standard 3D API for the consumer market. After completing VQuake, John Carmack vowed to never write a proprietary port again, citing his frustration with Rendition&#x27;s Speedy3D API.

====QuakeWorld====
To improve the quality of online play, id Software released QuakeWorld in December 1996, a build of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine that featured significantly revamped network code including the addition of client-side prediction. The original &quot;Quake&quot; network code would not show the player the results of their actions until the server sent back a reply acknowledging them. For example, if the player attempted to move forward, the client would send the request to move forward to the server, and the server would determine whether the client was actually able to move forward or if it ran into an obstacle, such as a wall or another player. The server would then respond to the client, and only then would the client display movement to the player. This was fine for play on a LAN, a high bandwidth, very low latency connection, but the latency over a dial-up Internet connection is much larger than on a LAN, and this caused a noticeable delay between when a player tried to act and when that action was visible on the screen. This made gameplay much more difficult, especially since the unpredictable nature of the Internet made the amount of delay vary from moment to moment. Players would experience jerky, laggy motion that sometimes felt like ice skating, where they would slide around with seemingly no ability to stop, due to a build-up of previously sent movement requests. John Carmack has admitted that this was a serious problem that should have been fixed before release, but it was not caught because he and other developers had high-speed Internet access at home.

After months of private beta testing, QuakeWorld, written by John Carmack with help from John Cash and Christian Antkow, was released on December 13, 1996. The client portion followed on December 17. Official id Software development stopped with the test release of QuakeWorld 2.33 on December 21, 1998. The last official stable release was 2.30. QuakeWorld has been described by IGN as the first popular first-person shooter meant to be played online.

With the help of client-side prediction, which allowed players to see their own movement immediately without waiting for a response from the server, QuakeWorld&#x27;s network code allowed players with high-latency connections to control their character&#x27;s movement almost as precisely as when playing in single-player mode. The Netcode parameters could be adjusted by the user so that &quot;QuakeWorld&quot; performed well for users with high and low latency. The trade off to client-side prediction was that sometimes other players or objects would no longer be quite where they had appeared to be, or, in extreme cases, that the player would be pulled back to a previous position when the client received a late reply from the server which overrode movement the client had already previewed; this was known as &quot;warping&quot;. As a result, some serious players, particularly in the U.S., still preferred to play online using the original &quot;Quake&quot; engine (commonly called NetQuake) rather than QuakeWorld. However, the majority of players, especially those on dial-up connections, preferred the newer network model, and QuakeWorld soon became the dominant form of online play. Following the success of QuakeWorld, client-side prediction has become a standard feature of nearly all real-time online games. As with all other &quot;Quake&quot; upgrades, QuakeWorld was released as a free, unsupported add-on to the game and was updated numerous times through 1998.

In January 1997 an independant developer, Nick Maher, developed a version of the Quake World master server (called QuakeWorld Local) that could be run on a LAN without an Internet connection. The software tracked player statistics over time and allowed international players without a QuakeWorld server on their continent, or without Internet access at all, to enjoy the new client.

====GLQuake====
On January 22, 1997, id Software released the first beta of GLQuake. This was designed to use the OpenGL 3D API to access hardware 3D graphics acceleration cards to rasterize the graphics, rather than having the computer&#x27;s CPU fill in every pixel. In addition to higher framerates for most players, GLQuake provided higher resolution modes and texture filtering. GLQuake also experimented with reflections, transparent water, and even rudimentary shadows. GLQuake came with a driver enabling the subset of OpenGL used by the game to function on the 3dfx Voodoo Graphics card, the only consumer-level card at the time capable of running GLQuake well. Previously, John Carmack had experimented with a version of &quot;Quake&quot; specifically written for the Rendition Vérité chip used in the Creative Labs PCI 3D Blaster card. This version had met with only limited success, and Carmack decided to write for generic APIs in the future rather than tailoring for specific hardware.

====WinQuake====
On March 11, 1997, id Software released WinQuake, a version of the non-OpenGL engine designed to run under Microsoft Windows; the original &quot;Quake&quot; had been written for MS-DOS, allowing for launch from Windows 95, but could not run under Windows NT-based operating systems because it needed direct access to hardware. WinQuake instead accessed hardware via Win32-based APIs such as DirectSound, DirectInput, and DirectDraw that were supported on Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0 and later releases. Like GLQuake, WinQuake also allowed higher resolution video modes. This removed the last barrier to widespread popularity of the game.

====vkQuake====
On July 20, 2016, Axel Gneiting, an id Tech employee responsible for implementing the Vulkan rendering path to the id Tech 6 engine used in &quot;Doom&quot; (2016), released a source port called vkQuake under the GPLv2.

==Release==
===Ports===
&quot;Quake&quot; was ported to multiple platforms. The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor using X11 on July 5, 1996, followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. An SVGAlib port for Linux was created by programmer Greg Alexander in 1997 using leaked source code but was later mainlined by id, unlike similar unofficial ports for OS/2, Amiga, Java VMs, and Mac OS. The first commercially released port was for Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port&#x27;s release, leading to MacSoft&#x27;s involvement) in late August 1997. ClickBOOM announced a version for Amiga-computers in 1998. Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the two existing add-ons as &quot;Quake: The Offering&quot;.

&quot;Quake&quot; was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself, but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by Sega. Sega took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent frame rate, and assigned it to Lobotomy Software. The Saturn port was developed with Softimage 3D and uses Lobotomy Software&#x27;s 3D engine, &quot;SlaveDriver&quot; (also used in &quot;PowerSlave&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; for the Saturn). It is the only version of &quot;Quake&quot; rated &quot;T&quot; for Teen instead of &quot;M&quot; for Mature.

&quot;Quake&quot; was ported to the PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the company was not able to find a publisher for it. A port for the Atari Jaguar was reported as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of &quot;Ultimate Future Games&quot; magazine, but it was never released. A port of &quot;Quake&quot; was planned for Panasonic M2 prior to cancellation of the system.

On March 24, 1998, the game was released for the Nintendo 64 by Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on &quot;Doom 64&quot;, at id Software&#x27;s request. The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.

Both console ports required compromises because of the limited CPU power and ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU. The Saturn version omits the four secret levels from the original PC version of the game, replacing them with four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell&#x27;s Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, &quot;Dank &amp; Scuz&quot;, which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Saturn version. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto, The Installation, The Ebon Fortress, The Wind Tunnels, The Sewage System, and Hell&#x27;s Atrium. It also does not use the hub map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order. The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, as well as an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death.

In 1998, LBE Systems and Lazer-Tron released a prototype titled &quot;Quake: Arcade Tournament Edition&quot; in the arcades in limited quantities. R-Comp Interactive published the game for RISC OS as &quot;Quake Resurrection&quot; in 1999, including the total conversion &quot;Malice&quot; and expansion &quot;Q!Zone&quot;, although community-made source ports such as ArcQuake were also available.

An unreleased Game Boy Advance port of &quot;Quake&quot; was in development from Randy Linden in 2002, and was pitched to id Software in that year. The port was rejected by the company, and Linden&#x27;s work would remain unused until prototypes of his work were dumped in June 2022. Two homebrew ports of &quot;Quake&quot; for the Nintendo DS exist, &quot;QuakeDS&quot; and &quot;CQuake&quot;. Both run well; however, multiplayer does not work on &quot;QuakeDS&quot;. Since the source code for &quot;Quake&quot; was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones. The Rockbox project also distributes a version of &quot;Quake&quot; that runs on some MP3 players.

In 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of &quot;Quake&quot; for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions. Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360. &quot;Quake Mobile&quot; was reviewed by &quot;GameSpot&quot; on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a &quot;Best Mobile Game&quot; in their E3 2005 Editor&#x27;s Choice Awards. It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v, both of which are PDAs, not mobile phones. &quot;Quake Mobile&quot; does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints. &quot;Quake Mobile&quot; runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of &quot;Quake Mobile&quot; is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two &quot;Quake&quot; expansion packs, &quot;Scourge of Armagon&quot; and &quot;Dissolution of Eternity&quot;, are also available for &quot;Quake Mobile&quot;.

A Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs &quot;Quake&quot; at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.

===Enhanced version===
At the launch of the 2021 QuakeCon@Home on August 19, 2021, Bethesda released an &quot;enhanced&quot; version of &quot;Quake&quot; for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, developed by Nightdive Studios. In addition to support for modern systems and improved rendering techniques, the enhanced version includes both mission packs, &quot;Scourge of Armagon&quot; and &quot;Dissolution of Eternity&quot;. It also includes two episodes created by MachineGames: the previously released &quot;Dimension of the Past&quot; and a new one called &quot;Dimension of the Machine&quot;. A port of &quot;Quake 64&quot; was also included in its entirety via the newly implemented &quot;Add-On&quot; menu.

==Additional content==
===Official expansions===
Originally, there were two official expansion packs released for &quot;Quake&quot;. The expansion packs pick up where the first game left off, include all of the same weapons, power-ups, monsters, and gothic atmosphere/architecture, and continue/finish the story of the first game and its protagonist. An unofficial third expansion pack, &quot;Abyss of Pandemonium&quot;, was developed by the Impel Development Team, published by Perfect Publishing, and released on April 14, 1998; an updated version, version 2.0, titled &quot;Abyss of Pandemonium – The Final Mission&quot; was released as freeware. An authorized expansion pack, &quot;Q!ZONE&quot; was developed and published by WizardWorks, and released in 1996. An authorized level editor, &quot;Deathmatch Maker&quot; was developed by Virtus Corporation and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing in 1997. It contained an exclusive Virtus&#x27; Episode. In honor of &quot;Quake&quot;″s 20th anniversary, MachineGames, an internal development studio of ZeniMax Media, who are the current owners of the &quot;Quake&quot; IP, released online a new expansion pack for free, called &quot;Episode 5: Dimension of the Past&quot;.

====&quot;Scourge of Armagon&quot;====
&quot;Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon&quot; was the first official mission pack, released on March 5, 1997. Developed by Hipnotic Interactive, it features three episodes divided into seventeen new single-player levels (three of which are secret), a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack composed by Jeehun Hwang, and gameplay features not originally present in &quot;Quake&quot;, including rotating structures and breakable walls. Unlike the main &quot;Quake&quot; game and Mission Pack No. 2, &quot;Scourge&quot; does away with the episode hub, requiring the three episodes to be played sequentially. The three new enemies include Centroids, large cybernetic scorpions with nailguns; Gremlins, small goblins that can steal weapons and multiply by feeding on enemy corpses; and Spike Mines, floating orbs that detonate when near the player. The three new weapons include the Mjolnir, a large lightning emitting hammer; the Laser Cannon, which shoots bouncing bolts of energy; and the Proximity Mine Launcher, which fires grenades that attach to surfaces and detonate when an opponent comes near. The three new power-ups include the Horn of Conjuring, which summons an enemy to protect the player; the Empathy Shield, which halves the damage taken by the player between the player and the attacking enemy; and the Wetsuit, which renders the player invulnerable to electricity and allows the player to stay underwater for a period of time. The storyline follows Armagon, a general of Quake&#x27;s forces, planning to invade Earth via a portal known as the &#x27;Rift&#x27;. Armagon resembles a giant gremlin with cybernetic legs and a combined rocket launcher/laser cannon for arms.

Tim Soete of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a score 8.6 out of 10.

====&quot;Dissolution of Eternity&quot;====
&quot;Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity&quot; was the second official mission pack, released on March 19, 1997. Developed by Rogue Entertainment, it features two episodes divided into fifteen new single-player levels, a new multiplayer level, a new soundtrack, and several new enemies and bosses. Notably, the pack lacks secret levels. The eight new enemies include Electric Eels, Phantom Swordsmen, Multi-Grenade Ogres (which fire cluster grenades), Hell Spawn, Wraths (floating, robed undead), Guardians (resurrected ancient Egyptian warriors), Mummies, and statues of various enemies that can come to life. The four new types of bosses include Lava Men, Overlords, large Wraths, and a dragon guarding the &quot;temporal energy converter&quot;. The two new power-ups include the Anti Grav Belt, which allows the player to jump higher; and the Power Shield, which lowers the damage the player receives. Rather than offering new weapons, the mission pack gives the player four new types of ammo for existing weapons, such as &quot;lava nails&quot; for the Nailgun, cluster grenades for the Grenade Launcher, rockets that split into four in a horizontal line for the Rocket Launcher, and plasma cells for the Thunderbolt, as well as a grappling hook to help with moving around the levels.

Tim Soete of &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a score of 7.7 out of 10.

====&quot;Dimension of the Past&quot;====
To celebrate &quot;Quake&quot;″s 20th anniversary, a mission pack was developed by MachineGames and released on June 24, 2016. It features 10 new single-player levels and a new multiplayer level, but does not use new gameplay additions from &quot;Scourge of Armagon&quot; and &quot;Dissolution of Eternity&quot;. Chronologically, it is set between the main game and the first two expansions.

====&quot;Dimension of the Machine&quot;====
The fourth mission pack, &quot;Dimension of the Machine&quot;, was released as part of the enhanced version of &quot;Quake&quot; released on August 19, 2021.

===Community content===
&quot;Quake&quot; can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan-created modifications, known as mods. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in &quot;Quake&quot; fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software&#x27;s original release.

The first major &quot;Quake&quot; mod was &quot;Team Fortress&quot;. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter &quot;Soldier&quot; class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the &quot;Scout&quot; class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one&#x27;s flag in &quot;Threewave CTF&quot; would return the flag to the base, and in &quot;TF&quot; the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to &quot;Threewave CTF&quot;. &quot;Team Fortress&quot; maintained its standing as the most-played online &quot;Quake&quot; modification for many years. After the developers joined Valve, &quot;Team Fortress&quot; was ported to the GoldSrc engine as &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;. It later received a sequel, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, for which content continues to be developed.

Another popular mod was &quot;Threewave Capture the Flag&quot; (CTF), primarily authored by Dave &#x27;Zoid&#x27; Kirsch. &quot;Threewave CTF&quot; is a partial conversion consisting of new levels, a new weapon (a grappling hook), power-ups, new textures, and new gameplay rules. Typically, two teams (red and blue) would compete in a game of Capture the flag, though a few maps with up to four teams (red, blue, green, and yellow) were created. Capture the Flag soon became a standard game mode included in most popular multiplayer games released after &quot;Quake&quot;.
&quot;Rocket Arena&quot; provides the ability for players to face each other in small, open arenas with changes in the gameplay rules so that item collection and detailed level knowledge are no longer factors. A series of short rounds, with the surviving player in each round gaining a point, instead tests the player&#x27;s aiming and dodging skills and reflexes. &quot;Clan Arena&quot; is a further modification that provides team play using &quot;Rocket Arena&quot; rules. One mod category, &quot;bots&quot;, was introduced to provide surrogate players in multiplayer mode.

&quot;Arcane Dimensions&quot; is a single-player mod. It is a partial conversion with breakable objects and walls, enhanced particle system, numerous visual improvements and new enemies and weapons. The level design is much more complex in terms of geometry and gameplay than in the original game.

There are a large number of custom levels that have been made by users and fans of &quot;Quake&quot;. , new maps are still being made, over 20 years since the game&#x27;s release. Custom maps are new maps that are playable by loading them into the original game. Custom levels of various gameplay types have been made, but most are in the single-player and deathmatch genres. More than 1500 single-player and a similar number of deathmatch maps have been made for &quot;Quake&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Quake&quot; was critically acclaimed on the PC. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the original PC version 93% and 94/100, and the Nintendo 64 port 76% and 74/100. A &quot;Next Generation&quot; critic lauded the game&#x27;s realistic 3D physics and genuinely unnerving sound effects. &quot;GamePro&quot; said &quot;Quake&quot; had been over-hyped but is excellent nonetheless, particularly its usage of its advanced 3D engine. The review also praised the sound effects, atmospheric music, and graphics, though it criticized that the polygons used to construct the enemies are too obvious at close range.

Less than a month after &quot;Quake&quot; was released (and a month before they actually reviewed the game), &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 9 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it is similar to &quot;Doom&quot; but supports a maximum of eight players instead of four. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Quake&quot; the 36th-best computer game ever released, and listed &quot;telefragged&quot; as #1 on its list of &quot;the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming&quot;. In 1997, the Game Developers Choice Awards gave Quake three spotlight awards for Best Sound Effects, Best Music or Soundtrack and Best On-Line/Internet Game.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game a B+ and called it &quot;an extended bit of subterranean mayhem that offers three major improvements over its immediate predecessor [&quot;Doom&quot;].&quot; He identified these as the graphics, the audio design, and the amount of violent action.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Though replay value is limited by the lack of interactive environments or even the semblance of a plot, there&#x27;s no doubt that &quot;Quake&quot; and its engine are something powerful and addictive.&quot;

The Saturn version received mostly negative reviews, as critics generally agreed that it did not bring over the elements that make the game enjoyable. In particular, critics reviled the absence of the multiplayer mode, which they felt had eclipsed the single player campaign as the reason to play &quot;Quake&quot;. Kraig Kujawa wrote in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;&quot;Quake&quot; is not a great one-player game - it gained its notoriety on the Net as a multiplayer.&quot; and his co-reviewer Sushi-X concluded &quot;Without multiplayer, I&#x27;d pass.&quot; Most reviews also said the controls are much worse than the PC original, in particular the difficulty of aiming at enemies without the benefit of either mouse-controlled camera or a second analog stick. &quot;GamePro&quot; noted that the graphics are very pixelated and blurry, to the point where people unfamiliar with &quot;Quake&quot; would not be able to discern what they&#x27;re looking at. They concluded, &quot;&quot;Quake&quot; may not be the worst Saturn game available, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t live up to its PC heritage.&quot; Most critics did find the port technically impressive, particularly the added light sourcing. However, &quot;Next Generation&quot; pointed out that &quot;Porting &quot;Quake&quot; to a console is nothing more than an excuse for bragging rights. It&#x27;s simply a way to show that the limited architecture of a 32-bit system has the power to push the same game that those mighty Pentium PCs take for granted.&quot; Even Rich Leadbetter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot;, which gave the port a 92%, acknowledged that it was a proverbial dancing bear, noting several conspicuous compromises the port made and stating as his concluding argument, &quot;Look, it&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; on the Saturn - the machine has no right to be doing this!&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; opined that the game&#x27;s lack of plot makes the single-player campaign feel too shallow and lacking in motivation to appeal to most gamers. Most critics compared the port unfavorably to the Saturn version of &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; (which came out just a few months earlier), mainly in terms of gameplay.

Reviews for the Nintendo 64 version praised its lighting effects and smooth frame rate in single-player mode. &quot;IGN&quot; added the caveats that the environments are simplified from the PC version and the pre-rendered light sourcing is less impressive than the real-time light sourcing of the Saturn version, but judged the visuals overall to be superior to those of the unaccelerated PC version. &quot;GamePro&quot; went so far as to say the graphics are as clean as those of GLQuake, while &quot;Next Generation&quot; was more moderate, concluding that &quot;As a whole, &quot;Quake 64&quot; doesn&#x27;t live up to the experience offered by the high-end, 3D-accelerated PC version; it is, however, an entertaining gaming experience that is worthy of a close look and a nice addition to the blossoming number of first-person shooters for Nintendo 64.&quot; Most reviews found fault with the multiplayer, stating that the frame rate takes a hit in this mode, some of the levels are too large with only two players present, and the game should have supported four players, as previous Nintendo 64 shooters &quot;&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; did. However, &quot;Next Generation&quot; pointed out that on the Nintendo 64, &quot;Quake&quot; with four players would inevitably have meant a severely compromised frame rate and small view screen. &quot;GameSpot&quot; also felt the multiplayer was fun despite its limitations, and noted that setting up a deathmatch was quicker and easier on the Nintendo 64 than on PC. Reviewers sharply differed over the controls, with &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot; all describing them as precise, responsive, and intuitive, while &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot; complained that finding the right control required fiddling with the settings and even at best felt lacking compared to a keyboard-and-mouse setup. Reviews generally concluded that while the Nintendo 64 version would not appeal to &quot;Quake&quot; veterans due to its multiplayer shortcomings and lack of exclusive content, it was a strong enough conversion for non-PC gamers to enjoy the &quot;Quake&quot; experience.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;For those who don&#x27;t have LAN or internet capabilities, check out arcade &quot;Quake&quot;. It&#x27;s a blast.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 28th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;one of the most addictive, adaptable, and pulse-pounding 3D shooters ever created&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Quake&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time.

===Enhanced version===
&quot;Nintendo Life&quot; gave the Switch version a rave review, saying it &quot;wisely avoids tinkering with the magic formula that made the game so great in the first place, instead keeping the look and feel of the original intact whilst carefully adding all manner of modern bells and whistles in a feature-packed port that&#x27;s an absolute dream to spend time with.&quot; They particularly praised the level designs, puzzle elements, atmospheric game world, and numerous configuration options for the graphical upgrades and multiplayer sessions. They argued that the smooth performance in both docked and handheld mode and ability to play the game as portable makes the Switch version the definitive version of the game.

===Sales===
According to David Kushner in &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, id Software released a retail shareware version of &quot;Quake&quot; before the game&#x27;s full retail distribution by GT Interactive. These shareware copies could be converted into complete versions through passwords purchased via phone. However, Kushner wrote that &quot;gamers wasted no time hacking the shareware to unlock the full version of the game for free.&quot; This problem, combined with the scale of the operation, led id Software to cancel the plan. As a result, the company was left with 150,000 unsold shareware copies in storage. The venture damaged &quot;Quake&quot;″s initial sales and caused its retail push by GT Interactive to miss the holiday shopping season. Following the game&#x27;s full release, Kushner remarked that its early &quot;sales were good — with 250,000 units shipped — but not a phenomenon like &quot;Doom II&quot;.&quot;

In the United States, &quot;Quake&quot; placed sixth on PC Data&#x27;s monthly computer game sales charts for November and December 1996. Its shareware edition was the sixth-best-selling computer game of 1996 overall, while its retail SKU claimed 20th place. The shareware version sold 393,575 copies and grossed $3,005,519 (~$ in ) in the United States during 1996. It remained in PC Data&#x27;s monthly top 10 from January to April 1997, but was absent by May. During its first 12 months, &quot;Quake&quot; sold 373,000 retail copies and earned $18 million in the United States, according to PC Data. Its final retail sales for 1997 were 273,936 copies, which made it the country&#x27;s 16th-highest computer game seller for the year.

In 1997, id estimated that there may be as many as 5 million copies of Quake circulating. The game sold over 1.4 million copies by December 1997. Sales of &quot;Quake&quot; reached 550,000 units in the United States alone by December 1999.

==Legacy==
The source code of &quot;Quake&quot; was released on December 22, 1999. The id Software maps, objects, textures, sounds, and other creative works remain under their original proprietary license. The shareware distribution of &quot;Quake&quot; is still freely redistributable and usable with the GPLed engine code. One must purchase a copy of &quot;Quake&quot; in order to receive the registered version of the game which includes more single-player episodes and the deathmatch maps. Based on the success of the first &quot;Quake&quot; game, &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, and &quot;Quake 4&quot; were published, with &quot;Quake 4&quot; being developed by Raven Software using the &quot;Doom 3&quot; engine.

&quot;Quake&quot; was the game primarily responsible for the emergence of the machinima artform of films made in game engines, thanks to edited &quot;Quake&quot; demos such as &quot;Ranger Gone Bad&quot; and &quot;Blahbalicious&quot;, the in-game film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Covenant&quot;, and the in-game-rendered, four-hour epic film &quot;The Seal of Nehahra&quot;. On June 22, 2006, it had been ten years since the original uploading of the game to cdrom.com archives. Many Internet forums had topics about it, and it was a front-page story on Slashdot. On October 11, 2006, John Romero released the original map files for all of the levels in &quot;Quake&quot;.

&quot;Quake&quot; has four sequels: &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, &quot;Quake 4&quot;, and &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot;. In 2002, a version of &quot;Quake&quot; was produced for mobile phones. A copy of &quot;Quake&quot; was also released as a compilation in 2001, labeled &quot;Ultimate Quake&quot;, which included the original &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; which was published by Activision. In 2008, &quot;Quake&quot; was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of user modifiable games. John Carmack accepted the award. Years after its original release, &quot;Quake&quot; is still regarded by many critics as one of the greatest and most influential games ever made.

===Speedrunning===
As an example of the dedication that &quot;Quake&quot; has inspired in its fan community, a group of expert players recorded speedrun demos (replayable recordings of the player&#x27;s movement) of &quot;Quake&quot; levels completed in record time on the &quot;Nightmare&quot; skill level. The footage was edited into a continuous 19 minutes, 49 seconds demo called &quot;Quake done Quick&quot; and released on June 10, 1997. Owners of &quot;Quake&quot; could replay this demo in the game engine, watching the run unfold as if they were playing it themselves.

Most full-game speedruns are a collaborative effort by a number of runners (though some have been done by single runners on their own). Although each particular level is credited to one runner, the ideas and techniques used are iterative and collaborative in nature, with each runner picking up tips and ideas from the others, so that speeds keep improving beyond what was thought possible as the runs are further optimized and new tricks or routes are discovered. Further time improvements of the continuous whole game run were achieved into the 21st century. In addition, many thousands of individual level runs are kept at Speed Demos Archive&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; section, including many on custom maps. Speedrunning is a counterpart to multiplayer modes in making &quot;Quake&quot; one of the first games promoted as a virtual sport.

===Changes at id Software===
The release of &quot;Quake&quot; marks the end of the classic line-up at id Software. Due to conflicts and burnout, the majority of the staff resigned from id after the game&#x27;s release including Romero, Abrash, Shawn Green, Jay Wilbur, Petersen and Mike Wilson. Petersen claimed in July 2021 that the lack of a team leader was the cause of it all. He volunteered to take lead as he had five years of experience as project manager in MicroProse, but he was turned down by Carmack. Romero has discussed their relative lack of experience at the time and failure to communicate with one another, and has stated that there is no long-lasting animosity between the staff. Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from &quot;Quake&quot;. In 2000, Romero released &quot;Daikatana&quot;, the game that he envisioned &quot;Quake&quot; being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time, he said &quot;Daikatana&quot; was &quot;more fun to make than &quot;Quake&quot;&quot; due to the lack of creative interference.

===Sequels===
After the departure of Sandy Petersen, the remaining id employees chose to change the thematic direction substantially for &quot;Quake II&quot;, making the design more technological and futuristic, rather than maintaining the focus on Lovecraftian horror. &quot;Quake 4&quot; followed the design themes of &quot;Quake II&quot;, whereas &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; mixed these styles; it had a parallel setting that housed several &quot;id all-stars&quot; from various games as playable characters. The mixed settings occurred because &quot;Quake II&quot; originally began as a separate product line. The id designers fell back on the project&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Quake II&quot; because the game&#x27;s fast-paced, tactile feel felt closer to a Quake game than a new franchise. Since any sequel to the original &quot;Quake&quot; had already been vetoed, it became a way of continuing the series without continuing the storyline or setting of the first game. In June 2011, John Carmack made an offhand comment that id Software was considering going back to the &quot;...mixed up Cthulhu-ish Quake 1 world and rebooting [in] that direction.&quot;

<text>In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework that combines field theory and the principle of relativity with ideas behind quantum mechanics. QFT is used in particle physics to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles. The current standard model of particle physics is based on QFT.

==History==

Quantum field theory emerged from the work of generations of theoretical physicists spanning much of the 20th century. Its development began in the 1920s with the description of interactions between light and electrons, culminating in the first quantum field theory—quantum electrodynamics. A major theoretical obstacle soon followed with the appearance and persistence of various infinities in perturbative calculations, a problem only resolved in the 1950s with the invention of the renormalization procedure. A second major barrier came with QFT&#x27;s apparent inability to describe the weak and strong interactions, to the point where some theorists called for the abandonment of the field theoretic approach. The development of gauge theory and the completion of the Standard Model in the 1970s led to a renaissance of quantum field theory.

===Theoretical background===
Quantum field theory results from the combination of classical field theory, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. A brief overview of these theoretical precursors follows.

The earliest successful classical field theory is one that emerged from Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, despite the complete absence of the concept of fields from his 1687 treatise &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;. The force of gravity as described by Isaac Newton is an &quot;action at a distance&quot;—its effects on faraway objects are instantaneous, no matter the distance. In an exchange of letters with Richard Bentley, however, Newton stated that &quot;it is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact&quot;. It was not until the 18th century that mathematical physicists discovered a convenient description of gravity based on fields—a numerical quantity (a vector in the case of gravitational field) assigned to every point in space indicating the action of gravity on any particle at that point. However, this was considered merely a mathematical trick.

Fields began to take on an existence of their own with the development of electromagnetism in the 19th century. Michael Faraday coined the English term &quot;field&quot; in 1845. He introduced fields as properties of space (even when it is devoid of matter) having physical effects. He argued against &quot;action at a distance&quot;, and proposed that interactions between objects occur via space-filling &quot;lines of force&quot;. This description of fields remains to this day.

The theory of classical electromagnetism was completed in 1864 with Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which described the relationship between the electric field, the magnetic field, electric current, and electric charge. Maxwell&#x27;s equations implied the existence of electromagnetic waves, a phenomenon whereby electric and magnetic fields propagate from one spatial point to another at a finite speed, which turns out to be the speed of light. Action-at-a-distance was thus conclusively refuted.

Despite the enormous success of classical electromagnetism, it was unable to account for the discrete lines in atomic spectra, nor for the distribution of blackbody radiation in different wavelengths. Max Planck&#x27;s study of blackbody radiation marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. He treated atoms, which absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation, as tiny oscillators with the crucial property that their energies can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, values. These are known as quantum harmonic oscillators. This process of restricting energies to discrete values is called quantization. Building on this idea, Albert Einstein proposed in 1905 an explanation for the photoelectric effect, that light is composed of individual packets of energy called photons (the quanta of light). This implied that the electromagnetic radiation, while being waves in the classical electromagnetic field, also exists in the form of particles.

In 1913, Niels Bohr introduced the Bohr model of atomic structure, wherein electrons within atoms can only take on a series of discrete, rather than continuous, energies. This is another example of quantization. The Bohr model successfully explained the discrete nature of atomic spectral lines. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed the hypothesis of wave–particle duality, that microscopic particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties under different circumstances. Uniting these scattered ideas, a coherent discipline, quantum mechanics, was formulated between 1925 and 1926, with important contributions from Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac, and Wolfgang Pauli.

In the same year as his paper on the photoelectric effect, Einstein published his theory of special relativity, built on Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetism. New rules, called Lorentz transformations, were given for the way time and space coordinates of an event change under changes in the observer&#x27;s velocity, and the distinction between time and space was blurred. It was proposed that all physical laws must be the same for observers at different velocities, i.e. that physical laws be invariant under Lorentz transformations.

Two difficulties remained. Observationally, the Schrödinger equation underlying quantum mechanics could explain the stimulated emission of radiation from atoms, where an electron emits a new photon under the action of an external electromagnetic field, but it was unable to explain spontaneous emission, where an electron spontaneously decreases in energy and emits a photon even without the action of an external electromagnetic field. Theoretically, the Schrödinger equation could not describe photons and was inconsistent with the principles of special relativity—it treats time as an ordinary number while promoting spatial coordinates to linear operators.

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Quantum field theory naturally began with the study of electromagnetic interactions, as the electromagnetic field was the only known classical field as of the 1920s.

Through the works of Born, Heisenberg, and Pascual Jordan in 1925–1926, a quantum theory of the free electromagnetic field (one with no interactions with matter) was developed via canonical quantization by treating the electromagnetic field as a set of quantum harmonic oscillators. With the exclusion of interactions, however, such a theory was yet incapable of making quantitative predictions about the real world.

In his seminal 1927 paper &quot;The quantum theory of the emission and absorption of radiation&quot;, Dirac coined the term quantum electrodynamics (QED), a theory that adds upon the terms describing the free electromagnetic field an additional interaction term between electric current density and the electromagnetic vector potential. Using first-order perturbation theory, he successfully explained the phenomenon of spontaneous emission. According to the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, quantum harmonic oscillators cannot remain stationary, but they have a non-zero minimum energy and must always be oscillating, even in the lowest energy state (the ground state). Therefore, even in a perfect vacuum, there remains an oscillating electromagnetic field having zero-point energy. It is this quantum fluctuation of electromagnetic fields in the vacuum that &quot;stimulates&quot; the spontaneous emission of radiation by electrons in atoms. Dirac&#x27;s theory was hugely successful in explaining both the emission and absorption of radiation by atoms; by applying second-order perturbation theory, it was able to account for the scattering of photons, resonance fluorescence and non-relativistic Compton scattering. Nonetheless, the application of higher-order perturbation theory was plagued with problematic infinities in calculations.

In 1928, Dirac wrote down a wave equation that described relativistic electrons: the Dirac equation. It had the following important consequences: the spin of an electron is 1/2; the electron &quot;g&quot;-factor is 2; it led to the correct Sommerfeld formula for the fine structure of the hydrogen atom; and it could be used to derive the Klein–Nishina formula for relativistic Compton scattering. Although the results were fruitful, the theory also apparently implied the existence of negative energy states, which would cause atoms to be unstable, since they could always decay to lower energy states by the emission of radiation.

The prevailing view at the time was that the world was composed of two very different ingredients: material particles (such as electrons) and quantum fields (such as photons). Material particles were considered to be eternal, with their physical state described by the probabilities of finding each particle in any given region of space or range of velocities. On the other hand, photons were considered merely the excited states of the underlying quantized electromagnetic field, and could be freely created or destroyed. It was between 1928 and 1930 that Jordan, Eugene Wigner, Heisenberg, Pauli, and Enrico Fermi discovered that material particles could also be seen as excited states of quantum fields. Just as photons are excited states of the quantized electromagnetic field, so each type of particle had its corresponding quantum field: an electron field, a proton field, etc. Given enough energy, it would now be possible to create material particles. Building on this idea, Fermi proposed in 1932 an explanation for beta decay known as Fermi&#x27;s interaction. Atomic nuclei do not contain electrons &quot;per se&quot;, but in the process of decay, an electron is created out of the surrounding electron field, analogous to the photon created from the surrounding electromagnetic field in the radiative decay of an excited atom.

It was realized in 1929 by Dirac and others that negative energy states implied by the Dirac equation could be removed by assuming the existence of particles with the same mass as electrons but opposite electric charge. This not only ensured the stability of atoms, but it was also the first proposal of the existence of antimatter. Indeed, the evidence for positrons was discovered in 1932 by Carl David Anderson in cosmic rays. With enough energy, such as by absorbing a photon, an electron-positron pair could be created, a process called pair production; the reverse process, annihilation, could also occur with the emission of a photon. This showed that particle numbers need not be fixed during an interaction. Historically, however, positrons were at first thought of as &quot;holes&quot; in an infinite electron sea, rather than a new kind of particle, and this theory was referred to as the Dirac hole theory. QFT naturally incorporated antiparticles in its formalism.

===Infinities and renormalization===
Robert Oppenheimer showed in 1930 that higher-order perturbative calculations in QED always resulted in infinite quantities, such as the electron self-energy and the vacuum zero-point energy of the electron and photon fields, suggesting that the computational methods at the time could not properly deal with interactions involving photons with extremely high momenta. It was not until 20 years later that a systematic approach to remove such infinities was developed.

A series of papers was published between 1934 and 1938 by Ernst Stueckelberg that established a relativistically invariant formulation of QFT. In 1947, Stueckelberg also independently developed a complete renormalization procedure. Such achievements were not understood and recognized by the theoretical community.

Faced with these infinities, John Archibald Wheeler and Heisenberg proposed, in 1937 and 1943 respectively, to supplant the problematic QFT with the so-called S-matrix theory. Since the specific details of microscopic interactions are inaccessible to observations, the theory should only attempt to describe the relationships between a small number of observables (&quot;e.g.&quot; the energy of an atom) in an interaction, rather than be concerned with the microscopic minutiae of the interaction. In 1945, Richard Feynman and Wheeler daringly suggested abandoning QFT altogether and proposed action-at-a-distance as the mechanism of particle interactions.

In 1947, Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford measured the minute difference in the 2&quot;S&quot;1/2 and 2&quot;P&quot;1/2 energy levels of the hydrogen atom, also called the Lamb shift. By ignoring the contribution of photons whose energy exceeds the electron mass, Hans Bethe successfully estimated the numerical value of the Lamb shift. Subsequently, Norman Myles Kroll, Lamb, James Bruce French, and Victor Weisskopf again confirmed this value using an approach in which infinities cancelled other infinities to result in finite quantities. However, this method was clumsy and unreliable and could not be generalized to other calculations.

The breakthrough eventually came around 1950 when a more robust method for eliminating infinities was developed by Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Freeman Dyson, and Shinichiro Tomonaga. The main idea is to replace the calculated values of mass and charge, infinite though they may be, by their finite measured values. This systematic computational procedure is known as renormalization and can be applied to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. As Tomonaga said in his Nobel lecture:Since those parts of the modified mass and charge due to field reactions [become infinite], it is impossible to calculate them by the theory. However, the mass and charge observed in experiments are not the original mass and charge but the mass and charge as modified by field reactions, and they are finite. On the other hand, the mass and charge appearing in the theory are… the values modified by field reactions. Since this is so, and particularly since the theory is unable to calculate the modified mass and charge, we may adopt the procedure of substituting experimental values for them phenomenologically... This procedure is called the renormalization of mass and charge… After long, laborious calculations, less skillful than Schwinger&#x27;s, we obtained a result... which was in agreement with [the] Americans&#x27;.

By applying the renormalization procedure, calculations were finally made to explain the electron&#x27;s anomalous magnetic moment (the deviation of the electron &quot;g&quot;-factor from 2) and vacuum polarization. These results agreed with experimental measurements to a remarkable degree, thus marking the end of a &quot;war against infinities&quot;.

At the same time, Feynman introduced the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and Feynman diagrams. The latter can be used to visually and intuitively organize and to help compute terms in the perturbative expansion. Each diagram can be interpreted as paths of particles in an interaction, with each vertex and line having a corresponding mathematical expression, and the product of these expressions gives the scattering amplitude of the interaction represented by the diagram.

It was with the invention of the renormalization procedure and Feynman diagrams that QFT finally arose as a complete theoretical framework.

===Non-renormalizability===
Given the tremendous success of QED, many theorists believed, in the few years after 1949, that QFT could soon provide an understanding of all microscopic phenomena, not only the interactions between photons, electrons, and positrons. Contrary to this optimism, QFT entered yet another period of depression that lasted for almost two decades.

The first obstacle was the limited applicability of the renormalization procedure. In perturbative calculations in QED, all infinite quantities could be eliminated by redefining a small (finite) number of physical quantities (namely the mass and charge of the electron). Dyson proved in 1949 that this is only possible for a small class of theories called &quot;renormalizable theories&quot;, of which QED is an example. However, most theories, including the Fermi theory of the weak interaction, are &quot;non-renormalizable&quot;. Any perturbative calculation in these theories beyond the first order would result in infinities that could not be removed by redefining a finite number of physical quantities.

The second major problem stemmed from the limited validity of the Feynman diagram method, which is based on a series expansion in perturbation theory. In order for the series to converge and low-order calculations to be a good approximation, the coupling constant, in which the series is expanded, must be a sufficiently small number. The coupling constant in QED is the fine-structure constant , which is small enough that only the simplest, lowest order, Feynman diagrams need to be considered in realistic calculations. In contrast, the coupling constant in the strong interaction is roughly of the order of one, making complicated, higher order, Feynman diagrams just as important as simple ones. There was thus no way of deriving reliable quantitative predictions for the strong interaction using perturbative QFT methods.

With these difficulties looming, many theorists began to turn away from QFT. Some focused on symmetry principles and conservation laws, while others picked up the old S-matrix theory of Wheeler and Heisenberg. QFT was used heuristically as guiding principles, but not as a basis for quantitative calculations.

=== Source theory ===
Schwinger, however, took a different route. For more than a decade he and his students had been nearly the only exponents of field theory, but in 1951 he found a way around the problem of the infinities with a new method using &quot;external sources&quot; as currents coupled to gauge fields. Motivated by the former findings, Schwinger kept pursuing this approach in order to &quot;quantumly&quot; generalize the classical process of coupling external forces to the configuration space parameters known as Lagrange multipliers. He summarized his source theory in 1966 then expanded the theory&#x27;s applications to quantum electrodynamics in his three volume-set titled: &quot;Particles, Sources, and Fields.&quot; Developments in pion physics, in which the new viewpoint was most successfully applied, convinced him of the great advantages of mathematical simplicity and conceptual clarity that its use bestowed.

In source theory there are no divergences, and no renormalization. It may be regarded as the calculational tool of field theory, but it is more general. Using source theory, Schwinger was able to calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, which he had done in 1947, but this time with no ‘distracting remarks’ about infinite quantities.

Schwinger also applied source theory to his QFT theory of gravity, and was able to reproduce all four of Einstein&#x27;s classic results: gravitational red shift, deflection and slowing of light by gravity, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. The neglect of source theory by the physics community was a major disappointment for Schwinger:The lack of appreciation of these facts by others was depressing, but understandable. -J. SchwingerSee &quot;the shoes incident&quot; between J. Schwinger and S. Weinberg.

===Standard model===

In 1954, Yang Chen-Ning and Robert Mills generalized the local symmetry of QED, leading to non-Abelian gauge theories (also known as Yang–Mills theories), which are based on more complicated local symmetry groups. In QED, (electrically) charged particles interact via the exchange of photons, while in non-Abelian gauge theory, particles carrying a new type of &quot;charge&quot; interact via the exchange of massless gauge bosons. Unlike photons, these gauge bosons themselves carry charge.

Sheldon Glashow developed a non-Abelian gauge theory that unified the electromagnetic and weak interactions in 1960. In 1964, Abdus Salam and John Clive Ward arrived at the same theory through a different path. This theory, nevertheless, was non-renormalizable.

Peter Higgs, Robert Brout, François Englert, Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble proposed in their famous &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; papers that the gauge symmetry in Yang–Mills theories could be broken by a mechanism called spontaneous symmetry breaking, through which originally massless gauge bosons could acquire mass.

By combining the earlier theory of Glashow, Salam, and Ward with the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking, Steven Weinberg wrote down in 1967 a theory describing electroweak interactions between all leptons and the effects of the Higgs boson. His theory was at first mostly ignored, until it was brought back to light in 1971 by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s proof that non-Abelian gauge theories are renormalizable. The electroweak theory of Weinberg and Salam was extended from leptons to quarks in 1970 by Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani, marking its completion.

Harald Fritzsch, Murray Gell-Mann, and Heinrich Leutwyler discovered in 1971 that certain phenomena involving the strong interaction could also be explained by non-Abelian gauge theory. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) was born. In 1973, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, and Hugh David Politzer showed that non-Abelian gauge theories are &quot;asymptotically free&quot;, meaning that under renormalization, the coupling constant of the strong interaction decreases as the interaction energy increases. (Similar discoveries had been made numerous times previously, but they had been largely ignored.) Therefore, at least in high-energy interactions, the coupling constant in QCD becomes sufficiently small to warrant a perturbative series expansion, making quantitative predictions for the strong interaction possible.

These theoretical breakthroughs brought about a renaissance in QFT. The full theory, which includes the electroweak theory and chromodynamics, is referred to today as the Standard Model of elementary particles. The Standard Model successfully describes all fundamental interactions except gravity, and its many predictions have been met with remarkable experimental confirmation in subsequent decades. The Higgs boson, central to the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking, was finally detected in 2012 at CERN, marking the complete verification of the existence of all constituents of the Standard Model.

===Other developments===
The 1970s saw the development of non-perturbative methods in non-Abelian gauge theories. The &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole was discovered theoretically by &#x27;t Hooft and Alexander Polyakov, flux tubes by Holger Bech Nielsen and Poul Olesen, and instantons by Polyakov and coauthors. These objects are inaccessible through perturbation theory.

Supersymmetry also appeared in the same period. The first supersymmetric QFT in four dimensions was built by Yuri Golfand and Evgeny Likhtman in 1970, but their result failed to garner widespread interest due to the Iron Curtain. Supersymmetry theories only took off in the theoretical community after the work of Julius Wess and Bruno Zumino in 1973, but to date have not been widely accepted as part of the Standard Model due to lack of experimental evidence.

Among the four fundamental interactions, gravity remains the only one that lacks a consistent QFT description. Various attempts at a theory of quantum gravity led to the development of string theory, itself a type of two-dimensional QFT with conformal symmetry. Joël Scherk and John Schwarz first proposed in 1974 that string theory could be &quot;the&quot; quantum theory of gravity.

===Condensed-matter-physics===
Although quantum field theory arose from the study of interactions between elementary particles, it has been successfully applied to other physical systems, particularly to many-body systems in condensed matter physics.

Historically, the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking was a result of Yoichiro Nambu&#x27;s application of superconductor theory to elementary particles, while the concept of renormalization came out of the study of second-order phase transitions in matter.

Soon after the introduction of photons, Einstein performed the quantization procedure on vibrations in a crystal, leading to the first quasiparticle—phonons. Lev Landau claimed that low-energy excitations in many condensed matter systems could be described in terms of interactions between a set of quasiparticles. The Feynman diagram method of QFT was naturally well suited to the analysis of various phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Gauge theory is used to describe the quantization of magnetic flux in superconductors, the resistivity in the quantum Hall effect, as well as the relation between frequency and voltage in the AC Josephson effect.

==Principles==
For simplicity, natural units are used in the following sections, in which the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light are both set to one.

===Classical fields===
A classical field is a function of spatial and time coordinates. Examples include the gravitational field in Newtonian gravity and the electric field and magnetic field in classical electromagnetism. A classical field can be thought of as a numerical quantity assigned to every point in space that changes in time. Hence, it has infinitely many degrees of freedom.

Many phenomena exhibiting quantum mechanical properties cannot be explained by classical fields alone. Phenomena such as the photoelectric effect are best explained by discrete particles (photons), rather than a spatially continuous field. The goal of quantum field theory is to describe various quantum mechanical phenomena using a modified concept of fields.

Canonical quantization and path integrals are two common formulations of QFT. To motivate the fundamentals of QFT, an overview of classical field theory follows.

The simplest classical field is a real scalar field — a real number at every point in space that changes in time. It is denoted as , where is the position vector, and is the time. Suppose the Lagrangian of the field, formula_1, is
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the Lagrangian density, formula_4 is the time-derivative of the field, is the gradient operator, and is a real parameter (the &quot;mass&quot; of the field). Applying the Euler–Lagrange equation on the Lagrangian:
:formula_5
we obtain the equations of motion for the field, which describe the way it varies in time and space:
:formula_6
This is known as the Klein–Gordon equation.

The Klein–Gordon equation is a wave equation, so its solutions can be expressed as a sum of normal modes (obtained via Fourier transform) as follows:
:formula_7

====Topological quantum field theory====
The correlation functions and physical predictions of a QFT depend on the spacetime metric . For a special class of QFTs called topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), all correlation functions are independent of continuous changes in the spacetime metric. QFTs in curved spacetime generally change according to the &quot;geometry&quot; (local structure) of the spacetime background, while TQFTs are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms but are sensitive to the &quot;topology&quot; (global structure) of spacetime. This means that all calculational results of TQFTs are topological invariants of the underlying spacetime. Chern–Simons theory is an example of TQFT and has been used to construct models of quantum gravity. Applications of TQFT include the fractional quantum Hall effect and topological quantum computers. The world line trajectory of fractionalized particles (known as anyons) can form a link configuration in the spacetime, which relates the braiding statistics of anyons in physics to the
link invariants in mathematics. Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) applicable to the frontier research of topological quantum matters include Chern-Simons-Witten gauge theories in 2+1 spacetime dimensions, other new exotic TQFTs in 3+1 spacetime dimensions and beyond.

===Perturbative and non-perturbative methods===
Using perturbation theory, the total effect of a small interaction term can be approximated order by order by a series expansion in the number of virtual particles participating in the interaction. Every term in the expansion may be understood as one possible way for (physical) particles to interact with each other via virtual particles, expressed visually using a Feynman diagram. The electromagnetic force between two electrons in QED is represented (to first order in perturbation theory) by the propagation of a virtual photon. In a similar manner, the W and Z bosons carry the weak interaction, while gluons carry the strong interaction. The interpretation of an interaction as a sum of intermediate states involving the exchange of various virtual particles only makes sense in the framework of perturbation theory. In contrast, non-perturbative methods in QFT treat the interacting Lagrangian as a whole without any series expansion. Instead of particles that carry interactions, these methods have spawned such concepts as &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopole, domain wall, flux tube, and instanton. Examples of QFTs that are completely solvable non-perturbatively include minimal models of conformal field theory and the Thirring model.

==Mathematical rigor==
In spite of its overwhelming success in particle physics and condensed matter physics, QFT itself lacks a formal mathematical foundation. For example, according to Haag&#x27;s theorem, there does not exist a well-defined interaction picture for QFT, which implies that perturbation theory of QFT, which underlies the entire Feynman diagram method, is fundamentally ill-defined.

However, &quot;perturbative&quot; quantum field theory, which only requires that quantities be computable as a formal power series without any convergence requirements, can be given a rigorous mathematical treatment. In particular, Kevin Costello&#x27;s monograph &quot;Renormalization and Effective Field Theory&quot; provides a rigorous formulation of perturbative renormalization that combines both the effective-field theory approaches of Kadanoff, Wilson, and Polchinski, together with the Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to quantizing gauge theories. Furthermore, perturbative path-integral methods, typically understood as formal computational methods inspired from finite-dimensional integration theory, can be given a sound mathematical interpretation from their finite-dimensional analogues.

Since the 1950s, theoretical physicists and mathematicians have attempted to organize all QFTs into a set of axioms, in order to establish the existence of concrete models of relativistic QFT in a mathematically rigorous way and to study their properties. This line of study is called constructive quantum field theory, a subfield of mathematical physics, which has led to such results as CPT theorem, spin–statistics theorem, and Goldstone&#x27;s theorem, and also to mathematically rigorous constructions of many interacting QFTs in two and three spacetime dimensions, e.g. two-dimensional scalar field theories with arbitrary polynomial interactions, the three-dimensional scalar field theories with a quartic interaction, etc.

Compared to ordinary QFT, topological quantum field theory and conformal field theory are better supported mathematically — both can be classified in the framework of representations of cobordisms.

Algebraic quantum field theory is another approach to the axiomatization of QFT, in which the fundamental objects are local operators and the algebraic relations between them. Axiomatic systems following this approach include Wightman axioms and Haag–Kastler axioms. One way to construct theories satisfying Wightman axioms is to use Osterwalder–Schrader axioms, which give the necessary and sufficient conditions for a real time theory to be obtained from an imaginary time theory by analytic continuation (Wick rotation).

Yang–Mills existence and mass gap, one of the Millennium Prize Problems, concerns the well-defined existence of Yang–Mills theories as set out by the above axioms. The full problem statement is as follows.

<text>In particle physics, quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.

In technical terms, QED can be described as a very accurate way to calculate the probability of the position and movement of particles, even those massless such as photons, and the quantity depending on position (field) of those particles, and described light and matter beyond the wave-particle duality proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. Richard Feynman called it &quot;the jewel of physics&quot; for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen. It is the most precise and stringently tested theory in physics.

==History==

The first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to British scientist Paul Dirac, who during the 1920s computed the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom. He is credited with coining the term &quot;quantum electrodynamics&quot;.

Dirac described the quantization of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, it was possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting doubt on the theory&#x27;s internal consistency. This suggested that special relativity and quantum mechanics were fundamentally incompatible.
Difficulties increased through the end of the 1940s. Improvements in microwave technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom, later known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron. These experiments exposed discrepancies that the theory was unable to explain.

A first indication of a possible solution was given by Bethe in 1947. He made the first non-relativistic computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Lamb and Retherford. Despite limitations of the computation, agreement was excellent. The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections of mass and charge that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments. In this way, the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result with good experimental agreement. This procedure was named renormalization.

Based on Bethe&#x27;s intuition and fundamental papers on the subject by Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson, it was finally possible to produce fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman were jointly awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in this area. Their contributions, and Dyson&#x27;s, were about covariant and gauge-invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman&#x27;s mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed unlike the field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, became one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and is seen as a criterion for a theory&#x27;s general acceptability. Even though renormalization works well in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, referring to renormalization as a &quot;shell game&quot; and &quot;hocus pocus&quot;.

Neither Feynman nor Dirac were happy with that way to approach the observations made in theoretical physics, above all in quantum mechanics.

QED is the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s, developed by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on Schwinger&#x27;s pioneering work, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.

==Feynman&#x27;s view of quantum electrodynamics==

===Introduction===
Near the end of his life, Richard Feynman gave a series of lectures on QED intended for the lay public. These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman (1985), &quot;&quot;, a classic non-mathematical exposition of QED from the point of view articulated below.

The key components of Feynman&#x27;s presentation of QED are three basic actions.
: A photon goes from one place and time to another place and time.
: An electron goes from one place and time to another place and time.
: An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time.
These actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all be seen in the adjacent diagram.

As well as the visual shorthand for the actions, Feynman introduces another kind of shorthand for the numerical quantities called probability amplitudes. The probability is the square of the absolute value of total probability amplitude, formula_1. If a photon moves from one place and time formula_2 to another place and time formula_3, the associated quantity is written in Feynman&#x27;s shorthand as formula_4, and it depends on only the momentum and polarization of the photon. The similar quantity for an electron moving from formula_5 to formula_6 is written formula_7. It depends on the momentum and polarization of the electron, in addition to a constant Feynman calls &quot;n&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;bare&quot; mass of the electron: it is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron mass. Finally, the quantity that tells us about the probability amplitude for an electron to emit or absorb a photon Feynman calls &quot;j&quot;, and is sometimes called the &quot;bare&quot; charge of the electron: it is a constant, and is related to, but not the same as, the measured electron charge &quot;e&quot;.

QED is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction. It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (&quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;), &quot;E&quot;(&quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;) and &quot;j&quot;) acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in Feynman&#x27;s book). Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.

The basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:
The indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is &quot;no observable feature present in the given system&quot; that in any way &quot;reveals&quot; which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). Whenever one &quot;is&quot; able to observe which alternative takes place, one always finds that the &quot;probability&quot; of the event is the sum of the &quot;probabilities&quot; of the alternatives. Indeed, if this were not the case, the very term &quot;alternatives&quot; to describe these processes would be inappropriate. What (a) says is that once the &quot;physical means&quot; for observing which alternative occurred is &quot;removed&quot;, one cannot still say that the event is occurring through &quot;exactly one of the alternatives&quot; in the sense of adding probabilities; one must add the amplitudes instead.

Similarly, the independence criterion in (b) is very important: it only applies to processes which are not &quot;entangled&quot;.

===Basic constructions===
Suppose we start with one electron at a certain place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label &quot;A&quot;) and a photon at another place and time (given the label &quot;B&quot;). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: &quot;What is the probability of finding an electron at &quot;C&quot; (another place and a later time) and a photon at &quot;D&quot; (yet another place and time)?&quot;. The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot; (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;D&quot; (another elementary action). From a knowledge of the probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes – &quot;E&quot;(&quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;) and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot; to &quot;D&quot;) – we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated overall probability amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability.

But there are other ways in which the result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time &quot;E&quot;, where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at &quot;F&quot;; then move on to &quot;C&quot;, where it is detected, while the new photon moves on to &quot;D&quot;. The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes – one emission and one absorption. We would expect to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. (This is not elementary in practice and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to &quot;G&quot;, where it emits a photon, which goes on to &quot;D&quot;, while the electron moves on to &quot;H&quot;, where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to &quot;C&quot;. Again, we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to our original simple estimate. Incidentally, the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.

There is an &quot;infinite number&quot; of other intermediate &quot;virtual&quot; processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these processes, a Feynman diagram could be drawn describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram, the less it contributes to the result, it is only a matter of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of &quot;any&quot; interactive process between electrons and photons, it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.

That basic scaffolding remains when one moves to a quantum description, but some conceptual changes are needed. One is that whereas we might expect in our everyday life that there would be some constraints on the points to which a particle can move, that is &quot;not&quot; true in full quantum electrodynamics. There is a nonzero probability amplitude of an electron at &quot;A&quot;, or a photon at &quot;B&quot;, moving as a basic action to &quot;any other place and time in the universe&quot;. That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also &quot;earlier times&quot;. (An electron moving backwards in time can be viewed as a positron moving forward in time.)

===Probability amplitudes===
Quantum mechanics introduces an important change in the way probabilities are computed. Probabilities are still represented by the usual real numbers we use for probabilities in our everyday world, but probabilities are computed as the square modulus of probability amplitudes, which are complex numbers.

Feynman avoids exposing the reader to the mathematics of complex numbers by using a simple but accurate representation of them as arrows on a piece of paper or screen. (These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman diagrams, which are simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time.) The amplitude arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory. They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the &quot;square&quot; of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow. So, for a given process, if two probability amplitudes, v and w, are involved, the probability of the process will be given either by

:formula_8

or

:formula_9

The rules as regards adding or multiplying, however, are the same as above. But where you would expect to add or multiply probabilities, instead you add or multiply probability amplitudes that now are complex numbers.


Addition and multiplication are common operations in the theory of complex numbers and are given in the figures. The sum is found as follows. Let the start of the second arrow be at the end of the first. The sum is then a third arrow that goes directly from the beginning of the first to the end of the second. The product of two arrows is an arrow whose length is the product of the two lengths. The direction of the product is found by adding the angles that each of the two have been turned through relative to a reference direction: that gives the angle that the product is turned relative to the reference direction.

That change, from probabilities to probability amplitudes, complicates the mathematics without changing the basic approach. But that change is still not quite enough because it fails to take into account the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized, which is to say that their orientations in space and time have to be taken into account. Therefore, &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;) consists of 16 complex numbers, or probability amplitude arrows. There are also some minor changes to do with the quantity &quot;j&quot;, which may have to be rotated by a multiple of 90° for some polarizations, which is only of interest for the detailed bookkeeping.

Associated with the fact that the electron can be polarized is another small necessary detail, which is connected with the fact that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; ending at &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. The amplitude would be calculated as the &quot;difference&quot;, , where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.

===Propagators===
Finally, one has to compute &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;) and &quot;E&quot;(&quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;) corresponding to the probability amplitudes for the photon and the electron respectively. These are essentially the solutions of the Dirac equation, which describe the behavior of the electron&#x27;s probability amplitude and the Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which describes the behavior of the photon&#x27;s probability amplitude. These are called Feynman propagators. The translation to a notation commonly used in the standard literature is as follows:

:formula_10

where a shorthand symbol such as formula_11 stands for the four real numbers that give the time and position in three dimensions of the point labeled &quot;A&quot;.

===Mass renormalization===

A problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years: although we start with the assumption of three basic &quot;simple&quot; actions, the rules of the game say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, we must take into account &quot;all&quot; the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those endpoints. Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to &quot;C&quot;, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at &quot;D&quot; before moving on to &quot;B&quot;. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short, we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line, it breaks up into a collection of &quot;simple&quot; lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of &quot;simple&quot; lines, and so on &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. This is a challenging situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly, then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to &quot;infinite&quot; probability amplitudes. In time this problem was &quot;fixed&quot; by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a &quot;dippy process&quot;, and Dirac also criticized this procedure as &quot;in mathematics one does not get rid of infinities when it does not please you&quot;.

===Conclusions===
Within the above framework physicists were then able to calculate to a high degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons, such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. However, as Feynman points out, it fails to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do. &quot;There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we don&#x27;t understand them – what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this is a very interesting and serious problem.&quot;

==Mathematical formulation==
=== QED action ===
Mathematically, QED is an abelian gauge theory with the symmetry group U(1), defined on Minkowski space (flat spacetime). The gauge field, which mediates the interaction between the charged spin-1/2 fields, is the electromagnetic field.
The QED Lagrangian for a spin-1/2 field interacting with the electromagnetic field in natural units gives rise to the action
 = \int d^4x\,\left[-\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} + \bar\psi\,(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\,\psi\right]&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour =#50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4

where
*formula_12 are Dirac matrices.
*formula_13 a bispinor field of spin-1/2 particles (e.g. electron–positron field).
*formula_14, called &quot;psi-bar&quot;, is sometimes referred to as the Dirac adjoint.
*formula_15 is the gauge covariant derivative.
**&quot;e&quot; is the coupling constant, equal to the electric charge of the bispinor field.
**formula_16 is the covariant four-potential of the electromagnetic field generated by the electron itself. It is also known as a gauge field or a formula_17 connection.
**formula_18 is the external field imposed by external source.
*&quot;m&quot; is the mass of the electron or positron.
*formula_19 is the electromagnetic field tensor. This is also known as the curvature of the gauge field.

Expanding the covariant derivative reveals a second useful form of the Lagrangian (external field formula_18 set to zero for simplicity)
:formula_21
where formula_22 is the conserved formula_17 current arising from Noether&#x27;s theorem. It is written
:formula_24

=== Equations of motion ===
Expanding the covariant derivative in the Lagrangian gives

:formula_25
:formula_26
For simplicity, formula_18 has been set to zero. Alternatively, we can absorb formula_18 into a new gauge field formula_29 and relabel the new field as formula_30

From this Lagrangian, the equations of motion for the formula_13 and formula_16 fields can be obtained.

==== Equation of motion for ψ ====
These arise most straightforwardly by considering the Euler-Lagrange equation for formula_33. Since the Lagrangian contains no formula_34 terms, we immediately get
:formula_35
so the equation of motion can be written
formula_36

==== Equation of motion for Aμ ====
* Using the Euler–Lagrange equation for the formula_16 field,
{\partial ( \partial_\nu A_\mu )} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_\mu} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;|3}}

the derivatives this time are
formula_38
formula_39

Substituting back into () leads to

:formula_40
which can be written in terms of the formula_17 current formula_22 as
Now, if we impose the Lorenz gauge condition
formula_43
the equations reduce to
formula_44
which is a wave equation for the four-potential, the QED version of the classical Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge. (The square represents the wave operator, formula_45.)

===Interaction picture===
This theory can be straightforwardly quantized by treating bosonic and fermionic sectors as free. This permits us to build a set of asymptotic states that can be used to start computation of the probability amplitudes for different processes. In order to do so, we have to compute an evolution operator, which for a given initial state formula_46 will give a final state formula_47 in such a way to have

formula_48

This technique is also known as the S-matrix. The evolution operator is obtained in the interaction picture, where time evolution is given by the interaction Hamiltonian, which is the integral over space of the second term in the Lagrangian density given above:

formula_49

and so, one has

formula_50

where &quot;T&quot; is the time-ordering operator. This evolution operator only has meaning as a series, and what we get here is a perturbation series with the fine-structure constant as the development parameter. This series is called the Dyson series.

===Feynman diagrams===
Despite the conceptual clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow him in their presentation. When performing calculations, it is much easier to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles&#x27; momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then &quot;look&quot; the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.

Using Wick&#x27;s theorem on the terms of the Dyson series, all the terms of the S-matrix for quantum electrodynamics can be computed through the technique of Feynman diagrams. In this case, rules for drawing are the following

To these rules we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an integration on momenta formula_51, since these internal (&quot;virtual&quot;) particles are not constrained to any specific energy–momentum, even that usually required by special relativity (see Propagator for details). The signature of the metric formula_52 is formula_53.

From them, computations of probability amplitudes are straightforwardly given. An example is Compton scattering, with an electron and a photon undergoing elastic scattering. Feynman diagrams are in this case

and so we are able to get the corresponding amplitude at the first order of a perturbation series for the S-matrix:

formula_54

from which we can compute the cross section for this scattering.

===Nonperturbative phenomena===
The predictive success of quantum electrodynamics largely rests on the use of perturbation theory, expressed in Feynman diagrams. However, quantum electrodynamics also leads to predictions beyond perturbation theory. In the presence of very strong electric fields, it predicts that electrons and positrons will be spontaneously produced, so causing the decay of the field. This process, called the Schwinger effect, cannot be understood in terms of any finite number of Feynman diagrams and hence is described as nonperturbative. Mathematically, it can be derived by a semiclassical approximation to the path integral of quantum electrodynamics.

==Renormalizability==
Higher-order terms can be straightforwardly computed for the evolution operator, but these terms display diagrams containing the following simpler ones

that, being closed loops, imply the presence of diverging integrals having no mathematical meaning. To overcome this difficulty, a technique called renormalization has been devised, producing finite results in very close agreement with experiments. A criterion for the theory being meaningful after renormalization is that the number of diverging diagrams is finite. In this case, the theory is said to be &quot;renormalizable&quot;. The reason for this is that to get observables renormalized, one needs a finite number of constants to maintain the predictive value of the theory untouched. This is exactly the case of quantum electrodynamics displaying just three diverging diagrams. This procedure gives observables in very close agreement with experiment as seen e.g. for electron gyromagnetic ratio.

Renormalizability has become an essential criterion for a quantum field theory to be considered as a viable one. All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except gravitation, whose quantum counterpart is only conjectural and presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.

==Nonconvergence of series==
An argument by Freeman Dyson shows that the radius of convergence of the perturbation series in QED is zero. The basic argument goes as follows: if the coupling constant were negative, this would be equivalent to the Coulomb force constant being negative. This would &quot;reverse&quot; the electromagnetic interaction so that &quot;like&quot; charges would &quot;attract&quot; and &quot;unlike&quot; charges would &quot;repel&quot;. This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons on one side of the universe and a cluster of positrons on the other side of the universe. Because the theory is &quot;sick&quot; for any negative value of the coupling constant, the series does not converge but is at best an asymptotic series.

From a modern perspective, we say that QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to arbitrarily high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This is one of the motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.

== Electrodynamics in curved spacetime ==

This theory can be extended, at least as a classical field theory, to curved spacetime. This arises similarly to the flat spacetime case, from coupling a free electromagnetic theory to a free fermion theory and including an interaction which promotes the partial derivative in the fermion theory to a gauge-covariant derivative.

<text>A quine is a computer program that takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are &quot;self-replicating programs&quot;, &quot;self-reproducing programs&quot;, and &quot;self-copying programs&quot;.

A quine is a fixed point of an execution environment, when that environment is viewed as a function transforming programs into their outputs. Quines are possible in any Turing-complete programming language, as a direct consequence of Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem. For amusement, programmers sometimes attempt to develop the shortest possible quine in any given programming language.

== Name ==

The name &quot;quine&quot; was coined by Douglas Hofstadter, in his popular 1979 science book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, in honor of philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine (1908–2000), who made an extensive study of indirect self-reference, and in particular for the following paradox-producing expression, known as Quine&#x27;s paradox:
&quot;Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation&quot; yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.
==History==

John von Neumann theorized about self-reproducing automata in the 1940s. Later, Paul Bratley and Jean Millo&#x27;s article &quot;Computer Recreations: Self-Reproducing Automata&quot; discussed them in 1972.
Bratley first became interested in self-reproducing programs after seeing the first known such program written in Atlas Autocode at Edinburgh in the 1960s by the University of Edinburgh lecturer and researcher Hamish Dewar.

The &quot;download source&quot; requirement of the GNU Affero General Public License is based on the idea of a quine.

==Examples==
===Constructive quines===
In general, the method used to create a quine in any programming language is to have, within the program, two pieces: (a) code used to do the actual printing and (b) data that represents the textual form of the code. The code functions by using the data to print the code (which makes sense since the data represents the textual form of the code), but it also uses the data, processed in a simple way, to print the textual representation of the data itself.

Here are three small examples in Python3:

# Example A. chr(39) == &quot;&#x27;&quot;.
a = &#x27;a = {}{}{}; print(a.format(chr(39), a, chr(39)))&#x27;; print(a.format(chr(39), a, chr(39)))
# Example B. chr(39) == &quot;&#x27;&quot;.
b = &#x27;b = %s%s%s; print(b %% (chr(39), b, chr(39)))&#x27;; print(b % (chr(39), b, chr(39)))
# Example C. %r will quote automatically.
c = &#x27;c = %r; print(c %% c)&#x27;; print(c % c)
The following Java code demonstrates the basic structure of a quine.

public class Quine
 public static void main(String[] args)
 char q = 34; // Quotation mark character
 String[] l = { // Array of source code
 &quot;public class Quine&quot;,
 &quot; public static void main(String[] args)&quot;,
 &quot; char q = 34; // Quotation mark character&quot;,
 &quot; String[] l = { // Array of source code&quot;,
 &quot; };&quot;,
 &quot; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) // Print opening code&quot;,
 &quot; System.out.println(l[i]);&quot;,
 &quot; for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++) // Print string array&quot;,
 &quot; System.out.println(l[6] + q + l[i] + q + &#x27;,&#x27;);&quot;,
 &quot; for (int i = 7; i &lt; l.length; i++) // Print this code&quot;,
 &quot; System.out.println(l[i]);&quot;,
 &quot;}&quot;,
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) // Print opening code
 System.out.println(l[i]);
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++) // Print string array
 System.out.println(l[6] + q + l[i] + q + &#x27;,&#x27;);
 for (int i = 7; i &lt; l.length; i++) // Print this code
 System.out.println(l[i]);
}
The source code contains a string array of itself, which is output twice, once inside quotation marks.

This code was adapted from an original post from c2.com, where the author, Jason Wilson, posted it as a minimalistic version of a Quine, without Java comments.

Thanks to new text blocks feature in Java 15 (or newer), a more readable and simpler version is possible:
public class Quine {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String textBlockQuotes = new String(new char[]{&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;});
 char newLine = 10;
 String source = &quot;&quot;&quot;
public class Quine {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String textBlockQuotes = new String(new char[]{&#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;, &#x27;&quot;&#x27;});
 char newLine = 10;
 String source = %s;
 System.out.print(source.formatted(textBlockQuotes + newLine + source + textBlockQuotes));
}
 System.out.print(source.formatted(textBlockQuotes + newLine + source + textBlockQuotes));
}
The same idea is used in the following SQL quine:
SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(&#x27;SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(&quot;$&quot;,CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),&quot;$&quot;) AS Quine&#x27;,CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),&#x27;SELECT REPLACE(REPLACE(&quot;$&quot;,CHAR(34),CHAR(39)),CHAR(36),&quot;$&quot;) AS Quine&#x27;) AS Quine

===Eval quines===

Some programming languages have the ability to evaluate a string as a program. Quines can take advantage of this feature. For example, this Ruby quine:

eval s=&quot;print &#x27;eval s=&#x27;;p s&quot;

Lua can do:
s=&quot;print(string.format(&#x27;s=%c%s%c; load(s)()&#x27;,34,s,34))&quot;; load(s)()

In Python 3.8:

exec(s:=&#x27;print(&quot;exec(s:=%r)&quot;%s)&#x27;)
===&quot;Cheating&quot; quines===

In many functional languages, including Scheme and other Lisps, and interactive languages such as APL, numbers are self-evaluating. In TI-BASIC, if the last line of a program returns a value, the returned value is displayed on the screen. Therefore, in such languages a program consisting of only a single digit results in a 1-byte quine. Since such code does not &quot;construct&quot; itself, this is often considered cheating.

==== Empty quines ====
In some languages, particularly scripting languages but also C, an empty source file is a fixed point of the language, being a valid program that produces no output. Such an empty program, submitted as &quot;the world&#x27;s smallest self reproducing program&quot;, once won the &quot;worst abuse of the rules&quot; prize in the International Obfuscated C Code Contest. The program was not actually compiled, but used codice_1 to copy the file into another file, which could be executed to print nothing.

==== Source code inspection ====
Quines, per definition, cannot receive &quot;any&quot; form of input, including reading a file, which means a quine is considered to be &quot;cheating&quot; if it looks at its own source code. The following shell script is not a quine:

#!/bin/sh
# Invalid quine.
# Reading the executed file from disk is cheating.
cat $0
A shorter variant, exploiting the behaviour of shebang directives:

#!/bin/cat
Other questionable techniques include making use of compiler messages; for example, in the GW-BASIC environment, entering &quot;Syntax Error&quot; will cause the interpreter to respond with &quot;Syntax Error&quot;.

==Ouroboros programs==
The quine concept can be extended to multiple levels of recursion, giving rise to &quot;ouroboros programs&quot;, or quine-relays. This should not be confused with multiquines.

===Example===
This Java program outputs the source for a C++ program that outputs the original Java code.

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
 char q = 34;
 string l[] = {

 &quot; char q = 34;&quot;,
 &quot; string l[] = {&quot;,
 &quot; for(int i = 20; i &lt;= 25; i++)&quot;,
 &quot; cout « l[i] « endl;&quot;,
 &quot; for(int i = 0; i &lt;= 34; i++)&quot;,
 &quot; cout « l[0] + q + l[i] + q + &#x27;,&#x27; « endl;&quot;,
 &quot; for(int i = 26; i &lt;= 34; i++)&quot;,
 &quot; cout « l[i] « endl;&quot;,

 &quot; for(int i = 2; i &lt;= 9; i++)&quot;,
 &quot; System.out.println(l[i]);&quot;,
 &quot; for(int i = 0; i &lt; l.length; i++)&quot;,
 &quot; System.out.println(l[0] + q + l[i] + q + &#x27;,&#x27;);&quot;,
 &quot; for(int i = 10; i &lt;= 18; i++)&quot;,

Such programs have been produced with various cycle lengths:

* Haskell → Python → Ruby
* Python → Bash → Perl
* C → Haskell → Python → Perl
* Haskell → Perl → Python → Ruby → C → Java
* Ruby → Java → C# → Python
* C → C++ → Ruby → Python → PHP → Perl
* Ruby → Python → Perl → Lua → OCaml → Haskell → C → Java → Brainfuck → Whitespace → Unlambda
* Ruby → Scala → Scheme → Scilab → Shell (bash) → S-Lang → Smalltalk → Squirrel3 → Standard ML → ... → Rexx (128 (and formerly 50) programming languages)
* Web application → C (web application source code consists of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS)

==Multiquines==

David Madore, creator of Unlambda, describes multiquines as follows:
&quot;A multiquine is a set of r different programs (in r different languages – without this condition we could take them all equal to a single quine), each of which is able to print any of the r programs (including itself) according to the command line argument it is passed. (Cheating is not allowed: the command line arguments must not be too long – passing the full text of a program is considered cheating).&quot;
A multiquine consisting of 2 languages (or biquine) would be a program which:
* When run, is a quine in language X. 
* When supplied with a user-defined command line argument, would print a second program in language Y. 
* Given the second program in language Y, when run normally, would also be a quine in language Y.
* Given the second program in language Y, and supplied with a user-defined command line argument, would produce the original program in language X.

A biquine could then be seen as a set of two programs, both of which are able to print either of the two, depending on the command line argument supplied.

Theoretically, there is no limit on the number of languages in a multiquine.
A 5-part multiquine (or pentaquine) has been produced with Python, Perl, C, NewLISP, and F#
and there is also a 25-language multiquine.

==Polyglot==

Similar to, but unlike a multiquine, a polyglot program is a computer program or script written in a valid form of multiple programming languages or file formats by combining their syntax. A polyglot program is not required to have a self-reproducing quality, although a polyglot program can also be a quine in one or more of its possible ways to execute.

Unlike quines and multiquines, polyglot programs are not guaranteed to exist between arbitrary sets of languages as a result of Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem, because they rely on the interplay between the syntaxes, and not a provable property that one can always be embedded within another.

==Radiation-hardened==
A radiation-hardened quine is a quine that can have any single character removed and still produces the original program with no missing character. Of necessity, such quines are much more convoluted than ordinary quines, as is seen by the following example in Ruby:
eval=&#x27;eval$q=%q(puts %q(10210/#{1 1 if 1==21}}/.i rescue##/

1 1&quot;[13,213].max_by{|s|s.size}#&quot;##&quot;).gsub(/\d/){[&quot;=\47eval$q=%q(#$q)#\47##\47

&quot;,:eval,:instance_,&quot;||=9&quot;][eval$&amp;]}
exit)#&#x27;##&#x27;

instance_eval=&#x27;eval$q=%q(puts %q(10210/#{1 1 if 1==21}}/.i rescue##/

1 1&quot;[13,213].max_by{|s|s.size}#&quot;##&quot;).gsub(/\d/){[&quot;=\47eval$q=%q(#$q)#\47##\47

&quot;,:eval,:instance_,&quot;||=9&quot;][eval$&amp;]}
exit)#&#x27;##&#x27;

/#{eval eval if eval==instance_eval}}/.i rescue##/

eval eval&quot;[eval||=9,instance_eval||=9].max_by{|s|s.size}#&quot;##&quot;
== Automatic generation ==
Using relational programming techniques, it is possible to generate quines automatically by transforming the interpreter (or equivalently, the compiler and runtime) of a language into a relational program, and then solving for a fixed point.

<text>In abstract algebra, the field of fractions of an integral domain is the smallest field in which it can be embedded. The construction of the field of fractions is modeled on the relationship between the integral domain of integers and the field of rational numbers. Intuitively, it consists of ratios between integral domain elements.

The field of fractions of an integral domain formula_1 is sometimes denoted by formula_2 or formula_3, and the construction is sometimes also called the fraction field, field of quotients, or quotient field of formula_1. All four are in common usage, but are not to be confused with the quotient of a ring by an ideal, which is a quite different concept. For a commutative ring that is not an integral domain, the analogous construction is called the localization or ring of quotients.

== Definition ==

Given an integral domain formula_1 and letting formula_6, we define an equivalence relation on formula_7 by letting formula_8 whenever formula_9. We denote the equivalence class of formula_10 by formula_11. This notion of equivalence is motivated by the rational numbers formula_12, which have the same property with respect to the underlying ring formula_13 of integers.

Then the field of fractions is the set formula_14 with addition given by
:formula_15 
and multiplication given by 
:formula_16
One may check that these operations are well-defined and that, for any integral domain formula_1, formula_18 is indeed a field. In particular, for formula_19, the multiplicative inverse of formula_11 is as expected: formula_21.

The embedding of formula_1 in formula_2 maps each formula_24 in formula_1 to the fraction formula_26 for any nonzero formula_27 (the equivalence class is independent of the choice formula_28). This is modeled on the identity formula_29.

The field of fractions of formula_1 is characterized by the following universal property:

:if formula_31 is an injective ring homomorphism from formula_1 into a field formula_33, then there exists a unique ring homomorphism formula_34 that extends formula_35.

There is a categorical interpretation of this construction. Let formula_36 be the category of integral domains and injective ring maps. The functor from formula_36 to the category of fields that takes every integral domain to its fraction field and every homomorphism to the induced map on fields (which exists by the universal property) is the left adjoint of the inclusion functor from the category of fields to formula_36. Thus the category of fields (which is a full subcategory) is a reflective subcategory of formula_36.

A multiplicative identity is not required for the role of the integral domain; this construction can be applied to any nonzero commutative rng formula_1 with no nonzero zero divisors. The embedding is given by formula_41 for any nonzero formula_42.

== Examples ==

* The field of fractions of the ring of integers is the field of rationals: formula_43.
* Let formula_44 be the ring of Gaussian integers. Then formula_45, the field of Gaussian rationals.
* The field of fractions of a field is canonically isomorphic to the field itself.
* Given a field formula_46, the field of fractions of the polynomial ring in one indeterminate formula_47 (which is an integral domain), is called the &quot;&quot;, &quot;field of rational fractions&quot;, or &quot;field of rational expressions&quot; and is denoted formula_48.
* The field of fractions of the convolution ring of half-line functions yields a space of operators, including the Dirac delta function, differential operator, and integral operator. This construction gives an alternate representation of the Laplace transform that does not depend explicitly on an integral transform.

== Generalizations ==
=== Localization ===
For any commutative ring formula_1 and any multiplicative set formula_50 in formula_1, the localization formula_52 is the commutative ring consisting of fractions
:formula_53
with formula_54 and formula_55, where now formula_56 is equivalent to formula_57 if and only if there exists formula_58 such that formula_59.

Two special cases of this are notable:
* If formula_50 is the complement of a prime ideal formula_61, then formula_52 is also denoted formula_63.When formula_1 is an integral domain and formula_61 is the zero ideal, formula_63 is the field of fractions of formula_1.
* If formula_50 is the set of non-zero-divisors in formula_1, then formula_52 is called the total quotient ring.The total quotient ring of an integral domain is its field of fractions, but the total quotient ring is defined for any commutative ring.

Note that it is permitted for formula_50 to contain 0, but in that case formula_52 will be the trivial ring.

=== Semifield of fractions ===
The semifield of fractions of a commutative semiring in which every nonzero element is (multiplicatively) cancellative is the smallest semifield in which it can be embedded. (Note that, unlike the case of rings, a semiring with no zero divisors can still have nonzero elements that are not cancellative. For example, let formula_73 denote the tropical semiring and let formula_74 be the polynomial semiring over formula_73. Then formula_1 has no zero divisors, but the element formula_77 is not cancellative because formula_78).

The elements of the semifield of fractions of the commutative semiring formula_1 are equivalence classes written as
:formula_80
with formula_81 and formula_82 in formula_1 and formula_84.

<doc id="25272" wikidata="Q472883" url="?curid=25272" title="Quadratic reciprocity">
<text>In number theory, the law of quadratic reciprocity is a theorem about modular arithmetic that gives conditions for the solvability of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers. Due to its subtlety, it has many formulations, but the most standard statement is: 
.&lt;/math&gt;

This law, together with its supplements, allows the easy calculation of any Legendre symbol, making it possible to determine whether there is an integer solution for any quadratic equation of the form formula_1 for an odd prime formula_2; that is, to determine the &quot;perfect squares&quot; modulo formula_2. However, this is a non-constructive result: it gives no help at all for finding a &quot;specific&quot; solution; for this, other methods are required. For example, in the case formula_4 using Euler&#x27;s criterion one can give an explicit formula for the &quot;square roots&quot; modulo formula_2 of a quadratic residue formula_6, namely,

:formula_7

indeed,

:formula_8

This formula only works if it is known in advance that formula_6 is a quadratic residue, which can be checked using the law of quadratic reciprocity.

The quadratic reciprocity theorem was conjectured by Euler and Legendre and first proved by Gauss, who referred to it as the &quot;fundamental theorem&quot; in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; and his papers, writing

:&quot;The fundamental theorem must certainly be regarded as one of the most elegant of its type.&quot; (Art. 151)

Privately, Gauss referred to it as the &quot;golden theorem&quot;. He published six proofs for it, and two more were found in his posthumous papers. There are now over 240 published proofs. The shortest known proof is included below, together with short proofs of the law&#x27;s supplements (the Legendre symbols of −1 and 2).

Generalizing the reciprocity law to higher powers has been a leading problem in mathematics, and has been crucial to the development of much of the machinery of modern algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry, culminating in Artin reciprocity, class field theory, and the Langlands program.

==Motivating examples==
Quadratic reciprocity arises from certain subtle factorization patterns involving perfect square numbers. In this section, we give examples which lead to the general case.

===Factoring  &quot;n&quot;2 − 5===
Consider the polynomial formula_10 and its values for formula_11 The prime factorizations of these values are given as follows:

The prime factors formula_2 dividing formula_13 are formula_14, and every prime whose final digit is formula_15 or formula_16; no primes ending in formula_17 or formula_18 ever appear. Now, formula_2 is a prime factor of some formula_20 whenever formula_21, i.e. whenever formula_22 i.e. whenever 5 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2. This happens for formula_24 and those primes with formula_25 and the latter numbers formula_26 and formula_27 are precisely the quadratic residues modulo formula_28. Therefore, except for formula_29, we have that formula_28 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_2 iff formula_2 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_28.

The law of quadratic reciprocity gives a similar characterization of prime divisors of formula_34 for any prime &quot;q&quot;, which leads to a characterization for any integer formula_35.

===Patterns among quadratic residues===
Let &quot;p&quot; be an odd prime. A number modulo &quot;p&quot; is a quadratic residue whenever it is congruent to a square (mod &quot;p&quot;); otherwise it is a quadratic non-residue. (&quot;Quadratic&quot; can be dropped if it is clear from the context.) Here we exclude zero as a special case. Then as a consequence of the fact that the multiplicative group of a finite field of order &quot;p&quot; is cyclic of order &quot;p-1&quot;, the following statements hold:

*There are an equal number of quadratic residues and non-residues; and
*The product of two quadratic residues is a residue, the product of a residue and a non-residue is a non-residue, and the product of two non-residues is a residue.

For the avoidance of doubt, these statements do &quot;not&quot; hold if the modulus is not prime. 
For example, there are only 3 quadratic residues (1, 4 and 9) in the multiplicative group modulo 15. 
Moreover, although 7 and 8 are quadratic non-residues, their product 7x8 = 11 is also a quadratic non-residue, in contrast to the prime case.

Quadratic residues appear as entries in the following table, indexed by the row number as modulus and column number as root:

This table is complete for odd primes less than 50. To check whether a number &quot;m&quot; is a quadratic residue mod one of these primes &quot;p&quot;, find &quot;a&quot; ≡ &quot;m&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;) and 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;a&quot; is in row &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; is a residue (mod &quot;p&quot;); if &quot;a&quot; is not in row &quot;p&quot; of the table, then &quot;m&quot; is a nonresidue (mod &quot;p&quot;).

The quadratic reciprocity law is the statement that certain patterns found in the table are true in general.

===Legendre&#x27;s version===
Another way to organize the data is to see which primes are quadratic residues mod which other primes, as illustrated in the following table. The entry in row &quot;p&quot; column &quot;q&quot; is R if &quot;q&quot; is a quadratic residue (mod &quot;p&quot;); if it is a nonresidue the entry is N.

If the row, or the column, or both, are ≡ 1 (mod 4) the entry is blue or green; if both row and column are ≡ 3 (mod 4), it is yellow or orange.

The blue and green entries are symmetric around the diagonal: The entry for row &quot;p&quot;, column &quot;q&quot; is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row &quot;q&quot;, column &quot;p&quot;, is R (resp N).

The yellow and orange ones, on the other hand, are antisymmetric: The entry for row &quot;p&quot;, column &quot;q&quot; is R (resp N) if and only if the entry at row &quot;q&quot;, column &quot;p&quot;, is N (resp R).

The reciprocity law states that these patterns hold for all &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.


Ordering the rows and columns mod 4 makes the pattern clearer.

==Supplements to Quadratic Reciprocity==

The supplements provide solutions to specific cases of quadratic reciprocity. They are often quoted as partial results, without having to resort to the complete theorem.

===&quot;q&quot; = ±1 and the first supplement===

Trivially 1 is a quadratic residue for all primes. The question becomes more interesting for −1. Examining the table, we find −1 in rows 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43 or 47. The former set of primes are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the latter are congruent to 3 modulo 4.

:First Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity. The congruence formula_36 is solvable if and only if formula_2 is congruent to 1 modulo 4.

===&quot;q&quot; = ±2 and the second supplement===
Examining the table, we find 2 in rows 7, 17, 23, 31, 41, and 47, but not in rows 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, or 43. The former primes are all ≡ ±1 (mod 8), and the latter are all ≡ ±3 (mod 8). This leads to

:Second Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity. The congruence formula_38 is solvable if and only if formula_2 is congruent to ±1 modulo 8.

−2 is in rows 3, 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, but not in rows 5, 7, 13, 23, 29, 31, 37, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 or ≡ 3 (mod 8), and the latter are ≡ 5, 7 (mod 8).

===&quot;q&quot; = ±3===
3 is in rows 11, 13, 23, 37, and 47, but not in rows 5, 7, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, or 43. The former are ≡ ±1 (mod 12) and the latter are all ≡ ±5 (mod 12).

−3 is in rows 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, and 43 but not in rows 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 (mod 3) and the latter ≡ 2 (mod 3).

Since the only residue (mod 3) is 1, we see that −3 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 3.

===&quot;q&quot; = ±5===
5 is in rows 11, 19, 29, 31, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, or 47. The former are ≡ ±1 (mod 5) and the latter are ≡ ±2 (mod 5).

Since the only residues (mod 5) are ±1, we see that 5 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 5.

−5 is in rows 3, 7, 23, 29, 41, 43, and 47 but not in rows 11, 13, 17, 19, 31, or 37. The former are ≡ 1, 3, 7, 9 (mod 20) and the latter are ≡ 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20).

===Higher &quot;q&quot;===
The observations about −3 and 5 continue to hold: −7 is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a residue modulo 7, −11 is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot; if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a residue modulo 11, 13 is a residue (mod &quot;p&quot;) if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a residue modulo 13, etc. The more complicated-looking rules for the quadratic characters of 3 and −5, which depend upon congruences modulo 12 and 20 respectively, are simply the ones for −3 and 5 working with the first supplement.

:Example. For −5 to be a residue (mod &quot;p&quot;), either both 5 and −1 have to be residues (mod &quot;p&quot;) or they both have to be non-residues: i.e., &quot;p&quot; ≡ ±1 (mod 5) &quot;and&quot; &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) or &quot;p&quot; ≡ ±2 (mod 5) &quot;and&quot; &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4). Using the Chinese remainder theorem these are equivalent to &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1, 9 (mod 20) or &quot;p&quot; ≡ 3, 7 (mod 20).

The generalization of the rules for −3 and 5 is Gauss&#x27;s statement of quadratic reciprocity.

==Statement of the theorem==

Quadratic Reciprocity (Gauss&#x27;s statement). If formula_40, then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_42 is solvable. If formula_43 and formula_44, then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_46 is solvable.

Quadratic Reciprocity (combined statement). Define formula_47. Then the congruence formula_41 is solvable if and only if formula_49 is solvable.

Quadratic Reciprocity (Legendre&#x27;s statement). If &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; are congruent to 1 modulo 4, then: formula_42 is solvable if and only if formula_41 is solvable. If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are congruent to 3 modulo 4, then: formula_42 is solvable if and only if formula_41 is not solvable.

The last is immediately equivalent to the modern form stated in the introduction above. It is a simple exercise to prove that Legendre&#x27;s and Gauss&#x27;s statements are equivalent – it requires no more than the first supplement and the facts about multiplying residues and nonresidues.

==Proof==

Apparently, the shortest known proof yet was published by B. Veklych in the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;.

===Proofs of the supplements===
The value of the Legendre symbol of formula_54 (used in the proof above) follows directly from Euler&#x27;s criterion:

:formula_55

by Euler&#x27;s criterion, but both sides of this congruence are numbers of the form formula_56, so they must be equal.

Whether formula_57 is a quadratic residue can be concluded if we know the number of solutions of the equation formula_58 with formula_59 which can be solved by standard methods. Namely, all its solutions where formula_60 can be grouped into octuplets of the form formula_61, and what is left are four solutions of the form formula_62 and possibly four additional solutions where formula_63 and formula_64, which exist precisely if formula_57 is a quadratic residue. That is, formula_57 is a quadratic residue precisely if the number of solutions of this equation is divisible by formula_67. And this equation can be solved in just the same way here as over the rational numbers: substitute formula_68, where we demand that formula_69 (leaving out the two solutions formula_70), then the original equation transforms into

:formula_71

Here formula_72 can have any value that does not make the denominator zero – for which there are formula_73 possibilities (i.e. formula_57 if formula_54 is a residue, formula_76 if not) – and also does not make formula_6 zero, which excludes one more option, formula_78. Thus there are

:formula_79

possibilities for formula_72, and so together with the two excluded solutions there are overall formula_81 solutions of the original equation. Therefore, formula_57 is a residue modulo formula_2 if and only if formula_67 divides formula_85. This is a reformulation of the condition stated above.

==History and alternative statements==
The theorem was formulated in many ways before its modern form: Euler and Legendre did not have Gauss&#x27;s congruence notation, nor did Gauss have the Legendre symbol.

In this article &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; always refer to distinct positive odd primes, and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; to unspecified integers.

===Fermat===
Fermat proved (or claimed to have proved) a number of theorems about expressing a prime by a quadratic form:

:formula_86

He did not state the law of quadratic reciprocity, although the cases −1, ±2, and ±3 are easy deductions from these and others of his theorems.

He also claimed to have a proof that if the prime number &quot;p&quot; ends with 7, (in base 10) and the prime number &quot;q&quot; ends in 3, and &quot;p&quot; ≡ &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), then

:formula_87

Euler conjectured, and Lagrange proved, that

:formula_88

Proving these and other statements of Fermat was one of the things that led mathematicians to the reciprocity theorem.

===Euler===
Translated into modern notation, Euler stated that for distinct odd primes &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;:

# If &quot;q&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) then &quot;q&quot; is a quadratic residue (mod &quot;p&quot;) if and only if there exists some integer &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; ≡ &quot;b&quot;2 (mod &quot;q&quot;).
# If &quot;q&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4) then &quot;q&quot; is a quadratic residue (mod &quot;p&quot;) if and only if there exists some integer &quot;b&quot; which is odd and not divisible by &quot;q&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; ≡ ±&quot;b&quot;2 (mod 4&quot;q&quot;).

This is equivalent to quadratic reciprocity.

He could not prove it, but he did prove the second supplement.

===Legendre and his symbol===
Fermat proved that if &quot;p&quot; is a prime number and &quot;a&quot; is an integer, 
:formula_89

Thus if &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;a&quot;, using the non-obvious fact (see for example Ireland and Rosen below) that the residues modulo &quot;p&quot; form a field and therefore in particular the multiplicative group is cyclic, hence there can be at most two solutions to a quadratic equation:

:formula_90

Legendre lets &quot;a&quot; and &quot;A&quot; represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;B&quot; positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), and sets out a table of eight theorems that together are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity:

He says that since expressions of the form

:formula_91

will come up so often he will abbreviate them as:

:formula_92

This is now known as the Legendre symbol, and an equivalent definition is used today: for all integers &quot;a&quot; and all odd primes &quot;p&quot;

:formula_93

====Legendre&#x27;s version of quadratic reciprocity====
:formula_94

He notes that these can be combined:

:formula_95

A number of proofs, especially those based on Gauss&#x27;s Lemma, explicitly calculate this formula.

====The supplementary laws using Legendre symbols====

:formula_96

From these two supplements, we can obtain a third reciprocity law for the quadratic character -2 as follows:

For -2 to be a quadratic residue, either -1 or 2 are both quadratic residues, or both non-residues :formula_97.

So either :formula_98 are both even, or they are both odd. The sum of these two expressions is

:formula_99 which is an integer. Therefore,

:formula_100

Legendre&#x27;s attempt to prove reciprocity is based on a theorem of his:

:Legendre&#x27;s Theorem. Let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; be integers where any pair of the three are relatively prime. Moreover assume that at least one of &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;bc&quot; or &quot;ca&quot; is negative (i.e. they don&#x27;t all have the same sign). If 
::formula_101
:are solvable then the following equation has a nontrivial solution in integers:
::formula_102

Example. Theorem I is handled by letting &quot;a&quot; ≡ 1 and &quot;b&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4) be primes and assuming that formula_103 and, contrary the theorem, that formula_104 Then formula_105 has a solution, and taking congruences (mod 4) leads to a contradiction.

This technique doesn&#x27;t work for Theorem VIII. Let &quot;b&quot; ≡ &quot;B&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4), and assume

:formula_106

Then if there is another prime &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4) such that

:formula_107

the solvability of formula_108 leads to a contradiction (mod 4). But Legendre was unable to prove there has to be such a prime &quot;p&quot;; he was later able to show that all that is required is:

:Legendre&#x27;s Lemma. If &quot;p&quot; is a prime that is congruent to 1 modulo 4 then there exists an odd prime &quot;q&quot; such that formula_109

but he couldn&#x27;t prove that either. Hilbert symbol (below) discusses how techniques based on the existence of solutions to formula_110 can be made to work.

===Gauss===
Gauss first proves the supplementary laws. He sets the basis for induction by proving the theorem for ±3 and ±5. Noting that it is easier to state for −3 and +5 than it is for +3 or −5, he states the general theorem in the form:

:If &quot;p&quot; is a prime of the form 4&quot;n&quot; + 1 then &quot;p&quot;, but if &quot;p&quot; is of the form 4&quot;n&quot; + 3 then −&quot;p&quot;, is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) of every prime, which, with a positive sign, is a residue (resp. nonresidue) of &quot;p&quot;. In the next sentence, he christens it the &quot;fundamental theorem&quot; (Gauss never used the word &quot;reciprocity&quot;).

Introducing the notation &quot;a&quot; R &quot;b&quot; (resp. &quot;a&quot; N &quot;b&quot;) to mean &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) (mod &quot;b&quot;), and letting &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;′, etc. represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;′, etc. positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), he breaks it out into the same 8 cases as Legendre:

In the next Article he generalizes this to what are basically the rules for the Jacobi symbol (below). Letting &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;′, etc. represent any (prime or composite) positive numbers ≡ 1 (mod 4) and &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot;′, etc. positive numbers ≡ 3 (mod 4):

All of these cases take the form &quot;if a prime is a residue (mod a composite), then the composite is a residue or nonresidue (mod the prime), depending on the congruences (mod 4)&quot;. He proves that these follow from cases 1) - 8).

Gauss needed, and was able to prove, a lemma similar to the one Legendre needed:

:Gauss&#x27;s Lemma. If &quot;p&quot; is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 then there exists an odd prime &quot;q&quot; such that:
::formula_111

The proof of quadratic reciprocity uses complete induction.

:Gauss&#x27;s Version in Legendre Symbols. 
::formula_112

These can be combined:

:Gauss&#x27;s Combined Version in Legendre Symbols. Let
::formula_113
:In other words:
::formula_114
:Then:
::formula_115

A number of proofs of the theorem, especially those based on Gauss sums or the splitting of primes in algebraic number fields, derive this formula.

===Other statements===
The statements in this section are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity: if, for example, Euler&#x27;s version is assumed, the Legendre-Gauss version can be deduced from it, and vice versa.

:Euler&#x27;s Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity. If formula_116 then formula_117

This can be proven using Gauss&#x27;s lemma.
:Quadratic Reciprocity (Gauss; Fourth Proof). Let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, ... be unequal positive odd primes, whose product is &quot;n&quot;, and let &quot;m&quot; be the number of them that are ≡ 3 (mod 4); check whether &quot;n&quot;/&quot;a&quot; is a residue of &quot;a&quot;, whether &quot;n&quot;/&quot;b&quot; is a residue of &quot;b&quot;, ... The number of nonresidues found will be even when &quot;m&quot; ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4), and it will be odd if &quot;m&quot; ≡ 2, 3 (mod 4).

Gauss&#x27;s fourth proof consists of proving this theorem (by comparing two formulas for the value of Gauss sums) and then restricting it to two primes. He then gives an example: Let &quot;a&quot; = 3, &quot;b&quot; = 5, &quot;c&quot; = 7, and &quot;d&quot; = 11. Three of these, 3, 7, and 11 ≡ 3 (mod 4), so &quot;m&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 4). 5×7×11 R 3; 3×7×11 R 5; 3×5×11 R 7;  and  3×5×7 N 11, so there are an odd number of nonresidues.

::formula_120
:has a nontrivial solution, then so does:
::formula_121

:Zeta function formulation
:As mentioned in the article on Dedekind zeta functions, quadratic reciprocity is equivalent to the zeta function of a quadratic field being the product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function

===Jacobi symbol===

The Jacobi symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol; the main difference is that the bottom number has to be positive and odd, but does not have to be prime. If it is prime, the two symbols agree. It obeys the same rules of manipulation as the Legendre symbol. In particular

:formula_122

and if both numbers are positive and odd (this is sometimes called &quot;Jacobi&#x27;s reciprocity law&quot;):

:formula_123

However, if the Jacobi symbol is 1 but the denominator is not a prime, it does not necessarily follow that the numerator is a quadratic residue of the denominator. Gauss&#x27;s cases 9) - 14) above can be expressed in terms of Jacobi symbols:

:formula_124

and since &quot;p&quot; is prime the left hand side is a Legendre symbol, and we know whether &quot;M&quot; is a residue modulo &quot;p&quot; or not.

The formulas listed in the preceding section are true for Jacobi symbols as long as the symbols are defined. Euler&#x27;s formula may be written

:formula_125

Example.

:formula_126

2 is a residue modulo the primes 7, 23 and 31:

:formula_127

But 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 5, so it can&#x27;t be one modulo 15. This is related to the problem Legendre had: if formula_128 then &quot;a&quot; is a non-residue modulo every prime in the arithmetic progression &quot;m&quot; + 4&quot;a&quot;, &quot;m&quot; + 8&quot;a&quot;, ..., if there &quot;are&quot; any primes in this series, but that wasn&#x27;t proved until decades after Legendre.

Eisenstein&#x27;s formula requires relative primality conditions (which are true if the numbers are prime)

:Let formula_129 be positive odd integers such that:
::formula_130
:Then
::formula_131

===Hilbert symbol===
The quadratic reciprocity law can be formulated in terms of the Hilbert symbol formula_132 where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two nonzero rational numbers and &quot;v&quot; runs over all the non-trivial absolute values of the rationals (the Archimedean one and the &quot;p&quot;-adic absolute values for primes &quot;p&quot;). The Hilbert symbol formula_132 is 1 or −1. It is defined to be 1 if and only if the equation formula_134 has a solution in the completion of the rationals at &quot;v&quot; other than formula_135. The Hilbert reciprocity law states that formula_132, for fixed &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and varying &quot;v&quot;, is 1 for all but finitely many &quot;v&quot; and the product of formula_132 over all &quot;v&quot; is 1. (This formally resembles the residue theorem from complex analysis.)

The proof of Hilbert reciprocity reduces to checking a few special cases, and the non-trivial cases turn out to be equivalent to the main law and the two supplementary laws of quadratic reciprocity for the Legendre symbol. There is no kind of reciprocity in the Hilbert reciprocity law; its name simply indicates the historical source of the result in quadratic reciprocity. Unlike quadratic reciprocity, which requires sign conditions (namely positivity of the primes involved) and a special treatment of the prime 2, the Hilbert reciprocity law treats all absolute values of the rationals on an equal footing. Therefore, it is a more natural way of expressing quadratic reciprocity with a view towards generalization: the Hilbert reciprocity law extends with very few changes to all global fields and this extension can rightly be considered a generalization of quadratic reciprocity to all global fields.
==Connection with cyclotomic fields==

The early proofs of quadratic reciprocity are relatively unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used Gauss sums to show that quadratic fields are subfields of cyclotomic fields, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a reciprocity theorem for cyclotomic fields. His proof was cast in modern form by later algebraic number theorists. This proof served as a template for class field theory, which can be viewed as a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.

Robert Langlands formulated the Langlands program, which gives a conjectural vast generalization of class field theory. He wrote:

:&quot;I confess that, as a student unaware of the history of the subject and unaware of the connection with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl&#x27;s book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.&quot;

== Other rings ==
There are also quadratic reciprocity laws in rings other than the integers.

===Gaussian integers===
In his second monograph on quartic reciprocity Gauss stated quadratic reciprocity for the ring formula_138 of Gaussian integers, saying that it is a corollary of the biquadratic law in formula_139 but did not provide a proof of either theorem. Dirichlet showed that the law in formula_138 can be deduced from the law for formula_141 without using quartic reciprocity.

For an odd Gaussian prime formula_142 and a Gaussian integer formula_143 relatively prime to formula_144 define the quadratic character for formula_138 by:

:formula_146

Let formula_147 be distinct Gaussian primes where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are odd and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are even. Then

:formula_148

===Eisenstein integers===
Consider the following third root of unity:

:formula_149

The ring of Eisenstein integers is formula_150 For an Eisenstein prime formula_151 and an Eisenstein integer formula_143 with formula_153 define the quadratic character for formula_154 by the formula

:formula_155

Let λ = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;bω&quot; and μ = &quot;c&quot; + &quot;dω&quot; be distinct Eisenstein primes where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are not divisible by 3 and &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are divisible by 3. Eisenstein proved

:formula_156

===Imaginary quadratic fields===
The above laws are special cases of more general laws that hold for the ring of integers in any imaginary quadratic number field. Let &quot;k&quot; be an imaginary quadratic number field with ring of integers formula_157 For a prime ideal formula_158 with odd norm formula_159 and formula_160 define the quadratic character for formula_161 as

:formula_162

for an arbitrary ideal formula_163 factored into prime ideals formula_164 define

:formula_165

and for formula_166 define

:formula_167

Let formula_168 i.e. formula_169 is an integral basis for formula_157 For formula_171 with odd norm formula_172 define (ordinary) integers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; by the equations,

:formula_173

and a function

:formula_174

If &quot;m&quot; = &quot;Nμ&quot; and &quot;n&quot; = &quot;Nν&quot; are both odd, Herglotz proved

:formula_175

Also, if

:formula_176

Then

:formula_177

===Polynomials over a finite field===
Let &quot;F&quot; be a finite field with &quot;q&quot; = &quot;pn&quot; elements, where &quot;p&quot; is an odd prime number and &quot;n&quot; is positive, and let &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] be the ring of polynomials in one variable with coefficients in &quot;F&quot;. If formula_178 and &quot;f&quot; is irreducible, monic, and has positive degree, define the quadratic character for &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] in the usual manner:

:formula_179

If formula_180 is a product of monic irreducibles let

:formula_181

Dedekind proved that if formula_178 are monic and have positive degrees,

:formula_183

==Higher powers==

The attempt to generalize quadratic reciprocity for powers higher than the second was one of the main goals that led 19th century mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi, Gotthold Eisenstein, Richard Dedekind, Ernst Kummer, and David Hilbert to the study of general algebraic number fields and their rings of integers; specifically Kummer invented ideals in order to state and prove higher reciprocity laws.

The ninth in the list of 23 unsolved problems which David Hilbert proposed to the Congress of Mathematicians in 1900 asked for the 
&quot;Proof of the most general reciprocity law [f]or an arbitrary number field&quot;. Building upon work by Philipp Furtwängler, Teiji Takagi, Helmut Hasse and others, Emil Artin discovered Artin reciprocity in 1923, a general theorem for which all known reciprocity laws are special cases, and proved it in 1927.

<text>Quantum information is the information of the state of a quantum system. It is the basic entity of study in quantum information theory, and can be manipulated using quantum information processing techniques. Quantum information refers to both the technical definition in terms of Von Neumann entropy and the general computational term.

It is an interdisciplinary field that involves quantum mechanics, computer science, information theory, philosophy and cryptography among other fields. Its study is also relevant to disciplines such as cognitive science, psychology and neuroscience. Its main focus is in extracting information from matter at the microscopic scale. Observation in science is one of the most important ways of acquiring information and measurement is required in order to quantify the observation, making this crucial to the scientific method. In quantum mechanics, due to the uncertainty principle, non-commuting observables cannot be precisely measured simultaneously, as an eigenstate in one basis is not an eigenstate in the other basis. According to the eigenstate–eigenvalue link, an observable is well-defined (definite) when the state of the system is an eigenstate of the observable. Since any two non-commuting observables are not simultaneously well-defined, a quantum state can never contain definitive information about both non-commuting observables.

Data can be encoded into the quantum state of a quantum system as quantum information. While quantum mechanics deals with examining properties of matter at the microscopic level, quantum information science focuses on extracting information from those properties, and quantum computation manipulates and processes information – performs logical operations – using quantum information processing techniques.

Quantum information, like classical information, can be processed using digital computers, transmitted from one location to another, manipulated with algorithms, and analyzed with computer science and mathematics. Just like the basic unit of classical information is the bit, quantum information deals with qubits. Quantum information can be measured using Von Neumann entropy.

Recently, the field of quantum computing has become an active research area because of the possibility to disrupt modern computation, communication, and cryptography.

== History and development ==

=== Development from fundamental quantum mechanics ===
The history of quantum information theory began at the turn of the 20th century when classical physics was revolutionized into quantum physics. The theories of classical physics were predicting absurdities such as the ultraviolet catastrophe, or electrons spiraling into the nucleus. At first these problems were brushed aside by adding ad hoc hypotheses to classical physics. Soon, it became apparent that a new theory must be created in order to make sense of these absurdities, and the theory of quantum mechanics was born.

Quantum mechanics was formulated by Erwin Schrödinger using wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg using matrix mechanics. The equivalence of these methods was proven later. Their formulations described the dynamics of microscopic systems but had several unsatisfactory aspects in describing measurement processes. Von Neumann formulated quantum theory using operator algebra in a way that it described measurement as well as dynamics. These studies emphasized the philosophical aspects of measurement rather than a quantitative approach to extracting information via measurements.

See: Dynamical Pictures
==== Development from communication ====
In the 1960s, Ruslan Stratonovich, Carl Helstrom and Gordon proposed a formulation of optical communications using quantum mechanics. This was the first historical appearance of quantum information theory. They mainly studied error probabilities and channel capacities for communication. Later, Alexander Holevo obtained an upper bound of communication speed in the transmission of a classical message via a quantum channel.

==== Development from atomic physics and relativity ====
In the 1970s, techniques for manipulating single-atom quantum states, such as the atom trap and the scanning tunneling microscope, began to be developed, making it possible to isolate single atoms and arrange them in arrays. Prior to these developments, precise control over single quantum systems was not possible, and experiments used coarser, simultaneous control over a large number of quantum systems. The development of viable single-state manipulation techniques led to increased interest in the field of quantum information and computation.

In the 1980s, interest arose in whether it might be possible to use quantum effects to disprove Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. If it were possible to clone an unknown quantum state, it would be possible to use entangled quantum states to transmit information faster than the speed of light, disproving Einstein&#x27;s theory. However, the no-cloning theorem showed that such cloning is impossible. The theorem was one of the earliest results of quantum information theory.

==== Development from cryptography ====

Despite all the excitement and interest over studying isolated quantum systems and trying to find a way to circumvent the theory of relativity, research in quantum information theory became stagnant in the 1980s. However, around the same time another avenue started dabbling into quantum information and computation: Cryptography. In a general sense, &quot;cryptography is the problem of doing communication or computation involving two or more parties who may not trust one another.&quot;

Bennett and Brassard developed a communication channel on which it is impossible to eavesdrop without being detected, a way of communicating secretly at long distances using the BB84 quantum cryptographic protocol. The key idea was the use of the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that observation disturbs the observed, and the introduction of an eavesdropper in a secure communication line will immediately let the two parties trying to communicate know of the presence of the eavesdropper.

==== Development from computer science and mathematics ====

With the advent of Alan Turing&#x27;s revolutionary ideas of a programmable computer, or Turing machine, he showed that any real-world computation can be translated into an equivalent computation involving a Turing machine. This is known as the Church–Turing thesis.

Soon enough, the first computers were made, and computer hardware grew at such a fast pace that the growth, through experience in production, was codified into an empirical relationship called Moore&#x27;s law. This &#x27;law&#x27; is a projective trend that states that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every two years. As transistors began to become smaller and smaller in order to pack more power per surface area, quantum effects started to show up in the electronics resulting in inadvertent interference. This led to the advent of quantum computing, which uses quantum mechanics to design algorithms.

At this point, quantum computers showed promise of being much faster than classical computers for certain specific problems. One such example problem was developed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa, known as the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm. This problem however held little to no practical applications. Peter Shor in 1994 came up with a very important and practical problem, one of finding the prime factors of an integer. The discrete logarithm problem as it was called, could theoretically be solved efficiently on a quantum computer but not on a classical computer hence showing that quantum computers should be more powerful than Turing machines.

==== Development from information theory ====
Around the time computer science was making a revolution, so was information theory and communication, through Claude Shannon. Shannon developed two fundamental theorems of information theory: noiseless channel coding theorem and noisy channel coding theorem. He also showed that error correcting codes could be used to protect information being sent.

Quantum information theory also followed a similar trajectory, Ben Schumacher in 1995 made an analogue to Shannon&#x27;s noiseless coding theorem using the qubit. A theory of error-correction also developed, which allows quantum computers to make efficient computations regardless of noise and make reliable communication over noisy quantum channels.

==Qubits and information theory==
Quantum information differs strongly from classical information, epitomized by the bit, in many striking and unfamiliar ways. While the fundamental unit of classical information is the bit, the most basic unit of quantum information is the qubit. Classical information is measured using Shannon entropy, while the quantum mechanical analogue is Von Neumann entropy. Given a statistical ensemble of quantum mechanical systems with the density matrix formula_1, it is given by formula_2 Many of the same entropy measures in classical information theory can also be generalized to the quantum case, such as Holevo entropy and the conditional quantum entropy.

Unlike classical digital states (which are discrete), a qubit is continuous-valued, describable by a direction on the Bloch sphere. Despite being continuously valued in this way, a qubit is the &quot;smallest&quot; possible unit of quantum information, and despite the qubit state being continuous-valued, it is impossible to measure the value precisely. Five famous theorems describe the limits on manipulation of quantum information. 
# no-teleportation theorem, which states that a qubit cannot be (wholly) converted into classical bits; that is, it cannot be fully &quot;read&quot;. 
# no-cloning theorem, which prevents an arbitrary qubit from being copied.
# no-deleting theorem, which prevents an arbitrary qubit from being deleted. 
# no-broadcast theorem, which prevents an arbitrary qubit from being delivered to multiple recipients, although it can be transported from place to place (&quot;e.g.&quot; via quantum teleportation).
# no-hiding theorem, which demonstrates the conservation of quantum information.

These theorems are proven from unitarity, which according to Leonard Susskind is the technical term for the statement that quantum information within the universe is conserved. The five theorems open possibilities in quantum information processing.

== Quantum information processing ==
The state of a qubit contains all of its information. This state is frequently expressed as a vector on the Bloch sphere. This state can be changed by applying linear transformations or quantum gates to them. These unitary transformations are described as rotations on the Bloch sphere. While classical gates correspond to the familiar operations of Boolean logic, quantum gates are physical unitary operators.

* Due to the volatility of quantum systems and the impossibility of copying states, the storing of quantum information is much more difficult than storing classical information. Nevertheless, with the use of quantum error correction quantum information can still be reliably stored in principle. The existence of quantum error correcting codes has also led to the possibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation.
* Classical bits can be encoded into and subsequently retrieved from configurations of qubits, through the use of quantum gates. By itself, a single qubit can convey no more than one bit of accessible classical information about its preparation. This is Holevo&#x27;s theorem. However, in superdense coding a sender, by acting on one of two entangled qubits, can convey two bits of accessible information about their joint state to a receiver.
* Quantum information can be moved about, in a quantum channel, analogous to the concept of a classical communications channel. Quantum messages have a finite size, measured in qubits; quantum channels have a finite channel capacity, measured in qubits per second.
* Quantum information, and changes in quantum information, can be quantitatively measured by using an analogue of Shannon entropy, called the von Neumann entropy.
* In some cases, quantum algorithms can be used to perform computations faster than in any known classical algorithm. The most famous example of this is Shor&#x27;s algorithm that can factor numbers in polynomial time, compared to the best classical algorithms that take sub-exponential time. As factorization is an important part of the safety of RSA encryption, Shor&#x27;s algorithm sparked the new field of post-quantum cryptography that tries to find encryption schemes that remain safe even when quantum computers are in play. Other examples of algorithms that demonstrate quantum supremacy include Grover&#x27;s search algorithm, where the quantum algorithm gives a quadratic speed-up over the best possible classical algorithm. The complexity class of problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer is known as BQP.
*Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows unconditionally secure transmission of classical information, unlike classical encryption, which can always be broken in principle, if not in practice. Note that certain subtle points regarding the safety of QKD are debated.

The study of the above topics and differences comprises quantum information theory.

==Relation to quantum mechanics==
Quantum mechanics is the study of how microscopic physical systems change dynamically in nature. In the field of quantum information theory, the quantum systems studied are abstracted away from any real world counterpart. A qubit might for instance physically be a photon in a linear optical quantum computer, an ion in a trapped ion quantum computer, or it might be a large collection of atoms as in a superconducting quantum computer. Regardless of the physical implementation, the limits and features of qubits implied by quantum information theory hold as all these systems are mathematically described by the same apparatus of density matrices over the complex numbers. Another important difference with quantum mechanics is that while quantum mechanics often studies infinite-dimensional systems such as a harmonic oscillator, quantum information theory is concerned with both continuous-variable systems and finite-dimensional systems.

== Entropy and information ==
Entropy measures the uncertainty in the state of a physical system. Entropy can be studied from the point of view of both the classical and quantum information theories.

=== Classical information theory ===
Classical information is based on the concepts of information laid out by Claude Shannon. Classical information, in principle, can be stored in a bit of binary strings. Any system having two states is a capable bit.

==== Shannon entropy ====

Shannon entropy is the quantification of the information gained by measuring the value of a random variable. Another way of thinking about it is by looking at the uncertainty of a system prior to measurement. As a result, entropy, as pictured by Shannon, can be seen either as a measure of the uncertainty prior to making a measurement or as a measure of information gained after making said measurement.

Shannon entropy, written as a function of a discrete probability distribution, formula_3 associated with events formula_4, can be seen as the average information associated with this set of events, in units of bits:

formula_5

This definition of entropy can be used to quantify the physical resources required to store the output of an information source. The ways of interpreting Shannon entropy discussed above are usually only meaningful when the number of samples of an experiment is large.

==== Rényi entropy ====
The Rényi entropy is a generalization of Shannon entropy defined above. The Rényi entropy of order r, written as a function of a discrete probability distribution, formula_6, associated with events formula_7, is defined as:

formula_8

for formula_9 and formula_10.

We arrive at the definition of Shannon entropy from Rényi when formula_11, of Hartley entropy (or max-entropy) when formula_12, and min-entropy when formula_13.

=== Quantum information theory ===
Quantum information theory is largely an extension of classical information theory to quantum systems. Classical information is produced when measurements of quantum systems are made.

==== Von Neumann entropy ====
One interpretation of Shannon entropy was the uncertainty associated with a probability distribution. When we want to describe the information or the uncertainty of a quantum state, the probability distributions are simply replaced by density operators formula_1:

formula_15

where formula_16 are the eigenvalues of formula_1.

Von Neumann entropy plays a role in quantum information similar to the role Shannon entropy plays in classical information.

== Applications ==
===Quantum communication===

Quantum communication is one of the applications of quantum physics and quantum information. There are some famous theorems such as the no-cloning theorem that illustrate some important properties in quantum communication. Dense coding and quantum teleportation are also applications of quantum communication. They are two opposite ways to communicate using qubits. While teleportation transfers one qubit from Alice and Bob by communicating two classical bits under the assumption that Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell state, dense coding transfers two classical bits from Alice to Bob by using one qubit, again under the same assumption, that Alice and Bob have a pre-shared Bell state.

===Quantum key distribution===

One of the best known applications of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution which provide a theoretical solution to the security issue of a classical key. The advantage of quantum key distribution is that it is impossible to copy a quantum key because of the no-cloning theorem. If someone tries to read encoded data, the quantum state being transmitted will change. This could be used to detect eavesdropping.

====BB84====

The first quantum key distribution scheme, BB84, was developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It is usually explained as a method of securely communicating a private key from a third party to another for use in one-time pad encryption.

====E91====

E91 was made by Artur Ekert in 1991. His scheme uses entangled pairs of photons. These two photons can be created by Alice, Bob, or by a third party including eavesdropper Eve. One of the photons is distributed to Alice and the other to Bob so that each one ends up with one photon from the pair.

This scheme relies on two properties of quantum entanglement:

# The entangled states are perfectly correlated which means that if Alice and Bob both measure their particles having either a vertical or horizontal polarization, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, from quantum mechanics theory the quantum state is completely random so that it is impossible for Alice to predict if she will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization results.
# Any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys this quantum entanglement such that Alice and Bob can detect.

====B92====

B92 is a simpler version of BB84.

The main difference between B92 and BB84:

* B92 only needs two states
* BB84 needs 4 polarization states

Like the BB84, Alice transmits to Bob a string of photons encoded with randomly chosen bits but this time the bits Alice chooses the bases she must use. Bob still randomly chooses a basis by which to measure but if he chooses the wrong basis, he will not measure anything which is guaranteed by quantum mechanics theories. Bob can simply tell Alice after each bit she sends whether he measured it correctly.

===Quantum computation===

The most widely used model in quantum computation is the quantum circuit, which are based on the quantum bit &quot;qubit&quot;. Qubit is somewhat analogous to the bit in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state, or they can be in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured, the result of the measurement is always either a 0 or a 1; the probabilities of these two outcomes depend on the quantum state that the qubits were in immediately prior to the measurement.

Any quantum computation algorithm can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates.

===Quantum decoherence===

If a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence perfectly, but it would be impossible to test the entire system. If it is not perfectly isolated, for example during a measurement, coherence is shared with the environment and appears to be lost with time; this process is called quantum decoherence. As a result of this process, quantum behavior is apparently lost, just as energy appears to be lost by friction in classical mechanics.

===Quantum error correction===

QEC is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Quantum error correction is essential if one is to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation that can deal not only with noise on stored quantum information, but also with faulty quantum gates, faulty quantum preparation, and faulty measurements.

Peter Shor first discovered this method of formulating a &quot;quantum error correcting code&quot; by storing the information of one qubit onto a highly entangled state of ancilla qubits. A quantum error correcting code protects quantum information against errors.

<text>The quarterback (QB) is a position in gridiron football who are members of the offensive side of the ball and mostly line up directly behind the offensive line. In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offense, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle. The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is almost always the offensive player that throws forward passes. When the QB is tackled behind the line of scrimmage, it is called a sack. The position is also colloquially known as the &quot;signal caller&quot; and &quot;field general&quot;.

==Overview==
In modern American football, the starting quarterback is usually the leader of the offense, and their successes and failures can have a significant impact on the fortunes of their team. Accordingly, the quarterback is among the most glorified, scrutinized, and highest-paid positions in team sports; the majority of the highest-paid players in the NFL are quarterbacks, and teams often use their top draft picks to select a quarterback. &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; describes the signing of a starting quarterback as a catch-22, where &quot;NFL teams cannot maintain success without excellent quarterback play. But excellent quarterback play is usually so expensive that it prevents NFL teams from maintaining success&quot;; a star quarterback&#x27;s high salary may prevent the signing of other expensive star players as the team has to stay under the hard salary cap. 
One of the major contributing factors behind the success and longevity of the New England Patriots&#x27; Brady–Belichick era was the willingness of starting quarterback Tom Brady to consistently take pay cuts despite his elite performance, which allowed the Patriots to spend that money elsewhere on additional skill players, with a famous example of this being the signing of Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss in 2007.

The quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play. Depending on the play calling system, prior to each play the quarterback will usually gather the rest of their team together in a huddle to tell them which play the team will run. However, when there is not much time left, or when an offense simply wants to increase the tempo of their plays, teams will forgo the huddle and the quarterback may call plays while the other offensive players get into position or at the line of scrimmage. After the team is lined up, the center will pass the ball back to the quarterback (a process called the snap). Usually on a running play, the quarterback will then hand or pitch the ball backwards to a halfback or fullback. On a passing play, the quarterback is almost always the player responsible for trying to throw the ball downfield to an eligible receiver. Additionally, the quarterback may run with the football himself, as part of a designed play like the option run or quarterback sneak, or the quarterback could make an impromptu run on their own (called a &quot;scramble&quot;) to avoid being sacked by the defense.

Depending on the offensive scheme used by their team, the quarterback&#x27;s role can vary. In systems like the triple option, the quarterback will only pass the ball a few times per game, if at all, while the pass-heavy spread offense, as run by schools like Texas Tech, requires quarterbacks to throw the ball on most plays. The passing game is emphasized heavily in the Canadian Football League (CFL), where there are only three downs (as opposed to the four downs used in American football), a larger field of play and an extra eligible receiver. Different skillsets are required of the quarterback depending upon the offensive system. Quarterbacks that perform well in a pass-heavy spread offense system, a popular offensive scheme in the NCAA and NFHS, rarely perform well in the National Football League (NFL), as the fundamentals of the pro-style offense used in the NFL are very different from those in the spread system, while quarterbacks in Canadian football need to be able to throw the ball often and accurately. In general, quarterbacks need to have physical skills such as arm strength, mobility and a quick throwing motion, in addition to intangibles such as competitiveness, leadership, intelligence and downfield vision.

In the NFL, quarterbacks are required to wear a uniform number between 1 and 19. In the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), quarterbacks are required to wear a uniform number between 1 and 49; in the NFHS, the quarterback can also wear a number between 80 and 89. In the CFL, the quarterback can wear any number from 0 to 49 and 70 to 99. Because of their numbering, quarterbacks are eligible receivers in the NCAA, NFHS and CFL; in the NFL, quarterbacks are eligible receivers if they are not lined up directly under center.

==Leadership==

Often compared to captains of other team sports, before the implementation of NFL team captains in 2007, the starting quarterback was usually the &quot;de facto&quot; team leader and a well-respected player on and off the field. Since 2007, when the NFL allowed teams to designate several captains to serve as on-field leaders, the starting quarterback has usually been one of the team captains as the leader of the team&#x27;s offense.

In the NFL, while the starting quarterback has no other responsibility or authority, they may, depending on the league or individual team, have various informal duties, such as participation in pre-game ceremonies, the coin toss or other events outside the game. For instance, the starting quarterback is the first player (and third person after the team owner and head coach) to be presented with the Lamar Hunt Trophy/George Halas Trophy (after winning the AFC/NFC Conference title) and the Vince Lombardi Trophy (after a Super Bowl victory). The starting quarterback of the victorious Super Bowl team is often chosen for the &quot;I&#x27;m going to Disney World!&quot; campaign (which includes a trip to Walt Disney World for them and their families), whether they are the Super Bowl MVP or not; examples include Joe Montana (XXIII), Trent Dilfer (XXXV), Peyton Manning (50) and Tom Brady (LIII). Dilfer was chosen even though teammate Ray Lewis was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXV, due to the bad publicity from Lewis&#x27; murder trial the previous year.

Being able to rely on a quarterback is vital to team morale. San Diego Chargers safety Rodney Harrison called the 1998 season a &quot;nightmare&quot; because of poor play by Ryan Leaf and Craig Whelihan and, from the rookie Leaf, obnoxious behavior toward teammates. Although their 1999 season replacements Jim Harbaugh and Erik Kramer were not stars, linebacker Junior Seau said, &quot;You can&#x27;t imagine the security we feel as teammates knowing we have two quarterbacks who have performed in this league and know how to handle themselves as players and as leaders&quot;.

Commentators have noted the &quot;disproportionate importance&quot; of the quarterback, describing it as the &quot;most glorified—and scrutinized—position&quot; in team sports. It is believed that &quot;there is no other position in sports that &#x27;dictates the terms&#x27; of a game the way quarterback does&quot;, whether that impact is positive or negative, as &quot;Everybody feeds off of what the quarterback can and cannot do...Defensively, offensively, everybody reacts to what threats or non-threats the quarterback has. Everything else is secondary&quot;. &quot;An argument can be made that quarterback is the most influential position in team sports, considering he touches the ball on virtually every offensive play of a far shorter season than baseball, basketball or hockey—a season in which every game is vitally important&quot;. Most consistently successful NFL teams (for instance, multiple Super Bowl appearances within a short period of time) have been centered around a single starting quarterback; the one exception was the Washington Redskins under head coach Joe Gibbs who won three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks from 1982 to 1991. Many of these NFL dynasties ended with the departure of their starting quarterback.

On a team&#x27;s defense, the middle linebacker is regarded as &quot;quarterback of the defense&quot; and is often the defensive leader, since they must be as smart as they are athletic. The middle linebacker (MLB), sometimes known as the &quot;Mike&quot;, is the only inside linebacker in the 4–3 scheme.

==Backup==

Compared to other positions in gridiron football, the backup quarterback gets considerably less playing time than the starting quarterback. While players at many other positions may rotate in and out during a game, and even a starter at most other positions rarely plays every snap, a team&#x27;s starting quarterback often remains in the game for every play, which means that a team&#x27;s primary backup may go an entire season without taking a meaningful offensive snap. While their primary role may be to be available in case of injury to the starter, the backup quarterback may also have additional roles such as a holder on placekicks or as a punter, and will often play a key role in practice, serving as the upcoming opponent&#x27;s quarterback during the preceding week&#x27;s practices. A backup quarterback may also be put in during &quot;garbage time&quot; (when the score is so lopsided and the time left in the game is so short that the outcome cannot realistically be changed), or start a meaningless late-season game (either the team has been eliminated from the postseason, or the playoff seeding cannot be affected), in order to ensure the starting quarterback does not needlessly risk an injury. Backup quarterbacks typically have the career of a journeyman quarterback and have short stints with multiple teams, a notable exception being Frank Reich, who backed up Jim Kelly for nine years with the Buffalo Bills in the 1980s and 1990s.

A quarterback controversy results when a team has two capable quarterbacks competing for the starting position. Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the play call from the sideline; Morton started in Super Bowl V, which his team lost, while Staubach started in Super Bowl VI the following year and won. Although Morton played most of the 1972 season due to an injury to Staubach, Staubach took back the starting job when he rallied the Cowboys in a come-from-behind win in the playoffs and Morton was subsequently traded; Staubach and Morton faced each other in Super Bowl XII. Another notable quarterback controversy involved the San Francisco 49ers, who had three capable starters: Joe Montana, Steve Young and Steve Bono. Montana suffered a season-ending injury that cost him the 1991 NFL season and was supplanted by Young. Young was injured midway through the season, but Bono held the starting job (despite Young&#x27;s recovery) until Bono&#x27;s own injury let Young reclaim it. Montana also missed most of the 1992 NFL season, making only one appearance, then was traded away at his request to take over as the starter for the Kansas City Chiefs; upon retirement, he was succeeded by Bono as the Chiefs&#x27; starting quarterback.

Teams will often bring in a capable backup quarterback via the draft or a trade, as competition or potential replacement which would certainly threaten the starting quarterback&#x27;s place in the team (see Two-quarterback system below). For instance, Drew Brees began his career with the San Diego Chargers but the team also drafted Philip Rivers; despite Brees initially retaining his starting job and being the Comeback Player of the Year he was not re-signed due to an injury and joined the New Orleans Saints as a free agent. Brees and Rivers both retired in 2021, each having been a starter for the Saints and Chargers, respectively, for over a decade. Aaron Rodgers was drafted by the Green Bay Packers as the eventual successor to Brett Favre, though Rodgers served in a backup role for a few years to develop sufficiently for the team to give him the starting job; Rodgers would himself encounter a similar situation in 2020 when the Packers drafted quarterback Jordan Love. Similarly, Patrick Mahomes was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs to eventually supplant Alex Smith, with the latter willingly serving as a mentor.

==Trends and other roles==
In addition to their main role, quarterbacks are occasionally used in other roles. In the past, many teams utilized a backup quarterback as their holder on placekicks. A benefit of using quarterbacks as holders is that it would be easier to pull off a fake field goal attempt, but many coaches today prefer to use punters as holders because a punter will have far more time in practice sessions to work with the kicker than any quarterback would. In the Wildcat formation, where a halfback lines up behind the center and the quarterback lines up out wide, the quarterback can be used as a receiving target or a blocker. A more rare use for a quarterback is to punt the ball themself, a play known as a quick kick. Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway was known to perform quick kicks occasionally, typically when the Broncos were facing a third-and-long situation. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Randall Cunningham, an All-America punter in college, was also known to punt the ball occasionally, and was assigned as the team&#x27;s default punter for certain situations, such as when the team was backed up inside their own five-yard line.

As Roger Staubach&#x27;s backup, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White was also the team&#x27;s punter, opening strategic possibilities for coach Tom Landry. Ascending to the starting role upon Staubach&#x27;s retirement, White held his position as the team&#x27;s punter for several seasons—a double duty he performed to All-American standard at Arizona State University. White also had two touchdown receptions as a Dallas Cowboy, both from the halfback option.

===Special tactics===

If quarterbacks are uncomfortable with the formation the defense is using, they may call an audible change to their play. For example, if a quarterback receives the call to execute a running play, but they notice that the defense is ready to blitz—that is, to send additional defenders across the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle the quarterback or short their ability to pass—the quarterback may want to change the play. To do this, the quarterback yells a special code, like &quot;Blue 42&quot; or &quot;Texas 29&quot;, which tells the offense to switch to a specific play or formation.

Quarterbacks can also &quot;spike&quot; (throw the football at the ground) to stop the official game clock. For example, if a team is down by a field goal with only seconds remaining, a quarterback may spike the ball to prevent the game clock from running out. This usually allows the field goal unit to come onto the field, or attempt a final &quot;Hail Mary pass&quot;. However, if a team is winning, a quarterback can keep the clock running by kneeling after the snap. This is normally done when the opposing team has no timeouts and there is little time left in the game, as it allows a team to burn up the remaining time on the clock without risking a turnover or injury.

===Dual-threat quarterbacks===
A dual-threat quarterback possesses the skills and physique to run with the ball if necessary. With the rise of several blitz-heavy defensive schemes and increasingly faster defensive players, the importance of a mobile quarterback has been redefined. While arm power, accuracy, and pocket presence—the ability to successfully operate from within the &quot;pocket&quot; formed by his blockers—are still the most important quarterback virtues, the ability to elude or run past defenders creates an additional threat that allows greater flexibility in a team&#x27;s passing and running game.

Dual-threat quarterbacks have historically been more prolific at the college level. Typically, a quarterback with exceptional quickness is used in an option offense, which allows the quarterback to hand the ball off, run it themself or pitch it to a running back shadowing them to the outside. This type of offense forces defenders to commit to the running back up the middle, the quarterback around the end or the running back trailing the quarterback. It is then that the quarterback has the &quot;option&quot; to identify which matchup is most favorable to the offense as the play unfolds and exploit that defensive weakness. In the college game, many schools employ several plays that are designed for the quarterback to run with the ball. This is much less common in professional football, except for a quarterback sneak, a play that involves the quarterback diving forward behind the offensive line to gain a small amount of yardage, but there is still an emphasis on being mobile enough to escape a heavy pass rush. Historically, high-profile dual-threat quarterbacks in the NFL were uncommon—among the notable exceptions were Steve Young and John Elway, who led their teams to one and five Super Bowl appearances respectively; and Michael Vick, whose rushing ability was a rarity in the early 2000s, although he never led his team to a Super Bowl. In the 2010s, quarterbacks with dual-threat capabilities have become more popular. Current NFL quarterbacks considered to be dual-threats include Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, and Josh Allen.

===Two-quarterback system===

Some teams employ a strategy that involves the use of more than one quarterback during the course of a game. This is more common at lower levels of football, such as high school or small college, but rare in major college or professional football.

There are four circumstances in which a two-quarterback system may be used.

The first is when a team is in the process of determining which quarterback will eventually be the starter, and may choose to use each quarterback for part of the game in order to compare the performances. For instance, the Seattle Seahawks&#x27; Pete Carroll used the preseason games in 2012 to select Russell Wilson as the starting quarterback over Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson.

The second is a starter–reliever system, in which the starting quarterback splits the regular season playing time with the backup quarterback, although the former will start playoff games. This strategy is rare, and was last seen in the NFL in the &quot;WoodStrock&quot; combination of Don Strock and David Woodley, which took the Miami Dolphins to the Epic in Miami in 1982 and Super Bowl XVII the following year. The starter–reliever system is distinct from a one-off situation in which a starter is benched in favor of the backup because the switch is part of the game plan (usually if the starter is playing poorly for that game), and the expectation is that the two players will assume the same roles game after game.

The third is if a coach decides that the team has two quarterbacks who are equally effective and proceeds to rotate the quarterbacks at predetermined intervals, such as after each quarter or after each series. Southern California high school football team Corona Centennial operated this model during the 2014 football season, rotating quarterbacks after every series. In a game against the Chicago Bears in week 7 of the 1971 season, Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton on each play, sending in the quarterbacks with the playcall from the sideline.

The fourth, still occasionally seen in major-college football, is the use of different quarterbacks in different game or down-and-distance situations. Generally this involves a running quarterback and a passing quarterback in an option or wishbone offense. In Canadian football, quarterback sneaks or other runs in short-yardage situations tend to be successful as a result of the distance between the offensive and defensive lines being one yard. Drew Tate, a quarterback for the Calgary Stampeders, was primarily used in short-yardage situations and led the CFL in rushing touchdowns during the 2014 season with 10 scores as the backup to Bo Levi Mitchell. This strategy had all but disappeared from professional American football, but returned to some extent with the advent of the &quot;wildcat&quot; offense. There is debate within football circles as to the effectiveness of the so-called &quot;two-quarterback system&quot;. Many coaches and media personnel remain skeptical of the model. Teams such as USC (Southern California), OSU (Oklahoma State), Northwestern and smaller West Georgia have utilized the two-quarterback system; West Georgia, for example, uses the system due to the skillsets of its quarterbacks. As recently as 2020, Oregon, who had two quarterbacks capable of starting (Boston College transfer Anthony Brown and sophomore Tyler Shough), utilized a similar tactic in the 2020 Pac-12 Football Championship Game, giving Shough the start but inserting the dual-threat Brown on short-yardage plays, red zone situations and the final drive of the game. Teams like these use this situation because of the advantages it gives them against defenses of the other team, so that the defense is unable to adjust to their gameplan.

==History==


The quarterback position dates to the late 1800s, when American Ivy League schools playing a form of rugby union imported from the United Kingdom began to put their own spin on the game. Walter Camp, a prominent athlete and rugby player at Yale University, pushed through a change in rules at a meeting in 1880 that established a line of scrimmage and allowed for the football to be snapped to a quarterback. The change was meant to allow for teams to strategize their play more thoroughly and retain possession more easily than was possible in the chaos of a scrummage in rugby. In Camp&#x27;s formulation, the &quot;quarter-back&quot; was the person who received a ball snapped back with another player&#x27;s foot. Originally he was not allowed to run forward of the line of scrimmage:

In the primary formation of Camp&#x27;s time, there were four &quot;back&quot; positions, with the tailback playing furthest back, followed by the fullback, the halfback, and the quarterback closest to the line. As the quarterback was not allowed to run past the line of scrimmage, and the forward pass had not yet been invented, their primary role was to receive the snap from the center, and immediately hand or toss the ball backwards to the fullback or halfback to run. By the early 1900s, their role had been further reduced, as teams began to employ longer, direct snaps to one of the other backs (who by rule &quot;were&quot; allowed to run) and the quarterback became the primary &quot;blocking back&quot;, leading the way through the defense but rarely carrying the ball themselves. This was the primary strategy of the single wing offense which was popular during the early decades of the 20th century. After the growth of the forward pass, the role of the quarterback changed again. The quarterback would later be returned to his role as the primary receiver of the snap after the advent of the T-formation offense, especially under the success of former single wing tailback, and later T-formation quarterback, Sammy Baugh.

The requirement to stay behind the line of scrimmage was soon rescinded, but it was later reimposed in six-man football. The exchange between the person snapping the ball, typically the center, and the quarterback was initially an awkward one because it involved a kick. At first, centers gave the ball a small boot, and then picked it up and handed it to the quarterback. By 1889, Yale center Bert Hanson was bouncing the ball on the ground to the quarterback between his legs. The following year, a rule change officially made snapping the ball using the hands between the legs legal. Several years later, Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago invented the lift-up snap: the center passed the ball off the ground and between his legs to a standing quarterback. A similar set of changes were later adopted in Canadian football as part of the Burnside rules, a set of rules proposed by John Meldrum &quot;Thrift&quot; Burnside, the captain of the University of Toronto&#x27;s football team.

The change from a scrummage to a scrimmage made it easier for teams to decide what plays they would run before the snap. At first, the captains of college teams were put in charge of play calling, indicating with shouted codes which players would run with the ball and how the men on the line were supposed to block. Yale later used visual signals, including adjustments of the captain&#x27;s knit hat, to call plays. Centers could also signal plays based on the alignment of the ball before the snap. In 1888, however, Princeton University began to have its quarterback call plays using number signals. That system caught on and quarterbacks began to act as directors and organizers of offensive play.

Early on, quarterbacks were used in a variety of formations. Harvard&#x27;s team put seven men on the line of scrimmage, with three halfbacks who alternated at quarterback and a lone fullback. Princeton put six men on the line and had one designated quarterback, while Yale used seven linemen, one quarterback and two halfbacks who lined up on either side of the fullback. This was the origin of the T-formation, an offensive set that remained in use for many decades afterward and gained popularity in professional football starting in the 1930s.

In 1906, the forward pass was legalized in American football; Canadian football did not adopt the forward pass until 1929. Despite the legalization of the forward pass, the most popular formations of the early 20th century focused mostly on the rushing game. The single-wing formation, a run-oriented offensive set, was invented by football coach Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner around the year 1908. In the single-wing, the quarterback was positioned behind the line of scrimmage and was flanked by a tailback, fullback and wingback. He served largely as a blocking back; the tailback typically took the snap, either running forward with the ball or making a lateral pass to one of the other players in the backfield. The quarterback&#x27;s job was usually to make blocks upfield to help the tailback or fullback gain yards. Passing plays were rare in the single-wing, an unbalanced power formation where four linemen lined up to one side of the center and two lined up to the other. The tailback was the focus of the offense, and was often a triple-threat man who would either pass, run or kick the ball.

Offensive play calling continued to focus on rushing up through the 1920s, when professional leagues began to challenge the popularity of college football. In the early days of the professional National Football League (NFL), which was founded in 1920, games were largely low-scoring affairs. Two-thirds of all games in the 1920s were shutouts, and quarterbacks/tailbacks usually passed only out of desperation. In addition to a reluctance to risk turnovers by passing, various rules existed that limited the effectiveness of the forward pass: passers were required to drop back five yards behind the line of scrimmage before they could attempt a pass, and incomplete passes in the end zone resulted in a change of possession and a touchback. Additionally, the rules required the ball to be snapped from the location on the field where it was ruled dead; if a play ended with a player going out of bounds, the center had to snap the ball from the sideline, an awkward place to start a play.

Despite these constraints, player-coach Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers, along with several other NFL figures of his era, was a consistent proponent of the forward pass. The Packers found success in the 1920s and 1930s using variations on the single-wing that emphasized the passing game. Packers quarterback Red Dunn and New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers quarterback Benny Friedman were the leading passers of their era, but passing remained a relative rarity among other teams; between 1920 and 1932, there were three times as many running plays as there were passing plays.

Early NFL quarterbacks typically were responsible for calling the team&#x27;s offensive plays with signals before the snap. The use of the huddle to call plays originated with Stagg in 1896, but only began to be used regularly in college games in 1921. In the NFL, players were typically assigned numbers, as were the gaps between offensive linemen. One player, usually the quarterback, would call signals indicating which player was to run the ball and which gap he would run toward. Playcalling (or any other kind of coaching from the sidelines) was not permitted during this period, leaving the quarterback to devise the offensive strategy (often, the quarterback doubled as head coach during this era). Substitutions were limited and quarterbacks often played on both offense and defense.

Between 1933 and 1945, numerous changes for the quarterback position were applied. The rule requiring a quarterback/tailback to be five yards behind the line of scrimmage to pass was abolished, and hash marks were added to the field that established a limited zone between which the ball was placed before snaps, making offensive formations more flexible. Additionally, incomplete passes in the end zone were no longer counted as turnovers and touchbacks.

The single-wing continued to be in wide use throughout this, and a number of forward-passing tailbacks became stars, including Sammy Baugh of the Washington Redskins. In 1939, University of Chicago head football coach Clark Shaughnessy made modifications to the T-formation, a formation that put the quarterback behind the center and had him receive the snap directly. Shaughnessy altered the formation by having the linemen be spaced further apart, and he began having players go in motion behind the line of scrimmage before the snap to confuse defenses. These changes were picked up by Chicago Bears coach George Halas, a close friend of Shaughnessy, and they quickly caught on in the professional ranks. Utilizing the T-formation and led by quarterback Sid Luckman, the Bears reached the NFL championship game in 1940 and beat the Redskins by a score of 73–0. The blowout led other teams across the league to adopt variations on the T-formation, including the Philadelphia Eagles, Cleveland Rams and Detroit Lions. Baugh and the Redskins converted to the T-formation and continued to succeed.

Thanks in part to the emergence of the T-formation and changes in the rulebooks to liberalize the passing game, passing from the quarterback position became more common in the 1940s and as teams switched to the T-formation, passing tailbacks, such as Sammy Baugh, would line up as quarterbacks instead. Over the course of the decade, passing yards began to exceed rushing yards for the first time in the history of football. The Cleveland Browns of the late 1940s in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a professional league created to challenge the NFL, were one of the teams of that era that relied most on passing. Quarterback Otto Graham helped the Browns win four AAFC championships in the late 1940s in head coach Paul Brown&#x27;s T-formation offense, which emphasized precision timing passes. Cleveland, along with several other AAFC teams, was absorbed by the NFL in 1950 after the dissolution of the AAFC that same year. By the end of the 1940s, all NFL teams aside from the Pittsburgh Steelers used the T-formation as their primary offensive formation.

As late as the 1960s, running plays occurred more frequently than passes. NFL quarterback Milt Plum later stated that during his career (1957–1969) passes typically only occurred on third downs and sometimes on first downs. Quarterbacks only increased in importance as rules changed to favor passing and higher scoring and as football gained popularity on television after the 1958 NFL Championship Game, often referred to as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;. Early modern offenses evolved around the quarterback as a passing threat, boosted by rules changes in 1978 and 1979 that made it a penalty for defensive backs to interfere with receivers downfield and allowed offensive linemen to pass-block using their arms and open hands; the rules had limited them to blocking with their hands held to their chests. Average passing yards per game rose from 283.3 in 1977 to 408.7 in 1979.
The NFL continues to be a pass-heavy league, in part due to further rule changes that prescribed harsher penalties for hitting the quarterback and for hitting defenseless receivers as they awaited passes. Passing in wide-open offenses has also been an emphasis at the high school and college levels, and professional coaches have devised schemes to fit the talents of new generations of quarterbacks.

While quarterbacks and team captains usually called plays in football&#x27;s early years, today coaches often decide which plays the offense will run. Some teams use an offensive coordinator, an assistant coach whose duties include offensive game-planning and often play-calling. In the NFL, coaches are allowed to communicate with quarterbacks and call plays using audio equipment built into the player&#x27;s helmet. Quarterbacks are allowed to hear, but not talk to, their coaches until there are fifteen seconds left on the play clock. Once the quarterback receives the call, he may relay it to other players via signals or in a huddle.

Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry was an early advocate of taking play calling out of the quarterback&#x27;s hands. Although this remained a common practice in the NFL through the 1970s, fewer QBs were doing it by the 1980s and even Hall of Famers like Joe Montana did not call their own plays. Buffalo Bills QB Jim Kelly was one of the last to regularly call plays. Peyton Manning, formerly of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, was the best modern example of a quarterback who called his own plays, primary using an uptempo, no-huddle-based attack. Manning had almost complete control over the offense. Former Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco retained a high degree of control over the offense as well, particularly when running a no-huddle scheme, as did Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

==Race==
Throughout football history, the racial makeup of quarterbacks did not reflect the racial makeup of the sport. Black quarterbacks especially faced barriers in breaking into the starting job at the highest levels. The first black starting quarterback in the Super Bowl era was Marlin Briscoe in 1968, who started for the American Football League&#x27;s Denver Broncos during part of one season; he was later converted to wide receiver. James Harris started several games for the Buffalo Bills after the AFL-NFL merger, and later started games for the Los Angeles Rams. Other early NFL black starting quarterbacks include Joe Gilliam of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who was the first black quarterback to start a season for any NFL team; though he was benched after the first six games. The New York Giants became the last team to field a black starting QB during an NFL season when Geno Smith filled in for Eli Manning in 2017.

During the 2013 NFL season, 67 percent of NFL players were African American yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white, with just one percent of quarterbacks from other races. Since the inception of the game, only four quarterbacks with known black ancestry have led their team to a Super Bowl victory: Doug Williams in 1988, Russell Wilson, who is multiracial, in 2014, Patrick Mahomes (biracial) in 2020, 2023, and 2024 and Jalen Hurts in 2025. However, numerous quarterbacks with African ancestry did start the Super Bowl since the 2010s, including four in a row (Super Bowl XLVII, Super Bowl XLVIII, Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl 50). Quarterbacks with known black ancestry have also won the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award in recent years, including Cam Newton, Patrick Mahomes, and Lamar Jackson.

Some black quarterbacks claim to have experienced bias towards or against them due to their race. Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively, current Cleveland Browns signal-caller Deshaun Watson despises being called a dual-threat quarterback because he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks.

Super Bowl LVII was the first Super Bowl in history where each starting quarterback (Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes) was black.

<text>In geometry a quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon, having four edges (sides) and four corners (vertices). The word is derived from the Latin words &quot;quadri&quot;, a variant of four, and &quot;latus&quot;, meaning &quot;side&quot;. It is also called a tetragon, derived from Greek &quot;tetra&quot; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;gon&quot; meaning &quot;corner&quot; or &quot;angle&quot;, in analogy to other polygons (e.g. pentagon). Since &quot;gon&quot; means &quot;angle&quot;, it is analogously called a quadrangle, or 4-angle. A quadrilateral with vertices formula_1, formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 is sometimes denoted as formula_5.

Quadrilaterals are either simple (not self-intersecting), or complex (self-intersecting, or crossed). Simple quadrilaterals are either convex or concave.

The interior angles of a simple (and planar) quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; add up to 360 degrees, that is
:formula_6

This is a special case of the &quot;n&quot;-gon interior angle sum formula: &quot;S&quot; = (&quot;n&quot; − 2) × 180° (here, n=4).

All non-self-crossing quadrilaterals tile the plane, by repeated rotation around the midpoints of their edges.

==Simple quadrilaterals==
Any quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is a simple quadrilateral.

===Convex quadrilateral===

In a convex quadrilateral all interior angles are less than 180°, and the two diagonals both lie inside the quadrilateral.
*Irregular quadrilateral (British English) or trapezium (North American English): no sides are parallel. (In British English, this was once called a &quot;trapezoid&quot;. For more, see .)
*Trapezium (UK) or trapezoid (US): at least one pair of opposite sides are parallel. Trapezia (UK) and trapezoids (US) include parallelograms.

*Isosceles trapezium (UK) or isosceles trapezoid (US): one pair of opposite sides are parallel and the base angles are equal in measure. Alternative definitions are a quadrilateral with an axis of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides, or a trapezoid with diagonals of equal length.
*Parallelogram: a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Equivalent conditions are that opposite sides are of equal length; that opposite angles are equal; or that the diagonals bisect each other. Parallelograms include rhombi (including those rectangles called squares) and rhomboids (including those rectangles called oblongs). In other words, parallelograms include all rhombi and all rhomboids, and thus also include all rectangles.
*Rhombus, rhomb: all four sides are of equal length (equilateral). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other. Informally: &quot;a pushed-over square&quot; (but strictly including a square, too).
*Rhomboid: a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths, and some angles are oblique (equiv., having no right angles). Informally: &quot;a pushed-over oblong&quot;. Not all references agree; some define a rhomboid as a parallelogram that is not a rhombus.
*Rectangle: all four angles are right angles (equiangular). An equivalent condition is that the diagonals bisect each other, and are equal in length. Rectangles include squares and oblongs. Informally: &quot;a box or oblong&quot; (including a square).
*Square (regular quadrilateral): all four sides are of equal length (equilateral), and all four angles are right angles. An equivalent condition is that opposite sides are parallel (a square is a parallelogram), and that the diagonals perpendicularly bisect each other and are of equal length. A quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is both a rhombus and a rectangle (i.e., four equal sides and four equal angles).
*: longer than wide, or wider than long (i.e., a rectangle that is not a square).
*Kite: two pairs of adjacent sides are of equal length. This implies that one diagonal divides the kite into congruent triangles, and so the angles between the two pairs of equal sides are equal in measure. It also implies that the diagonals are perpendicular. Kites include rhombi.

*Tangential quadrilateral: the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is tangential if and only if opposite sides have equal sums.
*Tangential trapezoid: a trapezoid where the four sides are tangents to an inscribed circle.
*Cyclic quadrilateral: the four vertices lie on a circumscribed circle. A convex quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if opposite angles sum to 180°.
*Right kite: a kite with two opposite right angles. It is a type of cyclic quadrilateral.
*Harmonic quadrilateral: a cyclic quadrilateral such that the products of the lengths of the opposing sides are equal.
*Bicentric quadrilateral: it is both tangential and cyclic.
*Orthodiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals cross at right angles.
*Equidiagonal quadrilateral: the diagonals are of equal length.
*Bisect-diagonal quadrilateral: one diagonal bisects the other into equal lengths. Every dart and kite is bisect-diagonal. When both diagonals bisect another, it&#x27;s a parallelogram. 
*Ex-tangential quadrilateral: the four extensions of the sides are tangent to an excircle.
*An &quot;equilic quadrilateral&quot; has two opposite equal sides that when extended, meet at 60°.
*A &quot;Watt quadrilateral&quot; is a quadrilateral with a pair of opposite sides of equal length.
*A &quot;quadric quadrilateral&quot; is a convex quadrilateral whose four vertices all lie on the perimeter of a square.
*A &quot;diametric quadrilateral&quot; is a cyclic quadrilateral having one of its sides as a diameter of the circumcircle.
*A &quot;Hjelmslev quadrilateral&quot; is a quadrilateral with two right angles at opposite vertices.

===Concave quadrilaterals===
In a concave quadrilateral, one interior angle is bigger than 180°, and one of the two diagonals lies outside the quadrilateral.
*A &quot;dart&quot; (or arrowhead) is a concave quadrilateral with bilateral symmetry like a kite, but where one interior angle is reflex. See Kite.

==Complex quadrilaterals ==

A self-intersecting quadrilateral is called variously a cross-quadrilateral, crossed quadrilateral, butterfly quadrilateral or bow-tie quadrilateral. In a crossed quadrilateral, the four &quot;interior&quot; angles on either side of the crossing (two acute and two reflex, all on the left or all on the right as the figure is traced out) add up to 720°.

*Crossed trapezoid (US) or trapezium (Commonwealth): a crossed quadrilateral in which one pair of nonadjacent sides is parallel (like a trapezoid).
*Antiparallelogram: a crossed quadrilateral in which each pair of nonadjacent sides have equal lengths (like a parallelogram).
*Crossed rectangle: an antiparallelogram whose sides are two opposite sides and the two diagonals of a rectangle, hence having one pair of parallel opposite sides.
*Crossed square: a special case of a crossed rectangle where two of the sides intersect at right angles.

==Special line segments==
The two diagonals of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect opposite vertices.

The two bimedians of a convex quadrilateral are the line segments that connect the midpoints of opposite sides. They intersect at the &quot;vertex centroid&quot; of the quadrilateral (see below).

The four maltitudes of a convex quadrilateral are the perpendiculars to a side—through the midpoint of the opposite side.

==Area of a convex quadrilateral==
There are various general formulas for the area of a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with sides .

===Trigonometric formulas===
The area can be expressed in trigonometric terms as
:formula_7

where the lengths of the diagonals are and and the angle between them is . In the case of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral (e.g. rhombus, square, and kite), this formula reduces to formula_8 since is .

The area can be also expressed in terms of bimedians as
:formula_9
where the lengths of the bimedians are and and the angle between them is .

Bretschneider&#x27;s formula expresses the area in terms of the sides and two opposite angles:
:formula_10

where the sides in sequence are , , , , where is the semiperimeter, and and are two (in fact, any two) opposite angles. This reduces to Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral—when .

Another area formula in terms of the sides and angles, with angle being between sides and , and being between sides and , is
:formula_11

In the case of a cyclic quadrilateral, the latter formula becomes formula_12

In a parallelogram, where both pairs of opposite sides and angles are equal, this formula reduces to formula_13

Alternatively, we can write the area in terms of the sides and the intersection angle of the diagonals, as long as is not :
:formula_14

In the case of a parallelogram, the latter formula becomes formula_15

Another area formula including the sides , , , is
:formula_16
where is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals, and is the angle between the bimedians.

The last trigonometric area formula including the sides , , , and the angle (between and ) is:
:formula_17
which can also be used for the area of a concave quadrilateral (having the concave part opposite to angle ), by just changing the first sign to .

===Non-trigonometric formulas===
The following two formulas express the area in terms of the sides , , and , the semiperimeter , and the diagonals , :

:formula_18 

:formula_19 

The first reduces to Brahmagupta&#x27;s formula in the cyclic quadrilateral case, since then .

The area can also be expressed in terms of the bimedians , and the diagonals , :

:formula_20 

:formula_21 

In fact, any three of the four values , , , and suffice for determination of the area, since in any quadrilateral the four values are related by formula_22 The corresponding expressions are:

:formula_23 
if the lengths of two bimedians and one diagonal are given, and

:formula_24 
if the lengths of two diagonals and one bimedian are given.

===Vector formulas===
The area of a quadrilateral can be calculated using vectors. Let vectors and form the diagonals from to and from to . The area of the quadrilateral is then
:formula_25

which is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors and . In two-dimensional Euclidean space, expressing vector as a free vector in Cartesian space equal to and as , this can be rewritten as:
:formula_26

==Diagonals==
===Properties of the diagonals in quadrilaterals===
In the following table it is listed if the diagonals in some of the most basic quadrilaterals bisect each other, if their diagonals are perpendicular, and if their diagonals have equal length. The list applies to the most general cases, and excludes named subsets.

* &quot;Note 1: The most general trapezoids and isosceles trapezoids do not have perpendicular diagonals, but there are infinite numbers of (non-similar) trapezoids and isosceles trapezoids that do have perpendicular diagonals and are not any other named quadrilateral.&quot;
* &quot;Note 2: In a kite, one diagonal bisects the other. The most general kite has unequal diagonals, but there is an infinite number of (non-similar) kites in which the diagonals are equal in length (and the kites are not any other named quadrilateral).&quot;

===Lengths of the diagonals===
The lengths of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; can be calculated using the law of cosines on each triangle formed by one diagonal and two sides of the quadrilateral. Thus
:formula_27

and
:formula_28

Other, more symmetric formulas for the lengths of the diagonals, are
:formula_29

and
:formula_30

===Generalizations of the parallelogram law and Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem===
In any convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot;, the sum of the squares of the four sides is equal to the sum of the squares of the two diagonals plus four times the square of the line segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals. Thus
:formula_31

where is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is sometimes known as Euler&#x27;s quadrilateral theorem and is a generalization of the parallelogram law.

The German mathematician Carl Anton Bretschneider derived in 1842 the following generalization of Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem, regarding the product of the diagonals in a convex quadrilateral
:formula_32

This relation can be considered to be a law of cosines for a quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, where , it reduces to . Since , it also gives a proof of Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality.

===Other metric relations===
If and are the feet of the normals from and to the diagonal in a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with sides , , , , then
:formula_33

In a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with sides , , , , and where the diagonals intersect at ,
:formula_34

where , , , and .

The shape and size of a convex quadrilateral are fully determined by the lengths of its sides in sequence and of one diagonal between two specified vertices. The two diagonals and the four side lengths of a quadrilateral are related by the Cayley-Menger determinant, as follows:
:formula_35

==Angle bisectors==
The internal angle bisectors of a convex quadrilateral either form a cyclic quadrilateral (that is, the four intersection points of adjacent angle bisectors are concyclic) or they are concurrent. In the latter case the quadrilateral is a tangential quadrilateral.

In quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot;, if the angle bisectors of and meet on diagonal , then the angle bisectors of and meet on diagonal .

==Bimedians==

The bimedians of a quadrilateral are the line segments connecting the midpoints of the opposite sides. The intersection of the bimedians is the centroid of the vertices of the quadrilateral.

The midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral (convex, concave or crossed) are the vertices of a parallelogram called the Varignon parallelogram. It has the following properties:
*Each pair of opposite sides of the Varignon parallelogram are parallel to a diagonal in the original quadrilateral.
*A side of the Varignon parallelogram is half as long as the diagonal in the original quadrilateral it is parallel to.
*The area of the Varignon parallelogram equals half the area of the original quadrilateral. This is true in convex, concave and crossed quadrilaterals provided the area of the latter is defined to be the difference of the areas of the two triangles it is composed of.
*The perimeter of the Varignon parallelogram equals the sum of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral.
*The diagonals of the Varignon parallelogram are the bimedians of the original quadrilateral.

The two bimedians in a quadrilateral and the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals in that quadrilateral are concurrent and are all bisected by their point of intersection.

In a convex quadrilateral with sides , , and , the length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides and is
:formula_36

where and are the length of the diagonals. The length of the bimedian that connects the midpoints of the sides and is
:formula_37

Hence
:formula_38

This is also a corollary to the parallelogram law applied in the Varignon parallelogram.

The lengths of the bimedians can also be expressed in terms of two opposite sides and the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals. This is possible when using Euler&#x27;s quadrilateral theorem in the above formulas. Whence
:formula_39

and
:formula_40

Note that the two opposite sides in these formulas are not the two that the bimedian connects.

In a convex quadrilateral, there is the following dual connection between the bimedians and the diagonals:
* The two bimedians have equal length if and only if the two diagonals are perpendicular.
* The two bimedians are perpendicular if and only if the two diagonals have equal length.

==Trigonometric identities==
The four angles of a simple quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; satisfy the following identities:

:formula_41

and

:formula_42

Also,

:formula_43

In the last two formulas, no angle is allowed to be a right angle, since tan 90° is not defined.

Let formula_44, formula_45, formula_46, formula_47 be the sides of a convex quadrilateral, formula_48 is the semiperimeter, 
and formula_1 and formula_3 are opposite angles, then

:formula_51

and

:formula_52.

We can use these identities to derive the Bretschneider&#x27;s Formula.

==Inequalities==
===Area===
If a convex quadrilateral has the consecutive sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; and the diagonals &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, then its area &quot;K&quot; satisfies
:formula_53 with equality only for a rectangle.
:formula_54 with equality only for a square.
:formula_55 with equality only if the diagonals are perpendicular and equal.
:formula_56 with equality only for a rectangle.

From Bretschneider&#x27;s formula it directly follows that the area of a quadrilateral satisfies
:formula_57

with equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic or degenerate such that one side is equal to the sum of the other three (it has collapsed into a line segment, so the area is zero).

Also,
:formula_58
with equality for a bicentric quadrilateral or a rectangle.

The area of any quadrilateral also satisfies the inequality
:formula_59

Denoting the perimeter as &quot;L&quot;, we have
:formula_60

with equality only in the case of a square.

The area of a convex quadrilateral also satisfies
:formula_61

for diagonal lengths &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, with equality if and only if the diagonals are perpendicular.

Let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with the area &quot;K&quot; and diagonals &quot;AC = p&quot;, &quot;BD = q&quot;. Then

:formula_62 with equality only for a square.

Let &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot; be the lengths of the sides of a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with the area &quot;K&quot;, then the following inequality holds:

:formula_63 with equality only for a square.

===Diagonals and bimedians===
A corollary to Euler&#x27;s quadrilateral theorem is the inequality
:formula_64

where equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

Euler also generalized Ptolemy&#x27;s theorem, which is an equality in a cyclic quadrilateral, into an inequality for a convex quadrilateral. It states that
:formula_65

where there is equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic. This is often called Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality.

In any convex quadrilateral the bimedians &quot;m, n&quot; and the diagonals &quot;p, q&quot; are related by the inequality
:formula_66

with equality holding if and only if the diagonals are equal. This follows directly from the quadrilateral identity formula_67

===Sides===
The sides &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; of any quadrilateral satisfy
:formula_68

and
:formula_69

==Maximum and minimum properties==
Among all quadrilaterals with a given perimeter, the one with the largest area is the square. This is called the &quot;isoperimetric theorem for quadrilaterals&quot;. It is a direct consequence of the area inequality
:formula_70

where &quot;K&quot; is the area of a convex quadrilateral with perimeter &quot;L&quot;. Equality holds if and only if the quadrilateral is a square. The dual theorem states that of all quadrilaterals with a given area, the square has the shortest perimeter.

The quadrilateral with given side lengths that has the maximum area is the cyclic quadrilateral.

Of all convex quadrilaterals with given diagonals, the orthodiagonal quadrilateral has the largest area. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the area of a convex quadrilateral satisfies
:formula_71

where &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the diagonals &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. Equality holds if and only if &quot;θ&quot; = 90°.

If &quot;P&quot; is an interior point in a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot;, then
:formula_72

From this inequality it follows that the point inside a quadrilateral that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices is the intersection of the diagonals. Hence that point is the Fermat point of a convex quadrilateral.

==Remarkable points and lines in a convex quadrilateral==
The centre of a quadrilateral can be defined in several different ways. The &quot;vertex centroid&quot; comes from considering the quadrilateral as being empty but having equal masses at its vertices. The &quot;side centroid&quot; comes from considering the sides to have constant mass per unit length. The usual centre, called just centroid (centre of area) comes from considering the surface of the quadrilateral as having constant density. These three points are in general not all the same point.

The &quot;vertex centroid&quot; is the intersection of the two bimedians. As with any polygon, the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; coordinates of the vertex centroid are the arithmetic means of the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; coordinates of the vertices.

The &quot;area centroid&quot; of quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; can be constructed in the following way. Let &quot;Ga&quot;, &quot;Gb&quot;, &quot;Gc&quot;, &quot;Gd&quot; be the centroids of triangles &quot;BCD&quot;, &quot;ACD&quot;, &quot;ABD&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot; respectively. Then the &quot;area centroid&quot; is the intersection of the lines &quot;GaGc&quot; and &quot;GbGd&quot;.

In a general convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot;, there are no natural analogies to the circumcenter and orthocenter of a triangle. But two such points can be constructed in the following way. Let &quot;Oa&quot;, &quot;Ob&quot;, &quot;Oc&quot;, &quot;Od&quot; be the circumcenters of triangles &quot;BCD&quot;, &quot;ACD&quot;, &quot;ABD&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot; respectively; and denote by &quot;Ha&quot;, &quot;Hb&quot;, &quot;Hc&quot;, &quot;Hd&quot; the orthocenters in the same triangles. Then the intersection of the lines &quot;OaOc&quot; and &quot;ObOd&quot; is called the quasicircumcenter, and the intersection of the lines &quot;HaHc&quot; and &quot;HbHd&quot; is called the &quot;quasiorthocenter&quot; of the convex quadrilateral. These points can be used to define an Euler line of a quadrilateral. In a convex quadrilateral, the quasiorthocenter &quot;H&quot;, the &quot;area centroid&quot; &quot;G&quot;, and the quasicircumcenter &quot;O&quot; are collinear in this order, and &quot;HG&quot; = 2&quot;GO&quot;.

There can also be defined a &quot;quasinine-point center&quot; &quot;E&quot; as the intersection of the lines &quot;EaEc&quot; and &quot;EbEd&quot;, where &quot;Ea&quot;, &quot;Eb&quot;, &quot;Ec&quot;, &quot;Ed&quot; are the nine-point centers of triangles &quot;BCD&quot;, &quot;ACD&quot;, &quot;ABD&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot; respectively. Then &quot;E&quot; is the midpoint of &quot;OH&quot;.

Another remarkable line in a convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the Newton line, which connects the midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by the vertex centroid. One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the Newton&#x27;s one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with the vertex centroid. The line is remarkable by the fact that it contains the (area) centroid. The vertex centroid divides the segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and the (area) centroid in the ratio 3:1.

For any quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; with points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; the intersections of &quot;AD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot;, respectively, the circles &quot;(PAB), (PCD), (QAD),&quot; and &quot;(QBC)&quot; pass through a common point &quot;M&quot;, called a Miquel point.

For a convex quadrilateral &quot;ABCD&quot; in which &quot;E&quot; is the point of intersection of the diagonals and &quot;F&quot; is the point of intersection of the extensions of sides &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;, let ω be a circle through &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; which meets &quot;CB&quot; internally at &quot;M&quot; and &quot;DA&quot; internally at &quot;N&quot;. Let &quot;CA&quot; meet ω again at &quot;L&quot; and let &quot;DB&quot; meet ω again at &quot;K&quot;. Then there holds: the straight lines &quot;NK&quot; and &quot;ML&quot; intersect at point &quot;P&quot; that is located on the side &quot;AB&quot;; the straight lines &quot;NL&quot; and &quot;KM&quot; intersect at point &quot;Q&quot; that is located on the side &quot;CD&quot;. 
Points &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are called &quot;Pascal points&quot; formed by circle ω on sides &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot;.


==Other properties of convex quadrilaterals==
* If exterior squares are drawn on all sides of a quadrilateral then the segments connecting the centers of opposite squares are (a) equal in length, and (b) perpendicular. Thus these centers are the vertices of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. This is called Van Aubel&#x27;s theorem.
*For any simple quadrilateral with given edge lengths, there is a cyclic quadrilateral with the same edge lengths.
*The four smaller triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of a convex quadrilateral have the property that the product of the areas of two opposite triangles equals the product of the areas of the other two triangles.
*The angle formula_73 at the intersection of the diagonals satisfies formula_74 where formula_75 are the diagonals of the quadrilateral.

==Taxonomy==

A hierarchical taxonomy of quadrilaterals is illustrated by the figure to the right. Lower classes are special cases of higher classes they are connected to. Note that &quot;trapezoid&quot; here is referring to the North American definition (the British equivalent is a trapezium). Inclusive definitions are used throughout.

==Skew quadrilaterals==

A non-planar quadrilateral is called a skew quadrilateral. Formulas to compute its dihedral angles from the edge lengths and the angle between two adjacent edges were derived for work on the properties of molecules such as cyclobutane that contain a &quot;puckered&quot; ring of four atoms. Historically the term gauche quadrilateral was also used to mean a skew quadrilateral. A skew quadrilateral together with its diagonals form a (possibly non-regular) tetrahedron, and conversely every skew quadrilateral comes from a tetrahedron where a pair of opposite edges is removed.

<text>Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from a sender at one location to a receiver some distance away. While teleportation is commonly portrayed in science fiction as a means to transfer physical objects from one location to the next, quantum teleportation only transfers quantum information. The sender does not have to know the particular quantum state being transferred. Moreover, the location of the recipient can be unknown, but to complete the quantum teleportation, classical information needs to be sent from sender to receiver. Because classical information needs to be sent, quantum teleportation cannot occur faster than the speed of light.

One of the first scientific articles to investigate quantum teleportation is &quot;Teleporting an Unknown Quantum State via Dual Classical and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Channels&quot; published by C. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Crépeau, R. Jozsa, A. Peres, and W. K. Wootters in 1993, in which they proposed using dual communication methods to send/receive quantum information. It was experimentally realized in 1997 by two research groups, led by Sandu Popescu and Anton Zeilinger, respectively.

Experimental determinations of quantum teleportation have been made in information contentincluding photons, atoms, electrons, and superconducting circuitsas well as distance, with 1,400 km (870 mi) being the longest distance of successful teleportation by Jian-Wei Pan&#x27;s team using the Micius satellite for space-based quantum teleportation.

==Non-technical summary==

In matters relating to quantum information theory, it is convenient to work with the simplest possible unit of information: the two-state system of the qubit. The qubit functions as the quantum analog of the classic computational part, the bit, as it can have a measurement value of &quot;both&quot; a 0 &quot;and&quot; a 1, whereas the classical bit can only be measured as a 0 &quot;or&quot; a 1. The quantum two-state system seeks to transfer quantum information from one location to another location without losing the information and preserving the quality of this information. This process involves moving the information &quot;between carriers&quot; and not movement of the &quot;actual carriers&quot;, similar to the traditional process of communications, as two parties remain stationary while the information (digital media, voice, text, etc.) is being transferred, contrary to the implications of the word &quot;teleport&quot;. The main components needed for teleportation include a sender, the information (a qubit), a traditional channel, a quantum channel, and a receiver. The sender does not need to know the exact contents of the information being sent. The measurement postulate of quantum mechanicswhen a measurement is made upon a quantum state, any subsequent measurements will &quot;collapse&quot; or that the observed state will be lostcreates an imposition within teleportation: if a sender measures their information, the state could collapse when the receiver obtains the data since the state had changed from when the sender made the initial measurement and in so making it different.

For actual teleportation, it is required that an entangled quantum state be created for the qubit to be transferred. Entanglement imposes statistical correlations between otherwise distinct physical systems by creating or placing two or more separate particles into a single, shared quantum state. This intermediate state contains two particles whose quantum states are related to each other: measuring one particle&#x27;s state provides information about the measurement of the other particle&#x27;s state. These correlations hold even when measurements are chosen and performed independently, out of causal contact from one another, as verified in Bell test experiments. Thus, an observation resulting from a measurement choice made at one point in spacetime seems to instantaneously affect outcomes in another region, even though light hasn&#x27;t yet had time to travel the distance, a conclusion seemingly at odds with special relativity. This is known as the EPR paradox. However, such correlations can never be used to transmit any information faster than the speed of light, a statement encapsulated in the no-communication theorem. Thus, teleportation as a whole can never be superluminal, as a qubit cannot be reconstructed until the accompanying classical information arrives.

The sender will combine the particle, whose information is teleported, with one of the entangled particles, causing a change of the overall entangled quantum state. Of this changed state, the particles in the receiver&#x27;s possession are then sent to an analyzer that will measure the change of the entangled state. The &quot;change&quot; measurement will allow the receiver to recreate the original information that the sender had, resulting in the information being teleported or carried between two people that have different locations. Since the initial quantum information is &quot;destroyed&quot; as it becomes part of the entangled state, the no-cloning theorem is maintained as the information is recreated from the entangled state and not copied during teleportation.

The quantum channel is the communication mechanism that is used for all quantum information transmission and is the channel used for teleportation (relationship of quantum channel to traditional communication channel is akin to the qubit being the quantum analog of the classical bit). However, in addition to the quantum channel, a traditional channel must also be used to accompany a qubit to &quot;preserve&quot; the quantum information. When the change measurement between the original qubit and the entangled particle is made, the measurement result must be carried by a traditional channel so that the quantum information can be reconstructed and the receiver can get the original information. Because of this need for the traditional channel, the speed of teleportation can be no faster than the speed of light (hence the no-communication theorem is not violated). The main advantage with this is that Bell states can be shared using photons from lasers, making teleportation achievable through open space, as there is no need to send information through physical cables or optical fibers.

Quantum states can be encoded in various degrees of freedom of atoms. For example, qubits can be encoded in the degrees of freedom of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus or in the degrees of freedom of the nucleus itself. Thus, performing this kind of teleportation requires a stock of atoms at the receiving site, available for having qubits imprinted on them.

 the quantum states of single photons, photon modes, single atoms, atomic ensembles, defect centers in solids, single electrons, and superconducting circuits have been employed as information bearers.

Understanding quantum teleportation requires a good grounding in finite-dimensional linear algebra, Hilbert spaces and projection matrices. A qubit is described using a two-dimensional complex number-valued vector space (a Hilbert space), which are the primary basis for the formal manipulations given below. A working knowledge of quantum mechanics is not absolutely required to understand the mathematics of quantum teleportation, although without such acquaintance, the deeper meaning of the equations may remain quite mysterious.

==Protocol==
The resources required for quantum teleportation are a communication channel capable of transmitting two classical bits, a means of generating an entangled Bell state of qubits and distributing to two different locations, performing a Bell measurement on one of the Bell state qubits, and manipulating the quantum state of the other qubit from the pair. Of course, there must also be some input qubit (in the quantum state formula_1) to be teleported. The protocol is then as follows:

# A Bell state is generated with one qubit sent to location A and the other sent to location B.
# A Bell measurement of the Bell state qubit and the qubit to be teleported (formula_1 ) is performed at location A. This yields one of four measurement outcomes which can be encoded in two classical bits of information. Both qubits at location A are then discarded.
# Using the classical channel, the two bits are sent from A to B. (This is the only potentially time-consuming step after step 1 since information transfer is limited by the speed of light.)
# As a result of the measurement performed at location A, the Bell state qubit at location B is in one of four possible states. Of these four possible states, one is identical to the original quantum state formula_1 , and the other three are closely related. The identity of the state actually obtained is encoded in two classical bits and sent to location B. The Bell state qubit at location B is then modified in one of three ways, or not at all, which results in a qubit identical to formula_1, the state of the qubit that was chosen for teleportation.

It is worth noticing that the above protocol assumes that the qubits are individually addressable, meaning that the qubits are distinguishable and physically labeled. However, there can be situations where two identical qubits are indistinguishable due to the spatial overlap of their wave functions. Under this condition, the qubits cannot be individually controlled or measured. Nevertheless, a teleportation protocol analogous to that described above can still be (conditionally) implemented by exploiting two independently prepared qubits, with no need of an initial Bell state. This can be made by addressing the internal degrees of freedom of the qubits (e.g., spins or polarisations) by spatially localized measurements performed in separated regions A and B where the two spatially overlapping, indistinguishable qubits can be found. This theoretical prediction has been then verified experimentally via polarized photons in a quantum optical setup.

== Experimental results and records ==
Work in 1998 verified the initial predictions, and the distance of teleportation was increased in August 2004 to 600 meters, using optical fiber. Subsequently, the record distance for quantum teleportation has been gradually increased to , then to , and is now , set in open air experiments in the Canary Islands, done between the two astronomical observatories of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. There has been a recent record set () using superconducting nanowire detectors that reached the distance of over optical fiber. For material systems, the record distance is .

A variant of teleportation called &quot;open-destination&quot; teleportation, with receivers located at multiple locations, was demonstrated in 2004 using five-photon entanglement. Teleportation of a composite state of two single qubits has also been realized. In April 2011, experimenters reported that they had demonstrated teleportation of wave packets of light up to a bandwidth of 10 MHz while preserving strongly nonclassical superposition states. In August 2013, the achievement of &quot;fully deterministic&quot; quantum teleportation, using a hybrid technique, was reported. On 29 May 2014, scientists announced a reliable way of transferring data by quantum teleportation. Quantum teleportation of data had been done before but with highly unreliable methods. On 26 February 2015, scientists at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, led by Chao-yang Lu and Jian-Wei Pan carried out the first experiment teleporting multiple degrees of freedom of a quantum particle. They managed to teleport the quantum information from ensemble of rubidium atoms to another ensemble of rubidium atoms over a distance of using entangled photons. In 2016, researchers demonstrated quantum teleportation with two independent sources which are separated by in Hefei optical fiber network. In September 2016, researchers at the University of Calgary demonstrated quantum teleportation over the Calgary metropolitan fiber network over a distance of . In December 2020, as part of the INQNET collaboration, researchers achieved quantum teleportation over a total distance of 44 km (27.3 mi) with fidelities exceeding 90%.

Researchers have also successfully used quantum teleportation to transmit information between clouds of gas atoms, notable because the clouds of gas are macroscopic atomic ensembles.

It is also possible to teleport &quot;logical operations&quot;, see quantum gate teleportation. In 2018, physicists at Yale demonstrated a deterministic teleported CNOT operation between logically encoded qubits.

First proposed theoretically in 1993, quantum teleportation has since been demonstrated in many different guises. It has been carried out using two-level states of a single photon, a single atom and a trapped ion – among other quantum objects – and also using two photons. In 1997, two groups experimentally achieved quantum teleportation. The first group, led by Sandu Popescu, was based in Italy. An experimental group led by Anton Zeilinger followed a few months later.

The results obtained from experiments done by Popescu&#x27;s group concluded that classical channels alone could not replicate the teleportation of linearly polarized state and an elliptically polarized state. The Bell state measurement distinguished between the four Bell states, which can allow for a 100% success rate of teleportation, in an ideal representation.

Zeilinger&#x27;s group produced a pair of entangled photons by implementing the process of parametric down-conversion. In order to ensure that the two photons cannot be distinguished by their arrival times, the photons were generated using a pulsed pump beam. The photons were then sent through narrow-bandwidth filters to produce a coherence time that is much longer than the length of the pump pulse. They then used a two-photon interferometry for analyzing the entanglement so that the quantum property could be recognized when it is transferred from one photon to the other.

Photon 1 was polarized at 45° in the first experiment conducted by Zeilinger&#x27;s group. Quantum teleportation is verified when both photons are detected in the formula_5 state, which has a probability of 25%. Two detectors, f1 and f2, are placed behind the beam splitter, and recording the coincidence will identify the formula_5 state. If there is a coincidence between detectors f1 and f2, then photon 3 is predicted to be polarized at a 45° angle. Photon 3 is passed through a polarizing beam splitter that selects +45° and −45° polarization. If quantum teleportation has happened, only detector d2, which is at the +45° output, will register a detection. Detector d1, located at the −45° output, will not detect a photon. If there is a coincidence between d2f1f2, with the 45° analysis, and a lack of a d1f1f2 coincidence, with −45° analysis, it is proof that the information from the polarized photon 1 has been teleported to photon 3 using quantum teleportation.

=== Quantum teleportation over 143 km ===

Zeilinger&#x27;s group developed an experiment using active feed-forward in real time and two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife, a distance of over 143 kilometers. The results were published in 2012. In order to achieve teleportation, a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement assisted clock synchronization were implemented. The two locations were entangled to share the auxiliary state:

:formula_7

La Palma and Tenerife can be compared to the quantum characters Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob share the entangled state above, with photon 2 being with Alice and photon 3 being with Bob. A third party, Charlie, provides photon 1 (the input photon) which will be teleported to Alice in the generalized polarization state:

:formula_8

where the complex numbers formula_9 and formula_10 are unknown to Alice or Bob.

Alice will perform a Bell-state measurement (BSM) that randomly projects the two photons onto one of the four Bell states with each one having a probability of 25%. Photon 3 will be projected onto formula_11, the input state. Alice transmits the outcome of the BSM to Bob, via the classical channel, where Bob is able to apply the corresponding unitary operation to obtain photon 3 in the initial state of photon 1. Bob will not have to do anything if he detects the formula_12 state. Bob will need to apply a formula_13 phase shift to photon 3 between the horizontal and vertical component if the formula_14 state is detected.

The results of Zeilinger&#x27;s group concluded that the average fidelity (overlap of the ideal teleported state with the measured density matrix) was 0.863 with a standard deviation of 0.038. The link attenuation during their experiments varied between 28.1 dB and 39.0 dB, which was a result of strong winds and rapid temperature changes. Despite the high loss in the quantum free-space channel, the average fidelity surpassed the classical limit of 2/3. Therefore, Zeilinger&#x27;s group successfully demonstrated quantum teleportation over a distance of 143 km.

=== Quantum teleportation across the Danube River ===
In 2004, a quantum teleportation experiment was conducted across the Danube River in Vienna, a total of 600 meters. An 800-meter-long optical fiber wire was installed in a public sewer system underneath the Danube River, and it was exposed to temperature changes and other environmental influences. Alice must perform a joint Bell state measurement (BSM) on photon b, the input photon, and photon c, her part of the entangled photon pair (photons c and d). Photon d, Bob&#x27;s receiver photon, will contain all of the information on the input photon b, except for a phase rotation that depends on the state that Alice observed. This experiment implemented an active feed-forward system that sends Alice&#x27;s measurement results via a classical microwave channel with a fast electro-optical modulator in order to exactly replicate Alice&#x27;s input photon. The teleportation fidelity obtained from the linear polarization state at 45° varied between 0.84 and 0.90, which is well above the classical fidelity limit of 0.66.

=== Deterministic quantum teleportation with atoms ===
Three qubits are required for this process: the source qubit from the sender, the ancillary qubit, and the receiver&#x27;s target qubit, which is maximally entangled with the ancillary qubit. For this experiment, &lt;chem&gt;^{40}Ca+&lt;/chem&gt; ions were used as the qubits. Ions 2 and 3 are prepared in the Bell state formula_15. The state of ion 1 is prepared arbitrarily. The quantum states of ions 1 and 2 are measured by illuminating them with light at a specific wavelength. The obtained fidelities for this experiment ranged between 73% and 76%. This is larger than the maximum possible average fidelity of 66.7% that can be obtained using completely classical resources.

=== Ground-to-satellite quantum teleportation ===
The quantum state being teleported in this experiment is formula_16, where formula_9 and formula_10 are unknown complex numbers, formula_19 represents the horizontal polarization state, and formula_20 represents the vertical polarization state. The qubit prepared in this state is generated in a laboratory in Ngari, Tibet. The goal was to teleport the quantum information of the qubit to the Micius satellite that was launched on August 16, 2016, at an altitude of around 500 km. When a Bell state measurement is conducted on photons 1 and 2 and the resulting state is formula_21, photon 3 carries this desired state. If the Bell state detected is formula_22, then a phase shift of formula_13 is applied to the state to get the desired quantum state. The distance between the ground station and the satellite changes from as little as 500 km to as large as 1,400 km. Because of the changing distance, the channel loss of the uplink varies between 41 dB and 52 dB. The average fidelity obtained from this experiment was 0.80 with a standard deviation of 0.01. Therefore, this experiment successfully established a ground-to-satellite uplink over a distance of 500–1,400 km using quantum teleportation. This is an essential step towards creating a global-scale quantum internet.

=== Quantum teleportation over internet cables ===
Quantum teleportation has been demonstrated over fiber optic cables simultaneously carrying regular telecommunications traffic. This eliminates the need for separate, dedicated infrastructure for quantum networking and shows that quantum teleportation and classical communications can coexist on the same fiber optic cables. A less crowded wavelength of light was used for the quantum signal and special filters were required to reduce noise from other traffic.

== Formal presentation ==
There are a variety of ways in which the teleportation protocol can be written mathematically. Some are very compact but abstract, and some are verbose but straightforward and concrete. The presentation below is of the latter form: verbose, but has the benefit of showing each quantum state simply and directly. Later sections review more compact notations.

The teleportation protocol begins with a quantum state or qubit formula_24, in Alice&#x27;s possession, that she wants to convey to Bob. This qubit can be written generally, in bra–ket notation, as:

:formula_25

The subscript &quot;C&quot; above is used only to distinguish this state from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, below.

Next, the protocol requires that Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state. This state is fixed in advance, by mutual agreement between Alice and Bob, and can be any one of the four Bell states shown. It does not matter which one.

:formula_26,
:formula_27,
:formula_28.
:formula_29,

In the following, assume that Alice and Bob share the state formula_30
Alice obtains one of the particles in the pair, with the other going to Bob. (This is implemented by preparing the particles together and shooting them to Alice and Bob from a common source.) The subscripts &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the entangled state refer to Alice&#x27;s or Bob&#x27;s particle.

At this point, Alice has two particles (&quot;C&quot;, the one she wants to teleport, and &quot;A&quot;, one of the entangled pair), and Bob has one particle, &quot;B&quot;. In the total system, the state of these three particles is given by

:formula_31

Alice will then make a local measurement in the Bell basis (i.e. the four Bell states) on the two particles in her possession. To make the result of her measurement clear, it is best to write the state of Alice&#x27;s two qubits as superpositions of the Bell basis. This is done by using the following general identities, which are easily verified:

:formula_32

:formula_33

:formula_34

and

:formula_35
After expanding the expression for formula_36, one applies these identities to the qubits with &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; subscripts. In particular,formula_37and the other terms follow similarly. Combining similar terms, the total three particle state of &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; together becomes the following four-term superposition:

: formula_38

Note that all three particles are still in the same total state since no operations have been performed. Rather, the above is just a change of basis on Alice&#x27;s part of the system. This change has moved the entanglement from particles A and B to particles C and A. The actual teleportation occurs when Alice measures her two qubits (C and A) in the Bell basis

:formula_39

Equivalently, the measurement may be done in the computational basis, formula_40, by mapping each Bell state uniquely to one of formula_41 with the quantum circuit in the figure to the right.

The result of Alice&#x27;s (local) measurement is a collection of two classical bits (00, 01, 10 or 11) related to one of the following four states (with equal probability of 1/4), after the three-particle state has collapsed into one of the states:

*formula_42
*formula_43
*formula_44
*formula_45

Alice&#x27;s two particles are now entangled to each other, in one of the four Bell states, and the entanglement originally shared between Alice&#x27;s and Bob&#x27;s particles is now broken. Bob&#x27;s particle takes on one of the four superposition states shown above. Note how Bob&#x27;s qubit is now in a state that resembles the state to be teleported. The four possible states for Bob&#x27;s qubit are unitary images of the state to be teleported.

The result of Alice&#x27;s Bell measurement tells her which of the above four states the system is in. She can now send her result to Bob through a classical channel. Two classical bits can communicate which of the four results she obtained. After Bob receives the message from Alice, he will know which of the four states his particle is in. Using this information, he performs a unitary operation on his particle to transform it to the desired state formula_46:

*If Alice indicates her result is formula_47, Bob knows his qubit is already in the desired state and does nothing. This amounts to the trivial unitary operation, the identity operator.
*If the message indicates formula_48, Bob would send his qubit through the unitary quantum gate given by the Pauli matrix

:formula_49

to recover the state.

*If Alice&#x27;s message corresponds to formula_50, Bob applies the gate

:formula_51

to his qubit.

*Finally, for the remaining case, the appropriate gate is given by

:formula_52

Teleportation is thus achieved. The above-mentioned three gates correspond to rotations of π radians (180°) about appropriate axes (X, Y and Z) in the Bloch sphere picture of a qubit.

Some remarks:

* After this operation, Bob&#x27;s qubit will take on the state formula_53, and Alice&#x27;s qubit becomes an (undefined) part of an entangled state. Teleportation does not result in the copying of qubits, and hence is consistent with the no-cloning theorem.
* There is no transfer of matter or energy involved. Alice&#x27;s particle has not been physically moved to Bob; only its state has been transferred. The term &quot;teleportation&quot;, coined by Bennett, Brassard, Crépeau, Jozsa, Peres and Wootters, reflects the indistinguishability of quantum mechanical particles.
* For every qubit teleported, Alice needs to send Bob two classical bits of information. These two classical bits do not carry complete information about the qubit being teleported. If an eavesdropper intercepts the two bits, she may know exactly what Bob needs to do in order to recover the desired state. However, this information is useless if she cannot interact with the entangled particle in Bob&#x27;s possession.

== Certifying quantum teleportation ==
When implementing the quantum teleportation protocol, different experimental noises may arise affecting the state transference. The usual way to benchmark a particular teleportation procedure is by using the average fidelity: Given an arbitrary teleportation protocol producing output states formula_54 with probability formula_55 for an initial state formula_56, the average fidelity is defined as:

formula_57

where the integration is performed over the Haar measure defined by assuming maximal uncertainty over the initial quantum states formula_58, and formula_59 is the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. 

The widely known classical threshold is obtained by optimizing the average fidelity over all classical protocols (i.e. when the sender Alice and the receiver Bob can use just a classical channel to communicate with each other). When teleportation involves qubit states, the maximal classical average fidelity is formula_60. In this way, a particular protocol with average fidelity formula_61 is certified as &quot;useful&quot; if formula_62.

However, using the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity as the &quot;unique&quot; distance measure for benchmarking teleportation is not justified, and one may choose different distinguishability measures. For example, there may exist reasons depending on the context in which other measures might be more suitable than fidelity. In this way, the average distance of teleportation is defined as:

formula_63

being formula_64 a well-behaved (i.e. satisfying identity of indiscernibles and unitary invariance) distinguishability measure between quantum states. Consequently, different classical thresholds exist, depending on the considered distance measure (classical thresholds for Trace distance, quantum Jensen–Shannon divergence, transmission distance, Bures distance, wootters distance, and quantum Hellinger distance, among others, were obtained in Ref. ). This points out a particular issue when certifying quantum teleportation: Given a teleportation protocol, its certification is not a universal fact in the sense that depends on the distance used. Then, a particular protocol might be certified as useful for a set of distance quantifiers, and non-useful for other distinguishability measures. 

== Alternative notations ==


There are a variety of different notations in use that describe the teleportation protocol. One common one is by using the notation of quantum gates.

In the above derivation, the unitary transformation that is the change of basis (from the standard product basis into the Bell basis) can be written using quantum gates. Direct calculation shows that this gate is given by

:formula_65

where &quot;H&quot; is the one qubit Walsh-Hadamard gate and formula_66 is the Controlled NOT gate.

== Entanglement swapping ==

Teleportation can be applied not just to pure states, but also mixed states, that can be regarded as the state of a single subsystem of an entangled pair. The so-called entanglement swapping is a simple and illustrative example.

If Alice and Bob share an entangled pair, and Bob teleports his particle to Carol, then Alice&#x27;s particle is now entangled with Carol&#x27;s particle. This situation can also be viewed symmetrically as follows:

Alice and Bob share an entangled pair, and Bob and Carol share a different entangled pair. Now let Bob perform a projective measurement on his two particles in the Bell basis and communicate the result to Carol. These actions are precisely the teleportation protocol described above with Bob&#x27;s first particle, the one entangled with Alice&#x27;s particle, as the state to be teleported. When Carol finishes the protocol she now has a particle with the teleported state, that is an entangled state with Alice&#x27;s particle. Thus, although Alice and Carol never interacted with each other, their particles are now entangled.

A detailed diagrammatic derivation of entanglement swapping has been given by Bob Coecke, presented in terms of categorical quantum mechanics.

=== Algorithm for swapping Bell pairs ===
An important application of entanglement swapping is distributing Bell states for use in entanglement distributed quantum networks. A technical description of the entanglement swapping protocol is given here for pure Bell states.

# Alice and Bob locally prepare known Bell pairs resulting in the initial state: formula_67
# Alice sends qubit formula_68 to a third party Carol
# Bob sends qubit formula_69 to Carol
# Carol performs a Bell projection between formula_70 and formula_71 that by chance (all four Bell states are possible and recognizable) results in the measurement outcome: formula_72
# In the case of the other three Bell projection outcomes, local corrections given by Pauli operators are made by Alice and or Bob after Carol has communicated the results of the measurement. formula_73 formula_74 formula_75
# Alice and Bob now have a Bell pair between qubits formula_76 and formula_77 formula_78

== Generalizations of the teleportation protocol ==
The basic teleportation protocol for a qubit described above has been generalized in several directions, in particular regarding the dimension of the system teleported and the number of parties involved (either as sender, controller, or receiver).

=== &quot;d&quot;-dimensional systems ===
A generalization to formula_79-level systems (so-called qudits) is straight forward and was already discussed in the original paper by Bennett &quot;et al.&quot;: the maximally entangled state of two qubits has to be replaced by a maximally entangled state of two qudits and the Bell measurement by a measurement defined by a maximally entangled orthonormal basis. All possible such generalizations were discussed by Werner in 2001.
The generalization to infinite-dimensional so-called continuous-variable systems was proposed by Braunstein and Kimble and led to the first teleportation experiment that worked unconditionally.

=== Multipartite versions ===
The use of multipartite entangled states instead of a bipartite maximally entangled state allows for several new features: either the sender can teleport information to several receivers either sending the same state to all of them (which allows to reduce the amount of entanglement needed for the process) or teleporting multipartite states or sending a single state in such a way that the receiving parties need to cooperate to extract the information. A different way of viewing the latter setting is that some of the parties can control whether the others can teleport.

== Logic gate teleportation ==
In general, mixed states ρ may be transported, and a linear transformation ω applied during teleportation, thus allowing data processing of quantum information. This is one of the foundational building blocks of quantum information processing. This is demonstrated below.

=== General description ===

A general teleportation scheme can be described as follows. Three quantum systems are involved. System 1 is the (unknown) state &quot;ρ&quot; to be teleported by Alice. Systems 2 and 3 are in a maximally entangled state &quot;ω&quot; that are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively. The total system is then in the state

:formula_80

A successful teleportation process is a LOCC quantum channel Φ that satisfies

:formula_81

where Tr12 is the partial trace operation with respect systems 1 and 2, and formula_82 denotes the composition of maps. This describes the channel in the Schrödinger picture.

Taking adjoint maps in the Heisenberg picture, the success condition becomes

:formula_83

for all observable &quot;O&quot; on Bob&#x27;s system. The tensor factor in formula_84 is formula_85 while that of formula_86 is formula_87.

=== Further details ===

The proposed channel Φ can be described more explicitly. To begin teleportation, Alice performs a local measurement on the two subsystems (1 and 2) in her possession. Assume the local measurement have &quot;effects&quot;

:formula_88

If the measurement registers the &quot;i&quot;-th outcome, the overall state collapses to

:formula_89

The tensor factor in formula_90 is formula_85 while that of formula_86 is formula_87. Bob then applies a corresponding local operation Ψ&quot;i&quot; on system 3. On the combined system, this is described by

:formula_94

where &quot;Id&quot; is the identity map on the composite system formula_95.

Therefore, the channel Φ is defined by

:formula_96

Notice Φ satisfies the definition of LOCC. As stated above, the teleportation is said to be successful if, for all observable &quot;O&quot; on Bob&#x27;s system, the equality

:formula_97

holds. The left hand side of the equation is:

:formula_98

:formula_99

where Ψ&quot;i*&quot; is the adjoint of Ψ&quot;i&quot; in the Heisenberg picture. Assuming all objects are finite dimensional, this becomes

:formula_100

The success criterion for teleportation has the expression

:formula_101

==Local explanation of the phenomenon==

A local explanation of quantum teleportation is put forward by David Deutsch and Patrick Hayden, with respect to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Their paper asserts that the two bits that Alice sends Bob contain &quot;locally inaccessible information&quot; resulting in the teleportation of the quantum state. &quot;The ability of quantum information to flow through a classical channel [...], surviving decoherence, is [...] the basis of quantum teleportation.&quot;

== Recent developments ==
While quantum teleportation is in an infancy stage, there are many aspects pertaining to teleportation that scientists are working to better understand or improve the process that include:

=== Higher dimensions ===

Quantum teleportation can improve the errors associated with fault tolerant quantum computation via an arrangement of logic gates. Experiments by D. Gottesman and I. L. Chuang have determined that a &quot;Clifford hierarchy&quot; gate arrangement which acts to enhance protection against environmental errors. Overall, a higher threshold of error is allowed with the Clifford hierarchy as the sequence of gates requires less resources that are needed for computation. While the more gates that are used in a quantum computer create more noise, the gates arrangement and use of teleportation in logic transfer can reduce this noise as it calls for less &quot;traffic&quot; that is compiled in these quantum networks. The more qubits used for a quantum computer, the more levels are added to a gate arrangement, with the diagonalization of gate arrangement varying in degree. Higher dimension analysis involves the higher level gate arrangement of the Clifford hierarchy.

=== Information quality ===

Considering the previously mentioned requirement of an intermediate entangled state for quantum teleportation, there needs to be consideration of the purity of this state for information quality. A protection that has been developed involves the use of continuous variable information (rather than a typical discrete variable) creating a superimposed coherent intermediate state. This involves making a phase shift in the received information and then adding a mixing step upon reception using a preferred state, which could be an odd or even coherent state, that will be &quot;conditioned to the classical information of the sender&quot;, creating a two mode state that contains the originally sent information.

There have also been developments with teleporting information between systems that already have quantum information in them. Experiments done by Feng, Xu, Zhou et al. have demonstrated that teleportation of a qubit to a photon that already has a qubit&#x27;s worth of information is possible due to using an optical qubit-ququart entangling gate. This quality can increase computation possibilities as calculations can be done based on previously stored information, allowing for improvements on past calculations.

<text>In quantum computing, a qubit () or quantum bit is a basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two spin states (left-handed and the right-handed circular polarization) can also be measured as horizontal and vertical linear polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of multiple states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

==Etymology==
The coining of the term &quot;qubit&quot; is attributed to Benjamin Schumacher. In the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term &quot;qubit&quot; was created in jest during a conversation with William Wootters.

==Bit versus qubit==
A binary digit, characterized as 0 or 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. When averaged over both of its states (0,1), a binary digit can represent up to one bit of information content, where a bit is the basic unit of information. However, in this article, the word bit is synonymous with a binary digit.

In classical computer technologies, a &quot;processed&quot; bit is implemented by one of two levels of low direct current voltage, and whilst switching from one of these two levels to the other, a so-called &quot;forbidden zone&quot; between two logic levels must be passed as fast as possible, as electrical voltage cannot change from one level to another instantly.

There are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit—usually taken to have the value &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, like a bit. However, whereas the state of a bit can only be binary (either 0 or 1), the general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can arbitrarily be a coherent superposition of &quot;all&quot; computable states simultaneously. Moreover, whereas a measurement of a classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition state. It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit. However, a qubit can hold more information, e.g., up to two bits using superdense coding.

A bit is always completely in either one of its two states, and a set of bits (e.g. a processor register or some bit array) can only hold a single of its possible states at any time. A quantum state can be in a superposition state, which means that the qubit can have non-zero probability amplitude in both its states simultaneously (popularly expressed as &quot;it can be in both states simultaneously&quot;). A qubit requires two complex numbers to describe its two probability amplitudes, and these two complex numbers can together be viewed as a 2-dimensional complex vector, which is called a &quot;quantum state vector&quot;, or &quot;superposition state vector.&quot; Alternatively and equivalently, the value stored in a qubit can be described as a single point in a 2-dimensional complex coordinate space. Similarly, a set of &quot;n&quot; qubits, which is also called a register, requires complex numbers to describe its superposition state vector.

==Standard representation==
In quantum mechanics, the general quantum state of a qubit can be represented by a linear superposition of its two orthonormal basis states (or basis vectors). These vectors are usually denoted as formula_1 and formula_2. They are written in the conventional Dirac—or &quot;bra–ket&quot;—notation; the formula_3 and formula_4 are pronounced &quot;ket 0&quot; and &quot;ket 1&quot;, respectively. These two orthonormal basis states, &lt;math&gt;\

==Qubit storage==
In 2008 a team of scientists from the U.K. and U.S. reported the first relatively long (1.75 seconds) and coherent transfer of a superposition state in an electron spin &quot;processing&quot; qubit to a nuclear spin &quot;memory&quot; qubit. This event can be considered the first relatively consistent quantum data storage, a vital step towards the development of quantum computing. In 2013, a modification of similar systems (using charged rather than neutral donors) has dramatically extended this time, to 3 hours at very low temperatures and 39 minutes at room temperature. Room temperature preparation of a qubit based on electron spins instead of nuclear spin was also demonstrated by a team of scientists from Switzerland and Australia. An increased coherence of qubits is being explored by researchers who are testing the limitations of a Ge hole spin-orbit qubit structure.

<doc id="25286" wikidata="Q5218" url="?curid=25286" title="Quechuan languages">
<text>Quechua (, ), also called  (, &#x27;people&#x27;s language&#x27;) in Southern Quechua, is an indigenous language family that originated in central Peru and thereafter spread to other countries of the Andes. Derived from a common ancestral &quot;Proto-Quechua&quot; language, it is today the most widely spoken pre-Columbian language family of the Americas, with the number of speakers estimated at 8–10 million speakers in 2004, and just under 7 million from the most recent census data available up to 2011. Approximately 13.9% (3.7 million) of Peruvians speak a Quechua language.

Although Quechua began expanding many centuries before the Incas, that previous expansion also meant that it was the primary language family within the Inca Empire. The Spanish also tolerated its use until the Peruvian struggle for independence in the 1780s. As a result, various Quechua languages are still widely spoken today, being co-official in many regions and the most spoken language lineage in Peru, after Spanish.

==History==

The Quechua linguistic homeland may have been Central Peru. It has been speculated that it may have been used in the Chavín and Wari civilizations. 

Quechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the Inca Empire. The Inca were one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke a form of Quechua, which in the Cuzco region particularly has been heavily influenced by Aymara, hence some of the characteristics that still distinguish the Cuzco form of Quechua today. Diverse Quechua regional dialects and languages had already developed in different areas, influenced by local languages, before the Inca Empire expanded and further promoted Quechua as the official language of the Empire.

After the Spanish conquest of Peru in the 16th century, Quechua continued to be used widely by the indigenous peoples as the &quot;common language&quot;. It was officially recognized by the Spanish administration, and many Spaniards learned it in order to communicate with local peoples. The clergy of the Catholic Church adopted Quechua to use as the language of evangelization. The oldest written records of the language are by missionary Domingo de Santo Tomás, who arrived in Peru in 1538 and learned the language from 1540. He published his &quot;Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Perú&quot; (Grammar or Art of the General Language of the Indians of the Kingdoms of Peru) in 1560. Given its use by the Catholic missionaries, the range of Quechua continued to expand in some areas.

In the late 18th century, colonial officials ended the administrative and religious use of Quechua. They banned it from public use in Peru after the Túpac Amaru II rebellion of indigenous peoples. The Crown banned &quot;loyal&quot; pro-Catholic texts in Quechua, such as Garcilaso de la Vega&#x27;s &quot;Comentarios Reales.&quot;

Despite a brief revival of the language immediately after the Latin American nations achieved independence in the 19th century, the prestige of Quechua had decreased sharply. Gradually its use declined so that it was spoken mostly by indigenous people in the more isolated and conservative rural areas. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, Quechua language speakers number roughly 7 million people across South America, more than any other indigenous language family in the Americas.

As a result of Inca expansion into Central Chile, there were bilingual Quechua-Mapudungu Mapuche in Central Chile at the time of the Spanish arrival. It has been argued that Mapuche, Quechua, and Spanish coexisted in Central Chile, with significant bilingualism, during the 17th century. Alongside Mapudungun, Quechua is the indigenous language that has influenced Chilean Spanish the most.

Quechua-Aymara and mixed Quechua-Aymara-Mapudungu toponymy can be found as far south as Osorno Province in Chile (latitude 41° S).

In 2017 the first thesis defense done in Quechua in Europe was done by Peruvian Carmen Escalante Gutiérrez at Pablo de Olavide University (Sevilla). The same year Pablo Landeo wrote the first novel in Quechua without a Spanish translation. A Peruvian student, Roxana Quispe Collantes of the University of San Marcos, completed and defended the first thesis in the language group in 2019; it concerned the works of poet Andrés Alencastre Gutiérrez and it was also the first non-Spanish native language thesis done at that university.

Currently, there are different initiatives that promote Quechua in the Andes and across the world: many universities offer Quechua classes, a community-based organization such as Elva Ambía&#x27;s Quechua Collective of New York promote the language, and governments are training interpreters in Quechua to serve in healthcare, justice, and bureaucratic facilities.

==Current status==

In 1975, Peru became the first country to recognize Quechua as one of its official languages. Ecuador conferred official status on the language in its 2006 constitution, and in 2009, Bolivia adopted a new constitution that recognized Quechua and several other indigenous languages as official languages of the country.

The major obstacle to the usage and teaching of Quechua languages is the lack of written materials, such as books, newspapers, software, and magazines. The Bible has been translated into Quechua and is distributed by certain missionary groups. Quechua, along with Aymara and minor indigenous languages, remains essentially a spoken language.

In recent years, Quechua has been introduced in intercultural bilingual education (IBE) in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Even in these areas, the governments are reaching only a part of the Quechua-speaking populations. Some indigenous people in each of the countries are having their children study in Spanish for social advancement.

Radio Nacional del Perú broadcasts news and agrarian programs in Quechua for periods in the mornings.

Quechua and Spanish are now heavily intermixed in much of the Andean region, with many hundreds of Spanish loanwords in Quechua. Similarly, Quechua phrases and words are commonly used by Spanish speakers. In southern rural Bolivia, for instance, many Quechua words such as &quot;wawa&quot; (infant), &quot;misi&quot; (cat), &quot;waska&quot; (strap or thrashing), are as commonly used as their Spanish counterparts, even in entirely Spanish-speaking areas. Quechua has also had a significant influence on other native languages of the Americas, such as Mapuche.

===Number of speakers===
It is difficult to measure the number of Quechua speakers. The number of speakers given varies widely according to the sources. The total in &quot;Ethnologue&quot; 16 is 10 million, primarily based on figures published 1987–2002, but with a few dating from the 1960s. The figure for Imbabura Highland Quechua in &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, for example, is 300,000, an estimate from 1977.

The missionary organization FEDEPI, on the other hand, estimated one million Imbabura dialect speakers (published 2006). Census figures are also problematic, due to under-reporting. The 2001 Ecuador census reports only 500,000 Quechua speakers, compared to the estimate in most linguistic sources of more than 2 million. The censuses of Peru (2007) and Bolivia (2001) are thought to be more reliable.

*Bolivia: 2,100,000 (2001 census); 2,800,000 South Bolivian (1987)
*Chile: few, if any; 8,200 in ethnic group (2002 census)
*Colombia: 4,402 to 16,000
*Ecuador: 2,300,000 (Adelaar 1991)
*Peru: 3,800,000 (2017 census); 3,500,000 to 4,400,000 (Adelaar 2000)

Additionally, there is an unknown number of speakers in emigrant communities.

==Classification==

There are significant differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken in the central Peruvian highlands and the peripheral varieties of Ecuador, as well as those of southern Peru and Bolivia. They can be labeled Quechua I (or Quechua B, central) and Quechua II (or Quechua A, peripheral). Within the two groups, there are few sharp boundaries, making them dialect continua.

However, there is a secondary division in Quechua II between the grammatically simplified northern varieties of Ecuador, Quechua II-B, known there as Kichwa, and the generally more conservative varieties of the southern highlands, Quechua II-C, which include the old Inca capital of Cusco. The closeness is at least in part because of the influence of Cusco Quechua on the Ecuadorean varieties in the Inca Empire. Because Northern nobles were required to educate their children in Cusco, this was maintained as the prestige dialect in the north.

Speakers from different points within any of the three regions can generally understand one another reasonably well. There are nonetheless significant local-level differences across each. (Wanka Quechua, in particular, has several very distinctive characteristics that make the variety more challenging to understand, even for other Central Quechua speakers.) Speakers from different major regions, particularly Central or Southern Quechua, are not able to communicate effectively.

The lack of mutual intelligibility among the dialects is the basic criterion that defines Quechua not as a single language, but as a language family. The complex and progressive nature of how speech varies across the dialect continua makes it nearly impossible to differentiate discrete varieties; &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists 45 varieties which are then divided into two groups; Central and Peripheral. Due to the non-intelligibility between the two groups, they are all classified as separate languages.

As a reference point, the overall degree of diversity across the family is a little less than that of the Romance or Germanic families, and more of the order of Slavic or Arabic. The greatest diversity is within Central Quechua, or Quechua I, which is believed to lie close to the homeland of the ancestral Proto-Quechua language.

===Family tree===
Alfredo Torero devised the traditional classification, the three divisions above, plus a fourth, a northern or Peruvian branch. The latter causes complications in the classification, however, as various dialects (e.g. Cajamarca–Cañaris, Pacaraos, and Yauyos) have features of both Quechua I and Quechua II, and so are difficult to assign to either.

Torero classifies them as the following:
* Quechuan
** Quechua I or &quot;Quechua B,&quot; &quot;Central Quechua&quot; or &quot;Waywash,&quot; spoken in Peru&#x27;s central highlands and coast.
*** The most widely spoken varieties are Huaylas, Huaylla Wanca, and Conchucos.
** or &quot;Quechua A&quot; or &quot;Peripheral Quechua&quot; or &quot;Wanp&#x27;una&quot;, divided into
*** Yungay (Yunkay) Quechua or &quot;Quechua II A,&quot; spoken in the northern mountains of Peru; the most widely spoken dialect is Cajamarca.
*** Northern Quechua or &quot;Quechua II B,&quot; spoken in Ecuador (Kichwa), northern Peru, and Colombia (Inga Kichwa)
**** The most widely spoken varieties in this group are Chimborazo Highland Quichua and Imbabura Highland Quichua.
*** Southern Quechua or &quot;Quechua II C,&quot; spoken in Bolivia, Chile, southern Peru and Northwest Argentina.
**** The most widely spoken varieties are South Bolivian, Cusco, Ayacucho, and Puno (Collao).

Willem Adelaar adheres to the Quechua I / Quechua II (central/peripheral) bifurcation. But, partially following later modifications by Torero, he reassigns part of Quechua II-A to Quechua I:

Landerman (1991) does not believe a true genetic classification is possible and divides Quechua II so that the family has four geographical–typological branches: Northern, North Peruvian, Central, and Southern. He includes Chachapoyas and Lamas in North Peruvian Quechua so Ecuadorian is synonymous with Northern Quechua.

===Geographical distribution===
Quechua I (Central Quechua, &quot;Waywash&quot;) is spoken in Peru&#x27;s central highlands, from the Ancash Region to Huancayo. It is the most diverse branch of Quechua, to the extent that its divisions are commonly considered different languages.

Quechua II (Peripheral Quechua, &quot;Wamp&#x27;una&quot; &quot;Traveler&quot;)
*II-A: Yunkay Quechua (North Peruvian Quechua) is scattered in Peru&#x27;s occidental highlands.
*II-B: Northern Quechua (also known as &quot;Runashimi&quot; or, especially in Ecuador, &quot;Kichwa&quot;) is mainly spoken in Colombia and Ecuador. It is also spoken in the Amazonian lowlands of Colombia and Ecuador, and in pockets of Peru.
*II-C: Southern Quechua, in the highlands further south, from Huancavelica through the Ayacucho, Cusco, and Puno regions of Peru, across much of Bolivia, and in pockets in north-western Argentina. It is the most influential branch, with the largest number of speakers and the most important cultural and literary legacy.

===Cognates===
This is a sampling of words in several Quechuan languages:

===Quechua and Aymara===
Quechua shares a large amount of vocabulary, and some striking structural parallels, with Aymara, and the two families have sometimes been grouped together as a &quot;Quechumaran family&quot;. This hypothesis is generally rejected by specialists, however. The parallels are better explained by mutual influence and borrowing through intensive and long-term contact. Many Quechua–Aymara cognates are close, often closer than intra-Quechua cognates, and there is a little relationship in the affixal system. The Puquina language of the Tiwanaku Empire is a possible source for some of the shared vocabulary between Quechua and Aymara.

===Language contact===
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Kunza, Leko, Mapudungun, Mochika, Uru-Chipaya, Zaparo, Arawak, Kandoshi, Muniche, Pukina, Pano, Barbakoa, Cholon-Hibito, Jaqi, Jivaro, and Kawapana language families due to contact.
==Vocabulary==
Quechua has borrowed a large number of Spanish words, such as &quot;piru&quot; (from &quot;pero&quot;, &quot;but&quot;), &quot;bwenu&quot; (from , &quot;good&quot;), &quot;iskwila&quot; (from , &quot;school&quot;), &quot;waka&quot; (from , &quot;cow&quot;) and &quot;wuru&quot; (from , &quot;donkey&quot;).

A number of Quechua words have entered English and French via Spanish, including &quot;coca&quot;, &quot;condor&quot;, &quot;guano&quot;, &quot;jerky&quot;, &quot;llama&quot;, &quot;pampa&quot;, &quot;poncho&quot;, &quot;puma&quot;, &quot;quinine&quot;, &quot;quinoa&quot;, &quot;vicuña&quot; ( in French), and, possibly, &quot;gaucho&quot;. The word &quot;lagniappe&quot; comes from the Quechuan word &quot;yapay&quot; &quot;to increase, to add&quot;. The word first came into Spanish then Louisiana French, with the French or Spanish article &quot;la&quot; in front of it, &quot;la ñapa&quot; in Louisiana French or Creole, or in Spanish. A rare instance of a Quechua word being taken into general Spanish use is given by &quot;carpa&quot; for &quot;tent&quot; (Quechua &quot;karpa&quot;).

The Quechua influence on Latin American Spanish includes such borrowings as &quot;papa&quot; &quot;potato&quot;, &quot;chuchaqui&quot; &quot;hangover&quot; in Ecuador, and diverse borrowings for &quot;altitude sickness&quot;: &quot;suruqch&#x27;i&quot; in Bolivia, &quot;sorojchi&quot; in Ecuador, and &quot;soroche&quot; in Peru.

In Bolivia, particularly, Quechua words are used extensively even by non-Quechua speakers. These include &quot;wawa&quot; &quot;baby, infant&quot;, &quot;chʼaki&quot; &quot;hangover&quot;, &quot;misi&quot; &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;jukʼucho&quot; &quot;mouse&quot;, &quot;qʼumer uchu&quot; &quot;green pepper&quot;, &quot;jaku&quot; &quot;let&#x27;s go&quot;, &quot;chhiri&quot; and &quot;chhurco&quot; &quot;curly haired&quot;, among many others. Quechua grammar also enters Bolivian Spanish, such as the use of the suffix &quot;-ri&quot;. In Bolivian Quechua, &quot;-ri&quot; is added to verbs to signify an action is performed with affection or, in the imperative, as a rough equivalent to &quot;please&quot;. In Bolivia, &quot;-ri&quot; is often included in the Spanish imperative to imply &quot;please&quot; or to soften commands. For example, the standard &quot;pásame&quot; &quot;pass me [something]&quot; becomes &quot;pasarime&quot;.

===Etymology of Quechua===
At first, Spaniards referred to the language of the Inca empire as the &quot;lengua general&quot;, the &quot;general tongue&quot;. The name &quot;quichua&quot; was first used in 1560 by Domingo de Santo Tomás in his &quot;Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Perú&quot;. It is not known what name the native speakers gave to their language before colonial times and whether it was Spaniards who called it &quot;quechua&quot;.

There are two possible etymologies of Quechua as the name of the language. There is a possibility that the name Quechua was derived from &quot;*qiĉwa&quot;, the native word which originally meant the &quot;temperate valley&quot; altitude ecological zone in the Andes (suitable for maize cultivation) and to its inhabitants. Alternatively, Pedro Cieza de León and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the early Spanish chroniclers, mention the existence of a people called Quichua in the present Apurímac Region, and it could be inferred that their name was given to the entire language.

The Hispanicised spellings &quot;Quechua&quot; and &quot;Quichua&quot; have been used in Peru and Bolivia since the 17th century, especially after the Third Council of Lima. Today, the various local pronunciations of &quot;Quechua&quot; include , , , and .

Another name that native speakers give to their own language is &quot;runa simi&quot;, &quot;language of man/people&quot;; it also seems to have emerged during the colonial period.

==Phonology==

The description below applies to Cuzco Quechua; there are significant differences in other varieties of Quechua.

===Vowels===
Quechua only has three vowel phonemes: and , with no diphthongs, as in Aymara (including Jaqaru). Monolingual speakers pronounce them as respectively, but Spanish realizations may also be found. When the vowels appear adjacent to uvular consonants (, , and ), they are rendered more like [, , ], respectively.

===Consonants===

Gemination of the tap results in a trill .

About 30% of the modern Quechua vocabulary is borrowed from Spanish, and some Spanish sounds (such as , , , ) may have become phonemic even among monolingual Quechua speakers.

Voicing is not phonemic in Cusco Quechua. Cusco Quechua, North Bolivian Quechua, and South Bolivian Quechua are the only varieties to have glottalized consonants. They, along with certain kinds of Ecuadorian Kichwa, are the only varieties which have aspirated consonants. Because reflexes of a given Proto-Quechua word may have different stops in neighboring dialects (Proto-Quechua &quot;*čaki&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; becomes &quot;č&#x27;aki&quot; and Proto-Quechua &quot;*čaka&quot; &#x27;bridge&#x27; becomes &quot;čaka&quot;), they are thought to be innovations in Quechua from Aymara, borrowed independently after branching off from Proto-Quechua.

===Stress===
Stress is penultimate in most dialects of Quechua. In some varieties, factors such as the apocope of word-final vowels may cause exceptional final stress. Stress in Chachapoyas Quechua falls word-initially.

==Orthography==

Quechua has been written using the Roman alphabet since the Spanish conquest of Peru. However, written Quechua is rarely used by Quechua speakers due to limited amounts of printed material in the language.

Until the 20th century, Quechua was written with a Spanish-based orthography, for example &quot;Inca, Huayna Cápac, Collasuyo, Mama Ocllo, Viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor&quot;. This orthography is the most familiar to Spanish speakers, and so it has been used for most borrowings into English, which essentially always happen through Spanish.

In 1975, the Peruvian government of Juan Velasco Alvarado adopted a new orthography for Quechua. This is the system preferred by the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, which results in the following spellings of the examples listed above: &quot;Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qollasuyu, Mama Oqllo, Wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur&quot;. This orthography has the following features:
* It uses &quot;w&quot; instead of &quot;hu&quot; for .
* It distinguishes velar &quot;k&quot; from uvular &quot;q&quot;, both of which were spelled &quot;c&quot; or &quot;qu&quot; in the traditional system.
* It distinguishes simple, ejective, and aspirated stops in dialects that make these distinctions, such as that of the Cusco Region, e.g. the aspirated &quot;khipu&quot; &#x27;knot&#x27;.
* It continues to use the Spanish five-vowel system.

In 1985, a variation of this system was adopted by the Peruvian government that uses the Quechuan three-vowel system, resulting in the following spellings: &quot;Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qullasuyu, Mama Uqllu, Wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur&quot;.

The different orthographies are still highly controversial in Peru. Advocates of the traditional system believe that the new orthographies look too foreign and believe that it makes Quechua harder to learn for people who have first been exposed to written Spanish. Those who prefer the new system maintain that it better matches the phonology of Quechua, and they point to studies showing that teaching the five-vowel system to children later causes reading difficulties in Spanish.

For more on this, see Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift.

Writers differ in the treatment of Spanish loanwords. These are sometimes adapted to modern orthography and sometimes left as in Spanish. For instance, &quot;I am Roberto&quot; could be written &quot;Robertom kani&quot; or &quot;Ruwirtum kani&quot;. (The &quot;-m&quot; is not part of the name; it is an evidential suffix, showing how the information is known: firsthand, in this case.)

The Peruvian linguist Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino has proposed an orthographic norm for all of Southern Quechua: this Standard Quechua (&quot;el Quechua estándar&quot; or &quot;Hanan Runasimi&quot;) conservatively integrates features of the two widespread dialects Ayacucho Quechua and Cusco Quechua. For instance:

The Spanish-based orthography is now in conflict with Peruvian law. According to article 20 of the decree &quot;Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC&quot;, which approves regulations relative to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed, with the aim of standardizing the spellings used by the National Geographic Institute &quot;(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)&quot; The IGN implements the necessary changes on the official maps of Peru.

==Grammar==

===Morphological type===
Quechua is an agglutinating language, meaning that words are built up from basic roots followed by several suffixes, each of which carries one meaning. Their large number of suffixes changes both the overall meaning of words and their subtle shades of meaning. All varieties of Quechua are very regular agglutinative languages, as opposed to isolating or fusional ones [Thompson]. Their normal sentence order is SOV (subject–object–verb). Notable grammatical features include bipersonal conjugation (verbs agree with both subject and object), evidentiality (indication of the source and veracity of knowledge), a set of topic particles, and suffixes indicating who benefits from an action and the speaker&#x27;s attitude toward it, but some varieties may lack some of the characteristics.

===Pronouns===

In Quechua, there are seven pronouns. First-person plural pronouns (equivalent to &quot;we&quot;) may be inclusive or exclusive; which mean, respectively, that the addressee (&quot;you&quot;) is or is not part of the &quot;we&quot;. Quechua also adds the suffix &quot;-kuna&quot; to the second and third person singular pronouns &quot;qam&quot; and &quot;pay&quot; to create the plural forms, &quot;qam-kuna&quot; and &quot;pay-kuna&quot;. In Quechua IIB, or &quot;Kichwa&quot;, the exclusive first-person plural pronoun, &quot;ñuqayku&quot;, is generally obsolete.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Quechua are always placed before nouns. They lack gender and number and are not declined to agree with nouns.

===Numbers===
*Cardinal numbers. &quot;ch&#x27;usaq&quot; (0), &quot;huk&quot; (1), &quot;iskay&quot; (2), &quot;kimsa&quot; (3), &quot;tawa&quot; (4), &quot;pichqa&quot; (5), &quot;suqta&quot; (6), &quot;qanchis&quot; (7), &quot;pusaq&quot; (8), &quot;isqun&quot; (9), &quot;chunka&quot; (10), &quot;chunka hukniyuq&quot; (11), &quot;chunka iskayniyuq&quot; (12), &quot;iskay chunka&quot; (20), &quot;pachak&quot; (100), &quot;waranqa&quot; (1,000), &quot;hunu&quot; (1,000,000), &quot;lluna&quot; (1,000,000,000,000).
*Ordinal numbers. To form ordinal numbers, the word &quot;ñiqin&quot; is put after the appropriate cardinal number (&quot;iskay ñiqin&quot; = &quot;second&quot;). The only exception is that, in addition to &quot;huk ñiqin&quot; (&quot;first&quot;), the phrase &quot;ñawpaq&quot; is also used in the somewhat more restricted sense of &quot;the initial, primordial, the oldest&quot;.

===Nouns===
Noun roots accept suffixes that indicate number, case, and the person of a possessor. In general, the possessive suffix precedes that of number. In the Santiago del Estero variety, however, the order is reversed. From variety to variety, suffixes may change.

===Adverbs===
Adverbs can be formed by adding &quot;-ta&quot; or, in some cases, &quot;-lla&quot; to an adjective: &quot;allin – allinta&quot; (&quot;good – well&quot;), &quot;utqay – utqaylla&quot; (&quot;quick – quickly&quot;). They are also formed by adding suffixes to demonstratives: &quot;chay&quot; (&quot;that&quot;) – &quot;chaypi&quot; (&quot;there&quot;), &quot;kay&quot; (&quot;this&quot;) – &quot;kayman&quot; (&quot;hither&quot;).

There are several original adverbs. For Europeans, it is striking that the adverb &quot;qhipa&quot; means both &quot;behind&quot; and &quot;future&quot; and &quot;ñawpa&quot; means &quot;ahead, in front&quot; and &quot;past&quot;. Local and temporal concepts of adverbs in Quechua (as well as in Aymara) are associated to each other reversely, compared to European languages. For the speakers of Quechua, we are moving backwards into the future (we cannot see it: it is unknown), facing the past (we can see it: it is remembered).

===Verbs===
The infinitive forms have the suffix &quot;-y&quot; (e.g.&quot;., much&#x27;a&quot; &#x27;kiss&#x27;; &quot;much&#x27;a-y&quot; &#x27;to kiss&#x27;). These are the typical endings for the indicative in a Southern Quechua (IIC) dialect:
The suffixes shown in the table above usually indicate the subject; the person of the object is also indicated by a suffix, which precedes the suffixes in the table. For the second person, it is &quot;-su-&quot;, and for the first person, it is &quot;-wa-&quot; in most Quechua II dialects. In such cases, the plural suffixes from the table (&quot;-chik&quot; and &quot;-ku&quot;) can be used to express the number of the object rather than the subject. There is a lot of variation between the dialects in the exact rules which determine this. In Central Quechua, however, the verbal morphology differs in a number of respects: most notably, the verbal plural suffixes &quot;-chik&quot; and &quot;-ku&quot; are not used, and plurality is expressed by different suffixes that are located &quot;before&quot; rather than after the personal suffixes. Furthermore, the 1st person singular object suffix is &quot;-ma-&quot;, rather than &quot;-wa-&quot;.

===Grammatical particles===
Particles are indeclinable: they do not accept suffixes. They are relatively rare, but the most common are &quot;arí&quot; &#x27;yes&#x27; and &quot;mana&quot; &#x27;no&#x27;, although &quot;mana&quot; can take some suffixes, such as &quot;-n&quot;/&quot;-m&quot; (&quot;manan&quot;/&quot;manam&quot;), &quot;-raq&quot; (&quot;manaraq&quot; &#x27;not yet&#x27;) and &quot;-chu&quot; (&quot;manachu?&quot; &#x27;or not?&#x27;), to intensify the meaning. Other particles are &quot;yaw&quot; &#x27;hey, hi&#x27;, and certain loan words from Spanish, such as &quot;piru&quot; (from Spanish &quot;pero&quot; &#x27;but&#x27;) and &quot;sinuqa&quot; (from &quot;sino&quot; &#x27;rather&#x27;).

===Evidentiality===
The Quechuan languages have three different morphemes that mark evidentiality. Evidentiality refers to a morpheme whose primary purpose is to indicate the source of information. In Quechuan languages, evidentiality is a three-term system: there are three evidential morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The markers can apply to first, second, and third persons. The chart below depicts an example of these morphemes from Wanka Quechua:
&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
DIR:direct evidence
CONJ:conjecture
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;

The parentheses around the vowels indicate that the vowel can be dropped when following an open vowel. For the sake of cohesiveness, the above forms are used to discuss the evidential morphemes. There are dialectal variations to the forms. The variations will be presented in the following descriptions.

The following sentences provide examples of the three evidentials and further discuss the meaning behind each of them.

====&quot;-m(i)&quot; : Direct evidence and commitment====

Regional variations: In Cusco Quechua, the direct evidential presents itself as &quot;–mi&quot; and &quot;–n&quot;.

The evidential &quot;–mi&quot; indicates that the speaker has a &quot;strong personal conviction the veracity of the circumstance expressed.&quot; It has the basis of direct personal experience.

Wanka Quechua
====&quot;-chr(a)&quot; : Inference and attenuation====
In Quechuan languages, not specified by the source, the inference morpheme appears as &quot;-ch(i), -ch(a), -chr(a)&quot;.

The &quot;-chr(a)&quot; evidential indicates that the utterance is an inference or form of conjecture. That inference relays the speaker&#x27;s non-commitment to the truth-value of the statement. It also appears in cases such as acquiescence, irony, interrogative constructions, and first person inferences. These uses constitute nonprototypical use and will be discussed later in the &quot;changes in meaning and other uses&quot; section.

Wanka Quechua
====&quot;-sh(i)&quot; : Hearsay====

Regional variations: It can appear as &quot;–sh(i)&quot; or &quot;–s(i)&quot; depending on the dialect.

With the use of this morpheme, the speaker &quot;serves as a conduit through which information from another source passes.&quot; The information being related is hearsay or revelatory in nature. It also works to express the uncertainty of the speaker regarding the situation. However, it also appears in other constructions that are discussed in the &quot;changes in meaning&quot; section.

Wanka Quechua
Hintz discusses an interesting case of evidential behavior found in the Sihaus dialect of Ancash Quechua. The author postulates that instead of three single evidential markers, that Quechuan language contains three pairs of evidential markers.

====Affix or clitic====
The evidential morphemes have been referred to as markers or morphemes. The literature seems to differ on whether or not the evidential morphemes are acting as affixes or clitics, in some cases, such as Wanka Quechua, enclitics. Lefebvre and Muysken (1998) discuss this issue in terms of case but remark the line between affix and clitic is not clear. Both terms are used interchangeably throughout these sections.

====Position in the sentence====
Evidentials in the Quechuan languages are &quot;second position enclitics&quot;, which usually attach to the first constituent in the sentence, as shown in this example.

They can, however, also occur on a focused constituent.

Sometimes, the affix is described as attaching to the focus, particularly in the Tarma dialect of Yaru Quechua, but this does not hold true for all varieties of Quechua. In Huanuco Quechua, the evidentials may follow any number of topics, marked by the topic marker &quot;–qa&quot;, and the element with the evidential must precede the main verb or be the main verb.

However, there are exceptions to that rule, and the more topics there are in a sentence, the more likely the sentence is to deviate from the usual pattern.
====Changes in meaning and other uses====
Evidentials can be used to relay different meanings depending on the context and perform other functions. The following examples are restricted to Wanka Quechua.

The direct evidential, -mi

The direct evidential appears in wh-questions and yes/no questions. By considering the direct evidential in terms of prototypical semantics, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to have a direct evidential, basically an evidential that confirms the speaker&#x27;s certainty about a topic, in a question. However, if one focuses less on the structure and more on the situation, some sense can be made. The speaker is asking the addressee for information so the speaker assumes the speaker knows the answer. That assumption is where the direct evidential comes into play. The speaker holds a certain amount of certainty that the addressee will know the answer. The speaker interprets the addressee as being in &quot;direct relation&quot; to the proposed content; the situation is the same as when, in regular sentences, the speaker assumes direct relation to the proposed information.

The direct evidential affix is also seen in yes/no questions, similar to the situation with wh-questions. Floyd describes yes/no questions as being &quot;characterized as instructions to the addressee to assert one of the propositions of a disjunction.&quot; Once again, the burden of direct evidence is being placed on the addressee, not on the speaker. The question marker in Wanka Quechua, &quot;-chun&quot;, is derived from the negative –chu marker and the direct evidential (realized as –n in some dialects).

====Inferential evidential, -chr(a)====

While &quot;–chr(a)&quot; is usually used in an inferential context, it has some non-prototypical uses.

&quot;Mild Exhortation&quot;
In these constructions the evidential works to reaffirm and encourage the addressee&#x27;s actions or thoughts.

This example comes from a conversation between husband and wife, discussing the reactions of their family and friends after they have been gone for a while. The husband says he plans to stretch the truth and tell them about distant places to which he has gone, and his wife (in the example above) echoes and encourages his thoughts.

&quot;Acquiescence&quot;
With these, the evidential is used to highlight the speaker&#x27;s assessment of inevitability of an event and acceptance of it. There is a sense of resistance, diminished enthusiasm, and disinclination in these constructions.

This example comes from a discourse where a woman demands compensation from the man (the speaker in the example) whose pigs ruined her potatoes. He denies the pigs as being his but finally realizes he may be responsible and produces the above example.

&quot;Interrogative&quot;
Somewhat similar to the &quot;–mi&quot; evidential, the inferential evidential can be found in content questions. However, the salient difference between the uses of the evidentials in questions is that in the &quot;–m(i)&quot; marked questions, an answer is expected. That is not the case with &quot;–chr(a)&quot; marked questions.

&quot;Irony&quot;
Irony in language can be a somewhat complicated topic in how it functions differently in languages, and by its semantic nature, it is already somewhat vague. For these purposes, it is suffice to say that when irony takes place in Wanka Quechua, the &quot;–chr(a)&quot; marker is used.

This example comes from discourse between a father and daughter about her refusal to attend school. It can be interpreted as a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an ironic statement (that is an absurd idea).

====Hearsay evidential, -sh(i)====

Aside from being used to express hearsay and revelation, this affix also has other uses.

&quot;Folktales, myths, and legends&quot;

Because folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them. Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the &quot;–sh(i)&quot; marker. In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.

&quot;Riddles&quot;

Riddles are somewhat similar to myths and folktales in that their nature is to be passed by word of mouth.

====Omission and overuse of evidential affixes====

In certain grammatical structures, the evidential marker does not appear at all. In all Quechuan languages the evidential will not appear in a dependent clause. No example was given to depict this omission.
Omissions occur in Quechua. The sentence is understood to have the same evidentiality as the other sentences in the context. Quechuan speakers vary as to how much they omit evidentials, but they occur only in connected speech.

An interesting contrast to omission of evidentials is overuse of evidentials. If a speaker uses evidentials too much with no reason, competence is brought into question. For example, the overuse of –m(i) could lead others to believe that the speaker is not a native speaker or, in some extreme cases, that one is mentally ill.

====Cultural aspect====

By using evidentials, the Quechua culture has certain assumptions about the information being relayed. Those who do not abide by the cultural customs should not be trusted. A passage from Weber (1986) summarizes them:
# (Only) one&#x27;s experience is reliable.
# Avoid unnecessary risk by assuming responsibility for information of which one is not absolutely certain.
# Do not be gullible. There are many folktales in which the villain is foiled by his gullibility.
#Assume responsibility only if it is safe to do so. Successful assumption of responsibility builds stature in the community.

Evidentials also show that being precise and stating the source of one&#x27;s information is extremely important in the language and the culture. Failure to use them correctly can lead to diminished standing in the community. Speakers are aware of the evidentials and even use proverbs to teach children the importance of being precise and truthful. Precision and information source are of the utmost importance. They are a powerful and resourceful method of human communication.
==Literature==

As in the case of the pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, there are a number of Andean texts in the local language which were written down in Latin characters after the European conquest, but which express, to a great extent, the culture of pre-Conquest times. For example, Quechua poems thought to date from Inca times are preserved as quotations within some Spanish-language chronicles dealing with the pre-Conquest period. However, the most important specimen of Quechua literature of this type is the so-called Huarochirí Manuscript (1598), which describes the mythology and religion of the valley of Huarochirí and has been compared to &quot;an Andean Bible&quot; and to the Mayan Popol Vuh. From the post-conquest period (starting from the middle of the 17th century), there are a number of anonymous or signed Quechua dramas, some of which deal with the Inca era, while most are on religious topics and of European inspiration. The most famous dramas are &quot;Ollantay&quot; and the plays describing the death of Atahualpa. Juan de Espinosa Medrano wrote several dramas in the language. Poems in Quechua were also composed during the colonial period. A notable example are the works of Juan Wallparrimachi, a participant in the Bolivian War of Independence.

As for Christian literature, as early as 1583, the Third Provincial Church Council of Lima, which took place in 1583, published a number of texts dealing with Christian doctrine and rituals, including a trilingual catechism in Spanish, Quechua and Aymara and a number of other similar texts in the years from 1584 to 1585. More texts of this type were published until the middle of the 17th century, mostly adhering to a Quechua literary standard that had been codified by the Third Council for this purpose. There is at least one Quechuan version of the Bible.

Dramas and poems continued to be written in the 19th and especially in 20th centuries as well; in addition, in the 20th century and more recently, more prose has been published. However, few literary forms were made present in the 19th century as European influences limited literary criticism. While some of that literature consists of original compositions (poems and dramas), the bulk of 20th century Quechua literature consists of traditional folk stories and oral narratives. Johnny Payne has translated two sets of Quechua oral short stories, one into Spanish and the other into English.

Demetrio Túpac Yupanqui wrote a Quechuan version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, under the title &quot;Yachay sapa wiraqucha dun Qvixote Manchamantan&quot;.

==Media==
A news broadcast in Quechua, &quot;Ñuqanchik&quot; (all of us), began in Peru in 2016.

Many Andean musicians write and sing in their native languages, including Quechua and Aymara. Notable musical groups are Los Kjarkas, Kala Marka, J&#x27;acha Mallku, Savia Andina, Wayna Picchu, Wara, Alborada, Uchpa, and many others.

There are several Quechua and Quechua-Spanish bloggers, as well as a Quechua language podcast.

The 1961 Peruvian film &quot;Kukuli&quot; was the first film to be spoken in the Quechua language.

In the 1977 science fiction film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the alien character Greedo speaks a simplified form of Quechua.

The first-person shooter game &quot;Overwatch 2&quot; features a Peruvian character, Illari, with some voice lines being in Quechua.

<text>Protein quaternary structure is the fourth (and highest) classification level of protein structure. Protein quaternary structure refers to the structure of proteins which are themselves composed of two or more smaller protein chains (also referred to as subunits). Protein quaternary structure describes the number and arrangement of multiple folded protein subunits in a multi-subunit complex. It includes organizations from simple dimers to large homooligomers and complexes with defined or variable numbers of subunits. In contrast to the first three levels of protein structure, not all proteins will have a quaternary structure since some proteins function as single units. Protein quaternary structure can also refer to biomolecular complexes of proteins with nucleic acids and other cofactors.

==Description and examples==
Many proteins are actually assemblies of multiple polypeptide chains. The quaternary structure refers to the number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one another. Examples of proteins with quaternary structure include hemoglobin, DNA polymerase, ribosomes, antibodies, and ion channels.

Enzymes composed of subunits with diverse functions are sometimes called holoenzymes, in which some parts may be known as regulatory subunits and the functional core is known as the catalytic subunit. Other assemblies referred to instead as multiprotein complexes also possess quaternary structure. Examples include nucleosomes and microtubules. Changes in quaternary structure can occur through conformational changes within individual subunits or through reorientation of the subunits relative to each other. It is through such changes, which underlie cooperativity and allostery in &quot;multimeric&quot; enzymes, that many proteins undergo regulation and perform their physiological function.

The above definition follows a classical approach to biochemistry, established at times when the distinction between a protein and a functional, proteinaceous unit was difficult to elucidate. More recently, people refer to protein–protein interaction when discussing quaternary structure of proteins and consider all assemblies of proteins as protein complexes.

==Nomenclature==

The number of subunits in an oligomeric complex is described using names that end in -mer (Greek for &quot;part, subunit&quot;). Formal and Greco-Latinate names are generally used for the first ten types and can be used for up to twenty subunits, whereas higher order complexes are usually described by the number of subunits, followed by -meric.

:*&quot;No known examples&quot;
The smallest unit forming a homo-oligomer, i.e. one protein chain or subunit, is designated as a monomer, subunit or protomer. The latter term was originally devised to specify the smallest unit of hetero-oligomeric proteins, but is also applied to homo-oligomeric proteins in current literature. The subunits usually arrange in cyclic symmetry to form closed point group symmetries.

Although complexes higher than octamers are rarely observed for most proteins, there are some important exceptions. Viral capsids are often composed of multiples of 60 proteins. Several molecular machines are also found in the cell, such as the proteasome (four heptameric rings = 28 subunits), the transcription complex and the spliceosome. The ribosome is probably the largest molecular machine, and is composed of many RNA and protein molecules.

In some cases, proteins form complexes that then assemble into even larger complexes. In such cases, one uses the nomenclature, e.g., &quot;dimer of dimers&quot; or &quot;trimer of dimers&quot;. This may suggest that the complex might dissociate into smaller sub-complexes before dissociating into monomers. This usually implies that the complex consists of different oligomerisation interfaces. For example, a tetrameric protein may have one four-fold rotation axis, i.e. point group symmetry 4 or &quot;C&quot;4. In this case the four interfaces between the subunits are identical. It may also have point group symmetry 222 or &quot;D&quot;2. This tetramer has different interfaces and the tetramer can dissociate into two identical homodimers. Tetramers of 222 symmetry are &quot;dimer of dimers&quot;. Hexamers of 32 point group symmetry are &quot;trimer of dimers&quot; or &quot;dimer of trimers&quot;. Thus, the nomenclature &quot;dimer of dimers&quot; is used to specify the point group symmetry or arrangement of the oligomer, independent of information relating to its dissociation properties. 

Another distinction often made when referring to oligomers is whether they are homomeric or heteromeric, referring to whether the smaller protein subunits that come together to make the protein complex are the same (homomeric) or different (heteromeric) from each other. For example, two identical protein monomers would come together to form a homo-dimer, whereas two different protein monomers would create a hetero-dimer.

==Structure Determination==

Protein quaternary structure can be determined using a variety of experimental techniques that require a sample of protein in a variety of experimental conditions. The experiments often provide an estimate of the mass of the native protein and, together with knowledge of the masses and/or stoichiometry of the subunits, allow the quaternary structure to be predicted with a given accuracy. It is not always possible to obtain a precise determination of the subunit composition for a variety of reasons.

The number of subunits in a protein complex can often be determined by measuring the hydrodynamic molecular volume or mass of the intact complex, which requires native solution conditions. For &quot;folded&quot; proteins, the mass can be inferred from its volume using the partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g. However, volume measurements are less certain than mass measurements, since &quot;unfolded&quot; proteins appear to have a much larger volume than folded proteins; additional experiments are required to determine whether a protein is unfolded or has formed an oligomer.

=== Common techniques used to study protein quaternary structure ===

* Ultracentrifugation
* Surface-induced dissociation mass spectrometry
* Coimmunoprecipation
* FRET
* Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)

===Direct mass measurement of intact complexes===

* Sedimentation-equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation 
* Electrospray mass spectrometry
* Mass Spectrometric Immunoassay MSIA

===Direct size measurement of intact complexes===

* Static light scattering
* Size exclusion chromatography (requires calibration)
* Dual polarisation interferometry

===Indirect size measurement of intact complexes===

* Sedimentation-velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (measures the translational diffusion constant)
* Dynamic light scattering (measures the translational diffusion constant)
* Pulsed-gradient protein nuclear magnetic resonance (measures the translational diffusion constant)
* Fluorescence polarization (measures the rotational diffusion constant)
* Dielectric relaxation (measures the rotational diffusion constant)
* Dual polarisation interferometry (measures the size and the density of the complex)

Methods that measure the mass or volume under unfolding conditions (such as 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE) are generally not useful, since non-native conditions usually cause the complex to dissociate into monomers. However, these may sometimes be applicable; for example, the experimenter may apply SDS-PAGE after first treating the intact complex with chemical cross-link reagents.

==Structure Prediction==
Some bioinformatics methods have been developed for predicting the quaternary structural attributes of proteins based on their sequence information by using various modes of pseudo amino acid composition.

Protein folding prediction programs used to predict protein tertiary structure have also been expanding to better predict protein quaternary structure. One such development is AlphaFold-Multimer built upon the AlphaFold model for predicting protein tertiary structure.

== Role in Cell Signaling ==
Protein quaternary structure also plays an important role in certain cell signaling pathways. The G-protein coupled receptor pathway involves a heterotrimeric protein known as a G-protein. G-proteins contain three distinct subunits known as the G-alpha, G-beta, and G-gamma subunits. When the G-protein is activated, it binds to the G-protein coupled receptor protein and the cell signaling pathway is initiated. Another example is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway, which is initiated by the dimerization of two receptor tyrosine kinase monomers. When the dimer is formed, the two kinases can phosphorylate each other and initiate a cell signaling pathway.

==Protein–protein interactions==

Proteins are capable of forming very tight but also only transient complexes. For example, ribonuclease inhibitor binds to ribonuclease A with a roughly 20 fM dissociation constant. Other proteins have evolved to bind specifically to unusual moieties on another protein, e.g., biotin groups (avidin), phosphorylated tyrosines (SH2 domains) or proline-rich segments (SH3 domains). Protein–protein interactions can be engineered to favor certain oligomerization states.

==Intragenic complementation==

When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene form a quaternary complex, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation (also called inter-allelic complementation). Intragenic complementation appears to be common and has been studied in many different genes in a variety of organisms including the fungi &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;; the bacterium &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;; the virus bacteriophage T4, an RNA virus, and humans. The intermolecular forces likely responsible for self-recognition and multimer formation were discussed by Jehle.

==Assembly==
Direct interaction of two nascent proteins emerging from nearby ribosomes appears to be a general mechanism for oligomer formation. Hundreds of protein oligomers were identified that assemble in human cells by such an interaction. The most prevalent form of interaction was between the N-terminal regions of the interacting proteins. Dimer formation appears to be able to occur independently of dedicated assembly machines.

<doc id="25292" wikidata="Q1248824" url="?curid=25292" title="Quest for Glory">
<text>Quest for Glory is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games, which were designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The series was created in the Sierra Creative Interpreter, a toolset developed at Sierra specifically to assist with adventure game development. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a 5-part series in the Sierra stable.

The series was originally titled &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest&quot;. However, Sierra failed to trademark the name. The Milton Bradley Company successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, which forced Sierra to change the series&#x27; title to &quot;Quest for Glory&quot;. This decision meant that all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest I&quot;) used the new name.

==Series==
Lori Cole pitched &quot;Quest for Glory&quot; to Sierra as a &quot;rich, narrative-driven, role-playing experience&quot;.

The series consisted of five games, each of which followed directly upon the events of the last. New games frequently referred to previous entries in the series, often in the form of cameos by recurring characters. The objective of the series is to transform the player character from an average adventurer to a hero by completing non-linear quests.

The game also was revolutionary in its character import system. This allowed players to import their individual character, including the skills and wealth they had acquired, from one game to the next.

Hybrids by their gameplay and themes, the games feature serious stories leavened with humor throughout. There are real dangers to face, and true heroic feats to perform, but silly details and overtones creep in (when the drama of adventuring does not force them out). Cheap word play is particularly frequent, to the point that the second game&#x27;s ending refers to itself as the hero&#x27;s &quot;latest set of adventures and miserable puns.&quot;

The games have recurring story elements. For example, most installments in the series require the player to create a dispel potion.

The games include a number of Easter eggs, including a number of allusions to other Sierra games. For example, if a player types &quot;pick nose&quot; in the first game, (or clicks the lockpick icon on the player in the new version), if their lock-picking skill is high enough, the game responds: &quot;Success! You now have an open nose&quot;. If the skill is too low, the player could insert the lock pick too far, killing himself. Another example is Dr. Cranium, an allusion to &quot;The Castle of Dr. Brain&quot;, in the fourth game.

Each game draws its inspiration from a different culture and mythology: (in order, Germanic/fairy tale; Middle Eastern/Arabian Nights; Egyptian/African; Slavic folklore; and finally Greco-Mediterranean) with the hero facing increasingly powerful opponents with help from characters who become more familiar from game to game.

Each game varies somewhat from the tradition it is derived from; for example, Baba Yaga, a character borrowed from Slavic folklore, appears in the first game which is based on German mythology. The second game, which uses Middle Eastern folklore, introduces several Arab and African-themed characters who reappear in the third game based on African folklore and Egyptian mythology, and also features some elements inspired by American culture, including references to the film Casablanca. Characters from every game and genre in the series reappear in the fourth and fifth games. In addition to deviating from the player&#x27;s expectations of the culture represented in each game, the series also includes a number of intentional anachronisms, such as the pizza-loving mad scientists in the later games.

Many CRPG enthusiasts consider the &quot;Quest for Glory&quot; series to be among the best in the genre, and the series is lauded for its non-linearity. The games are notable for blending the mechanics of adventure video games and roleplaying video games, their unique tone which combines pathos and humour, and the game systems which were ahead of their time, such as day-night cycles, non-playable characters which adhered to their own schedules within the games, and character improvement through both skill practice and point investiture. The website Polygon and the Kotaku blog have characterised the game as a precursor to modern day RPGs. Fraser Brown of the Destructoid blog considers the games: &quot;one of the greatest adventure series of all time&quot;.

Rowan Kaizer of the blog Engadget credits the games&#x27; hybrid adventure and roleplaying systems for the series&#x27; success. &quot;The binary succeed/fail form of adventure game puzzles tended to either make those games too easy or too hard,&quot; he wrote, &quot;But most puzzles in &quot;Quest For Glory&quot; involved some kind of skill check for your hero. This meant that you could succeed at most challenges by practicing or exploring, instead of getting stuck on bizarre item-combination puzzles&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The first four games are hybrid adventure/role playing video games with real-time combat, while the fifth game switches to the action RPG genre.

The gameplay standards established in earlier Sierra adventure games are enhanced by the player&#x27;s ability to choose the character&#x27;s career path from among the three traditional role-playing game backgrounds: fighter, magic-user/wizard and thief. Further variation is added by the ability to customize the Hero&#x27;s abilities, including the option of selecting skills normally reserved for another character class, leading to unique combinations often referred to as &quot;hybrid characters&quot;. During the second or third games, a character can be initiated as a Paladin by performing honorable actions, changing his class and abilities, and receiving a unique sword. This applies when the character is exported into later games. Any character that finishes any game in the series (except &quot;Dragon Fire&quot;, the last in the series) can be exported to a more recent game (&quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot; has a glitch which allows one to import characters from the same game), keeping the character&#x27;s statistics and parts of its inventory. If the character received the paladin sword, he would keep the magic sword (Soulforge or Piotyr&#x27;s sword) and special paladin magic abilities (with the exception of &quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot;, where the character loses all of his belongings, including the weapons, before the game begins). A character imported into a later game in the series from any other game can be assigned any character class, including Paladin.

Each career path has its own strengths and weaknesses, and scenarios unique to the class because of the skills associated with it. Each class also has its own distinct way to solve various in-game puzzles, which encourage replay: some puzzles have up to four different solutions. For instance, if a door is closed, instead of lockpicking or casting an open spell, the fighter can simply knock down the door. The magic user and the thief are both non-confrontational characters, as they lack the close range ability of the fighter, but are better able to attack from a distance, using daggers or spells. An example of these separate paths can be seen early in the first game. A gold ring belonging to the healer rests in a nest on top of a tree; fighters might make it fall by hurling rocks, thieves may want to climb the tree, while a magic user can simply cast the fetch spell to retrieve the nest, and then, while the fighter and magic user return the ring for a reward, the thief can choose between returning or selling the same ring in the thieves&#x27; guild (which is not available for those not possessing the &quot;thieving&quot; skills). It is also possible to build, over the course of several games, a character that has points in every skill in the game, and can therefore perform nearly every task. However, certain tasks are presented only to characters of a specific class. 

Each character class features special abilities unique to that class, as well as a shared set of attributes which can be developed by performing tasks and completing quests. In general, for a particular game the maximum value which can be reached for an ability is 100*[the number of that game]. &quot;Quest for Glory V&quot; allows stat bonuses which can push an attribute over the maximum and lets certain classes raise certain attributes beyond the normal limits. &quot;Quest for Glory V&quot; also features special kinds of equipment which lower some stats while raising others. At the beginning of each game, the player may assign points to certain attributes, and certain classes only have specific attributes enabled, although skills can be added for an extra cost.

General attributes influence all characters&#x27; classes and how they interact with objects and other people in the game; high values in strength allows movement of heavier objects and communication helps with bargaining goods with sellers. These attributes are changed by performing actions related to the skill; climbing a tree eventually increases the skill value in climb, running increases vitality, and so on. There are also complementing skills which are tied to specific classes; parry (the ability to block a blow with the sword), for instance, is mainly used by fighters and paladins, lock picking and sneaking are defaults with the thief, and the ability to cast magic spells is usually associated with magic user.

Vital statistics are depleted by performing some actions. Health, (determined by strength and vitality), determines the hit points of the character, which decreases when the character is attacked or harms himself. Stamina (based on agility and vitality) limits the number of actions (exercise, fighting, running, etc.) the character is able to perform before needing rest or risking injury. Mana is only required by characters with skill in magic, and is calculated according to the character&#x27;s intelligence and magic attributes.

Puzzle and Experience points only show the development of the player and his progress in the game, though in the first game also affects the kind of random encounters a player faces, as some monsters only appear after a certain level of experience is reached.

==Games==
===&quot;Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero&quot;===

In the valley barony of Spielburg, the evil ogress Baba Yaga has cursed the land and the baron who tried to drive her off. His children have disappeared, while the land is ravaged by monsters and brigands. The Valley of Spielburg is in need of a Hero able to solve these problems.

The original game was released in 1989 while a VGA remake was released in 1992.

===&quot;Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire&quot;===

&quot;Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire&quot; takes place in the land of Shapeir, in the world of Gloriana. Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir. The city is threatened by magical elementals, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapeir&#x27;s sister city Raseir is missing and his city fallen under tyranny.

&quot;Quest for Glory II&quot; is the only game in the series not to have originated or have been remade beyond the EGA graphics engine by Sierra, but AGD Interactive released a VGA fan remake of the game using the Adventure Game Studio engine on August 24th, 2008.

===&quot;Quest for Glory III: Wages of War&quot;===

Rakeesh the Paladin brings the Hero (and Prince of Shapeir) along with Uhura and her son Simba to his homeland, the town of Tarna in a jungle and savannah country called Fricana that resembles central African ecosystems.

Tarna is on the brink of war; the Simbani, the tribe of Uhura, are ready to do battle with the Leopardmen. Each tribe has stolen a sacred relic from the other, and both refuse to return it until the other side does. The Hero must prevent the war then thwart a demon who may be loosed upon the world.

===&quot;Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness&quot;===

Drawn without warning from his victory in Fricana, the Hero arrives without equipment or explanation in the middle of the hazardous Dark One Caves in the distant land of Mordavia. While struggling to survive in this land plagued with undead, the Hero must prevent a dark power from summoning eternal darkness into the world.

===&quot;Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire&quot;===

Erasmus introduces the player character, the Hero, to the Greece-like kingdom of Silmaria, whose king was recently assassinated. Thus, the traditional Rites of Rulership are due to commence, and the victor will be crowned king. The Hero enters the contest with the assistance of Erasmus, Rakeesh, and many old friends from previous entries in the series. The Hero competes against competitors, including the Silmarian guard Kokeeno Pookameeso, the warlord Magnum Opus, the hulking Gort, and the warrior Elsa Von Spielburg.

==Collections==
*&quot;Quest for Glory Anthology&quot; (1996), a package that includes the first four games, including the fully patched CD version of &quot;QFG IV&quot;; game copy protection codes (a feature of &quot;Quest for Glory IV&quot;) are included in the manual and on CD, while game saves are included in the save folder of the CD and the VGA version of &quot;Quest for Glory I&quot;.
*&quot;Quest for Glory Collection Series&quot; (1997), a re-release of &quot;Anthology&quot; with a &quot;Dragon Fire&quot; demo and sample soundtrack.
*&quot;Quest for Glory 1–5&quot; (2012), a digital collection on GOG.com and Steam that includes all five games in the series (including the EGA version and VGA remake of QFG1).

==Original concept==
Originally, the series was to be a tetralogy, consisting of four games, with the following themes and cycles: the four cardinal directions, the four classical elements, the four seasons and four different mythologies.

This is what the creators originally had in mind:
However, when &quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot; was designed, it was thought that it would be too difficult for the hero to go straight from Shapeir to Mordavia and defeat the Dark One. To solve the problem, a new game, &quot;Wages of War&quot;, was inserted into the canon, resulting in a renumbering of the series. Evidence for this can be found in the end of &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;: the player is told that the next game will be &quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot; and a fanged vampiric moon is shown, to hint at the next game&#x27;s theme.

The developers discussed this in the Fall 1992 issue of Sierra&#x27;s &quot;InterAction&quot; magazine, and an online chat room:
Somewhere between finishing &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; and cranking up the design process for &quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot;, the husband-and-wife team realized a fifth chapter would have to be added to bridge the games. That chapter became &quot;Wages of War&quot;.

The concept of seasons in the games represents the maturation of the Hero as he moves from story to story. It&#x27;s a critical component in a series that – from the very beginning – was designed to be a defined quartet of stories, representing an overall saga with a distinct beginning, middle, and end.

In the first episode, the player is a new graduate of the Famous Adventurer&#x27;s Correspondence School, ready to venture out into the springtime of his career and build a reputation. It&#x27;s a light-hearted, exhilarating journey into the unknown that can be replayed three times with three distinct outlooks at puzzle-solving.

In the second chapter – &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; – the Hero enters the summer of his experience, facing more difficult challenges with more highly developed skills. While the episode is more serious and dangerous than its predecessor, it retains the enchanting mixture of fantasy, challenge, and humor that made the first game a hit with so many fans.

Of all the reasons Lori and Corey found for creating a bridge between &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; and &quot;Shadows of Darkness&quot;, the most compelling was the feeling that the Hero character simply hadn&#x27;t matured enough to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.

==Characters==

Along with the Hero, several recurring characters appear and re-appear throughout the series including: Rakeesh Sah Tarna, Baba Yaga, Abdullah Doo, Elsa von Spielburg, the evil Ad Avis, and others.

==World==
The fictional world in which the Quest for Glory series takes place includes the town of Spielburg (based on German folklore and Norse mythology), the desert city of Shapeir (based on the Arabia of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;), the jungle city of Tarna (based on African mythology, especially Egypt), the hamlet of Mordavia (based on Slavic mythology) and Silmaria (based on Greek mythology). Adventures, monsters and story of the games are usually drawn from legends of the respective mythology on which a title is based, although there are several cross-over exceptions, like the Eastern European Baba Yaga also appearing in the first game, which is distinctly German/Nordic.

<doc id="25293" wikidata="Q1940786" url="?curid=25293" title="Quango">
<text>A quango or QUANGO (less often QuANGO or QANGO) is an organisation to which a government has devolved power, but which is still partly controlled and/or financed by government bodies. The term was originally a shortening of &quot;quasi NGO&quot;, where NGO is the acronym for a non-government organisation.

As its original name suggests, a quango is a hybrid form of organization, with elements of both NGOs and public sector bodies. The term is most often applied in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser degree, other countries in the core and middle Anglosphere.

In the UK, the term quango covers different &quot;arm&#x27;s-length&quot; government bodies, including &quot;non-departmental public bodies&quot; (NDPBs), non-ministerial government departments, and executive agencies.

In its pejorative use, it has been widely applied to public bodies of various kinds, and a variety of backronyms have been used to make the term consistent with this expanded use. The most popular has been &quot;Quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization&quot;, often with the acronym modified to &quot;qango&quot; or &quot;QANGO&quot;.

== Use ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, quangos are referred to as &#x27;Crown Corporations&#x27; or simply &#x27;Crown corps&#x27;. As of May 2021 there were 45 Crown corps owned by the Canadian federal government, however many more are owned by each of the provincial governments. Notably electricity providers such as the &#x27;Saskatchewan Power Corporation&#x27; a.k.a. SaskPower owned by the province of Saskatchewan and &#x27;Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board&#x27; a.k.a. Manitoba Hydro owned by the province of Manitoba.

==== Saskatchewan ====

Saskatchewan is notable for the ubiquity of provincial crown corps with most styled with the prefix &quot;Sask&quot;- followed by the primary service. The larger Saskatchewan Crown corps have their own Saskatchewan minister with all Saskatchewan Crown corps owned by the Crown Investment Corporation of Saskatchewan which in turn is owned by the provincial government. Some of the most notable Saskatchewan Crown corps are as follows:
* SaskTel (Saskatchewan Telecommunications Holding Corporation) providing telecommunications. Notable for the last remaining government owned incumbent telephone provider in Canada.
* SaskPower (Saskatchewan Power Corporation) providing electricity.
* SaskEnergy (SaskEnergy Incorporated) providing natural gas.
* SaskWater (Saskatchewan Water Corporation) providing potable water and sewage services to certain communities.

=== Ireland ===

In 2006, there were 832 quangos in the Republic of Ireland – 482 at national and 350 at local level – with a total of 5,784 individual appointees and a combined annual budget of €13 billion.

The Irish majority party, Fine Gael, had promised to eliminate 145 quangos should they be the governing party in the 2016 election. Since coming to power they have reduced the overall number of quangos by 17. This reduction also included agencies which the former government had already planned to remove.

=== New Zealand ===

In New Zealand, quangos are referred to as &#x27;Crown Entities&#x27;, with the shift occurring in the 1980s during a period of neoliberalisation of the state sector. In 1996, there were an estimated 310 quangos in New Zealand, and an additional 2690 school Board of Trustees (similar to the American model of boards of education). Other quangos from 1996 include: &quot;...63 Crown Health Enterprises, 39 tertiary education institutions, 21 Business development boards and 9 Crown Research Institutes. But there were also 71 single crown entities with services ranging from regulatory (e.g. Accounting Standards Review Board, Takeovers Panel) to quasi-judicial (e.g. Police Complaints Authority, Race Relations Conciliator), to the arts (e.g. New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, NZ Film Commission), to social welfare (e.g. Housing Corporation of NZ) and to substantial enterprises (e.g. Auckland International Airport Ltd).&quot;

By 2003, the number of quangos had increased to an estimated 400 (excluding Board of Trustees), with more than 3,000 people sitting on governance boards that were appointed by successive governments. This appointment of people to governance boards has been widely criticised by political parties and political commentators as a form of cronyism.

In 2010, there were 2,607 crown entities (including Board of Trustees) with annual expenditure of $32billion in 2009/2010.

=== United Kingdom ===
Despite a 1979 &quot;commitment&quot; from the Conservative Party to curb the growth of non-departmental bodies, their numbers grew rapidly throughout that party&#x27;s time in power during the 1980s. One UK example is the Forestry Commission, which is a non-ministerial government department responsible for forestry in England.

The Cabinet Office 2009 report on non-departmental public bodies found that there were 766 NDPBs sponsored by the UK government. The number had been falling: there were 827 in 2007 and 790 in 2008. The number of NDPBs had fallen by over 10% since 1997. Staffing and expenditure of NDPBs had increased. They employed 111,000 people in 2009 and spent £46.5 billion, of which £38.4 billion was directly funded by the government.

=== United States ===

Use of the term quango is less common in the United States although many US bodies, including Government Sponsored Enterprises, operate in the same fashion. Paul Krugman has stated that the US Federal Reserve is, effectively, &quot;what the British call a quango... Its complex structure divides power between the federal government and the private banks that are its members, and in effect gives substantial autonomy to a governing board of long-term appointees.&quot;

Other U.S.-based organizations that fit the original definition of quangos include the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the National Endowment for Democracy, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).

By the broader definition now used in the United Kingdom, there are hundreds of federal agencies that might be classed as quangos.

=== Indonesia ===
The Indonesian Ulema Council is considered a quango for its status as an independent, mass organization-like public organization but supported and financed by the state while keeping its status as independent organization outside the Indonesian state organizational system in other side. As a quango, MUI is empowered to issue religious edicts (fatwas) comparable to state laws which are binding upon the Indonesian Muslim population and can exert influence upon state policies, politics, and the economy due to its status and prestige.

== History ==

The term &quot;quasi non-governmental organisation&quot; was created in 1967 by Alan Pifer of the US-based Carnegie Foundation, in an essay on the independence and accountability of public-funded bodies that are incorporated in the private sector. This essay got the attention of David Howell, a Conservative M.P. in Britain, who then organized an Anglo-American project with Pifer, to examine the pros and cons of such enterprises. The lengthy term was shortened to the acronym (later lowercased quango) by a British participant to the joint project, Anthony Barker, during one of the conferences on the subject.

It describes an ostensibly non-governmental organisation performing governmental functions, often in receipt of funding or other support from government, By contrast, traditional NGOs mostly get their donations or funds from the public and other organisations that support their cause.

An essential feature of a quango in the original definition was that it should not be a formal part of the state structure. The term was then extended to apply to a range of organisations, such as executive agencies providing (from 1988) health, education and other services. Particularly in the UK, this occurred in a polemical atmosphere in which it was alleged that proliferation of such bodies was undesirable and should be reversed. In this context, the original acronym was often replaced by a backronym spelt out as &quot;quasi-autonomous national government organisation, and often rendered as &#x27;qango&#x27; This spawned the related acronym &quot;qualgo&quot;, a &#x27;quasi-autonomous &quot;local&quot; government organisation&#x27;.

The less contentious term non-departmental public body (NDPB) is often employed to identify numerous organisations with devolved governmental responsibilities. Examples in the United Kingdom include those engaged in the regulation of various commercial and service sectors, such as the Water Services Regulation Authority.

The UK government&#x27;s definition in 1997 of a non-departmental public body or quango was:

== Criticisms ==

&quot;The Times&quot; has accused quangos of bureaucratic waste and excess. In 2005, Dan Lewis, author of &quot;The Essential Guide to Quangos&quot;, claimed that the UK had 529 quangos, many of which were useless and duplicated the work of others.

The term has spawned the derivative quangocrat; the Taxpayers&#x27; Alliance faulted a majority of &quot;quangocrats&quot; for not making declarations of political activity.

<doc id="25295" wikidata="Q222560" url="?curid=25295" title="Quiver">
<text>A quiver is a container for holding arrows or bolts. It can be carried on an archer&#x27;s body, the bow, or the ground, depending on the type of shooting and the archer&#x27;s personal preference. Quivers were traditionally made of leather, wood, furs, and other natural materials, but are now often made of metal or plastic. 

==Etymology==
The English word quiver has its origins in Old French, written as quivre, cuevre, or coivre.

==Types==
===Belt quiver===
The most common style of quiver is a flat or cylindrical container suspended from the belt. They are found across many cultures from North America to China. Many variations of this type exist, such as being canted forwards or backwards, and being carried on the dominant hand side, off-hand side, or the small of the back. Some variants enclose almost the entire arrow, while minimalist &quot;pocket quivers&quot; consist of little more than a small stiff pouch that only covers the first few inches. The Bayeux Tapestry shows that most bowmen in medieval Europe used belt quivers.

===Back quiver===

Back quivers are secured to the archer&#x27;s back by leather straps, with the nock ends protruding above the dominant hand&#x27;s shoulder. Arrows can be drawn over the shoulder rapidly by the nock. This style of quiver was used by native peoples of North America and Africa, and was also commonly depicted in bas-reliefs from ancient Assyria. They were also used in Ancient Greece and often feature on sculptural representations of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. While popular in cinema and 20th century art for depictions of medieval European characters (such as Robin Hood), this style of quiver was rarely used in medieval Europe.

===Ground quiver===
A ground quiver is used for both target shooting or warfare when the archer is shooting from a fixed location. They can be simply stakes in the ground with a ring at the top to hold the arrows, or more elaborate designs that hold the arrows within reach without the archer having to lean down to draw.

===Bow quiver===
A modern invention, the bow quiver attaches directly to the bow&#x27;s limbs and holds the arrows steady with a clip of some kind. They are popular with compound bow hunters as it allows one piece of equipment to be carried in the field without encumbering the hunter&#x27;s body.

===Arrow bag===
A style used by medieval English longbowmen and several other cultures, an arrow bag is a simple drawstring cloth sack with a leather spacer at the top to keep the arrows divided. When not in use, the drawstring could be closed, completely covering the arrows so as to protect them from rain and dirt. Some had straps or rope sewn to them for carrying, but many either were tucked into the belt or set on the ground before battle to allow easier access.

===Japanese quivers===
Yebira refers to a variety of quiver designs. The Yazutsu is a different type, used in Kyudo. Their main use is to transport and protect arrows.
