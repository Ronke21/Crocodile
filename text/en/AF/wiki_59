<text>Stanisław Herman Lem (; 12 September 1921 – 27 March 2006) was a Polish writer. He was the author of many novels, short stories, and essays on various subjects, including philosophy, futurology, and literary criticism. Many of his science fiction stories are of satirical and humorous character. Lem&#x27;s books have been translated into more than 50 languages and have sold more than 45 million copies. Worldwide, he is best known as the author of the 1961 novel &quot;Solaris&quot;. In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world. 

Lem was the author of the fundamental philosophical work &quot;Summa Technologiae&quot;, in which he anticipated the creation of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and also developed the ideas of human autoevolution, the creation of artificial worlds, and many others. Lem&#x27;s science fiction works explore philosophical themes through speculations on technology, the nature of intelligence, the impossibility of communication with and understanding of alien intelligence, despair about human limitations, and humanity&#x27;s place in the universe. His essays and philosophical books cover these and many other topics. Translating his works is difficult due to Lem&#x27;s elaborate neologisms and idiomatic wordplay. 

The Sejm (the lower house of the Polish Parliament) declared 2021 Stanisław Lem Year.

==Life==
===Early life===

Lem was born in 1921 in Lwów, interwar Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). According to his own account, he was actually born on 13 September, but the date was changed to the 12th on his birth certificate because of superstition. He was the son of Sabina née Woller (1892–1979) and Samuel Lem (1879–1954), a wealthy laryngologist and former physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and first cousin to Polish poet Marian Hemar (Lem&#x27;s father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son). In later years Lem sometimes claimed to have been raised Roman Catholic, but he went to Jewish religious lessons during his school years. He later became an atheist &quot;for moral reasons ... the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created ... intentionally&quot;. In later years he would call himself both an agnostic and an atheist.

After the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland&#x27;s former eastern territory (now part of Ukraine and Belarus), he was not allowed to study at Lwów Polytechnic as he wished because of his &quot;bourgeois origin&quot;, and only due to his father&#x27;s connections he was accepted to study medicine at Lwów University in 1940. During the subsequent Nazi occupation (1941–1944), Lem&#x27;s Jewish family avoided placement in the Nazi Lwów Ghetto, surviving with false papers. He would later recall:
During that time, Lem earned a living as a car mechanic and welder, and occasionally stole munitions from storehouses (to which he had access as an employee of a German company) to pass them on to the Polish resistance.

In 1945, Lwów was annexed into the Soviet Ukraine, and the family, along with many other Polish citizens, was resettled to Kraków, where Lem, at his father&#x27;s insistence, took up medical studies at the Jagiellonian University. He did not take his final examinations on purpose, to avoid the career of military doctor, which he suspected could have become lifelong. After receiving &quot;absolutorium&quot; (Latin term for the evidence of completion of the studies without diploma), he did an obligatory monthly work at a hospital, at a maternity ward, where he assisted at a number of childbirths and a caesarean section. Lem said that the sight of blood was one of the reasons he decided to drop medicine.

===Rise to fame===

Lem started his literary work in 1946 with a number of publications in different genres, including poetry, as well as his first science fiction novel, &quot;The Man from Mars&quot;, serialized in &#x27; (&quot;New World of Adventures&quot;). Between 1948 and 1950 Lem was working as a scientific research assistant at the Jagiellonian University, and published a number of short stories, poems, reviews, etc., particularly in the magazine &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;. In 1951, he published his first book, &quot;The Astronauts&quot;. In 1954, he published a short story collection, &#x27; [&quot;Sesame and Other Stories&quot;] . The following year, 1955, saw the publication of another science fiction novel, &quot;The Magellanic Cloud&quot;.

During the era of Stalinism in Poland, which had begun in the late 1940s, all published works had to be directly approved by the state. Thus &quot;The Astronauts&quot; was not, in fact, the first novel Lem finished, just the first that made it past the state censors. Going by the date of the finished manuscript, Lem&#x27;s first book was a partly autobiographical novel &quot;Hospital of the Transfiguration&quot;, finished in 1948. It would be published seven years later, in 1955, as a part of the trilogy &quot;Czas nieutracony&quot; (&quot;Time Not Lost&quot;). The experience of trying to push &quot;Czas nieutracony&quot; through the censors was one of the major reasons Lem decided to focus on the less-censored genre of science fiction. Nonetheless, most of Lem&#x27;s works published in the 1950s also contain various elements of socialist realism as well as of the &quot;glorious future of communism&quot; forced upon him by the censors and editors. Lem later criticized several of his early pieces as compromised by the ideological pressure.

Lem became truly productive after 1956, when the de-Stalinization period in the Soviet Union led to the &quot;Polish October&quot;, when Poland experienced an increase in freedom of speech. Between 1956 and 1968, Lem authored seventeen books. His writing over the next three decades or so was split between science fiction and essays about science and culture.

In 1957, he published his first non-fiction, philosophical book, &quot;Dialogs&quot;, as well as a science fiction anthology, &quot;The Star Diaries&quot;, collecting short stories about one of his most popular characters, Ijon Tichy. 1959 saw the publication of three books: the novels &quot;Eden&quot; and &quot;The Investigation&quot;, and the short story anthology &quot;An Invasion from Aldebaran&quot; (&quot;Inwazja z Aldebarana&quot;). 1961 saw the novels &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot;, &quot;Solaris&quot;, and &quot;Return from the Stars&quot;, with &quot;Solaris&quot; being among his top works. This was followed by a collection of his essays and non-fiction prose, &quot;Wejście na orbitę&quot; (1962), and a short story anthology &quot;Noc księżycowa&quot; (1963). In 1964, Lem published a large work on the border of philosophy and sociology of science and futurology, &quot;Summa Technologiae&quot;, as well as a novel, &quot;The Invincible&quot;.

1965 saw the publication of &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; and of a short story collection, &quot;The Hunt&quot; (). 1966 was the year of &quot;Highcastle&quot;, followed in 1968 by &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; and &quot;Tales of Pirx the Pilot&quot;. &quot;Highcastle&quot; was another of Lem&#x27;s autobiographical works, and touched upon a theme that usually was not favored by the censors: Lem&#x27;s youth in the pre-war, then-Polish, Lviv. 1968 and 1970 saw two more non-fiction treatises, &quot;The Philosophy of Chance&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction and Futurology&quot;. Ijon Tichy returned in 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Futurological Congress&quot;; in the same year Lem released a genre-mixing experiment, &quot;A Perfect Vacuum&quot;, a collection of reviews of non-existent books. In 1973 a similar work, &quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot;, was published. In 1976, Lem published two works: &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;The Chain of Chance&quot;. In 1980, he published another set of reviews of non-existent works, &quot;Provocation&quot;. The following year saw another Tichy novel, &quot;Observation on the Spot&quot;, and &quot;Golem XIV&quot;. Later in that decade, Lem published &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fiasco&quot; (1986), his last science fiction novel.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lem cautiously supported the Polish dissident movement, and started publishing essays in the Paris-based magazine &quot;Kultura&quot;. In 1982, with martial law in Poland declared, Lem moved to West Berlin, where he became a fellow of the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (&quot;Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin&quot;). After that, he settled in Vienna. He returned to Poland in 1988.

===Final years===
From the late 1980s onwards, Lem tended to concentrate on philosophical texts and essays, published in Polish magazines including &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;, &quot;Odra&quot;, and &quot;Przegląd&quot;. These were later collected in a number of anthologies.

In early 1980s literary critic and historian Stanisław Bereś conducted a lengthy interview with Lem, which was published in book format in 1987 as &quot;Rozmowy ze Stanisławem Lemem&quot; (&quot;Conversations with Stanisław Lem)&quot;. That edition was subject to censorship. A revised, complete edition was published in 2002 as &quot;Tako rzecze… Lem&quot; (&quot;Thus spoke... Lem&quot;).

In the early 1990s, Lem met with the literary critic and scholar Peter Swirski for a series of extensive interviews, published together with other critical materials and translations as &quot;A Stanislaw Lem Reader&quot; (1997). In these interviews Lem speaks about a range of issues he rarely discussed previously. The book also includes Swirski&#x27;s translation of Lem&#x27;s retrospective essay &quot;Thirty Years Later&quot;, devoted to Lem&#x27;s nonfictional treatise &quot;Summa Technologiae&quot;. During later interviews in 2005, Lem expressed his disappointment with the genre of science fiction, and his general pessimism regarding technical progress. He viewed the human body as unsuitable for space travel, held that information technology drowns people in a glut of low-quality information, and considered truly intelligent robots as both undesirable and impossible to construct.

==Writings==

===Science fiction===
Lem&#x27;s prose shows a mastery of numerous genres and themes.

====Recurring themes====
One of Lem&#x27;s major recurring themes, beginning from his very first novel, &quot;The Man from Mars&quot;, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in &quot;Solaris&quot;. Other examples include the intelligent swarms of mechanical insect-like micromachines in &quot;The Invincible&quot;, and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in &quot;Fiasco&quot; and &quot;Eden&quot;, describing the failure of first contact.

Another key recurring theme is the shortcomings of humans. In &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;, Lem describes the failure of humanity&#x27;s intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space. Two overlapping arcs of short stories, &quot;Fables for Robots&quot; and &quot;The Cyberiad&quot; provide a commentary on humanity in the form of a series of grotesque, humorous, fairytale-like short stories about a mechanical universe inhabited by robots (who have occasional contact with biological &quot;slimies&quot; and human &quot;palefaces&quot;). Lem also underlines the uncertainties of evolution, including that it might not progress upwards in intelligence.

===Other writings===
&quot;The Investigation&quot; and &quot;The Chain of Chance&quot; are crime novels (the latter without a murderer); &quot;Pamiętnik...&quot; is a psychological drama inspired by Kafka. &quot;A Perfect Vacuum&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot; are collections of reviews of and introductions to non-existent books. Similarly, &quot;Provocations&quot; purports to review a non-existent Holocaust-themed work.

===Essays===
&quot;Dialogs&quot; and &quot;Summa Technologiae&quot; (1964) are Lem&#x27;s two most famous philosophical texts. The &quot;Summa&quot; is notable for being a unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were completely in the realm of science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual reality and nanotechnology.

===Views in later life===
Throughout the entirety of his life, Stanisław Lem remained deeply attached to his original hometown of Lwów (then in Poland, now Lviv in Ukraine) and missed it greatly. Although he never called for Poland to retake the city, he expressed sorrow and felt a sense of injustice at Poland losing the city to the USSR after the Second World War. His criticism of most science fiction surfaced in literary and philosophical essays &quot;Science Fiction and Futurology&quot; and interviews. In the 1990s, Lem forswore science fiction and returned to futurological prognostications, most notably those expressed in &quot;&quot; [&quot;Blink of an Eye&quot;]. He had a deep appreciation for the works of Polish writer Czesław Miłosz and respected Józef Piłsudski as a national leader. 

Lem said that since the success of the trade union Solidarity, and the collapse of the Soviet empire, he felt his wild dreams about the future could no longer compare with reality. He became increasingly critical of modern technology in his later life, criticising inventions such as the Internet, which he said &quot;makes it easier to hurt our neighbors.&quot; He was a proponent of nuclear power, which he saw as a potential means for Poland to secure its sovereignty via reducing dependency on fossil fuels from Russia. In his 2004-2006 columns for &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;, Lem was highly critical of Vladimir Putin, George W. Bush, Andrzej Lepper, Samoobrona, the League of Polish Families, and the All-Polish Youth.

==Relationship with American science fiction==
===SFWA===
Lem was awarded an honorary membership in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA honorary membership is given to people who do not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded. This formal action was interpreted by some of the SFWA members as a rebuke for his stance, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but he declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin, who quit her membership and then refused the Nebula Award for Best Novelette for &quot;The Diary of the Rose&quot;) protested against Lem&#x27;s treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.

===Philip K. Dick===
Lem singled out only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, in a 1984 English-language anthology of his critical essays, &quot;&quot;. Lem had initially held a low opinion of Philip K. Dick (as he did for the bulk of American science fiction) and would later say that this was due to a limited familiarity with Dick&#x27;s work, since Western literature was hard to come by in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

Dick alleged that Stanisław Lem was probably a false name used by a composite committee operating on orders of the Communist party to gain control over public opinion, and wrote a letter to the FBI to that effect. There were several attempts to explain Dick&#x27;s act. Lem was responsible for the Polish translation of Dick&#x27;s work &quot;Ubik&quot; in 1972, and when Dick felt monetarily short-changed by the publisher, he held Lem personally responsible (see &quot;Microworlds&quot;). Also it was suggested that Dick was under the influence of strong medications, including opioids, and may have experienced a &quot;slight disconnect from reality&quot; some time before writing the letter. A &quot;defensive patriotism&quot; of Dick against Lem&#x27;s attacks on American science fiction may have played some role as well. Lem would later mention Dick in his monograph &quot;Science Fiction and Futurology&quot;.

==Significance==
===Writing===

Lem is one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction writers, hailed by critics as equal to such classic authors as H. G. Wells and Olaf Stapledon. In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world. In Poland, in the 1960s and 1970s, Lem remained under the radar of mainstream critics, who dismissed him as a &quot;mass market&quot;, low-brow, youth-oriented writer; such dismissal might have given him a form of invisibility from censorship. His works were widely translated abroad, appearing in over 40 languages and have sold over 45 million copies. , about 1.5 million copies were sold in Poland after his death, with the annual numbers of 100,000 matching the new bestsellers.

Franz Rottensteiner, Lem&#x27;s former agent abroad, had this to say about Lem&#x27;s reception on international markets:
===Influence===
Will Wright&#x27;s popular city-planning game &quot;SimCity&quot; was partly inspired by Lem&#x27;s short story &quot;The Seventh Sally&quot; in &quot;The Cyberiad&quot;.

The video game &quot;Stellaris&quot; is highly inspired by his works, as its creators said at the start of 2021, designated the &quot;Year of Lem&quot;.

A major character in the film &quot;Planet 51&quot;, an alien Lem, was named by screenwriter Joe Stillman after Stanisław Lem. Since the film was intended to be a parody of American pulp science fiction shot in Eastern Europe, Stillman thought that it would be hilarious to hint at the writer whose works have nothing to do with little green men.

==Adaptations of Lem&#x27;s works==
&quot;Solaris&quot; was made into a film in 1968 by Russian director Boris Nirenburg, a film in 1972 by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky—which won a Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1972—and an American film in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh. Film critics have noted the influence of Tarkovsky&#x27;s adaptation on later science fiction films such as &quot;Event Horizon&quot; (1997) and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Inception&quot; (2010).

A number of other dramatic and musical adaptations of his work exist, such as adaptations of &quot;The Astronauts&quot; (&quot;First Spaceship on Venus&quot;, 1960) and &quot;The Magellanic Cloud&quot; (&quot;Ikarie XB-1&quot;, 1963). Lem himself was, however, critical of most of the screen adaptations, with the sole exception of &quot;Przekładaniec&quot; in 1968 by Andrzej Wajda. In 2013, the Israeli–Polish co-production &quot;The Congress&quot; was released, inspired by Lem&#x27;s novel &quot;The Futurological Congress&quot;.

György Pálfi directed a film adaptation of &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; with the same title, which was released in 2018.

In 2023, 11 Bit Studios published &quot;The Invincible&quot;, an adventure video game developed by Starward Industries. The game is an adaptation of Stanisław Lem&#x27;s 1964 novel.

==Political views==
Lem&#x27;s early works were socialist realist, possibly to satisfy state censorship, and in his later years he was critical of this aspect of them. In 1982, with the onset of the martial law in Poland, Lem moved to Berlin for studies, and the next year he moved for several years (1983–1988) to Vienna. He never showed any wish to relocate permanently in the West. By the standards of the Eastern Bloc, Lem was financially well off for most of his life. Lem was a critic of capitalism, totalitarianism, and of both Stalinist and Western ideologies.

Lem believed there were no absolutes. He said: &quot;I should wish, as do most men, that immutable truths existed, that not all would be eroded by the impact of historical time, that there were some essential propositions, be it only in the field of human values, the basic values, etc. In brief, I long for the absolute. But at the same time I am firmly convinced that there are no absolutes, that everything is historical, and that you cannot get away from history.&quot; Lem was concerned that if the human race attained prosperity and comfort, this would lead it to passiveness and degeneration.

==Personal life==

Lem was a polyglot: he knew Polish, Latin (from medical school), German, French, English, Russian and Ukrainian. Lem claimed that his IQ was tested at high school as 180.

In 1953, Lem met radiology student Barbara Leśniak, whom he married in a civil ceremony the same year. The couple&#x27;s church marriage ceremony was performed in February 1954. Barbara died on 27 April 2016. Their only child, (born 1968), who graduated with a degree in physics from Princeton University, has written &quot;Awantury na tle powszechnego ciążenia&quot; (&quot;Tantrums on the Background of the Universal Gravitation&quot;), a memoir which contains numerous personal details about Lem. The book jacket says Tomasz works as a translator and has a daughter, Anna.

As of 1984, Lem&#x27;s writing pattern was to get up a short time before five in the morning and start writing soon after, for 5 or 6 hours before taking a break.

Lem was an aggressive driver. He loved sweets (especially halva and chocolate-covered marzipan), and did not give them up even when, toward the end of his life, he fell ill with diabetes. In the mid-80s due to health problems he stopped smoking. Coffee often featured in Lem&#x27;s writing and interviews.

Stanisław Lem died from a heart failure in the hospital of the Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków on 27 March 2006 at the age of 84. He was buried at Salwator Cemetery, Sector W, Row 4, grave 17 ().

In November 2021, Agnieszka Gajewska&#x27;s biography of Lem, &quot;Holocaust and the Stars&quot;, was translated into English by Katarzyna Gucio and published by Routledge. It discussed aspects of Lem&#x27;s life, such as being forced to wear the yellow badge and being struck for not removing his hat in the presence of Germans, as required of Jews at the time.

Lem loved movies and greatly enjoyed artistic cinema (especially the movies of Luis Buñuel). He also liked King Kong, James Bond, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies but he remained mostly displeased by movies which were based upon his own stories. The only notable exceptions are &quot;Voyage to the End of the Universe&quot; (1963) (which didn&#x27;t credit Lem as writer of the original book &quot;The Magellanic Cloud&quot;) and &quot;Przekładaniec&quot; (&quot;Layer Cake&quot;) (1968) (which was based upon his short story &quot;Do You Exist, Mr Jones?&quot;).

<text>Satire is a genre of the visual, literary, and performing arts, usually in the form of fiction and less frequently non-fiction, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, often with the intent of exposing or shaming the perceived flaws of individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A prominent feature of satire is strong irony or sarcasm—&quot;in satire, irony is &quot;, according to literary critic Northrop Frye— but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This &quot;militant&quot; irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to question.

Satire is found in many artistic forms of expression, including internet memes, literature, plays, commentary, music, film and television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots==
The word &quot;satire&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;satur&quot; and the subsequent phrase &quot;.&quot; &quot;Satur&quot; meant &quot;full&quot;, but the juxtaposition with &quot;lanx&quot; shifted the meaning to &quot;miscellany or medley&quot;: the expression &quot;lanx satura&quot; literally means &quot;a full dish of various kinds of fruits&quot;. The use of the word &quot;lanx&quot; in this phrase, however, is disputed by B.L. Ullman.

The word &quot;satura&quot; as used by Quintilian, however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed hexameter form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as &quot;satire&quot;. Quintilian famously said that &quot;satura,&quot; that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (&quot;satura tota nostra est&quot;). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be Aristophanes&#x27; Old Comedy. The first critic to use the term &quot;satire&quot; in the modern broader sense was Apuleius.

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
The word &quot;satire&quot; derives from &quot;satura&quot;, and its origin was not influenced by the Greek mythological figure of the &quot;satyr&quot;. In the 17th century, philologist Isaac Casaubon was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.

==Humour==
Laughter is not an essential component of satire; in fact, there are types of satire that are not meant to be &quot;funny&quot; at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily &quot;satirical&quot;, even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and burlesque.

Even light-hearted satire has a serious &quot;after-taste&quot;: the organizers of the Ig Nobel Prize describe this as &quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;.

==Social and psychological functions==

Satire and irony in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of social study. They provide the keenest insights into a group&#x27;s collective psyche, reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society&#x27;s structures of power. Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or anthropology. In a prominent example from ancient Greece, philosopher Plato, when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of Aristophanes.

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular need to debunk and ridicule the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of power. Satire confronts public discourse and the collective imaginary, playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire&#x27;s job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it is not obligated to solve them. Karl Kraus set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension. Institutions like the ritual clowns, by giving expression to the antisocial tendencies, represent a safety valve which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the collective imaginary, which are jeopardized by the repressive aspects of society.

The state of political satire in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it, and the state of civil liberties and human rights. Under totalitarian regimes any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the Soviet Union where the dissidents, such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the USSR was allowed, the most prominent satirist being Arkady Raikin, political satire existed in the form of anecdotes that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially Brezhnev, famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric &quot;modes&quot;.

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===

Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or Menippean.

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist Horace (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and &quot;philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece&quot;. Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of &quot;gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings&quot;.

It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire&#x27;s sympathetic tone is common in modern society. A Horatian satirist&#x27;s goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.

====Juvenalian====
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist Juvenal (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Empire and actively attacked them through his literature. &quot;He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent&quot;. Juvenal&#x27;s satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.

A Juvenal satirist&#x27;s goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful. A Juvenal satirist mocks &quot;societal structure, power, and civilization&quot; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent&#x27;s reputation and/or power. Jonathan Swift has been established as an author who &quot;borrowed heavily from Juvenal&#x27;s techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society&quot;.

====Menippean====
===Satire vis-à-vis teasing===
In the history of theatre there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on politics and relevant issue, between satire and grotesque on one side, and jest with teasing on the other. Max Eastman defined the spectrum of satire in terms of &quot;degrees of biting&quot;, as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and &quot;kidding&quot; at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target. Nobel laureate satirical playwright Dario Fo pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (&quot;sfottò&quot;). Teasing is the reactionary side of the comic; it limits itself to a shallow parody of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a subversive character, and a moral dimension which draws judgement against its targets. Fo formulated an operational criterion to tell real satire from &quot;sfottò&quot;, saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing. Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.

Teasing (&quot;sfottò&quot;) is an ancient form of simple buffoonery, a form of comedy without satire&#x27;s subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an impersonation of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, tics, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with irony; it never harms the target&#x27;s conduct, ideology and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension. &quot;Sfottò&quot; directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him. Hermann Göring propagated jests and jokes against himself, with the aim of humanizing his image.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of Aristophanes, the primary topics of literary satire have been politics, religion and sex. This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually taboo. Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire. Satire which targets the clergy is a type of political satire, while religious satire is that which targets religious beliefs. Satire on sex may overlap with blue comedy, off-color humor and dick jokes.

Scatology has a long literary association with satire, as it is a classical mode of the grotesque, the grotesque body and the satiric grotesque. Shit plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes death, the turd being &quot;the ultimate dead object&quot;. The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human excrement, exposes their &quot;inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness&quot;. The ritual clowns of clown societies, like among the Pueblo Indians, have ceremonies with filth-eating. In other cultures, sin-eating is an apotropaic rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater), by ingesting the food provided, takes &quot;upon himself the sins of the departed&quot;. Satire about death overlaps with black humor and gallows humor.

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners. Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. Comedy of manners, sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes. Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible tones: wit, ridicule, irony, sarcasm, cynicism, the sardonic and invective.

The type of humour that deals with creating laughter at the expense of the person telling the joke is called reflexive humour. Reflexive humour can take place at dual levels of directing humour at self or at the larger community the self identifies with. The audience&#x27;s understanding of the context of reflexive humour is important for its receptivity and success. Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In preliterate cultures it manifests itself in ritual and folk forms, as well as in trickster tales and oral poetry.

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, cartoon strips, and graffiti. Examples are Dada sculptures, Pop Art works, music of Gilbert and Sullivan and Erik Satie, punk and rock music. In modern media culture, stand-up comedy is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into mass media, challenging mainstream discourse. Comedy roasts, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.

==Development==

===Ancient Egypt===

One of the earliest examples of what might be called satire, The Satire of the Trades, is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text&#x27;s apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck think that the context was meant to be serious.

The Papyrus Anastasi I (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader&#x27;s meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called &quot;satire&quot;, although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the Greek playwright Aristophanes one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and societal commentary, particularly for the political satire by which he criticized the powerful Cleon (as in &quot;The Knights&quot;). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent. Aristophanes&#x27; plays turned upon images of filth and disease. His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian Menander. His early play &quot;Drunkenness&quot; contains an attack on the politician Callimedon.

The oldest form of satire still in use is the Menippean satire by Menippus of Gadara. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of . As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.

===Ancient China===
Satire, or fengci (諷刺) the way it is called in Chinese, goes back at least to Confucius, being mentioned in the Book of Odes (Shijing 詩經). It meant &quot;to criticize by means of an ode&quot;. In the pre-Qin era it was also common for schools of thought to clarify their views through the use of short explanatory anecdotes, also called yuyan (寓言), translated as &quot;entrusted words&quot;. These yuyan usually were brimming with satirical content. The Daoist text Zhuangzi is the first to define this concept of Yuyan. During the Qin and Han dynasty, however, the concept of yuyan mostly died out through their heavy persecution of dissent and literary circles, especially by Qin Shi Huang and Han Wudi.

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was Quintilian, who invented the term to describe the writings of Gaius Lucilius. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are Horace and Juvenal, who wrote during the early days of the Roman Empire. Other important satirists in ancient Latin are Gaius Lucilius and Persius. &quot;Satire&quot; in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized Augustus, he used veiled ironic terms. In contrast, Pliny reports that the 6th-century-BC poet Hipponax wrote &quot;satirae&quot; that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.

In the 2nd century AD, Lucian wrote &quot;True History&quot;, a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by Ctesias, Iambulus, and Homer. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like them, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like &quot;Indica&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.

===Medieval Islamic world===
Medieval Arabic poetry included the satiric genre &quot;hija&quot;. Satire was introduced into Arabic prose literature by the author Al-Jahiz in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as anthropology, sociology and psychology, he introduced a satirical approach, &quot;based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in &quot;hija&quot;, satirical poetry.&quot; For example, in one of his zoological works, he satirized the preference for longer human penis size, writing: &quot;If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh&quot;. Another satirical story based on this preference was an &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tale called &quot;Ali with the Large Member&quot;.

In the 10th century, the writer Tha&#x27;alibi recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf&#x27;s wide breadth of knowledge and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return. An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as &quot;a transgressor of the Sharia&quot; and later Arabic poets in turn using the term &quot;Farazdaq-like&quot; as a form of political satire.

The terms &quot;comedy&quot; and &quot;satire&quot; became synonymous after Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Islamic philosophers and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as &quot;hija&quot; (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the &quot;art of reprehension&quot;, and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term &quot;comedy&quot; thus gained a new semantic meaning in Medieval literature.

Ubayd Zakani introduced satire in Persian literature during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices. He wrote the &quot;Resaleh-ye Delgosha&quot;, as well as &quot;Akhlaq al-Ashraf&quot; (&quot;Ethics of the Aristocracy&quot;) and the famous humorous fable &quot;Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh&quot; (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of Persian literature. Between 1905 and 1911, Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===

In the Early Middle Ages, examples of satire were the songs by Goliards or vagants now best known as an anthology called Carmina Burana and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer Carl Orff. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the High Middle Ages and the birth of modern vernacular literature in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by Chaucer. The disrespectful manner was considered &quot;unchristian&quot; and ignored, except for the moral satire, which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are &quot;Livre des Manières&quot; by (~1178), and some of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. Sometimes epic poetry (epos) was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

In the High Middle Ages the work Reynard the Fox, written by Willem die Madoc maecte, and its translations were a popular work that satirized the class system at the time. Representing the various classes as certain anthropomorphic animals. As example, the lion in the story represents the nobility, which is portrayed as being weak and without character, but very greedy. Versions of Reynard the Fox were also popular well into the early modern period. The Dutch translation Van den vos Reynaerde is considered a major medieval Dutch literary work. In the Dutch version De Vries argues that the animal characters represent barons who conspired against the Count of Flanders.

===Early modern western satire===

Direct social commentary via satire returned in the 16th century, when texts such as the works of François Rabelais tackled more serious issues.

Two major satirists of Europe in the Renaissance were Giovanni Boccaccio and François Rabelais. Other examples of Renaissance satire include &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, &quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;, Sebastian Brant&#x27;s &quot;Narrenschiff&quot; (1494), Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Moriae Encomium&quot; (1509), Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516), and &quot;Carajicomedia&quot; (1519).

The Elizabethan (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan &quot;satire&quot; (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French Huguenot Isaac Casaubon pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian&#x27;s writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the &quot;dishfull of fruits&quot;) became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the &quot;amendment of vices&quot; (Dryden).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of Hall&#x27;s &quot;Virgidemiarum&quot;, six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although Donne had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall&#x27;s was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model. The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall&#x27;s — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.

Another satiric genre to emerge around this time was the satirical almanac, with François Rabelais&#x27;s work &quot;Pantagrueline Prognostication&quot; (1532), which mocked astrological predictions. The strategies François utilized within this work were employed by later satirical almanacs, such as the &quot;Poor Robin&quot; series that spanned the 17th to 19th centuries.

=== Ancient and modern India ===
Satire (&quot;Kataksh&quot; or &quot;Vyang&quot;) has played a prominent role in Indian and Hindi literature, and is counted as one of the &quot;ras&quot; of literature in ancient books. With the commencement of printing of books in local language in the nineteenth century and especially after India&#x27;s freedom, this grew. Many of the works of Tulsi Das, Kabir, Munshi Premchand, village minstrels, Hari katha singers, poets, Dalit singers and current day stand up Indian comedians incorporate satire, usually ridiculing authoritarians, fundamentalists and incompetent people in power. In India, it has usually been used as a means of expression and an outlet for common people to express their anger against authoritarian entities.

===Age of Enlightenment===
The Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the Tory and Whig parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the Scriblerus Club, which included Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Thomas Parnell, and Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, &quot;an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship&quot;. In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting &quot;juvenal&quot; satire.

Jonathan Swift was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the &quot;problem&quot; of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. John Dryden wrote an influential essay entitled &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire&quot; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; was written in response to a rivalry with Thomas Shadwell and eventually inspired Alexander Pope to write his satirical &quot;Dunciad&quot;.
Alexander Pope (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Famous throughout and after the long 18th century, Pope died in 1744. Pope, in his &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which Pope was translating at the time of writing &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.
Other satirical works by Pope include the &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot;.

Daniel Defoe pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his &quot;The True-Born Englishman&quot; which mocks xenophobic patriotism, and &quot;The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters&quot;—advocating religious toleration by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of William Hogarth is a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th-century England. The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, James Gillray from London. With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray&#x27;s wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent cartoonist of the era.

Ebenezer Cooke (1665–1732), author of &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; (1708), was among the first writers of literary satire in Colonial America. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation&#x27;s culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===

Several satiric papers competed for the public&#x27;s attention in the Victorian era (1837–1901) and Edwardian period, such as &quot;Punch&quot; (1841) and &quot;Fun&quot; (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the Savoy Operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. In fact, in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert&#x27;s own intent:
:&quot;I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,&quot;
:&quot;The upstart I can wither with a whim;&quot;
:&quot;He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,&quot;
:&quot;But his laughter has an echo that is grim!&quot;

Novelists such as Charles Dickens (1812–1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, Sidney Godolphin Osborne (1808–1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; of the London &quot;Times&quot;. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the Junius letters. Osborne&#x27;s satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from Parliament&#x27;s then Home Secretary Sir James Graham. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government&#x27;s and landlords&#x27; mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the New Poor Laws and was passionate on the subject of the British government&#x27;s botched response to the Great Irish Famine and the mistreatment of British soldiers during the Crimean War.

A number of works of fiction during this time, influenced by Egyptomania, used the backdrop of Ancient Egypt as a device for satire. Some works, like Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;Some Words with a Mummy&quot; (1845) and Grant Allen&#x27;s &quot;My New Year&#x27;s Eve Among the Mummies&quot; (1878), portrayed Egyptian civilization as having already achieved many of the Victorian era&#x27;s advancements (like the steam engine and gaslamps) in an effort to satire the notion of progress. Other works, like Jane Loudon&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century&quot;, satirized Victorian curiosities with the afterlife.

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, Mark Twain (1835–1910) grew to become American&#x27;s greatest satirist: his novel &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884) is set in the antebellum South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the &quot;sinful temptation&quot; that leads him to help a fugitive slave. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain&#x27;s younger contemporary Ambrose Bierce (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a cynic, pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the American Civil War, which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce&#x27;s most famous work of satire is probably &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, hypocrisy and received wisdom.

===20th-century satire===
Karl Kraus is considered the first major European satirist since Jonathan Swift. In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as Aldous Huxley (1930s) and George Orwell (1940s), which under the inspiration of Zamyatin&#x27;s Russian 1921 novel &quot;We&quot;, made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Anatoly Lunacharsky wrote &#x27;Satire attains its greatest significance when a newly evolving class creates an ideology considerably more advanced than that of the ruling class, but has not yet developed to the point where it can conquer it. Herein lies its truly great ability to triumph, its scorn for its adversary and its hidden fear of it. Herein lies its venom, its amazing energy of hate, and quite frequently, its grief, like a black frame around glittering images. Herein lie its contradictions, and its power.&#x27; Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken, used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that &quot;one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms&quot; in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist Sinclair Lewis was known for his satirical stories such as &quot;Main Street&quot; (1920), &quot;Babbitt&quot; (1922), &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Mencken), and &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940) by Charlie Chaplin is itself a parody of Adolf Hitler; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the concentration camps.

Modern Soviet satire was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. This form of satire is recognized by its level of sophistication and intelligence used, along with its own level of parody. Since there is no longer the need of survival or revolution to write about, modern Soviet satire focused on the quality of life.
In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American stand-up comedy most prominently by Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl. As they challenged the taboos and conventional wisdom of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as &quot;sick comedians&quot;. In the same period, Paul Krassner&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Realist&quot; began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the counterculture; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, the Vietnam War, the Cold War and the War on Drugs. This baton was also carried by the original National Lampoon magazine, edited by Doug Kenney and Henry Beard and featuring blistering satire written by Michael O&#x27;Donoghue, P.J. O&#x27;Rourke, and Tony Hendra, among others. Prominent satiric stand-up comedian George Carlin acknowledged the influence &quot;The Realist&quot; had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the satire boom, led by comedians including Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore, whose stage show &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include David Frost, Eleanor Bron and the television program &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;.

Joseph Heller&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century. Departing from traditional Hollywood farce and screwball, director and comedian Jerry Lewis used satire in his self-directed films &quot;The Bellboy&quot; (1960), &quot;The Errand Boy&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964) to comment on celebrity and the star-making machinery of Hollywood. The film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) starring Peter Sellers was a popular satire on the Cold War. Sellers and the British satire boom had a direct influence on the comedy troupe Monty Python. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979) &quot;an unrivalled satire on religion&quot;.

Severino &quot;Nonoy&quot; Marcelo&#x27;s 1978 Philippine adult animated comedy film, &quot;Tadhana&quot;, presents a satirical, humorous and poignant view of the Philippines&#x27; history of Spanish colonization.

=== Contemporary satire ===

Contemporary popular usage of the term &quot;satire&quot; is often very imprecise. While satire often uses caricature and parody, by no means are all uses of these or other humorous devices satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article. &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Roman Satire&quot; also warns of the ambiguous nature of satire: 

Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as &quot;Mock the Week&quot; (2005–2022) and &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as &quot;The News Quiz&quot; (1977–ongoing) and &quot;The Now Show&quot; (1998–2024). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was a satire of the royal family, politics, entertainment, sport and British culture of the era. Court Flunkey from &quot;Spitting Image&quot; is a caricature of James Gillray, intended as a homage to the father of political cartooning.

Created by DMA Design in 1997, satire features prominently in the British video game series &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. Another example is the &quot;Fallout&quot; series, namely Interplay-developed &quot;Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game&quot; (1995). Other games utilizing satire include &quot;Postal&quot; (1997), &quot;State of Emergency&quot; (2002), &quot;Phone Story&quot; (2011), and &quot;7 Billion Humans&quot; (2018).

Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s &quot;South Park&quot; (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing racism, anti-Semitism, militant atheism, homophobia, sexism, environmentalism, corporate culture, political correctness and anti-Catholicism, among many other issues.

Satirical web series and sites include Emmy-nominated &quot;Honest Trailers&quot; (2012–), Internet phenomena-themed Encyclopedia Dramatica (2004–), Uncyclopedia (2005–), self-proclaimed &quot;America&#x27;s Finest News Source&quot; &quot;The Onion&quot; (1988–). and &quot;The Onion&#x27;s&quot; Christian conservative counterpart &quot;The Babylon Bee&quot; (2016–).
In the United States, Stephen Colbert&#x27;s television program, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; (2005–14) is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire; sketch comedy television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures Hillary Clinton and of Sarah Palin. Colbert&#x27;s character is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and &quot;unwittingly&quot; uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist was the late Sir Terry Pratchett, author of the internationally best-selling &quot;Discworld&quot; book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is Chris Morris, co-writer and director of &quot;Four Lions&quot;.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. Stephen Leacock was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small-town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including &quot;CODCO&quot;, &quot;The Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;, &quot;This Is That&quot;, and &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like &quot;History Bites&quot; present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Beaverton is a Canadian news satire site similar to The Onion. Canadian songwriter Nancy White uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on CBC Radio.

In Hong Kong, there was a well-known Australian Kim Jong-un impersonator Howard X whom often utilised satire to show his support for Hong Kong city&#x27;s pro-democracy movements and liberation of North Korea. He believed that humour is a very powerful weapon and he often made it clear that he imitates the dictator to satirize him, not to glorify him. Throughout his career as a professional impersonator, he had also worked with multiple organisations and celebrities to create parodies and to stir up conversations of politics and human rights.

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. Al Capp&#x27;s satirical comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in &quot;Time&quot;, centred on Capp&#x27;s portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, &quot;We don&#x27;t think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.&quot; Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pogo&quot; was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of Senator Joe McCarthy, caricatured in his comic strip as &quot;Simple J. Malarky&quot;. Garry Trudeau, whose comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character Mark Slackmeyer lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the &quot;exquisite agony&quot; of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.
Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and caricature; for instance, the popular animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

News satire is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. &quot;The Onion&quot;, &quot;Waterford Whispers News&quot;, &quot;Private Eye&quot;), radio (e.g. &quot;On the Hour&quot;), television (e.g. &quot;The Day Today&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot;) and the web (e.g. &quot;Faking News&quot;, &quot;El Koshary Today&quot;, &quot;Babylon Bee&quot;, &quot;The Beaverton&quot;, &quot;The Daily Bonnet&quot; and &quot;The Onion&quot;). Other satires are on the list of satirists and satires.

In an interview with &quot;Wikinews&quot;, Sean Mills, President of &quot;The Onion&quot;, said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. &quot;It&#x27;s whatever affects that person&quot;, said Mills. &quot;So it&#x27;s like, &#x27;I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that&#x27;s not funny to me.&#x27; Or someone else can say, &#x27;Cancer&#x27;s &quot;hilarious&quot;, but don&#x27;t talk about rape because my cousin got raped.&#x27; Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it.&quot;

Satire is also gaining recognition for its value in social science research, particularly when authors are seeking to unpack complex social issues like gendered racism.

Satire is regularly used by social movements covering a range of issues to achieve strategic goals. US community organizer and author of Rules for Radicals, Saul Alinsky, stated, &quot;&#x27;Humour is essential to a successful tactician, for the most potent weapons known to [people] are satire and ridicule&quot;.

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, reprising previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice. Exaggeration is one of the most common satirical techniques. Contrarily diminution is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions. In Germany, Japan, and Italy satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of art and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere freedom of information of journalistic kind. In some countries a specific &quot;right to satire&quot; is recognized and its limits go beyond the &quot;right to report&quot; of journalism and even the &quot;right to criticize&quot;. Satire benefits not only of the protection to freedom of speech, but also to that to culture, and that to scientific and artistic production.

=== Australia ===

In September 2017 The Juice Media received an e-mail from the Australian National Symbols Officer requesting that the use of a satirical logo, called the &quot;Coat of Harms&quot; based on the Australian Coat of Arms, no longer be used as they had received complaints from the members of the public. Coincidentally 5 days later a Bill was proposed to Australian parliament to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995. If passed, those found to be in breach of the new amendment can face 2–5 years imprisonment.

As of June 2018, the Criminal Code Amendment (Impersonating a Commonwealth Body) Bill 2017 was before the Australian Senate with the third reading moved May 10, 2018.

==Censorship and criticism==
Descriptions of satire&#x27;s biting effect on its target include &#x27;venomous&#x27;, &#x27;cutting&#x27;, &#x27;stinging&#x27;, vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with their persona.

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of poor taste, or that &quot;it&#x27;s just not funny&quot; for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people being ridiculed. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift&#x27;s purpose in &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism. Much later in history, in the weeks following 9/11 the American public at large found works of satire to be in bad taste and not appropriate for the social climate at the time. Some media outlets at the time, like essayist Roger Rosenblatt in an editorial for &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 24 issue, would go so far as to claim that irony was dead.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of Mark Twain see &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; as racist and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain&#x27;s known concerns attacked in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;). This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. The character of Alf Garnett (played by Warren Mitchell) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, little Englander that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of anti-hero to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with Archie Bunker in American TV show &quot;All in the Family&quot;, a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot; has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the &quot;target&quot; of its attacks. The &quot;Make a Realistic Wish Foundation&quot; sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to charities, was widely interpreted as an attack on the Make a Wish Foundation, or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. Prime Minister of the time Kevin Rudd stated that The Chaser team &quot;should hang their heads in shame&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;I didn&#x27;t see that but it&#x27;s been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale.&quot; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the romantic movement that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day. Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study. For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes censorship in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, Aristophanes was persecuted by the demagogue Cleon.

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft, whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in England, issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the Bishops&#x27; Ban of 1599, ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by John Marston, Thomas Middleton, Joseph Hall, and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council, and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the Martin Marprelate controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both Thomas Nashe and Gabriel Harvey, two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many in the Near East. It was not the first case of Muslim protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country&#x27;s flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the freedom of speech, and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an International Holocaust Cartoon Competition, which was immediately responded to by Jews with an Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest.

In 2006 British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen released &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;, a &quot;mockumentary&quot; that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was antisemitic, and the government of Kazakhstan boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist Jonathan Shapiro (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the ANC Jacob Zuma in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of &#x27;Lady Justice&#x27; which is held down by Zuma loyalists. The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma&#x27;s efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of rape in May 2006. In February 2009, the South African Broadcasting Corporation, viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC, shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro, and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.

On December 29, 2009, Samsung sued Mike Breen, and the &quot;Korea Times&quot; for $1 million, claiming criminal defamation over a satirical column published on Christmas Day, 2009.

On April 29, 2015, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) requested Kent Police investigate the BBC, claiming that comments made about Party leader Nigel Farage by a panelist on the comedy show &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act. Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, &quot;Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties.&quot;

==Satirical prophecy==
Satire is occasionally prophetic: the jokes precede actual events. Among the eminent examples are:
* The 1784 presaging of modern daylight saving time, later actually proposed in 1907. While an American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that Parisians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.
* In the 1920s, an English cartoonist imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a multi-story car park.
* The second episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which debuted in 1969, featured a &quot;sketch&quot; entitled &quot;The Mouse Problem&quot; (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon similar to some aspects of the modern furry fandom (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the sketch was first aired).
* The comedy film &quot;Americathon&quot;, released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese capitalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of reality shows.
* In January 2001, a satirical news article in &quot;The Onion&quot;, entitled &quot;Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over&quot; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to &quot;develop new and expensive weapons technologies&quot; and to &quot;engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years&quot;. Furthermore, he would &quot;bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession&quot;. This prophesied the Iraq War, the Bush tax cuts, and the Great Recession.
* In 1975, the first episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, Gillette introduced the Mach3. In 2004, &quot;The Onion&quot; satirized Schick and Gillette&#x27;s marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor. In 2006, Gillette released the Gillette Fusion, a five-blade razor.
* After the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, &quot;The Onion&quot; ran an article with the headline &quot;U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles&quot;. Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.
* In July 2016, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential Donald Trump presidency (although the first was made back in a 2000 episode). Other media sources, including the popular film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; have also made similar satirical references.
* &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, published in 1996, described an alternate America following the presidency of Johnny Gentle, a celebrity who had not held prior political office. Gentle&#x27;s signature policy was the erection of a wall between the United States and Canada for use as a hazardous waste dump. The US territory behind the wall was &quot;given&quot; to Canada, and the Canadian government was forced to pay for the wall. This appeared to parody the signature campaign promise and background of Donald Trump.

<text>Samuel Butler (baptized 14 February 1613 – 25 September 1680) was an English poet and satirist. He is remembered now chiefly for a long satirical poem titled &quot;Hudibras&quot;.

==Biography==
Samuel Butler was born in Strensham, Worcestershire, and was the son of a farmer and churchwarden, also named Samuel. His date of birth is unknown, but there is documentary evidence for the date of his baptism of 14 February. The date of Butler&#x27;s baptism is given as 8 February by Treadway Russell Nash in his 1793 edition of &quot;Hudibras&quot;. Nash had already mentioned Butler in his &quot;Collections for a History of Worcestershire&quot; (1781), and perhaps because the latter date seemed to be a revised account, it has been repeated by many writers and editors. However, The parish register of Strensham records under the year 1612: &quot;Item was christened Samuell Butler the sonne of Samuell Butler the xiiijth of February anno ut supra&quot;. Lady Day, 25 March, was New Year&#x27;s Day in England at the time, so the year of his baptism was 1613 according to the change of the start of the year with the Calendar Act of 1750 (see Old Style and New Style dates). Nash also claims in his 1793 edition of &quot;Hudibras&quot; that Butler&#x27;s father entered his son&#x27;s baptism into the register, an error that was also repeated in later publications; however, the entry was clearly written by a different hand.

Butler was brought up in the household of Sir William Russell of Strensham and became his clerk. &quot;When just a Boy he would make observations and reflections on every Thing one sayd or did, and censure it to be either well or ill. He was never at the University for the reason alleged.&quot; He was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Worcester, under Henry Bright whose teaching is recorded favourably by Thomas Fuller, a contemporary writer, in his &quot;Worthies of England&quot;. In early youth he was a servant to the Countess of Kent. Through Lady Kent he met her steward, the jurist John Selden who influenced his later writings. He also tried his hand at painting but was reportedly not very good at it; one of his editors reporting that &quot;his pictures served to stop windows and save the tax&quot; (on window glass). Conversely, John Aubrey who knew Butler quite well enough to be one of his pallbearers, wrote that &quot;He was thinking once to have made painting his Profession. His love to and skill in painting made a great friendship between him and Mr. Samuel Cowper (The Prince of Limners of this Age).&quot; He studied law but did not practice.

After the Restoration he became secretary, or steward, to Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery, Lord President of Wales, which entailed living at least a year in Ludlow, Shropshire, until January 1662 while he was paying craftsmen working on repairing the castle there. In late 1662 the first part of &quot;Hudibras&quot;, which he began writing when lodging at Holborn, London, in 1658 and continued to work on while in Ludlow, was published, and the other two in 1664 and 1678 respectively. One early purchaser of the first two parts was Samuel Pepys. While the diarist acknowledged that the book was the &quot;greatest fashion&quot; he could not see why it was found to be so witty.

Despite the popularity of &quot;Hudibras&quot;, Butler was not offered a place at Court. &quot;Satyrical Witts disoblige whom they converse with; and consequently make to themselves many Enemies and few Friends; and this was his manner and case.&quot; However, Butler is thought to have been in the employment of the Duke of Buckingham in the summer of 1670, and accompanied him on a diplomatic mission to France. Butler also received financial support in the form of a grant from King Charles II.

During the latter part of his life, Butler lived in a house in the now partially demolished Rose Street, to the west of Covent Garden.

==Death==
Butler died of consumption on 25 September 1680, and was buried on 27 September in the Church-yard of St. Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden; in the north part next to the church at the east end. &quot;His feet touch the wall. His grave 2 yards distant from the Pillaster of the Dore (by his desire) 6 feet deep&quot; at the expense of a Mr. Longueville, although he was not in debt when he died. Aubrey in &quot;Brief Lives&quot; describes his grave as &quot;being in the north part next to the church at the east end ... 2 yards distant from the pillaster of the dore&quot;. Also, a monument to him was placed in Westminster Abbey in 1732 by a printer, John Barber, and the Lord Mayor of London. There is also a memorial plaque to him in the small village church of Strensham, Worcestershire, near the town of Upton upon Severn, his birthplace.

==&quot;Hudibras&quot;==
&quot;Hudibras&quot; is directed against religious sectarianism. The poem was very popular in its time, and several of its phrases have passed into the dictionary. It was sufficiently popular to spawn imitators. &quot;Hudibras&quot; takes some of its characterization from &quot;Don Quixote&quot; but, unlike that work, it has many more references to personalities and events of the day. Butler was also influenced by satirists such as John Skelton and Paul Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Virgile travesti&quot;; a satire on classical literature, particularly Virgil.

&quot;Hudibras&quot; was reprinted many times in the centuries following Butler&#x27;s death. Two of the more noteworthy editions are those edited by Zachery Grey (1744) and Treadway Russell Nash (1793). The standard edition of the work was edited by John Wilders (1967).

==Other writings==
Most of his other writings never saw print until they were collected and published by Robert Thyer in 1759. Butler wrote many short biographies, epigrams and verses, the earliest surviving from 1644. Of his verses, the best known is &quot;The Elephant on the Moon&quot;, about a mouse trapped in a telescope, a satire on Sir Paul Neale of the Royal Society. Butler&#x27;s taste for the mock heroic is shown by another early poem &quot;Cynarctomachy&quot;, or Battle between Bear and Dogs, which is both a homage to and a parody of a Greek poem ascribed to Homer, &quot;Batrachomyomachia&quot;. 
He wrote the poem &quot;Upon Philip Nye&#x27;s Thanksgiving Beard&quot; about the Puritan Philip Nye and later also mentioned him in &quot;Hudibras&quot;.

His supposed lack of money later in life is strange as he had numerous unpublished works which could have offered him income including a set of Theophrastan character sketches which were not printed until 1759. Many other works are dubiously attributed to him.

<text>The saxophone (often referred to colloquially as the sax) is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument with a conical body, usually made of brass. As with all single-reed instruments, sound is produced when a reed on a mouthpiece vibrates to produce a sound wave inside the instrument&#x27;s body. The pitch is controlled by opening and closing holes in the body to change the effective length of the tube. The holes are closed by leather pads attached to keys operated by the player. Saxophones are made in various sizes and are almost always treated as transposing instruments. A person who plays the saxophone is called a &quot;saxophonist&quot; or &quot;saxist&quot;.

The saxophone is used in a wide range of musical styles including classical music (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and occasionally orchestras), military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and contemporary music. The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music.

The saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 1840s and was patented on 28 June 1846. Sax invented two groups of seven instruments each—one group contained instruments in C and F, and the other group contained instruments in B and E. The B and E instruments soon became dominant, and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a foothold and constituted only a small fraction of instruments made by Sax. &quot;High-pitch&quot; (also marked &quot;H&quot; or &quot;HP&quot;) saxophones tuned sharper than the (concert) A = 440 Hz standard were produced into the early twentieth century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor use, but are not playable to modern tuning and are considered obsolete. &quot;Low-pitch&quot; (also marked &quot;L&quot; or &quot;LP&quot;) saxophones are equivalent in tuning to modern instruments. C soprano and C melody saxophones were produced for the casual market as parlor instruments during the early twentieth century, and saxophones in F were introduced during the late 1920s but never gained acceptance.

The modern consists entirely of B and E instruments. The saxophones in widest use are the B soprano, E alto, B tenor, and E baritone. The E sopranino and B bass saxophone are typically used in larger saxophone choir settings, when available. 

In the table below, consecutive members of each family are pitched an octave apart. 
==Description==

===Construction===
The pitch of a saxophone is controlled by opening or closing the tone holes along the body of the instrument to change the length of the vibrating air column. The tone holes are closed by leather pads connected to keys—most are operated by the player&#x27;s fingers, but some are operated using the palm or the side of a finger. There is an octave key, which raises the pitch of the lower notes by one octave. The lowest note on most modern saxophones is the written B below middle C. Nearly all baritone saxophones are now constructed with an extra key to allow them to play low A, and a small number of altos with a low A key have been manufactured. The highest keyed note has traditionally been the F two and a half octaves above the low B, but many instruments now have an extra key for a high F, and some modern soprano saxophones even have a high G key. Notes above this are part of the altissimo register and require advanced embouchure techniques and fingering combinations.

Saxophone music is written in treble clef, appropriately transposed for each different type of instrument, and all saxophones use the same key arrangement and fingerings. Therefore any written note corresponds to the same fingering on any saxophone, making it easier for players to switch instruments.

Alto and larger saxophones have a detachable curved neck at the top, and a U-shaped bend (the &quot;bow&quot;) that turns the tubing upward as it approaches the bell. Soprano and sopranino saxophones are usually constructed without a detachable neck or a bow but some have a small detachable neck and some are shaped like an alto saxophone with a bow section. There are rare examples of alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones with mostly straight bodies. Baritone, bass, and contrabass saxophones have extra bends to accommodate the length of tubing. The fingering system for the saxophone is similar to the systems used for the oboe, the Boehm-system clarinet, and the flute.

===Materials===
From the earliest days of the saxophone the body and key cups have been made from sheet brass stock, which can be worked into complex shapes. The keywork is manufactured from other types of brass stock. King made saxophones with necks and bells of sterling silver from the 1930s into the early 1960s. Yanagisawa revived this idea in the 1980s and later introduced instruments entirely made of sterling silver. 
Keilwerth and P. Mauriat have used nickel silver, a copper-nickel-zinc alloy more commonly used for flutes, for the bodies of some saxophone models. 
For visual and tonal effect, higher copper variants of brass are sometimes substituted for the more common &quot;yellow brass&quot; and &quot;cartridge brass.&quot; Yanagisawa made its 902 and 992 series saxophones with the high copper alloy phosphor bronze to achieve a darker, more &quot;vintage&quot; tone than the brass 901 and 991 models.

Other materials are used for some mechanical parts and keywork. Buttons where the fingers contact the keys are usually made from plastic or mother of pearl. Rods, screw pins, and springs are usually made of blued or stainless steel. Mechanical buffers of felt, cork, leather, and various synthetic materials are used to minimize mechanical noise from key movement and to optimize the action of the keywork. Nickel silver is sometimes used for hinges for its advantages of mechanical durability, although the most common material for such applications has remained brass.

Manufacturers usually apply a finish to the surface of the instrument&#x27;s body and keywork. The most common finish is a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer to protect the brass from oxidation and maintain a shiny appearance. Silver or gold plating are offered as options on some models. Some silver plated saxophones are also lacquered. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because an underplating of silver is required for the gold to adhere to. Nickel plating has been used on the bodies of early budget model saxophones and is commonly used on keywork when a more durable finish is desired, mostly with student model saxophones. Chemical surface treatment of the base metal has come into use as an alternative to the lacquer and plating finishes in recent years.

===Mouthpiece and reed===

The saxophone uses a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. Each size of saxophone (alto, tenor, etc.) uses a different size of reed and mouthpiece.

Most saxophonists use reeds made from &quot;Arundo donax&quot; cane, but since the middle of the twentieth century some have been made of fiberglass or other composite materials. Saxophone reeds are proportioned slightly differently from clarinet reeds, being wider for the same length. Commercial reeds vary in hardness and design, and single-reed players try different reeds to find those that suit their mouthpiece, embouchure, and playing style.

Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone. Different mouthpiece design characteristics and features tend to be favored for different styles. Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;round&quot; sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave (&quot;excavated&quot;) &quot;chamber&quot; are truer to Adolphe Sax&#x27;s original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by the Raschèr school of classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers for a somewhat &quot;brighter&quot; sound with relatively more upper harmonics. The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles from the 1920s onward placed emphasis on dynamic range and projection, leading to innovation in mouthpiece designs. At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high &quot;baffle&quot;. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments.

Mouthpieces come in a wide variety of materials including vulcanized rubber (sometimes called hard rubber or ebonite), plastic and metals like bronze or surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, crystal, porcelain and bone. Recently, Delrin has been added to the stock of mouthpiece materials.

The effect of mouthpiece materials on tone of the saxophone has been the subject of much debate. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone color. There are examples of &quot;dark&quot; sounding metal pieces and &quot;bright&quot; sounding hard rubber pieces. The extra bulk required near the tip with hard rubber affects mouth position and airflow characteristics.
==History==
===Early development and adoption===

The saxophone was designed around 1840 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, flautist, and clarinetist. Born in Dinant and originally based in Brussels, he moved to Paris in 1842 to establish his musical instrument business. Before working on the saxophone, he made several improvements to the bass clarinet by improving its keywork and acoustics and extending its lower range. Sax was also a maker of the ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument. His experience with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies needed to make the first saxophones.

As an outgrowth of his work improving the bass clarinet, Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass instrument and the agility of a woodwind. He wanted it to overblow at the octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown. An instrument that overblows at the octave has identical fingering for both registers.

Sax created an instrument with a single-reed mouthpiece and conical brass body. Having constructed saxophones in several sizes in the early 1840s, Sax applied for, and received, a 15-year patent for the instrument on 28 June 1846. The patent encompassed 14 versions of the fundamental design, split into two categories of seven instruments each, and ranging from sopranino to contrabass. A limited number of instruments in the series pitched in F and C were produced by Sax, but the series pitched in E and B quickly became the standard. All the instruments were given an initial written range from the B below the treble staff to the E one half-step below the third ledger line above staff, giving each saxophone a range of two and a half octaves. Sax&#x27;s patent expired in 1866. Thereafter, numerous other instrument manufacturers implemented their own improvements to the design and keywork.

Sax&#x27;s original keywork, which was based on the &quot;Triebert system 3&quot; oboe for the left hand and the &quot;Boehm&quot; clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made certain legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger; that system was later improved with extra keys, linkage mechanisms, and alternate fingerings.

Early in the development of the saxophone the upper keyed range was extended to E, then to F above the staff; 1880s era sheet music for saxophone was written for the range of low B to F. In 1887 the Buffet-Crampon company obtained a patent for extending the bell and adding an extra key to extend the range downwards by one semitone to B. This extension is standard in modern designs, with the notable exception of baritone saxophones which have keys down to low A. The upper range to F remained the standard for nearly a century until a high F key became common on modern saxophones.

In the 1840s and 1850s, Sax&#x27;s invention gained use in small classical ensembles (both all-saxophone and mixed), as a solo instrument, and in French and British military bands. Saxophone method books were published and saxophone instruction was offered at conservatories in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. By 1856 the French &quot;Garde Republicaine&quot; band was the largest ensemble of its time to prominently feature the instrument, using eight saxophones. The saxophone was used experimentally in orchestral scores, but never came into widespread use as an orchestral instrument. In 1853-54 the orchestra of Louis Antoine Jullien featured a soprano saxophone on a concert tour of the United States.

After an early period of interest and support from classical music communities in Europe, interest in the saxophone as a classical instrument waned in the late nineteenth century. Saxophone teaching at the Paris Conservatory was suspended from 1870 to 1900 and classical saxophone repertoire stagnated during that period. But it was during this same period that the saxophone began to be promoted in the United States, largely through the efforts of Patrick Gilmore, leader of the &quot;22nd Regiment band&quot;, and Edward A. Lefebre, a Dutch emigré and saxophonist who had family business associations with Sax. Lefebre settled in New York in early 1872 after he arrived as a clarinetist with a British opera company. Gilmore organized the World Peace Jubilee and International Music Festival taking place in Boston that summer. The Garde Republicaine band performed and Lefebre was a clarinetist with the Great Festival Orchestra for that event. In the fall of 1873 Gilmore was reorganizing the 22nd Regiment band under the influence of the Garde Republicaine band and recruited Lefebre, who had established a reputation in New York as a saxophonist over the previous year. Gilmore&#x27;s band soon featured a soprano-alto-tenor-baritone saxophone section, which also performed as a quartet. The Gilmore-Lefebre association lasted until Gilmore&#x27;s death in 1892, during which time Lefebre also performed in smaller ensembles of various sizes and instrumentation, and worked with composers to increase light classical and popular repertoire for saxophone.

Lefebre&#x27;s later promotional efforts were very significant in broadening adoption of the saxophone. Starting near the end of the 1880s he consulted with the brass instrument manufacturer C.G. Conn to develop and start production of improved saxophones to replace the costly, scarce, and mechanically unreliable European instruments that were in the American market. The early 1890s saw regular production of saxophones commence at Conn and its offshoot Buescher Manufacturing Company, which dramatically increased availability of saxophones in the US. Lefebre worked with the music publisher Carl Fischer to distribute his transcriptions, arrangements, and original works for saxophone, and worked with the Conn Conservatory to further saxophone pedagogy in the US. Lefebre&#x27;s associations with Conn and Fischer lasted into the first decade of the twentieth century and Fischer continued to publish new arrangements of Lefebre&#x27;s works after his death.

===Early twentieth-century growth and development===

While the saxophone remained marginal, used mainly as a novelty instrument in the classical world, many new musical niches were established for it during the early decades of the twentieth century. Its early use in vaudeville and ragtime bands around the turn of the century laid the groundwork for its use in dance orchestras and eventually jazz. As the market for saxophones grew in the US, the manufacturing industry grew. The Martin Band Instrument Company started producing saxophones between 1905 and 1912, and the Cleveland Band Instrument Company started producing saxophones under contract to the H. N. White Company in 1916. The saxophone was promoted for the casual market with introduction of the C soprano (slightly higher than the regular soprano) and C melody (between alto and tenor) saxophones, both pitched in C to enable them to play from piano music. Production of such instruments stopped during the Great Depression. During the 1920s the saxophone came into use as a jazz instrument, fostered by the influences of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra and the Duke Ellington Orchestra. Starting in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the modern era of classical saxophone was launched largely through the efforts of Marcel Mule and Sigurd Raschèr, and the classical repertoire for the instrument expanded rapidly.

The use of the saxophone for more dynamic and more technically demanding styles of playing added incentive for improvements in keywork and acoustic design. Early saxophones had two separate octave keys operated by the left thumb to control the two octave vents required on alto or larger saxophones. Around the turn of the century, mechanisms were developed to operate both octave vents with a single key using the left thumb. Ergonomic design of keywork evolved rapidly during the 1920s and 1930s. The front F mechanism supporting alternate fingerings for high E and F, and a stack-linked G key action, became standard during the 1920s, followed by improvements to the left hand table key mechanisms controlling G and the bell keys. New bore designs during the 1920s and 1930s resulted from the quest for improved intonation, dynamic response and tonal qualities. The 1920s were also an era of design experiments like the Buescher straight altos and tenors, the King &quot;Saxello&quot; soprano, the C. G. Conn &quot;mezzo-soprano&quot; saxophone keyed in F, and the &quot;Conn-O-Sax&quot; saxophone–English horn hybrid.

French saxophonist and educator Jean-Marie Londeix greatly expanded the saxophone repertoire and available techniques in the second half of the 20th century, commissioning a great deal of new saxophone works with extended techniques, including those by Denisov, Lauba, Rossé, and Rolin.

===Modern saxophone emerges===
The modern layout of the saxophone emerged during the 1930s and 1940s, first with right-side bell keys introduced by C. G. Conn on baritones, then by King on altos and tenors. The mechanics of the left hand table were revolutionized by Selmer with their Balanced Action instruments in 1936, capitalizing on the right-side bell key layout. In 1948 Selmer introduced their Super Action saxophones with offset left and right hand stack keys. Thirty to forty years later this 1948 Selmer layout was nearly universal.

The high F key was also first introduced as an option on the Balanced Action model, although it took several decades for it to gain acceptance because of perceived deleterious effects on intonation.

Marcel Mule established study of the saxophone as a classical instrument at the Conservatoire de Paris from the 1940s. Larry Teal did the same in the United States at the University of Michigan a decade later. A number of other American institutions have since become recognized homes for the study of classical saxophone. They include Northwestern University, Indiana University, and the Eastman School of Music.

==Usage==
===In military bands===
The saxophone first gained popularity in military bands. Although the instrument was initially ignored in Germany, French and Belgian military bands were quick to include it in their ensembles. Most French and Belgian military bands incorporate at least a quartet of saxophones, comprising an E baritone, B tenor, E alto and B soprano. These four instruments have proven the most popular of all Sax&#x27;s creations with the E contrabass and B bass usually considered impractically large and E sopranino insufficiently powerful. British military bands tend to include at minimum two saxophonists on alto and tenor.

=== In classical music ===
The saxophone was introduced into the concert band, which usually calls for an E alto saxophone, a B tenor saxophone, and an E baritone saxophone. A concert band may include two altos, one tenor, and one baritone. A B soprano saxophone is also sometimes used, and is played by the first alto saxophonist. A bass saxophone in B is used in some concert band music (especially music by Percy Grainger).

Saxophones are used in chamber music, such as saxophone quartets and other chamber combinations of instruments. The classical saxophone quartet consists of a B soprano saxophone, E alto saxophone, B tenor saxophone, and E baritone saxophone (SATB). On occasion, the soprano is replaced with a second alto sax (AATB); a few professional saxophone quartets have featured non-standard instrumentation, such as James Fei&#x27;s Alto Quartet (four altos).

There is a repertoire of classical compositions and arrangements for the SATB instrumentation dating back to the nineteenth century, particularly by French composers who knew Sax. However, the largest body of chamber works for saxophone are from the modern era of classical saxophone initiated by Marcel Mule in 1928. Sigurd Raschèr followed as a soloist in orchestral works, starting in 1931, and also figured prominently in development of modern classical saxophone repertoire. The Mule quartet is often considered the prototype for quartets due to the level of virtuosity demonstrated by its members and its central role in the development of modern quartet repertoire. However, organized quartets existed before Mule&#x27;s ensemble, the prime example being the quartet headed by Edward A. Lefebre (1834–1911), which was a subset of Patrick Gilmore&#x27;s 22nd Regiment band between 1873 and 1893.

In the 20th and 21st centuries, the saxophone found increased popularity in symphony orchestras. The instrument has also been used in opera and choral music. Musical theatre scores also can include parts for saxophone, sometimes doubling another woodwind or brass instrument.

===In jazz and popular music===
Coincident with the more widespread availability of saxophones in the US around the turn of the century was the rise of ragtime music. The bands featuring the syncopated African-American rhythmic influences of ragtime were an exciting new feature of the American cultural landscape and provided the groundwork for new styles of dancing. Two of the best known ragtime-playing brass bands with saxophones were those led by W. C. Handy and James R. Europe. Europe&#x27;s 369th Infantry Regiment Band popularized ragtime in France during its 1918 tour. The rise of dance bands into the 1920s followed from the popularity of ragtime. The saxophone was also used in Vaudeville entertainment during the same period. Ragtime, Vaudeville, and dance bands introduced much of the American public to the saxophone. Rudy Wiedoeft became the best known individual saxophone stylist and virtuoso during this period leading into the &quot;saxophone craze&quot; of the 1920s. Following it, the saxophone became featured in music as diverse as the &quot;sweet&quot; music of Paul Whiteman and Guy Lombardo, jazz, swing, and large stage show bands.

The rise of the saxophone as a jazz instrument followed its widespread adoption in dance bands during the early 1920s. The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, formed in 1923, featured arrangements to back up improvisation, bringing the first elements of jazz to the large dance band format. Following the innovations of the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra and Jean Goldkette&#x27;s Victor Recording Orchestra featured jazz solos with saxophones and other instruments. The association of dance bands with jazz would reach its peak with the swing music of the 1930s. The large show band format, influenced by the 1930s swing bands, would be used as backing for popular vocalists and stage shows in the post World War II era, and provided a foundation for big band jazz. Show bands with saxophone sections became a staple of television talk shows (such as the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; that featured bands led by Doc Severinsen and Branford Marsalis) and Las Vegas stage shows. The swing era fostered the later saxophone styles that permeated bebop and rhythm and blues in the early postwar era.

Coleman Hawkins established the tenor saxophone as a jazz solo instrument during his stint with Fletcher Henderson from 1923 to 1934. Hawkins&#x27; arpeggiated, rich-toned, vibrato-laden style was the main influence on swing era tenor players before Lester Young, and his influence continued with other big-toned tenor players into the era of modern jazz. Among the tenor players directly influenced by him were Chu Berry, Charlie Barnet, Tex Beneke, Ben Webster, Vido Musso, Herschel Evans, Buddy Tate, and Don Byas. Hawkins&#x27; bandmate Benny Carter and Duke Ellington&#x27;s alto saxophonist Johnny Hodges became influential on swing era alto styles, while Harry Carney brought the baritone saxophone to prominence with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. The New Orleans player Sidney Bechet gained recognition for playing the soprano saxophone during the 1920s, but the instrument did not come into wide use until the modern era of jazz.

As Chicago style jazz evolved from New Orleans jazz in the 1920s, one of its defining features was the addition of saxophones to the ensemble. The small Chicago ensembles offered more improvisational freedom than did the New Orleans or large band formats, fostering the innovations of saxophonists Jimmy Dorsey (alto), Frankie Trumbauer (c-melody), Bud Freeman (tenor) and Stump Evans (baritone). Dorsey and Trumbauer became important influences on tenor saxophonist Lester Young.

Lester Young&#x27;s approach on tenor saxophone differed from Hawkins&#x27;, emphasizing more melodic &quot;linear&quot; playing that wove in and out of the chordal structure and longer phrases that differed from those suggested by the tune. He used vibrato less, fitting it to the passage he was playing. His tone was smoother and darker than that of his 1930s contemporaries. Young&#x27;s playing was a major influence on the modern jazz saxophonists Al Cohn, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, Lee Konitz, Warne Marsh, Charlie Parker, and Art Pepper.

The influence of Lester Young with the Count Basie Orchestra in the late 1930s and the popularity of Hawkins&#x27; 1939 recording of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; marked the saxophone as an influence on jazz equal to the trumpet, which had been the defining instrument of jazz since its beginnings in New Orleans. But the greatest influence of the saxophone on jazz was to occur a few years later when alto saxophonist Charlie Parker became an icon of the bebop revolution that influenced generations of jazz musicians. The small-group format of bebop and post-bebop jazz ensembles gained ascendancy in the 1940s as musicians used the harmonic and melodic freedom pioneered by Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell in extended jazz solos.

During the 1950s, prominent alto players included Sonny Stitt, Cannonball Adderley, Jackie McLean, Lou Donaldson, Sonny Criss and Paul Desmond, while prominent tenor players included Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Lucky Thompson, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, and Paul Gonsalves. Serge Chaloff, Gerry Mulligan, Pepper Adams and Leo Parker brought the baritone saxophone to prominence as a solo instrument. Steve Lacy renewed attention to the soprano saxophone in the context of modern jazz and John Coltrane boosted the instrument&#x27;s popularity during the 1960s. Smooth jazz musician Kenny G also uses the soprano sax as his principal instrument.

Saxophonists such as John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Sam Rivers, and Pharoah Sanders defined the forefront of creative exploration with the avant-garde movement of the 1960s. The new realms offered with Modal, harmolodic, and free jazz were explored with every device that saxophonists could conceive of. Sheets of sound, tonal exploration, upper harmonics, and multiphonics were hallmarks of the creative possibilities that saxophones offered. One lasting influence of the avant-garde movement is the exploration of non-Western ethnic sounds on the saxophone, for example, the African-influenced sounds used by Sanders and the Indian-influenced sounds used by Coltrane. The devices of the avant-garde movement have continued to be influential in music that challenges the boundaries between avant-garde and other categories of jazz, such as that of alto saxophonists Steve Coleman and Greg Osby.

Some ensembles such as the World Saxophone Quartet use the soprano-alto-tenor-baritone (SATB) format of the classical saxophone quartet for jazz. In the 1990s, World Saxophone Quartet founder Hamiet Bluiett formed the quartet Baritone Nation (four baritones).

The &quot;jump swing&quot; bands of the 1940s gave rise to rhythm and blues, featuring horn sections and exuberant, strong-toned, heavily rhythmic styles of saxophone playing with a melodic sense based on blues tonalities. Illinois Jacquet, Sam Butera, Arnett Cobb, and Jimmy Forrest were major influences on R&amp;B tenor styles and Louis Jordan, Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson, Earl Bostic, and Bull Moose Jackson were major influences on alto. The R&amp;B saxophone players influenced later genres including rock and roll, ska, soul, and funk. Horn section work continued with Johnny Otis and Ray Charles featuring horn sections and the Memphis Horns, the Phenix Horns, and Tower of Power achieving distinction for their section playing. Horn sections were added to the Chicago and West Coast blues bands of Lowell Fulson, T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, and Guitar Slim. Rock and soul fusion bands such as Chicago, The Electric Flag, and Blood, Sweat, and Tears featured horn sections. Bobby Keys and Clarence Clemons became influential rock and roll saxophone stylists. Junior Walker, King Curtis and Maceo Parker became influential soul and funk saxophone stylists, influencing the more technical jazz-fusion sounds of Michael Brecker and Bob Mintzer and pop-jazz players such as Candy Dulfer.

==Unusual variants==

A number of experimental saxophones and saxophone-related instruments have appeared since Sax&#x27;s original work, most with no lasting impact. During the early 1920s Reiffel &amp; Husted of Chicago produced a . During the 1920s some straight alto and tenor saxophones were produced by Buescher, which proved cumbersome to handle and more difficult to transport. Buescher custom produced one straight baritone saxophone as novelty instrument for a vaudeville performer. C.G. Conn introduced two new variants in 1928–1929, the and the mezzo-soprano saxophone, both keyed in F, one step above the E♭ alto. The Conn-O-Sax is built straight, with a slightly curved neck, a spherical liebesfuss-style bell, and extra keys for low A and up to high G. It was produced only in 1929 and 1930, and intended to imitate the form and timbre of the cor anglais. With fewer than 100 surviving instruments, the Conn-O-Sax is highly sought after by collectors. The Conn mezzo-soprano experienced a similarly short production run, as the economics of the Great Depression curtailed the market for what were regarded as novelty instruments. Most were subsequently expended by Conn to train its repair technicians.

The most successful of the unusual 1920s designs was the King , essentially a straight B soprano, but with a slightly curved neck and tipped bell, made by the H. N. White Company. Such instruments now command prices up to US$4,000. Its lasting influence is shown in the number of companies, including Keilwerth, Rampone &amp; Cazzani (&quot;altello&quot; model), L.A. Sax and Sax Dakota USA, marketing straight-bore, tipped-bell soprano saxophones as saxellos (or &quot;saxello sopranos&quot;).

Interest in two 1920s variants was revived by jazz musician Rahsaan Roland Kirk, who called his straight Buescher alto a and his Saxello a . The Buescher straight alto was a production instrument while the manzello was in fact a Saxello with a custom-made large bell and modified keywork. More recently, the mezzo-soprano, or a modern variant of it, came into use by jazz musicians Anthony Braxton, James Carter, Vinny Golia, and Joe Lovano.

Some of the 1920s experimental designs, in addition to the Saxello, provide the basis for similar instruments produced during the modern era. Straight altos and tenors have been revived by Keilwerth, L.A. Sax and Sax Dakota USA. A mezzo-soprano in the key of G has been produced by Danish woodwind technician Peter Jessen, most notably played by Joe Lovano. This instrument is more in the timbral quality of Bb soprano saxophone.

The , similar in size to the orchestral C-melody, was developed in the late 20th century by California instrument maker Jim Schmidt. This instrument has a larger bore and a new fingering system, and does not resemble the orchestral instrument except for its key and register.
 
Benedikt Eppelsheim, of Munich, Germany has introduced recent innovations at the upper and lower ends of the saxophone range. The soprillo sax is a piccolo-sized saxophone pitched an octave higher than the B soprano sax. It is so small that the octave key is built into the mouthpiece. The tubax, developed in 1999 by Eppelsheim, plays the same range and with the same fingering as the E contrabass saxophone. Its bore, however, is narrower than that of a contrabass, resulting in a more compact instrument with a &quot;reedier&quot; tone (akin to the double-reed contrabass sarrusophone). It can be played with the smaller (and more commonly available) baritone saxophone mouthpiece and reeds. Eppelsheim has also produced subcontrabass tubaxes in C and B, the latter being the lowest saxophone ever made.

Among the 2000s developments is the aulochrome, a double soprano saxophone invented by Belgian instrument maker François Louis in 2001.

Since the 1950s, saxophones with non-metallic bodies have occasionally been in production. Such instruments have failed to gain acceptance over a number of issues including durability, repairability, and deficiencies in key action and tone. The best known of these efforts is the 1950s Grafton acrylic alto saxophone used briefly by Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman. It had a production run of over 10 years as a budget model saxophone. The polycarbonate Vibratosax is in production as a low cost alternative to metal saxophones. Wooden Sawat saxophones are made in Thailand on a small scale. Opinions vary on the significance of body materials to sound.

The fingering scheme of the saxophone, which has had only minor changes since the instrument&#x27;s original invention, has presented inherent acoustic problems related to closed keys below the first open tonehole that affect response of, and slightly muffle, some notes. There is also a lack of tactile consistency between key centers, requiring extra effort from the player to adjust modes of muscle memory when moving between key centers. There have been two noteworthy efforts to remedy the acoustic problems and awkward aspects of the original fingering system:

The Leblanc Rationale and System saxophones have key mechanics designed to remedy the acoustic problems associated with closed keys below the first open tonehole. They also enable players to make half-step shifts of scales by depressing one key while keeping the rest of the fingering consistent with that of the fingering a half step away. Some Leblanc System features were built into the Vito Model 35 saxophones of the 1950s and 1960s. Despite the advantages of that system, acceptance was impaired by the expense and mechanical reliability issues related to the complexity of certain key mechanisms.

The chromatic, or linear fingering, saxophone is a project of instrument designer and builder Jim Schmidt, developing a horn maximizing tactile and logical consistency between every interval regardless of the key, and avoiding the acoustic problems associated with closed keys below the first open tone hole. Several working prototypes have been built and presented at trade shows. Production of this original and expensive saxophone is on an individual order basis.

==Related instruments==

Inexpensive keyless folk versions of the saxophone made of bamboo (recalling a chalumeau) were developed in the 20th century by instrument makers in Hawaii, Jamaica, Thailand, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Argentina. The Hawaiian instrument, called a xaphoon, was invented during the 1970s and is also marketed as a &quot;bamboo sax&quot;, although its cylindrical bore more closely resembles that of a clarinet, and its lack of any keywork makes it more akin to a recorder. Jamaica&#x27;s best known exponent of a similar type of homemade bamboo &quot;saxophone&quot; was the mento musician and instrument maker &#x27;Sugar Belly&#x27; (William Walker). In the Minahasa region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there exist entire bands made up of bamboo &quot;saxophones&quot; and &quot;brass&quot; instruments of various sizes. These instruments are imitations of European instruments, made using local materials. Similar instruments are produced in Thailand.

In Argentina, Ángel Sampedro del Río and Mariana García have produced bamboo saxophones of various sizes since 1985. Many synthesizer wind controllers are played and fingered like a saxophone, such as the Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI). A double reed instrument known as the rothphone and a brass instrument known as the jazzophone are both shaped similarly to an alto or tenor saxophone.

<text>A sackbut is an early form of the trombone used during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. A sackbut has the characteristic telescopic slide of a trombone, used to vary the length of the tube to change pitch, but is distinct from later trombones by its smaller, more cylindrically-proportioned bore, and its less-flared bell. Unlike the earlier slide trumpet from which it evolved, the sackbut possesses a U-shaped slide with two parallel sliding tubes, rather than just one.

Records of the term &quot;trombone&quot; predate the term &quot;sackbut&quot; by two decades, and evidence for the German term &quot;Posaune&quot; is even older. &quot;Sackbut&quot;, originally a French term, was used in England until the instrument fell into disuse in the eighteenth century; when it returned, the Italian term &quot;trombone&quot; became dominant. In modern English, an older trombone or a replica is called a &quot;sackbut&quot;.

The bell section was more resonant, since it did not contain the tuning slide and was loosely stayed rather than firmly braced to itself. This trait and its smaller bore and bell produce a &quot;covered, blended sound which was a timbre particularly effective for working with voices... zincks and crumhorns&quot;, as in an alta cappella.

The revived instrument had changed in specific ways. In the mid-18th century, the bell flare increased, crooks fell out of use, and flat, removable stays were replaced by tubular braces. The new shape produced a stronger sound, suitable for open-air performance in the marching bands where trombones became popular again in the 19th century. Before the early 19th century, most trombone players adjusted their tuning using a crook placed at the joint between the bell and the slide or seldom between the mouthpiece and the slide.&quot;, rather than the modern tuning slide on the bell curve, whose cylindrical sections prevent the instrument from flaring smoothly through this section. Older trombones also generally don&#x27;t have water keys, stockings, a leadpipe, or a slide lock, but as these parts are not critical to sound, replicas may include them. Bore size remained variable, as it still is today.

== Terminological history ==
The first reference to a slide instrument was probably &quot;trompette des ménestrels&quot;, first found in Burgundy in the 1420s and later in other regions of Europe. The name distinguished the instrument from the &quot;trompettes de guerre&quot; (war trumpets), which were of fixed length.

The next word to appear in the 15th century that implied a slide was the &quot;sackbutt&quot; group of words. There are two theories for the sources: it is either derived from the Middle French &quot;sacquer&quot; (to pull) and &quot;bouter&quot; (to push) or from the Spanish &quot;sacar&quot; (to draw or pull) and &quot;bucha&quot; (a tube or pipe). The term survives in numerous English spelling variations including sacbutt, sackbutte, sagbut, shagbolt, sacabushe, shakbusse and shakbusshe.

Closely related to &quot;sackbutt&quot; was the name used in France: &quot;sacqueboute&quot; and in Spain, where it was &quot;sacabuche&quot;. These terms were used in England and France until the 18th century.

In Scotland in 1538 the slide instrument is referred to as &quot;draucht trumpet&quot; (drawn trumpet) as opposed to a &quot;weir trumpet&quot; (war trumpet), which had a fixed length.

In Germany, the original word was &quot;Posaune&quot;, appearing about 1450 and is still used today. This (as well as &quot;bason&quot;) derives from &quot;busine,&quot; which is Latinate and meant straight trumpet.

In Italy it was (and remains) &quot;trombone&quot;, which derived from trumpet in the Latin &quot;tromba&quot; or &quot;drompten&quot;, used in the Low Countries. The first records of it being used are around 1440, but it is not clear whether this was just a nickname for a trumpet player. In 1487 a writer links the words &quot;trompone&quot; and &quot;sacqueboute&quot; and mentions the instrument as playing the contratenor part in a danceband.

== History ==
:&quot;See: Clarion&quot;

The trombone developed from the buisine trumpet. Up until 1375 trumpets were simply a long straight tube with a bell flare.

There are various uses of &quot;sackbut&quot;-like words in the Bible, which has led to a faulty translation from the Latin bible that suggested the trombones date back as far as 600 BC, but there is no evidence of slides at this time.

From 1375 the iconography sees trumpets being made with bends, and some in &#x27;S&#x27; shapes. Around 1400 we see the &quot;loop&quot;-shaped trumpet appear in paintings and at some point in the 15th century, a single-tube slide was added. This slide trumpet was known as a &quot;trompette des ménestrels&quot; in the alta cappella bands.

The earliest clear evidence of a U-shaped slide moving on two inner tubes is in a fresco painting by Filippino Lippi in Rome, &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, dating from 1488 to 1493.

From the 15th to the 19th centuries, the instrument designs changed very little overall, apart from a slight widening of the bell in classical era. Since the 19th century, trombone bore sizes and bells have increased significantly.

It was one of the most important instruments in Baroque polychoral works, along with the cornett and organ.

== Instrument sizes ==
Sackbuts come in several sizes. According to Michael Praetorius, these were:

The pitch of the trombones has (notionally) moved up a semi-tone since the 17th century, and this is explained in the section on pitch.

Because the tenor instrument is described as &quot;Gemeine&quot; (common or ordinary), this is probably the most widely used trombone. The basses, due to their longer slides, have a hinged handle on the slide stay, which is used to reach the long positions.
A giant contrabass sackbut known as the () was known in 16th and early 17th centuries, and is represented by only a few existing instruments. One surviving original instrument in B♭, an octave below the tenor, built in 1639 by Georg Nicolaus Öller in Stockholm, is housed in the Scenkonstmuseet. In addition, Ewald Meinl has made a modern copy of this instrument, and it is currently owned and played by Wim Becu.

== Construction ==
The bore size of renaissance/baroque trombones is approximately and the bell rarely more than in diameter. This compares with modern tenor trombones, which commonly have bores to and bells to .

Modern reproductions of sackbuts sacrifice some authenticity to harness manufacturing techniques and inventions that make them more comfortable for modern players, while retaining much of the original character of the old instruments.

Some original instruments could be disassembled into the constituent straight tubes, bowed tubes, bell flare, and stays, with ferrules at the joints. Mersenne has a diagram. (Little imagination is needed to see how it could be reassembled—with an extra tube—into something approaching a natural trumpet.) There is a debate as to whether they used tight fittings, wax or another joining substance. Modern sackbut reproductions are usually soldered together. Some modern sackbut reproductions use glue as a compromise to give a loose fitting for high resonance without risk of falling apart.

Tuning slides came in during the very late 18th century. Early trombonists adjusted pitch with the slide, and by adding variously shaped and sized crooks. Modern reproductions often have a bell bow tuning slide or telescopic slide between the slide and bell sections. Crooks are still used, as are variously sized bell bow sections for larger changes.

The stays on period sackbuts are flat. While the bell stay remained flat, from about 1660 the slide stays became tubular. On many modern reproductions round slide stays are much more comfortable to play and easier to make.

A loose connection between the bell stay and the bell is thought key to a resonant bell, and thus a better sackbut sound. Original instruments have a hinge joint (a looser connection helped imperfect slides slide). Modern copies with a tuning slide in the bell can need more support for operation of the slide, so either an extra stay by the tuning slide is provided or a joint without play in only one axis is employed.

The original way to make the slide tubes was to roll a flat piece of metal around a solid cylinder mandrel, and the joining edges soldered together. Modern manufacturers now draw the tubes. They also tend to have stockings, which were only invented around 1850. In addition, modern made slides are usually made of nickel silver with chrome plating, giving a smoother finish and quieter action than simply the brass that would have originally been used.

The water key was added in the 19th century, but modern reproductions often have them.

== Pitch ==

Until some time in the 18th century, the trombone was in A and the pitch of that A was about a half-step higher than it is today—460–480 Hz. There was a transition around the 18th century when trombones started to be thought of in B at around 440 Hz. This change did not require a change in the instrument, merely a new set of slide positions for each note. But it does mean that the baroque and renaissance repertoire was intended to be played at the higher pitch. There are many examples of evidence for this:

* Fellow church instruments that are fixed pitch—cornetts and organs—were pitched at approximately A=460–480 Hz (&quot;Chorton&quot;) across Europe in the Renaissance and baroque eras. High pitch is also seen in Renaissance wind bands.

* Aurelio Virgiliano&#x27;s &quot;Il dolcimelo&quot; (c. 1600) teaches trombonists that first position gives A, E, A, C, E and G.
* In 1687, Daniel Speer&#x27;s &quot;Grund-richtiger&quot; concurs with these notes for the slide all the way in (while describing pushing the slide out a bit to get the C).
* Praetorius describes an alto in D, tenor in A, and bass in D.

The tenor trombones that survive are pitched closest to B at A=440 Hz, which is the same as A at A=466 Hz. So what we now think of as a tenor trombone with B in first position, pitched at A=440 was actually thought of as a trombone in A (in first position), pitched at A=466. Surviving basses in D at A=466 (E at 440)—for example: Ehe, 1612 (Leipzig) and Hainlein, c.1630 (Nuremberg) confirm Praetorius&#x27; description. It is also worth noting that Rognoni&#x27;s &quot;Suzanne ung jour&quot; setting descends repeatedly to BB, which is a tone lower than the lowest note playable on a bass in F; on a bass in D, it falls in (modern) fifth position.

Many groups now perform at A=466 Hz for the sake of greater historical accuracy.

== Timbre ==

The sackbut was described as suitable for playing with the &#x27;loud&#x27; ensembles in the outdoors, as well as the &#x27;soft&#x27; ensembles inside.

The alta capella bands are seen in drawings as entertaining outside with ensembles including shawms, trumpets and trombones. When pushed, sackbuts can easily make a loud and brassy sound.

The sackbut also responds very well to rather soft playing—more so than a modern trombone. The sound is characterized by a more delicate, vocal timbre. The flat rims and shallow cups of the older mouthpieces are instrumental in providing the player with a much wider palette of articulations and tonal colours. This flexibility lends itself to a vocal style of playing and facilitates very characterful phrasing.

Mersenne wrote in 1636, &quot;It should be blown by a skillful musician so that it may not imitate the sounds of the trumpet, but rather assimilate itself to the sweetness of the human voice, lest it should emit a warlike rather than a peaceful sound.&quot;

Lorenzo da Lucca was said to have had &quot;in his playing a certain grace and lightness with a manner so pleasing&quot;.

== Performance practice ==

In musical traditions that continued into the baroque from earlier practice, musicians were expected to give expression to the written music by ornamenting with a mixture of one-note &quot;graces&quot; and whole passage &quot;divisions&quot; (also known as &quot;diminutions&quot;). The suggestions for producing effective ornaments without disrupting the line and harmony are discussed alongside countless examples in the 16th and early 17th century Italian division tutors. Graces such as the accento, portar della voce, tremolo, groppo, trillo, esclamationo and intonatio are all to be considered by performers of any music in this period.

&quot;Cornetts and trombones...play divisions that are neither scrappy, nor so wild and involved that they spoil the underlying melody and the composer&#x27;s design: but are introduced at such moments and with such vivacity and charm that they give the music the greatest beauty and spirit&quot;
Bottrigari, Venice 1594

Along with the improvisation, many of these tutors discuss articulation. Francesco Rognoni in 1620 describes the tonguing as the most important part of producing &quot;a good and beautiful effect in playing wind instruments, and principally the cornett&quot; (which of course had a very similar role to the trombone). The treatises discuss the various strengths of consonants from &quot;le&quot; through &quot;de&quot; to &quot;te&quot;. But the focus of the text is for playing rapid notes &quot;similar to the gorgia of the human voice&quot; with &quot;soft and smooth&quot; double tonguing (&quot;lingua riversa&quot;) using &quot;le re le re&quot;. This is opposed to using &quot;te che te che&quot;, which is described as &quot;harsh, barbarous and displeasing&quot;. The natural &#x27;pairing&#x27; of notes these articulations provide is similar to the instructions for string players who are instructed to slur (&quot;lireggiar&quot;) pairs of eighth notes with one bow stroke per quarter beat.

Another integral part of the early music sound-world is the musical temperament. Music in the middle-ages favours intervals of the fourth and fifth, which is why Pythagorean tuning was used. The interval of a third was used as a clash until the Renaissance, when it became consonant in compositions, which went hand-in-hand with the widespread use of meantone temperament. During the 17th century, Well temperament began to become more and more popular as the range of keys increased. Temperament affects the colour of a composition, and therefore modern performances, typically employing equal temperament, may not be true representations of the composers&#x27; intentions.
These old tunings are the result of the natural harmonic series of a brass instrument such as the sackbut. 
As the bell is smaller than a modern trombone, the harmonic series is closer to a perfect harmonic series, which is the basis for just tuning. Without adjusting the slide, the first to second harmonic is a perfect octave, second to third harmonic is a fifth slightly wider than equal temperament and fourth to fifth harmonic is a major third slightly narrower than in equal temperament. These adjusted intervals make chords ring and are the basis of meantone. In fact, Daniel Speer says &quot;Once you have found a good C (third position), this is also the place you will find your F.” Playing a sounding C and F in exactly the same position on a modern orchestra sounds out of tune, but it tunes perfectly well on in a sackbut choir if everyone plays natural harmonics.

Plenty of musical understanding can be gathered from reading the original music print. Publishers such as SPES and Arnaldo Forni Edition provide facsimile copies of plenty of music for trombone from this era. To read these it one needs to become familiar with the old clefs, time signatures, ligatures and notational conventions of the era.

==Symbolism==

The sound of sackbuts (and trombones) has long been thought especially solemn and noble, had an association with death and the afterlife. The instrument was a symbol of divine presence, the voice of the angels and instrument of judgment. This symbolism can be seen, for instance, in &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, &quot;Alceste&quot;, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, the &quot;Death March&quot; from &quot;Saul&quot;, and funeral aequales.

This association was probably encouraged by the lack of distinction made between natural horns, slide trumpets, and trombones in this Renaissance; they were used and often named interchangeably. Martin Luther&#x27;s 1534 translation of the Bible into German renders the Greek &quot;shophar&quot; and &quot;salpigx&quot; to &quot;Posaune&quot;. &quot;Posaune&quot; at the time could refer to a natural horn or other brass instrument, but it later came to mean exclusively &quot;trombone&quot; (similarly, English translations generally have &quot;trumpet&quot;, and only occasionally &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;shofar&quot;). This gives the later reader of the Luther Bible texts such as: “…we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trombone; for the trombone shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:52).

== Repertoire ==

===Before 1600===
The sackbut replaced the slide trumpet in the 15th century alta capella wind bands that were common in towns throughout Europe playing courtly dance music. See Waits.

Another key use of the trombone was in ceremonies, in conjunction with the trumpet. In many towns in Germany and Northern Italy, &#x27;piffari&#x27; bands were employed by local governments throughout the 16th century to give regular concerts in public squares and would lead processions for festivals. Piffari usually contained a mix of wind, brass and percussion instruments and sometimes viols.

Venice&#x27;s doge had his own piffari company and they gave an hour-long concert in the Piazza each day, as well as sometimes performing for services in St. Mark&#x27;s. Each of the six confraternities in Venice also had their own independent piffari groups too, which would all play at a lavish procession on the feast of Corpus Domini. These groups are in addition to the musicians employed by St. Mark&#x27;s to play in the balconies with the choir (the piffari would play on the main level).

It also was used in church music both for instrumental service music and as a doubling instrument for choral music. The treble and high alto parts were most often played by cornetts or shawms, with the violin sometimes replacing the cornett in 17th century Italian music.

The first record of trombones being used in churches was in Innsbruck 1503. Seville Cathedral&#x27;s records show employment of trombonists in 1526, followed by several other Spanish cathedrals during the 16th century, used not only for ceremonial music and processionals, but also for accompaniment of the liturgical texts as well, doubling voices.

The sacred use of trombones was brought to a fine art by the Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni Gabrieli and their contemporaries c.1570-1620 Venice and there is also evidence of trombonists being employed in churches and cathedrals in Italy at times during the second half of the 16th century in Bologna, Rome, Padua, Mantua and Modena.

Since ensembles had flexible instrumentation at this time, there is relatively little music before Giovanni Gabrieli&#x27;s publication &quot;Symphoniae sacrae&quot; (1597) that specifically mentions trombones. The only example currently known is the music by Francesco Corteccia for the Medici wedding 1539.

===1600–1700===

====Solo====
The 17th century brings two pieces of real solo trombone repertoire.

Giovanni Martino Cesare wrote &quot;La Hieronyma,&quot; (Musikverlag Max Hieber, MH6012) the earliest known piece for accompanied solo trombone. It comes from Cesare&#x27;s collection &quot;Musicali Melodie per voci et instrumenti a una, due, tre, quattro, cinque, e sei&quot; published in Munich 1621 of 28 pieces for a mixture of violins, cornetts, trombone, vocal soloists and organ continuo. The collection also contains &quot;La Bavara&quot; for four trombones.

The other solo trombone piece of the 17th century, &quot;Sonata trombone &amp; basso&quot; (modern edition by H Weiner, Ensemble Publications), was written around 1665. This anonymous piece is also known as the &#x27;St. Thomas Sonata&#x27; because it was kept in the library of the Saint Thomas Augustinian Monastery in Brno, Czech Republic.

Francesco Rognoni was another composer who specified the trombone in a set of divisions (variations) on the well-known song &quot;Suzanne ung jour&quot; (London Pro Musica, REP15). Rognoni was a master violin and gamba player whose treatise &quot;Selva di Varie passaggi secondo l&#x27;uso moderno&quot; (Milan 1620 and facsimile reprint by Arnaldo Forni Editore 2001) details improvisation of diminutions and Suzanne is given as one example. Although most diminutions are written for organ, string instruments or cornett, Suzanne is &quot;per violone over Trombone alla bastarda&quot;. With virtuosic semiquaver passages across the range of the instrument, it reflects Praetorius&#x27; comments about the large range of the tenor and bass trombones, and good players of the Quartposaune (bass trombone in F) could play fast runs and leaps like a viola bastarda or cornetto. The term &quot;bastarda&quot; describes a technique that made variations on all the different voices of a part song, rather than just the melody or the bass: &quot;considered illegitimate because it was not polyphonic&quot;.

====Chamber music====
In the 17th century, a considerable repertoire of chamber music using sackbut with various combinations of violins, cornetts and dulcians, often with continuo, appeared. Composers included Dario Castello, Giovanni Battista Fontana, Giovanni Paolo Cima, Andrea Cima, Johann Heinrich Schmelzer and Matthias Weckmann.

Antonio Bertali wrote several trio sonatas for 2 violins, trombone and bass continuo in the mid-17th century. One such &quot;Sonata a 3&quot; is freely available in facsimile form from the Düben Collection website hosted by Uppsala universitet. A &quot;Sonata a3 in C&quot; is published by Musica Rara and attributed to Biber, although the authorship is unclear and it is more likely to have been written by Bertali.

Dario Castello, a wind player at St. Mark&#x27;s Venice in the early 17th century had two books of &quot;Sonate Concertate&quot; published in 1621 and 1629. The sonatas of 1-4 parts with bass continuo often specify trombones, as well as cornett, violin and bassoon. The numerous reprints during the 17th century affirm his popularity then, as perhaps now.

Giuseppe Scarani joined St. Mark&#x27;s Venice in 1629 as a singer and in the following year published &quot;Sonate concertate&quot;, a volume of works for 2 or 3 (unspecified) instruments (and b.c.). The title has been suggested was chosen to try and capture some of Castello&#x27;s success.

Tiburtio Massaino wrote a Canzona for eight trombones, published in Raverio&#x27;s 1608 collection.

Johann Heinrich Schmelzer wrote several sonatas that included trombones—such as his &quot;Sonata à 7&quot; for two cornetts, two trumpets, three trombones, and basso continuo.

Daniel Speer published a four-part sonata in &quot;Neu-gebachene Taffel-Schnitz&quot; (1685). In 1687, Speer published the first written instruction in sackbut (and several other instruments) playing: &quot;Grund-richtiger/kurtz/leicht und noethiger Unterricht der Musicalischen Kunst&quot;. The second edition in 1697 provides two three part sonatas for trombones.

An English work of note from this period is Matthew Locke&#x27;s &quot;Music for His Majestys Sagbutts and Cornetts&quot;, a suite for Charles II&#x27;s coronation 1661.

====Light music====
Non-serious music, often based on dances for festive occasions, rarely had specified instrumentation. Often you find something like &quot;per diversi musici&quot;. Indeed, the groups that would perform them would often be full of multi-instrumentalists.

Johann Pezel wrote for Stadtpfeifer with his &quot;Hora decima musicorum&quot; (1670), containing sonatas, as well as &quot;Fünff-stimmigte blasende Music&quot; (1685) with five-part intradas and dance pieces.

Well known pieces from Germany includes Samuel Scheidt&#x27;s &quot;Ludi Musici&quot; (1621) and Johann Hermann Schein&#x27;s &quot;Banchetto musicale&quot; (1617).

The first English piece scored for trombone is John Adson&#x27;s &quot;Courtly Masquing Ayres&quot; (1611). Another light collection suitable for including trombones is Anthony Holborne&#x27;s &quot;Pavans, Galliards, Allmains, and other short Aeirs both Grave and Light in Five Parts for Viols, Violins or Other Musicall Winde Instruments&quot; (1599).

====Sacred music====
=====Venice=====
Trombonists were in the regular ensemble at St. Mark&#x27;s Venice from its formation in 1568 until they left the payroll in 1732. The first two ensemble directors—&quot;maestro di concerti&quot;—Girolamo Dalla Casa (1568–1601) and Giovanni Bassano (1601–1617)—were cornett players and the nucleus of the group was two cornetts and two trombones, although for the larger ceremonies many extra players were hired. During a mass attended by the Doge, evidence suggests they would have played a canzona in the Gradual after the Epistle and the Agnus Dei, a sonata in the Offertory as well as reinforcing vocal parts or substituting for absent singers.

This ensemble was used extensively by Giovanni Gabrieli in pieces substantially for brass, voices and organ in Venice up until his death in 1612. He was greatly influential in Venetian composers in other churches and confraternities, and his early baroque and cori spezzati style is seen in contemporaries like Giovanni Picchi and Giovanni Battista Grillo.

It is suggested that Monteverdi wrote his &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; (1610) as a pitch for employment at St. Mark&#x27;s as successor to Giovanni Gabrieli. In addition to the Magnificat, two movements specify trombones: the opening &quot;Deus in adiutorium&quot; is for six voices, two violins, two cornetts, three trombones, five viole da braccio and basso continuo; Sonata sopra &quot;Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis&quot; is for soprano, two violins, two cornetts, three trombones (one of which can be a viola da braccio) and basso continuo. Monteverdi also leaves the option to use trombones as part of the &quot;sex instrumentis&quot; of the &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; and in the instrumental &quot;Ritornello a 5&quot; between verses of &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;.

From around 1617, when the &quot;maestro de&#x27; concerti&quot; at St. Marks changed to violinist Francesco Bonfante and correspondingly the ensemble changed from basically a brass ensemble to being more evenly mixed with brass, wind and string instruments.

Monteverdi arrived at St. Mark&#x27;s in 1613 and it is unsurprising that he includes trombones and strings for several more sacred works during his time here, published in his &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot; 1641. Of the c.40 items in this collection, six specify three or four trombones (or viola da braccio, ad lib): SV268 Beatus vir I, SV263 Dixit Dominus I, SV263 Dixit Dominus II, SV261 Et iterum venturus est, SV258 Gloria in excelsis Deo, SV281 Magnificat I. Each is for 3-8 voices with 3 violins (apart from SV261), the trombones/violas and basso continuo. Monteverdi also specified trombones in two more sacred works: SV198 Laetatus sum (i) (1650) for 6 voices, 2 violins, 2 trombones and bassoon and SV272 Laudate Dominum omnes gentes I (1641) for 5 voices &#x27;concertato&#x27;, 4 voice chorus ad lib, 4 viola da braccio or trombones and basso continuo.

=====Germany/Austria=====
A prolific composer for trombones in Germany in the 17th century was Heinrich Schütz. His &quot;Fili me, Absalon&quot; (SWV 269) and &quot;Attendite, popule meus&quot; (SWV 270), are both scored for bass voice, four trombones (of which two are optionally violins) and basso continuo, are well known. They are part of his first &quot;Symphoniae Sacrae&quot; collection dating from 1629 and commentators have noted that the style reflects his studies in Venice with Giovanni Gabrieli 1609–1612. Other pieces that specify trombones (according to Grove) are (grouped by the collection they were published in): Concert mit 11 Stimmen (1618): SWV 21, in &quot;Psalmen Davids&quot; (Psalms of David) Op. 2 (1619): SWV 38, 40–46, Symphoniae sacrae I Op.6 (1629): SWV 259, 269–271, 274, Symphoniae sacrae II Op.10 (1647): SWV 344, Symphoniae sacrae III Op. 12 (1650): SWV 398a, Historia (1664): SWV 435, 448, 449, 453, 461, 452, 466–470, 473, 474–476, Schwanengesang Psalm 119 (1671): SWV 500, although many others are suitable for trombones too.

Johann Hermann Schein specified trombones in some of his sacred vocal works in the &quot;Opella nova, ander Theil, geistlicher Concerten&quot; collection (Leipzig, 1626). For example, &quot;Uns ist ein Kind geboren&quot; is scored for violino, traversa, alto trombone, tenor voice, fagotto and basso continuo. &quot;Mach dich auf, werde licht, Zion&quot; uses Canto 1: violino, cornetto, flauto picciolo e voce, Canto 2: voce e traversa, Alto: Trombone e Voce, Tenore: Voce e Trombone, Basso: Fagotto Trombone e Voce and Basso Continuo, during which solos for each of the trombonists are specified. Of particular interest is &quot;Maria, gegrüsset seist du, Holdselige,&quot; which uses soprano and tenor voices, alto trombone, 2 tenor trombones and on the bass line &quot;trombone grosso,&quot; which goes down to pedal A, and a couple of diatonic scale passages from bottom C.

German composer Johann Rudolf Ahle wrote some notable sacred pieces for voices and trombones. &quot;Höre, Gott&quot; uses five favoriti singers, two ripieno choirs (which double other parts at intense moments) and seven trombones, with basso continuo. And his most famous &quot;Neu-gepflanzte Thüringische Lust-Garten..&quot; (1657–65) contains several sacred works with 3 or 4 trombones, including &quot;Magnificat a 8&quot; for SATB soloists, cornett, 3 trombones and continuo and &quot;Herr nun lässestu deinen Diener a 5&quot; for bass, 4 trombones and continuo.

Dieterich Buxtehude specifies trombones in a few sacred concertos using style derived from polychoral Venetian works and one secular piece. For example, &quot;Gott fähret auf mit Jauchzen&quot; (BuxWV33 from CW v, 44) is scored for SSB voices, 2 violins, 2 violas, trombones, 2 cornetts, 2 trumpets, bassoon and basso continuo.

There are a few vocal works involving trombones in works by Andreas Hammerschmidt. These include &quot;Lob- und Danck Lied aus dem 84. Psalm&quot; for 9 voices, 5 trumpets, 3 trombones, 5 violas and basso continuo (Freiberg, 1652). There is also &quot;Hochzeitsgesang für Daniel Sartorius: Es ist nicht gut, dass der Mensch allein sei&quot; for 5 voices, 2 violins, 2 trombones, bassoon and basso continuo.

Johann Schelle has numerous sacred vocal works that use trombones. For instance &quot;Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar&quot; is scored for soprano, tenor, SSATB choir, 2 violins, 2 violas, 2 cornetts, 3 trombones, 2 trumpets, timpani, basso continuo, and &quot;Lobe den Herrn, meine Seele&quot; is for two choirs of SSATB and similar instruments to the previous work.

The lesser known Austrian composer Christoph Strauss, Kapellmeister to the Habsburg Emperor Mathias 1616–1620, wrote two important collections for trombones, cornetts and voices. His motets published in Nova ac diversimoda sacrarum cantionum composition, seu motettae (Vienna, 1613) are in a similar tradition to Gabrieli&#x27;s music. Of the sixteen motets in the collection, all are titled &quot;concerto&quot; apart from the &quot;sonata&quot; &quot;Expectans Expectavi Dominum&quot; for 6 trombones, cantus voice and tenor voice. In 1631 he published a number of masses, which were much more baroque, with basso continuo, rhetorical word painting and obligato usage of instruments.

Later in the 17th century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber composed sacred works for voices and orchestra featuring trombones. His &quot;Requiem&quot; mass (1692) uses an orchestra of strings, 3 trombones and basso continuo. A similar ensemble accompanies 8 vocal lines in his &quot;Lux perpetua&quot; (c1673), and three more similar works in the 1690s.

====Theatre====
Monteverdi ushers sackbuts into the first great opera, &#x27;L&#x27;Orfeo&#x27; 1607. The orchestra at the first performance, as shown in the first publication, the list of &quot;stromenti&quot; at the front of the score specifies four trombones, but at one point in Act 3, however, the score calls for five trombones.

===1700–1750===
There is relatively little repertoire for the trombone in the late baroque.

Johann Sebastian Bach uses trombones in fourteen of his church cantatas—BWV 2, 3, 4, 21, 23, 25, 28, 38, 64, 68, 96, 101, 121, 135—as well as motet BWV 118. He uses the trombone sound to reflect the (by now) archaic sounds of the Renaissance trombones doubling voices (with cornett playing the soprano line), yet he also uses them independently, which John Eliot Gardiner says prepares the way for their use in Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. The cantatas were either composed in Leipzig during 1723–1725, or (for BWV 4, 21 &amp; 23) the trombone parts were added to the existing cantata during the same period. The cornett and trombone parts would have been played by the Stadtpfeifer.

In England, George Frideric Handel includes trombones in three of his oratorios: &quot;Saul&quot; (1738), &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot; (1738) and &quot;Samson&quot; (1741). There are no other documented groups or performances with trombone players in England at this time, and it has been suggested that the premiers took place with a visiting group from Germany, as was the custom in Paris at this time.

Vienna&#x27;s Imperial court used trombones in church music:

Johann Joseph Fux was Hofkapellmeister in Vienna from 1715 until 1741. Many of his masses use the choir strengthened by strings, cornetts and trombones, often with independent moments for the instrumentalists and sometimes. &quot;Missa SS Trinitatis&quot; uses two choirs, which again points to the traditions going back to Gabrieli. His highly successful Requiem is for five vocal parts, two cornetts, two trombones, strings and continuo. He also uses the trombone in smaller motets and antiphons, such as his setting of &quot;Alma Redemptoris mater&quot; for soprano, alto trombone, strings and continuo. Some of his chamber music involves trombones, as do many of his operas, used as an obbligato instrument.

Also in the Vienna court was Antonio Caldara, vice-kapellmeister 1717–1736. Among his output are two Holy Week settings as Da Capo arias: &quot;Deh sciogliete, o mesti lumi&quot; for soprano, unison violins, bassoon, two trombones and organ and &quot;Dio, qual sia&quot; for soprano, trombone, bassoon and basso continuo.

===1750–1800===
Again this period suffers from a lack of trombone players. Most of these works derive from Vienna and Salzburg.

Joseph Haydn uses trombones in &quot;Il rotorno di Tobia&quot;, &quot;Die sieben letzten Worte&quot;, &quot;The Creation&quot;, &quot;Die Jahreszeiten&quot;, &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; and secular cantata choruses.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart uses trombones in connection with death or the supernatural. This includes the Requiem (K626, 1791), Great Mass in C minor (K423, 1783), &quot;Coronation Mass (C major)&quot; (K317, 1779), several other masses, &quot;Vesperae Solennes de Confessore&quot; (K339, 1780), &quot;Vesperae de Dominica&quot;, his arrangement of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; plus two of his three great operas: &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (K527, 1787) and &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (K620, 1791). Mozart&#x27;s first use of the trombone was an obligato line in the oratorio &quot;Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots&quot; (K35, 1767)

Christoph Willibald Gluck includes trombones in five of his operas: &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot; (1774), Orfeo ed Euridice (1774), &quot;Alceste&quot; (1776), &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; (1779) and &quot;Echo et Narcisse&quot; (1779), as well as ballet &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1761).

Some chamber music in this period includes trombone in an obligato role with voice, and also as a concerto instrument with string orchestra. Composers include the likes of Leopold Mozart, Georg Christoph Wagenseil, Johann Albrechtsberger, Michael Haydn and Johann Ernst Eberlin.

== Recordings ==

Plenty of recordings of the authentic sackbut are now available from the groups such as Concerto Palatino, HMSC, Gabrieli Consort and the Toulouse Sacqueboutiers. For a closer examination of the instrument, here are some recommended recordings where the sackbut is heavily featured in a &quot;solo&quot; capacity.

<text>The saxhorn is a family of valved brass instruments that have conical bores and deep cup-shaped mouthpieces. The saxhorn family was developed by Adolphe Sax, who is also known for creating the saxophone family. The sound of the saxhorn has a characteristic mellow tone quality and blends well with other brass.

== The saxhorn family ==

The saxhorns form a family of seven brass instruments (although at one point ten different sizes seem to have existed). Designed for band use, they are pitched alternately in E and B, like the saxophone group.

Modern saxhorns still manufactured and in use:
*B soprano saxhorn: flugelhorn
*E alto/tenor saxhorn: alto/tenor horn
*B baritone saxhorn: baritone horn 
*The B bass, E bass, and B contrabass saxhorns are basically the same as the modern euphonium, E bass tuba, and BB contrabass tuba, respectively.

Historically, much confusion exists as to the nomenclature of the various instruments in different languages.

The following table lists the members of the saxhorn family as described in the orchestration texts of Hector Berlioz and Cecil Forsyth, the J. Howard Foote catalog of 1893, and modern names. The modern instrument names continue to exhibit inconsistency, denoted by a &quot;/&quot; between the two names in use. In the table &quot;Pitch&quot; means the concert pitch of notational Middle C on each instrument (2nd partial, no valves depressed) in scientific pitch notation.

This list is not exhaustive of historic nomenclature for the saxhorns, for which there may exist no comprehensive and authoritative source.

=== Ranges of individual members ===
The saxhorn is based on the same three-valve system as most other valved brass instruments. Each member of the family is named after the root note produced by the second partial with no valves actuated. Each member nominally possesses or possessed the typical three-valve brass range from the note one tritone below that root note (second partial, all valves actuated) to the note produced by eighth partial with no valves actuated, i.e., the note two octaves above the root note.

All the modern members of the family are transposing instruments written in the treble clef with the root note produced by the second partial with no valves actuated being written as middle C, though the baritone horn often plays bass clef parts, especially in concert band music and when playing parts written for the trombone.

== History ==
Developed during the mid-to-late 1830s, the saxhorn family was patented in Paris in 1845 by Adolphe Sax. During the 19th century, the debate as to whether the saxhorn family was truly new, or rather a development of previously existing instruments, was the subject of prolonged lawsuits.

Throughout the mid-1850s, Sax continued to experiment with the instrument&#x27;s valve pattern.

The Trojan March (&quot;Marche Troyenne&quot;) of the Berlioz opera &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (185658) features an on-stage band which includes a family of saxhorns. The Royal Hunt and Storm (&quot;Chasse Royale&quot;) from the same opera uses them orchestrally. Sir John Eliot Gardiner wanted to use them in his 2003 recording, but was unable to borrow them from major conservatoires; he was eventually put in touch with a private collector who loaned him a set.

Saxhorns were popularized by the distinguished Distin Quintet, who toured Europe during the mid-19th century. This family of musicians, publishers and instrument manufacturers had a significant impact on the growth of the brass band movement in Britain during the mid- to late-19th century.

The saxhorn was the most common brass instrument in American Civil War bands. The over-the-shoulder variety of the instrument was used, as the backward-pointing bell of the instrument allowed troops marching behind the band to hear the music.

Contemporary works featuring this instrument are Désiré Dondeyne&#x27;s &quot;Tubissimo&quot; for bass tuba or saxhorn and piano (1983), Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum&quot; (1964), and Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;March of the Soviet Militia&quot; (1970).

<text>is a video game developer owned by the Japanese video game company Sega as part of its Sega CS Research and Development No. 2 division. Sonic Team is best known for its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and games such as &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; and &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;.

The initial team, formed in 1990, comprised staff from Sega&#x27;s Consumer Development division, including programmer Yuji Naka, artist Naoto Ohshima, and level designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. The team took the name Sonic Team in 1991 with the release of their first game, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog,&quot; for the Sega Genesis. It was a major success and contributed to millions of Genesis sales. The next &quot;Sonic&quot; games were developed by Naka and Yasuhara in America at Sega Technical Institute, while Ohshima worked on &quot;Sonic CD&quot; in Japan. Naka returned to Japan in late 1994 to become the head of CS3, later renamed R&amp;D No. 8. During this time, the division took on the Sonic Team brand but developed games that do not feature Sonic, such as &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996) and &quot;Burning Rangers&quot; (1998).

Following the release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; in 1998, some Sonic Team staff moved to the United States to form Sonic Team USA and develop &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; (2001). With Sega&#x27;s divestiture of its studios into separate companies, R&amp;D No. 8 became SONICTEAM Ltd. in 2000, with Naka as CEO and Sonic Team USA as its subsidiary. Sega&#x27;s financial troubles led to several major structural changes in the early 2000s; the United Game Artists studio was absorbed by Sonic Team in 2003, and Sonic Team USA became Sega Studios USA in 2004.

After Sammy Corporation purchased Sega in 2004, Sonic Team was reincorporated to become Sega&#x27;s GE1 research and development department. Naka departed during the development of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006), and Sega Studios USA was merged back into Sonic Team in 2008. The following decade was marked by &quot;Sonic&quot; games of varying reception, with head of studio Takashi Iizuka acknowledging that Sonic Team had prioritized shipping over quality.

==History==
===1990: Formation and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;===

In 1984, programmer Yuji Naka was hired into Sega&#x27;s Consumer Development division. His first project was &quot;Girl&#x27;s Garden&quot;, which he and Hiroshi Kawaguchi created as part of their training process. For his next game, &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; (1987) for the Master System, Naka created pseudo-3D animation effects. He met artist Naoto Ohshima while working on the game.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, a rivalry formed between Sega and Nintendo due to the release of their 16-bit video game consoles: the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Sega needed a mascot character that would be as synonymous with their brand as Mario was with Nintendo. Sega wanted a killer app and character that could appeal to an older demographic than preteens, demonstrate the capabilities of the Genesis, and ensure commercial success in North America.

Sega held an internal competition to submit characters designs for a mascot. Ohshima designed a blue hedgehog named Sonic, who was inserted into a prototype game created by Naka. The Sonic design was refined to be less aggressive and appeal to a wider audience before the division began development on their platform game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. According to Ohshima, Sega was looking for a game that would sell well in the United States as well as in Japan. Ohshima and Naka already had the game and character ready, with Ohshima having worked with Sega&#x27;s toy and stationery department on design ideas. Ohshima said their progress encouraged Sega to select their proposal, as theirs was the only team to have put in a high amount of time and effort. This left him confident their proposal would be selected.

The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; project began with just Naka and Ohshima, but grew to involve two programmers, two sound engineers, and three designers. Hirokazu Yasuhara joined to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels, and became the lead designer. He satisfied Naka&#x27;s request for a simple, one-button design by having Sonic do damage by jumping. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was released in 1991 and proved a major success, contributing to millions of sales of the Genesis. The team took the name Sonic Team for the game&#x27;s release. Naka referred to Sonic Team as only a &quot;team name&quot; at this point.

===1994–1998: Re-establishment and new intellectual properties===

Shortly after the release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, Naka, Yasuhara, and a number of other Japanese developers relocated to California to join Sega Technical Institute (STI), a development division established by Mark Cerny intended as an elite studio combining the design philosophies of American and Japanese developers. While Naka and Yasuhara developed &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; with STI, Ohshima worked on &quot;Sonic CD,&quot; a prequel for the Sega CD add-on. Though Naka was not directly involved in the &quot;Sonic CD&quot; development, he exchanged design ideas with Ohshima.

Following the release of &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; in 1994, Naka returned to Japan, having been offered a role as a producer. He was placed in charge of Sega&#x27;s Consumer Development Department 3, also known as CS3. Naka was reunited with Ohshima and brought with him Takashi Iizuka, who had also worked with Naka&#x27;s team at STI. In the mid-1990s, Sonic Team started work on new intellectual property, leading to the creation of &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996) and &quot;Burning Rangers&quot; (1998) for the Sega Saturn. Naka stated that the release of &quot;Nights&quot; is when Sonic Team was truly formed as a brand.

Few &quot;Sonic&quot; games were released for the Saturn. Since Sonic Team was preoccupied with &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, it outsourced the development of the last Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; game, &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; (1996), to the British studio Traveller&#x27;s Tales. Sonic Team developed bonus levels for a Saturn port, released in place of the canceled STI game &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;. Yasuhara moved to London to assist the development of &quot;Sonic R&quot; (1997), a &quot;Sonic&quot; racing game co-developed by Sonic Team and Traveller&#x27;s Tales. The only other Saturn &quot;Sonic&quot; game was &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997), a compilation of the Genesis games with a 3D overworld Sonic Team used to experiment with 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay. 

The Saturn was a commercial failure, which some writers attributed to its lack of a major &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Sega shifted focus to the Dreamcast, which launched in Japan in 1998. Sonic Team saw the Dreamcast as an opportunity to revisit the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. They had begun working on a 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Saturn, but development moved to the Dreamcast to align with Sega&#x27;s plans. Iizuka led the project; Iizuka had long wanted to create a &quot;Sonic&quot; role-playing video game and felt the Dreamcast was powerful enough to achieve his vision. The game became &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998), the bestselling Dreamcast game.

Around this time, CS3 was renamed Sega Research and Development Department 8 (R&amp;D #8). It was sometimes referred to as AM8 or &quot;Sega-AM8&quot;, as Sega&#x27;s R&amp;D department was named Sega Amusement Machine Research and Development (AM), though Sonic Team focused solely on home console games. Until 2000, media referred to Sonic Team as both R&amp;D #8 and AM8.

===1999–2003: Dreamcast, Sonic Team USA and Sega restructuring===
In 1999, shortly after the release of &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, twelve Sonic Team members relocated to San Francisco to establish Sonic Team USA, while others remained in Japan. Shortly afterward, a number of key employees—including Ohshima—left Sega to form a new studio, Artoon. Sonic Team achieved success in the arcade game market in 1999 with the launch of rhythm game &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, released for the Dreamcast. They also began developing online games; in 1999, they released &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, a puzzle game that used the Dreamcast&#x27;s online capabilities. In 2000, Sonic Team launched the role-playing game &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; to critical and commercial success.

Sega began to restructure its studios in October 2000 and spun off its software divisions into subsidiary companies. When the departments took new names, Naka felt it important to preserve the Sonic Team brand name, and the division&#x27;s new legal name as a company was SONICTEAM, Ltd. Naka was installed as the CEO, and Sonic Team USA became a subsidiary of the new company.

Despite a number of well-received games, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast in 2001 and exited the hardware business. Sega transitioned into a third-party developer and began developing games for multiple platforms. From 2000, Sonic Team in Japan began to release fewer games, with a few releases such as the puzzle game &quot;Puyo Pop&quot; and the action game &quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg&quot;. The company changes and lack of a Sega console affected Sonic Team; according to Naka, in a 2006 interview, &quot;Our approach was always to create strategic title concepts, which included the hardware. We do somewhat miss the idea of being able to address these constant challenges.&quot; Yasuhara left to join Naughty Dog after Sega discontinued the Dreamcast. However, originality remained important for Naka; Sonic Team developed &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; instead of &quot;Sonic Adventure 3&quot;, explored the digital card game genre with &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution&quot;, and developed the original game &quot;Billy Hatcher&quot;. Naka credited the enduring success of &quot;Sonic&quot; to the character&#x27;s appeal to children. Naka&#x27;s goal was to appeal to the largest audience possible and to appeal to children.

Early in 2003, Sega president Hideki Sato and COO Tetsu Kamaya announced they were stepping down from their roles, with Sato being replaced by Hisao Oguchi, the head of Hitmaker. As part of Oguchi&#x27;s restructuring plan, he announced his intention to consolidate Sega&#x27;s studios into &quot;four or five core operations&quot;. Sonic Team was financially solvent and absorbed United Game Artists, another Sega subsidiary led by Tetsuya Mizuguchi and known for the music games &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; (1999) and &quot;Rez&quot; (2001).

===2004–present: Reintegration and recent years===
In 2004, the Japanese company Sammy acquired a controlling interest in Sega and formed Sega Sammy Holdings. Prior to the merger, Sega began the process of re-integrating its subsidiaries into the main company. Sonic Team USA became Sega Studios USA, while SONICTEAM Ltd. became Sega&#x27;s Global Entertainment 1 research and development division (GE1). The team is still referred to as Sonic Team. As of 2005, senior Sega figures including Toshihiro Nagoshi and Yu Suzuki were reporting to Naka; according to Takashi Yuda, he was involved in all Sega game development. Naka announced his departure on 8 May 2006 and formed a new studio, Prope, to focus on creating original games. He left Sonic Team during the development of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (2006), released as part of the 15-year anniversary of the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise. &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was panned for its bugs and design flaws; &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot; (2008) received mixed reviews, but sold well. Both games were released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360; Sonic Team also developed a series of &quot;Sonic&quot; games for the Wii and Nintendo DS, such as 2007&#x27;s &quot;Sonic and the Secret Rings&quot;.

By 2010, Sonic Team had become part of CS Research and Development No. 2 (CS2), Sega Studios USA had been reintegrated into the Japanese team, and Iizuka had become the head of the department. After a series of poorly received &quot;Sonic&quot; releases, Sonic Team refocused on speed and more traditional side-scrolling in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Colors&quot;, which all received better reviews. In 2015, Iizuka recognized in an interview with &quot;Polygon&quot; that Sonic Team had prioritized shipping games over quality, and had not had enough involvement in later third-party &quot;Sonic&quot; games, such as &quot;Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric&quot;. He hoped the Sonic Team logo would stand as a &quot;mark of quality&quot;; he planned to release quality games and expand the &quot;Sonic&quot; brand, while retaining the modern Sonic design. Iizuka stated that doing new things with the franchise has had good and bad points at times. Sonic Team&#x27;s first &quot;Sonic&quot; game exclusive to smartphones, &quot;Sonic Runners&quot;, was released in 2015. An endless runner, it was designed to have more replay value than other games in the genre. &quot;Sonic Runners&quot; received mixed reviews and was unprofitable, resulting in its discontinuation a year later.

In 2017, Sonic Team developed and released &quot;Sonic Forces&quot;, and oversaw the development of &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; by Christian Whitehead. &quot;Forces&quot; was aimed at a broad audience of young and adult players, while &quot;Mania&quot; was focused on fans of the original Genesis games. &quot;Mania&quot; became the best reviewed &quot;Sonic&quot; game in fifteen years following nearly two decades of mixed reviews for the franchise. Sonic Team also contributed to the 2019 reboot of &quot;Sakura Wars.&quot; Sonic Team is embedded within the second business division of Sega, which has more than 400 employees as of 2023.

==Sonic Team USA / Sega Studios USA==

Sonic Team USA, later Sega Studios USA, was a division of Sega and of Sonic Team while Sonic Team was a subsidiary company. It was founded when twelve Sonic Team members, including Takashi Iizuka, relocated to San Francisco, California, in 1999, and was a subsidiary of SONICTEAM, Ltd. by 2000. The team worked on game development, translation, and market studies in the United States, until they returned to Japan and merged back into Sonic Team in 2008.

Sonic Team USA translated &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and tested &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot; in America before beginning work on &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. They took inspiration from their location in San Francisco, as well as Yosemite National Park and other areas of the United States. &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; was released on 23 June 2001, and was ported to the GameCube. The next Sonic Team USA project was &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003), the first &quot;Sonic&quot; game developed for multiple platforms. Sonic Team USA took a different approach with &quot;Heroes&quot; from the &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; games, focusing on gameplay more similar to the Genesis games to which even casual gamers could adapt.

After SONICTEAM, Ltd. merged back into Sega in 2004, Sonic Team USA was renamed Sega Studios USA. Its next project was &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, released in 2005, a spin-off starring Shadow. Unlike previous games, &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; was targeted at older players and featured different gameplay styles, including the use of guns and different endings to the game. &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; was critically panned for its mature themes and level design, but was a commercial success, selling at least 1.59 million units.

The final Sega Studios USA game was &quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; and the first &quot;Nights&quot; game since the cancellation of &quot;Air Nights&quot; in 2000. Iizuka felt it was important to retain the original game&#x27;s concepts while developing new mechanics, and released it on the Wii, a more family-oriented console. &quot;Journey of Dreams&quot; was also designed to have a more European feel, in contrast to the &quot;Sonic&quot; games, which were more American. The sound and CGI were completed by Sonic Team in Japan, while Sega Studios USA handled the rest of the development for the 2007 release.

Sega Studios USA oversaw the development of &quot;Sonic Rivals&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sonic Rivals 2&quot; (2007) by Backbone Entertainment. In 2008, Sega Studios USA merged with Sonic Team, making Iizuka the head of Sonic Team and a vice president of product development for Sega. In 2016, Iizuka relocated to Los Angeles to oversee development, with the goal of making the studios there &quot;a centralized hub for the global brand&quot;.

==Games==
Sonic Team has developed a number of video games, with many of them becoming bestsellers. The studio is best known for its &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series of platform games, which account for the majority of Sonic Team&#x27;s work; the 1991 release of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is considered one of the most important moments in video game history, as it propelled Genesis sales and displaced Nintendo as the leading video game company. Sonic Team have also developed a wide variety of other games, including action games such as &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;, &quot;Burning Rangers&quot;, and &quot;Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg,&quot; the online puzzle game &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot;, the online role-playing game &quot;Phantasy Star Online,&quot; and the music game &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;. &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; is credited for introducing online RPGs to consoles and was the first online RPG for many players. According to Sean Smith of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, few companies could claim to have released as many AAA games over such a long period, especially between 1991 and 2000. Some Sonic Team games, such as the original &quot;Sonic&quot; games for the Genesis and &quot;Nights&quot;, are considered some of the best video games ever made. Iizuka has said Sonic Team would be open to developing a third &quot;Nights&quot; game or a sequel to &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; (1995), if Sega were to commission them.

Sega and Sonic Team have been criticized for their handling of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; after the beginning of the 3D era of video games. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; described the 3D Sonic games as &quot;20-odd years of slowly accumulating bullshit&quot;, and wrote that unlike Sonic&#x27;s main competitor, Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; series, &quot;Sonic&quot; in 3D never had a &quot;transcendental hit&quot;. Zolani Stewart of &quot;Kotaku&quot; argued that the greater emphasis on plot and character changed Sonic into &quot;a flat, lifeless husk of a character, who spits out slogans and generally has only one personality mode, the radical attitude dude, the sad recycled image of vague &#x27;90s cultural concept&quot;. Sega of America marketing director Al Nilsen and &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; developer Christian Whitehead said the large number of characters was problematic, with Whitehead describing them as &quot;padding&quot;. In 2015, Sega CEO Haruki Satomi acknowledged that Sega had &quot;partially betrayed&quot; the trust of their fans and hoped to focus on quality over quantity.

<doc id="26805" wikidata="Q290" url="?curid=26805" title="Sex">
<text>Sex is the biological trait that determines whether a sexually reproducing organism produces male or female gametes. During sexual reproduction, a male and a female gamete fuse to form a zygote, which develops into an offspring that inherits traits from each parent. By convention, organisms that produce smaller, more mobile gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) are called &quot;male&quot;, while organisms that produce larger, non-mobile gametes (ova, often called egg cells) are called &quot;female&quot;. An organism that produces both types of gamete is hermaphrodite. 

In non-hermaphroditic species, the sex of an individual is determined through one of several biological sex-determination systems. Most mammalian species have the XY sex-determination system, where the male usually carries an X and a Y chromosome (XY), and the female usually carries two X chromosomes (XX). Other chromosomal sex-determination systems in animals include the ZW system in birds, and the XO system in some insects. Various environmental systems include temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles and crustaceans.

The male and female of a species may be physically alike (sexual monomorphism) or have physical differences (sexual dimorphism). In sexually dimorphic species, including most birds and mammals, the sex of an individual is usually identified through observation of that individual&#x27;s sexual characteristics. Sexual selection or mate choice can accelerate the evolution of differences between the sexes.

The terms &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; typically do not apply in sexually undifferentiated species in which the individuals are isomorphic (look the same) and the gametes are isogamous (indistinguishable in size and shape), such as the green alga &quot;Ulva lactuca&quot;. Some kinds of functional differences between individuals, such as in fungi, may be referred to as mating types.

==Sexual reproduction==


Sexual reproduction, in which two individuals produce an offspring that possesses a selection of the genetic traits of each parent, is exclusive to eukaryotes. Genetic traits are encoded in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of chromosomes. The eukaryote cell has a set of paired homologous chromosomes, one from each parent, and this double-chromosome stage is called &quot;diploid&quot;. During sexual reproduction, a diploid organism produces specialized haploid sex cells called gametes via meiosis, each of which has a single set of chromosomes. Meiosis involves a stage of genetic recombination via chromosomal crossover, in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched pairs of chromosomes, to form new chromosomes, each with a new combination of the genes of the parents. Then the chromosomes are separated into single sets in the gametes. When gametes fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote has half of the genetic material of the mother and half of the father. The combination of chromosomal crossover and fertilization, bringing the two single sets of chromosomes together to make a new diploid zygote, results in a new organism that contains a different set of the genetic traits of each parent.

In animals, the haploid stage only occurs in the gametes, the sex cells that fuse to form a zygote that develops directly into a new diploid organism. In a plant species, the diploid organism produces a type of haploid spore by meiosis that is capable of undergoing repeated cell division to produce a multicellular haploid organism. In either case, the gametes may be externally similar (isogamy) as in the green alga &quot;Ulva&quot; or may be different in size and other aspects (anisogamy). The size difference is greatest in oogamy, a type of anisogamy in which a small, motile gamete combines with a much larger, non-motile gamete.

In anisogamic organisms, by convention, the larger gamete (called an ovum, or egg cell) is considered female, while the smaller gamete (called a spermatozoon, or sperm cell) is considered male. An individual that produces large gametes is female, and one that produces small gametes is male. An individual that produces both types of gamete is a hermaphrodite. In some species, a hermaphrodite can self-fertilize and produce an offspring on its own. 

===Animals===

Most sexually reproducing animals spend their lives as diploid, with the haploid stage reduced to single-cell gametes. The gametes of animals have male and female forms—spermatozoa and egg cells, respectively. These gametes combine to form embryos which develop into new organisms.

The male gamete, a spermatozoon (produced in vertebrates within the testes), is a small cell containing a single long flagellum which propels it. Spermatozoa are extremely reduced cells, lacking many cellular components that would be necessary for embryonic development. They are specialized for motility, seeking out an egg cell and fusing with it in a process called fertilization.

Female gametes are egg cells. In vertebrates, they are produced within the ovaries. They are large, immobile cells that contain the nutrients and cellular components necessary for a developing embryo. Egg cells are often associated with other cells which support the development of the embryo, forming an egg. In mammals, the fertilized embryo instead develops within the female, receiving nutrition directly from its mother.

Animals are usually mobile and seek out a partner of the opposite sex for mating. Animals which live in the water can mate using external fertilization, where the eggs and sperm are released into and combine within the surrounding water. Most animals that live outside of water, however, use internal fertilization, transferring sperm directly into the female to prevent the gametes from drying up.

In most birds, both excretion and reproduction are done through a single posterior opening, called the cloaca—male and female birds touch cloaca to transfer sperm, a process called &quot;cloacal kissing&quot;. In many other terrestrial animals, males use specialized sex organs to assist the transport of sperm—these male sex organs are called intromittent organs. In humans and other mammals, this male organ is known as the penis, which enters the female reproductive tract (called the vagina) to achieve insemination—a process called sexual intercourse. The penis contains a tube through which semen (a fluid containing sperm) travels. In female mammals, the vagina connects with the uterus, an organ which directly supports the development of a fertilized embryo within (a process called gestation).

Because of their motility, animal sexual behavior can involve coercive sex. Traumatic insemination, for example, is used by some insect species to inseminate females through a wound in the abdominal cavity—a process detrimental to the female&#x27;s health.

===Plants===
Like animals, land plants have specialized male and female gametes. In seed plants, male gametes are produced by reduced male gametophytes that are contained within pollen which have hard coats that protect the male gamete forming cells during transport from the anthers to the stigma. The female gametes of seed plants are contained within ovules. Once fertilized, these form seeds which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary for the initial development of the embryonic plant.
The flowers of flowering plants contain their sexual organs. Most flowering plants are hermaphroditic, with both male and female parts in the same flower or on the same plant in single sex flowers, about 5% of plant species have individual plants that are one sex or the other. The female parts, in the center of a hermaphroditic or female flower, are the pistils, each unit consisting of a carpel, a style and a stigma. Two or more of these reproductive units may be merged to form a single compound pistil, the fused carpels forming an ovary. Within the carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the stamens: these consist of long filaments arranged between the pistil and the petals that produce pollen in anthers at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the stigma on top of a carpel&#x27;s style, it germinates to produce a pollen tube that grows down through the tissues of the style into the carpel, where it delivers male gamete nuclei to fertilize an ovule that eventually develops into a seed.

Some hermaphroditic plants are self-fertile, but plants have evolved multiple different self-incompatibility mechanisms to avoid self-fertilization, involving sequential hermaphroditism, molecular recognition systems and morphological mechanisms such as heterostyly.

In pines and other conifers, the sex organs are produced within cones that have male and female forms. Male cones are smaller than female ones and produce pollen, which is transported by wind to land in female cones. The larger and longer-lived female cones are typically more durable, and contain ovules within them that develop into seeds after fertilization.

Because seed plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Some flowering plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by insects or larger animals such as hummingbirds and bats, which may be attracted to flowers containing rewards of nectar and pollen. These animals transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in pollination.

===Fungi===

Most species of fungus can reproduce sexually and have life cycles with both haploid and diploid phases. These species of fungus are typically isogamous, i.e. lacking male and female specialization. One haploid fungus grows into contact with another, and then they fuse their cells. In some cases, the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell which donates only a nucleus (and no accompanying cellular material) could arguably be considered male. Fungi may also have more complex allelic mating systems, with other sexes not accurately described as male, female, or hermaphroditic.

Some fungi, including baker&#x27;s yeast, have mating types that determine compatibility. Yeasts with the same mating types will not fuse with each other to form diploid cells, only with yeast carrying another mating type.

Many species of higher fungi produce mushrooms as part of their sexual reproduction. Within the mushroom, diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid spores.

== Sexual systems ==
A sexual system is a distribution of male and female functions across organisms in a species.

=== Animals ===
Approximately 95% of animal species have separate male and female individuals, and are said to be gonochoric. About 5% of animal species are hermaphroditic. This low percentage is partially attributable to the very large number of insect species, in which hermaphroditism is absent. About 99% of vertebrates are gonochoric, and the remaining 1% that are hermaphroditic are almost all fishes.

=== Plants ===
The majority of plants are bisexual, either hermaphrodite (with both stamens and pistil in the same flower) or monoecious. In dioecious species male and female sexes are on separate plants. About 5% of flowering plants are dioecious, resulting from as many as 5000 independent origins. Dioecy is common in gymnosperms, in which about 65% of species are dioecious, but most conifers are monoecious.

==Evolution of sex==
It is generally accepted that isogamy was ancestral to anisogamy and that anisogamy evolved several times independently in different groups of eukaryotes, including protists, algae, plants, and animals. The evolution of anisogamy is synonymous with the origin of male and the origin of female. It is also the first step towards sexual dimorphism and influenced the evolution of various sex differences.

It is unclear whether anisogamy first led to the evolution of hermaphroditism or the evolution of gonochorism, and the evolution of sperm and eggs has left no fossil evidence. 

A 1.2 billion year old fossil from &quot;Bangiomorpha pubescens&quot; has provided the oldest fossil record for the differentiation of male and female reproductive types and shown that sexes evolved early in eukaryotes. Studies on green algae have provided genetic evidence for the evolutionary link between sexes and mating types. 

The original form of sex was external fertilization. Internal fertilization, or sex as we know it, evolved later and became dominant for vertebrates after their emergence on land.

===Adaptive function of sex===

The most basic role of meiosis appears to be conservation of the integrity of the genome that is passed on to progeny by parents. The two most fundamental aspects of sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination and outcrossing, are likely maintained respectively by the adaptive advantages of recombinational repair of genomic DNA damage and genetic complementation which masks the expression of deleterious recessive mutations. Genetic variation, often produced as a byproduct of these processes, may provide long-term advantages in those sexual lineages that favor outcrossing.

== Sex-determination systems ==

The biological cause of an organism developing into one sex or the other is called &quot;sex determination&quot;. The cause may be genetic, environmental, haplodiploidy, or multiple factors. Within animals and other organisms that have genetic sex-determination systems, the determining factor may be the presence of a sex chromosome. In plants that are sexually dimorphic, such as &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, the liverwort &quot;Marchantia polymorpha&quot; or the dioecious species in the flowering plant genus &quot;Silene&quot;, sex may also be determined by sex chromosomes. Non-genetic systems may use environmental cues, such as the temperature during early development in crocodiles, to determine the sex of the offspring.

Sex determination is often distinct from sex differentiation. Sex determination is the designation for the development stage towards either male or female while sex differentiation is the pathway towards the development of the phenotype.

=== Genetic ===
==== XY sex determination ====

Humans and most other mammals have an XY sex-determination system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for triggering male development, making XY sex determination mostly based on the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. It is the male gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. In this system XX mammals typically are female and XY typically are male. However, individuals with XXY or XYY are males, while individuals with X and XXX are females. Unusually, the platypus, a monotreme mammal, has ten sex chromosomes; females have ten X chromosomes, and males have five X chromosomes and five Y chromosomes. Platypus egg cells all have five X chromosomes, whereas sperm cells can either have five X chromosomes or five Y chromosomes.

XY sex determination is found in other organisms, including insects like the common fruit fly, and some plants. In some cases, it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome. In the fruit fly individuals with XY are male and individuals with XX are female; however, individuals with XXY or XXX can also be female, and individuals with X can be males.

==== ZW sex determination ====
In birds, which have a ZW sex-determination system, the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male. In this case, ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. It is the female gamete that determines the sex of the offspring. This system is used by birds, some fish, and some crustaceans.

The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. Females can have Z, ZZW, and even ZZWW.

==== XO sex determination ====
In the XO sex-determination system, males have one X chromosome (XO) while females have two (XX). All other chromosomes in these diploid organisms are paired, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. This system is found in most arachnids, insects such as silverfish (Apterygota), dragonflies (Paleoptera) and grasshoppers (Exopterygota), and some nematodes, crustaceans, and gastropods.

In field crickets, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female.

In the nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, most worms are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites with an XX karyotype, but occasional abnormalities in chromosome inheritance can give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome—these XO individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).

==== ZO sex determination ====
In the ZO sex-determination system, males have two Z chromosomes whereas females have one. This system is found in several species of moths.

===Environmental===
For many species, sex is not determined by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors such as temperature experienced during development or later in life.

In the fern &quot;Ceratopteris&quot; and other homosporous fern species, the default sex is hermaphrodite, but individuals which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by the pheromone antheridiogen to develop as male. The bonelliidae larvae can only develop as males when they encounter a female.

==== Sequential hermaphroditism ====
Some species can change sex over the course of their lifespan, a phenomenon called sequential hermaphroditism. 

Teleost fishes are the only vertebrate lineage where sequential hermaphroditism occurs. In clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female; when a dominant female is absent, then her partner changes sex from male to female. In many wrasses the opposite is true: the fish are initially female and become male when they reach a certain size. 

Sequential hermaphroditism also occurs in plants such as &quot;Arisaema triphyllum&quot;.

==== Temperature-dependent sex determination ====
Many reptiles, including all crocodiles and most turtles, have temperature-dependent sex determination. In these species, the temperature experienced by the embryos during their development determines their sex. 

In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower temperatures than females; but &quot;Macroclemys&quot; females are produced at temperatures lower than 22 °C or above 28 °C, while males are produced in between those temperatures.

====Haplodiploidy====
Certain insects, such as honey bees and ants, use a haplodiploid sex-determination system. Diploid bees and ants are generally female, and haploid individuals (which develop from unfertilized eggs) are male. This sex-determination system results in highly biased sex ratios, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization (arrhenotoky or pseudo-arrhenotoky resulting in males) rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.

==Sex ratio==
==Sex differences==
Anisogamy is the fundamental difference between male and female. Richard Dawkins has stated that it is possible to interpret all the differences between the sexes as stemming from this.

=== Sexual characteristics ===

=== Sexual dimorphism ===

In many animals and some plants, individuals of male and female sex differ in size and appearance, a phenomenon called sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism in animals is often associated with sexual selection: the mating competition between individuals of one sex vis-à-vis the opposite sex. Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drives sexual dimorphism, such as in the case of the stalk-eyed fly.

Sex differences in humans include a generally larger size and more body hair in men, while women have larger breasts, wider hips, and a higher body fat percentage. In other species, there may be differences in coloration or other features, and may be so pronounced that the different sexes may be mistaken for two entirely different taxa.

Females are the larger sex in a majority of animals. For instance, female southern black widow spiders are typically twice as long as the males. This size disparity may be associated with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm: larger females are able to produce more eggs. In many other cases, the male of a species is larger than the female. Mammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism, such as elephant seals, tend to have highly polygynous mating systems, presumably due to selection for success in competition with other males. 

Sexual dimorphism can be extreme, with males, such as some anglerfish, living parasitically on the female. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss genus &quot;Dicranum&quot; and the liverwort genus &quot;Sphaerocarpos&quot;. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signaling from females.

In birds, males often have a more colorful appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) that would seem to put them at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation for this is the handicap principle. This hypothesis argues that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.

=== Sex differences in behavior ===
The sexes across gonochoric species usually differ in behavior. In most animal species, females invest more in parental care, although in some species, such as some coucals, the males invest more parental care. Females also tend to be more choosy for who they mate with, such as most bird species. Males tend to be more competitive for mating than females.

<text>A star is a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by self-gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable universe contains an estimated to stars. Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye—all within the Milky Way galaxy.

A star&#x27;s life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material largely comprising hydrogen, helium, and trace heavier elements. Its total mass mainly determines its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases energy that traverses the star&#x27;s interior and radiates into outer space. At the end of a star&#x27;s lifetime, fusion ceases and its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a black hole.

Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. These elements are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star&#x27;s apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.

Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. When two such stars orbit closely, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;star&quot; ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;h₂stḗr&quot; also meaning star, but further analyzable as h₂eh₁s- (&quot;to burn&quot;, also the source of the word &quot;ash&quot;) + -tēr (agentive suffix). Compare Latin , Greek &quot;aster&quot;, German . Some scholars believe the word is a borrowing from Akkadian &quot;istar&quot; (Venus). &quot;Star&quot; is cognate (shares the same root) with the following words: asterisk, asteroid, , constellation, Esther.

==Observation history==

Historically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They have been part of religious practices, divination rituals, mythology, used for celestial navigation and orientation, to mark the passage of seasons, and to define calendars.

Early astronomers recognized a difference between &quot;fixed stars&quot;, whose position on the celestial sphere does not change, and &quot;wandering stars&quot; (planets), which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or weeks. Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.

The oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period ().

The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis. The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1,020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy&#x27;s star catalogue. Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded &quot;nova&quot; (new star). Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.

Despite the apparent immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers were aware that new stars could appear. In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a supernova, now known as SN 185. The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers. The SN 1054 supernova, which gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.

Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly to produce &quot;Zij&quot; star catalogues. Among these, the &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot; (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi&#x27;s Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.

According to Josep Puig, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars that almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars on 500 AH (1106/1107 AD) as evidence. 
Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe identified new stars in the night sky (later termed &quot;novae&quot;), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584, Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.

The Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star Algol in 1667. Edmond Halley published the first measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby &quot;fixed&quot; stars, demonstrating that they had changed positions since the time of the ancient Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus.

William Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this, he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are physical companions that form binary star systems.

The science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of stars such as Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere&#x27;s absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865, Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. The modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the early 1900s.

The first direct measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.

The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.

Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.
With the exception of rare events such as supernovae and supernova impostors, individual stars have primarily been observed in the Local Group, and especially in the visible part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues available for the Milky Way galaxy) and its satellites. Individual stars such as Cepheid variables have been observed in the M87 and M100 galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, as well as luminous stars in some other relatively nearby galaxies. With the aid of gravitational lensing, a single star (named Icarus) has been observed at 9 billion light-years away.

==Designations==

The concept of a constellation was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual stars were given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.

As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own myths. To the Ancient Greeks, some &quot;stars&quot;, known as planets (Greek πλανήτης (planētēs), meaning &quot;wanderer&quot;), represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were taken. (Uranus and Neptune were Greek and Roman gods, but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.)

Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer Johann Bayer created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as designations to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the star&#x27;s right ascension was invented and added to John Flamsteed&#x27;s star catalogue in his book &quot;Historia coelestis Britannica&quot; (the 1712 edition), whereby this numbering system came to be called &quot;Flamsteed designation&quot; or &quot;Flamsteed numbering&quot;.

The internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars which are not recognized by the IAU, professional astronomers, or the amateur astronomy community. The British Library calls this an unregulated commercial enterprise, and the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection issued a violation against one such star-naming company for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.

== Units of measurement ==

Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or Gaussian units, it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun. In 2015, the IAU defined a set of &quot;nominal&quot; solar values (defined as SI constants, without uncertainties) which can be used for quoting stellar parameters:

The solar mass was not explicitly defined by the IAU due to the large relative uncertainty () of the Newtonian constant of gravitation &quot;G&quot;. Since the product of the Newtonian constant of gravitation and solar mass
together (&quot;G&quot;) has been determined to much greater precision, the IAU defined the &quot;nominal&quot; solar mass parameter to be:

The nominal solar mass parameter can be combined with the most recent (2014) CODATA estimate of the Newtonian constant of gravitation &quot;G&quot; to derive the solar mass to be approximately . Although the exact values for the luminosity, radius, mass parameter, and mass may vary slightly in the future due to observational uncertainties, the 2015 IAU nominal constants will remain the same SI values as they remain useful measures for quoting stellar parameters.

Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit—approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.

==Formation and evolution==

Stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions—known as &quot;molecular clouds&quot;—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula. Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars. Massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.
All stars spend the majority of their existence as &quot;main sequence stars&quot;, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly, astronomers often group stars by their mass:
* &quot;Very low mass stars&quot;, with masses below , are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning and never become red giants. After exhausting their hydrogen they become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool. As the lifetime of stars is longer than the age of the universe, no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage.
* &quot;Low mass stars&quot; (including the Sun), with a mass between and ~ depending on composition, do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash; they develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch; they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf.
* &quot;Intermediate-mass stars&quot;, between ~ and ~, pass through evolutionary stages similar to low mass stars, but after a relatively short period on the red-giant branch they ignite helium without a flash and spend an extended period in the red clump before forming a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.
* &quot;Massive stars&quot; generally have a minimum mass of ~. After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium. Many end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae.

===Star formation===

The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density—often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.

As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form &quot;Bok globules&quot;. As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the core. These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 million years for a star like the sun, up to 100 million years for a red dwarf.

Early stars of less than are called T Tauri stars, while those with greater mass are Herbig Ae/Be stars. These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as Herbig–Haro objects.
These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.

Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the Henyey track.

Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.

===Main sequence===
Stars spend about 90% of their lifetimes fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature-and-pressure reactions in their cores. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star&#x27;s core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star&#x27;s temperature and luminosity.
The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion () years ago.

Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses every year, or about 0.01% of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose to each year, significantly affecting their evolution. Stars that begin with more than can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.

The time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun is expected to live 10 billion () years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than , called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about can only fuse about 10% of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion () years; the most extreme of will last for about 12 trillion years. Red dwarfs become hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature. Since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.8 billion years), no stars under about are expected to have moved off the main sequence.

Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. Astronomers label all elements heavier than helium &quot;metals&quot;, and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star, its metallicity. A star&#x27;s metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind. Older, population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time, such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres.

===Post–main sequence===

As stars of at least exhaust the supply of hydrogen at their core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell surrounding the helium core. The outer layers of the star expand and cool greatly as they transition into a red giant. In some cases, they will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core. As the stars expand, they throw part of their mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars. In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters the helium burning phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly , 250 times its present size, and lose 30% of its current mass.

As the hydrogen-burning shell produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant of up to , the mass of the helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, core helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.

After a star has fused the helium of its core, it begins fusing helium along a shell surrounding the hot carbon core. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red-giant phase, but with a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate. During the AGB phase, stars undergo thermal pulses due to instabilities in the core of the star. In these thermal pulses, the luminosity of the star varies and matter is ejected from the star&#x27;s atmosphere, ultimately forming a planetary nebula. As much as 50 to 70% of a star&#x27;s mass can be ejected in this mass loss process. Because energy transport in an AGB star is primarily by convection, this ejected material is enriched with the fusion products dredged up from the core. Therefore, the planetary nebula is enriched with elements like carbon and oxygen. Ultimately, the planetary nebula disperses, enriching the general interstellar medium. Therefore, future generations of stars are made of the &quot;star stuff&quot; from past stars.

====Massive stars====
During their helium-burning phase, a star of more than 9 solar masses expands to form first a blue supergiant and then a red supergiant. Particularly massive stars (exceeding 40 solar masses, like Alnilam, the central blue supergiant of Orion&#x27;s Belt) do not become red supergiants due to high mass loss. These may instead evolve to a Wolf–Rayet star, characterised by spectra dominated by emission lines of elements heavier than hydrogen, which have reached the surface due to strong convection and intense mass loss, or from stripping of the outer layers.

When helium is exhausted at the core of a massive star, the core contracts and the temperature and pressure rises enough to fuse carbon (see Carbon-burning process). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon-burning process), oxygen (see oxygen-burning process), and silicon (see silicon-burning process). Near the end of the star&#x27;s life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within a massive star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.

The final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy.

Some massive stars, particularly luminous blue variables, are very unstable to the extent that they violently shed their mass into space in events known as supernova impostors, becoming significantly brighter in the process. Eta Carinae is known for having undergone a supernova impostor event, the Great Eruption, in the 19th century.

====Collapse====
As a star&#x27;s core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than roughly , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time.

In massive stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than ) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture and inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae become so bright that they may briefly outshine the star&#x27;s entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as &quot;new stars&quot; where none seemingly existed before.

A supernova explosion blows away the star&#x27;s outer layers, leaving a remnant such as the Crab Nebula. The core is compressed into a neutron star, which sometimes manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster. In the case of the largest stars, the remnant is a black hole greater than . In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter, QCD matter, possibly present in the core.

The blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.

====Binary stars====
Binary stars&#x27; evolution may significantly differ from that of single stars of the same mass. For example, when any star expands to become a red giant, it may overflow its Roche lobe, the surrounding region where material is gravitationally bound to it; if stars in a binary system are close enough, some of that material may overflow to the other star, yielding phenomena including contact binaries, common-envelope binaries, cataclysmic variables, blue stragglers, and type Ia supernovae. Mass transfer leads to cases such as the Algol paradox, where the most-evolved star in a system is the least massive.

The evolution of binary star and higher-order star systems is intensely researched since so many stars have been found to be members of binary systems. Around half of Sun-like stars, and an even higher proportion of more massive stars, form in multiple systems, and this may greatly influence such phenomena as novae and supernovae, the formation of certain types of star, and the enrichment of space with nucleosynthesis products.

The influence of binary star evolution on the formation of evolved massive stars such as luminous blue variables, Wolf–Rayet stars, and the progenitors of certain classes of core collapse supernova is still disputed. Single massive stars may be unable to expel their outer layers fast enough to form the types and numbers of evolved stars that are observed, or to produce progenitors that would explode as the supernovae that are observed. Mass transfer through gravitational stripping in binary systems is seen by some astronomers as the solution to that problem.

==Distribution==
Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical large galaxy like the Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars. There are more than 2 trillion () galaxies, though most are less than 10% the mass of the Milky Way. Overall, there are likely to be between and stars (more stars than all the grains of sand on planet Earth). Most stars are within galaxies, but between 10 and 50% of the starlight in large galaxy clusters may come from stars outside of any galaxy.

A multi-star system consists of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or more stars exist. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups are called star clusters. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars to open clusters with dozens to thousands of stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy. The stars in an open or globular cluster all formed from the same giant molecular cloud, so all members normally have similar ages and compositions.

Many stars are observed, and most or all may have originally formed in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, 80% of which are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, more than two thirds of stars in the Milky Way are likely single red dwarfs. In a 2017 study of the Perseus molecular cloud, astronomers found that most of the newly formed stars are in binary systems. In the model that best explained the data, all stars initially formed as binaries, though some binaries later split up and leave single stars behind.
The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, away. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle, , it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.

Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature and thus are bluer than stars at the main sequence turnoff in the cluster to which they belong; in standard stellar evolution, blue stragglers would already have evolved off the main sequence and thus would not be seen in the cluster.

==Characteristics==
Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including such characteristics as luminosity, size, evolution, lifespan, and its eventual fate.

===Age===
Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).

The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.

===Chemical composition===

When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy, they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.

 the star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun. By contrast, the super-metal-rich star μ Leonis has nearly double the abundance of iron as the Sun, while the planet-bearing star 14 Herculis has nearly triple the iron. Chemically peculiar stars show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum; especially chromium and rare earth elements. Stars with cooler outer atmospheres, including the Sun, can form various diatomic and polyatomic molecules.
===Diameter===

Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The Sun is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.

The disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed with current ground-based optical telescopes, so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star&#x27;s angular diameter can be computed.

Stars range in size from neutron stars, which vary anywhere from 20 to in diameter, to supergiants like Betelgeuse in the Orion constellation, which has a diameter about 640 times that of the Sun with a much lower density.

===Kinematics===

The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.

Radial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star&#x27;s spectral lines and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star&#x27;s parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.

When both rates of movement are known, the space velocity of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds; such groups with common points of origin are referred to as stellar associations.

===Magnetic field===

The magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce magnetic fields, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star&#x27;s rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star&#x27;s surface into the star&#x27;s outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.

Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star&#x27;s stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time. During the Maunder Minimum, for example, the Sun underwent a 70-year period with almost no sunspot activity.

===Mass===

Stars have masses ranging from less than half the solar mass to over 200 solar masses (see List of most massive stars). One of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae, which, with 100–150 times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million years. Studies of the most massive open clusters suggests as a rough upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe. This represents an empirical value for the theoretical limit on the mass of forming stars due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud. Several stars in the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud have been measured with larger masses, but it has been determined that they could have been created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary systems, sidestepping the limit on massive star formation.
The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to , due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium in their composition. This generation of supermassive population III stars is likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., they are observed to have a high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life. In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at .

With a mass only 80 times that of Jupiter (), 2MASS J0523-1403 is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. For stars with metallicity similar to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 . When the metallicity is very low, the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 . Smaller bodies called brown dwarfs, occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas giants.

The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star&#x27;s spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.

===Rotation===
The rotation rate of stars can be determined through spectroscopic measurement, or more exactly determined by tracking their starspots. Young stars can have a rotation greater than 100 km/s at the equator. The B-class star Achernar, for example, has an equatorial velocity of about 225 km/s or greater, causing its equator to bulge outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than 50% greater than between the poles. This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km/s at which speed the star would break apart. By contrast, the Sun rotates once every 25–35 days depending on latitude, with an equatorial velocity of 1.93 km/s. A main sequence star&#x27;s magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow its rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.

Degenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star&#x27;s angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.

===Temperature===
The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production of its core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star&#x27;s color index. The temperature is normally given in terms of an effective temperature, which is the temperature of an idealized black body that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. The effective temperature is only representative of the surface, as the temperature increases toward the core. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins.

The stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and absorption features, is used to classify a star (see classification below).

Massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000 K. Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600 K; but they have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.

==Radiation==

The energy produced by stars, a product of nuclear fusion, radiates to space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. The particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind, which streams from the outer layers as electrically charged protons and alpha and beta particles. A steady stream of almost massless neutrinos emanate directly from the star&#x27;s core.

The production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star&#x27;s outer layers.

The color of a star, as determined by the most intense frequency of the visible light, depends on the temperature of the star&#x27;s outer layers, including its photosphere. Besides visible light, stars emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye. In fact, stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, to the shortest of X-rays, and gamma rays. From the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star, not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant, but all frequencies provide insight into the star&#x27;s physics.

Using the stellar spectrum, astronomers can determine the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If the distance of the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can estimate the age of the star.

===Luminosity===
The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.

Patches of the star&#x27;s surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots. Small, &quot;dwarf&quot; stars such as the Sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. &quot;Giant&quot; stars have much larger, more obvious starspots, and they exhibit strong stellar limb darkening. That is, the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk. Red dwarf flare stars such as UV Ceti may possess prominent starspot features.

===Magnitude===

The apparent brightness of a star is expressed in terms of its apparent magnitude. It is a function of the star&#x27;s luminosity, its distance from Earth, the extinction effect of interstellar dust and gas, and the altering of the star&#x27;s light as it passes through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star&#x27;s luminosity, and is the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).

Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.

On both apparent and absolute magnitude scales, the smaller the magnitude number, the brighter the star; the larger the magnitude number, the fainter the star. The brightest stars, on either scale, have negative magnitude numbers. The variation in brightness (Δ&quot;L&quot;) between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star (&quot;m&quot;b) from the magnitude number of the fainter star (&quot;m&quot;f), then using the difference as an exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say:

:formula_1
:formula_2

Relative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star&#x27;s absolute magnitude (&quot;M&quot;) and apparent magnitude (&quot;m&quot;) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, but it has an absolute magnitude of +1.41.

The Sun has an apparent magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, the latter star appears the brighter of the two. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.

The most luminous known stars have absolute magnitudes of roughly −12, corresponding to 6 million times the luminosity of the Sun. Theoretically, the least luminous stars are at the lower limit of mass at which stars are capable of supporting nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the core; stars just above this limit have been located in the NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster are absolute magnitude 15, while a 17th absolute magnitude white dwarf has been discovered.

==Classification==

The current stellar classification system originated in the early 20th century, when stars were classified from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Q&quot; based on the strength of the hydrogen line. It was thought that the hydrogen line strength was a simple linear function of temperature. Instead, it was more complicated: it strengthened with increasing temperature, peaked near 9000 K, and then declined at greater temperatures. The classifications were since reordered by temperature, on which the modern scheme is based.

Stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra, ranging from type &quot;O&quot;, which are very hot, to &quot;M&quot;, which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: &quot;O, B, A, F, G, K&quot;, and &quot;M&quot;. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types &quot;L&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes &quot;O0&quot; and &quot;O1&quot; may not exist.

In addition, stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by their surface gravity. These range from &quot;0&quot; (hypergiants) through &quot;III&quot; (giants) to &quot;V&quot; (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add &quot;VII&quot; (white dwarfs). Main sequence stars fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type. The Sun is a main sequence &quot;G2V&quot; yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size.

There is additional nomenclature in the form of lower-case letters added to the end of the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum. For example, an &quot;&quot;e&quot; can indicate the presence of emission lines; &quot;m&quot; represents unusually strong levels of metals, and &quot;var&quot;&quot; can mean variations in the spectral type.

White dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter &quot;D&quot;. This is further sub-divided into the classes &quot;DA&quot;, &quot;DB&quot;, &quot;DC&quot;, &quot;DO&quot;, &quot;DZ&quot;, and &quot;DQ&quot;, depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature.

==Variable stars==

Variable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.

During their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.

Eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events. This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, as well as giant and supergiant stars.

Cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.

Stars can vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots. A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.1 to 3.4 over a period of 2.87 days.

==Structure==

The interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of . The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.

As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of gamma rays. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.

In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.

The radiation zone is the region of the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. Where this is not the case, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.

The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star&#x27;s mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers. Red dwarf stars with less than are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core. For most stars the convective zones will vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.
The photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate into space. It is within the photosphere that sun spots, regions of lower than average temperature, appear.

Above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere. In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere, just above the photosphere, is the thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin. Above this is the transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only . Beyond this is the corona, a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres. The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star. Despite its high temperature, the corona emits very little light, due to its low gas density. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.

From the corona, a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from the star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.

==Nuclear fusion reaction pathways==

When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship formula_3. A variety of nuclear fusion reactions take place in the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition.

The hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive, so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40 million kelvin for a massive O-class star.

In the Sun, with a 16-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the proton–proton chain reaction:

:41H → 22H + 2e+ + 2νe(2 x 0.4 MeV)
:2e+ + 2e− → 2γ (2 x 1.0 MeV)
:21H + 22H → 23He + 2γ (2 x 5.5 MeV)
:23He → 4He + 21H (12.9 MeV)

There are a couple other paths, in which He and He combine to form Be, which eventually (with the addition of another proton) yields two He, a gain of one.

All these reactions result in the overall reaction:

:41H → 4He + 2γ + 2νe (26.7 MeV)

where γ is a gamma ray photon, νe is a neutrino, and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively. The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts. Each individual reaction produces only a tiny amount of energy, but because enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly, they produce all the energy necessary to sustain the star&#x27;s radiation output. In comparison, the combustion of two hydrogen gas molecules with one oxygen gas molecule releases only 5.7 eV.

In more massive stars, helium is produced in a cycle of reactions catalyzed by carbon called the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle.

In evolved stars with cores at 100 million kelvin and masses between 0.5 and , helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple-alpha process that uses the intermediate element beryllium:

:4He + 4He + 92 keV → 8*Be
:4He + 8*Be + 67 keV → 12*C
:12*C → 12C + γ + 7.4 MeV

For an overall reaction of:
:34He → 12C + γ + 7.2 MeV

In massive stars, heavier elements can be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-56. Any further fusion would be an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.

<text>StarCraft is a real-time strategy video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment for Microsoft Windows. The first installment of the video game series of the same name, it was released in 1998. A Classic Mac OS version was released in 1999, and a Nintendo 64 port co-developed with Mass Media and published by Nintendo was released in 2000.

Blizzard started work on the game shortly after &quot;Warcraft II&quot;, another real-time strategy game, was released in 1995. The first incarnation debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it was unfavorably compared to &quot;Warcraft II&quot;. As a result, the project was entirely overhauled before being showcased to the public in early 1997, at which time it received a far more positive response. The game&#x27;s multiplayer is particularly popular in South Korea, where players and teams participate in , earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments.

Set in a fictitious future timeline during the 25th century AD in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector, the game revolves around three intelligent species fighting for dominance: the Terrans are humans exiled from Earth who are now skilled at adapting to any situation; the Zerg are a race of insectoid aliens in pursuit of genetic perfection and obsessed with assimilating other races; the Protoss are a humanoid species with advanced technology and psionic abilities who are attempting to preserve their civilization and strict philosophy about their way of life from the Zerg.

Many journalists of the video game industry have praised &quot;StarCraft&quot; as one of the most important and greatest video games of all time. The game is also said to have raised the bar for developing real-time strategy (RTS) games. With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide by February 2009, &quot;StarCraft&quot; became one of the best-selling games for the personal computer. It has been praised for pioneering the use of unique factions in RTS gameplay and for having a compelling story.

&quot;StarCraft&quot; has had its storyline adapted and expanded through a series of novels published between 2000 and 2016, the expansion pack &quot;&quot;, and two officially authorized add-ons, and &quot;Retribution&quot;. A sequel, &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot;, was released in July 2010, along with two expansion packs and a campaign pack between 2013 and 2016, while of the original and its expansion pack was released in August 2017. The original game, along with the expansion, was released for free in April 2017.

==Gameplay==

Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s use of three distinct races in &quot;StarCraft&quot; is widely credited with revolutionizing the real-time strategy genre. All units are unique to their respective races, and while rough comparisons can be drawn between certain types of units in the technology tree, every unit performs differently and requires different tactics for a player to succeed.

The psionic and technologically adept Protoss have access to powerful units and machinery and advanced technologies such as energy shields and localized warp capabilities, powered by their psionic traits. However, their forces have lengthy and expensive manufacturing processes, encouraging players to follow a strategy of the quality of their units over quantity. The insectoid Zerg possess entirely organic units and structures, which can be produced quickly and at a far cheaper cost to resources, but are accordingly weaker, relying on sheer numbers and speed to overwhelm enemies. The humanoid Terrans provide a middle ground between the other two races, providing units that are versatile and flexible. They have access to a range of more ballistic military technologies and machinery, such as tanks and nuclear weapons.

Although each race is unique in its composition, no race has an innate advantage over the other. Each species is balanced out so that while they have different strengths, powers, and abilities, their overall strength is the same.

&quot;StarCraft&quot; features artificial intelligence that scales in difficulty, although the player cannot change the difficulty level in the single-player campaigns. Each campaign starts with enemy factions running easy AI modes, scaling through the course of the campaign to the hardest AI modes. In the level editor provided with the game, a designer has access to four levels of AI difficulties: &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, and &quot;insane&quot;, each setting differing in the units and technologies allowed to an AI faction and the extent of the AI&#x27;s tactical and strategic planning. The single-player campaign consists of thirty missions, split into ten for each race.

===Resource management===
Each race relies on two resources to sustain their game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and they are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and they acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building on top of a geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg is regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works in exactly the same way for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.

===Base construction===
Protoss and Zerg building construction is limited to specific locations: Protoss buildings need to be linked to a power grid, while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called &quot;creep&quot;, that is produced by certain structures. Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary base structures possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location. Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed. Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and can eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action if repairs are not performed by a worker unit. The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit to begin the process of transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings&#x27; shields (but not their structure) are regenerative. The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself.

===Multiplayer===
Multiplayer on &quot;StarCraft&quot; is powered through Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s Battle.net Internet service. Through this, a maximum of eight players can compete in a variety of game modes, including simply destroying all other players (which may be competitive, as in Ladder play, or non-ranked, as in melee play), to king of the hill and capture the flag objective-based games. In addition, the game incorporates a variety of specialized scenarios for different types of game, such as simulating a football game, using the Terran hoverbike unit to conduct a bike race, or hosting a Zerg hunting competition. &quot;StarCraft&quot; is also one of the few games that includes a spawn installation, which allows for limited multiplayer. It must be installed from a disc, and requires a product key to work just as the full version does. However, one product key can support up to eight spawned installations with access to Battle.net. Limitations of a spawned installation include the inability to play single-player missions, create multiplayer games, or use the campaign editor. Newer releases of the game available through Battle.net or discs that include the Windows Vista label don&#x27;t support the spawn installation.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
&quot;StarCraft&quot; takes place in a science fiction universe created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney for Blizzard Entertainment. According to the story presented in the game&#x27;s manual, the overpopulation of Earth in the early 24th century has caused the international governing body, known as United Powers League (which was later succeeded by United Earth Directorate), to exile certain members of the human race, such as criminals, the cybernetically enhanced, and genetic mutants, to colonize the far reaches of the galaxy. An attempt to colonize a nearby solar system goes wrong, resulting in humanity&#x27;s arrival in the Koprulu Sector. In the distant Koprulu Sector of the galaxy, the exiles form several governments, but quickly fall into conflict with each other. One government, the Confederacy of Man, eventually emerges as the strongest faction, but its oppressive nature and brutal methods of suppressing dissidents stir up major rebel opposition in the form of a terrorist group called the Sons of Korhal. Just prior to the beginning of the game, in December 2499, an alien race possessing advanced technology and psionic power, the Protoss, makes first contact with humanity by destroying a Confederate colony world without any prior warning. Soon after this, the Terrans discover that a second alien race, the insectoid Zerg, has been stealthily infesting the surface of several of the Terran colonies, and that the Protoss are destroying the planets to prevent the Zerg from spreading. With the Confederacy threatened by two alien races and internal rebellion, it begins to crumble.

===Characters===
The player assumes the role of three nameless characters over the course of the game. In the first act, the player acts as the Confederate magistrate of an outlying colony world of Mar Sara, threatened by both the Zerg and the Protoss, and is forced through events to join the rebel Sons of Korhal under its leader Arcturus Mengsk. Mengsk&#x27;s campaign is accompanied by Jim Raynor, a morally conscious law enforcement officer from Mar Sara, and Sarah Kerrigan, a psychic assassin and Mengsk&#x27;s second-in-command. The second episode of the game sees the player as a cerebrate, a commander within the Zerg Swarm. The player is ruled over by the Zerg Overmind – the manifestation of the collective consciousness of the Swarm and the game&#x27;s primary antagonist – and is given advice from other cerebrates of higher rank and status while accomplishing the objectives of the Swarm. In the final part of &quot;StarCraft&quot;, the player is a newly appointed Executor within the Protoss military reporting to Aldaris, a representative of the Protoss government. Aldaris is at odds with Tassadar – the former occupant of the player&#x27;s position – over his association with Zeratul, a member of a heretical group known as dark templar.

===Story===
The story of &quot;StarCraft&quot; is presented through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission, and conversations within the missions themselves, along with the use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The campaign is split into three episodes, each allowing the player to command one of the game&#x27;s three races. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara in the wake of the Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, despite the fact that it had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk&#x27;s troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk&#x27;s true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, followed by the player, taking with them a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.

The second campaign reveals that Kerrigan was not killed by the Zerg, but rather is captured and infested in an effort to incorporate her psionic traits into the Zerg gene pool. She emerges with far more psionic powers and physical strength, her DNA completely altered. Meanwhile, the Protoss commander Tassadar discovers that the Zerg&#x27;s cerebrates cannot be killed by conventional means, but that they can be harmed by the powers wielded by the heretical dark templar. Tassadar allies himself with the dark templar prelate Zeratul, who assassinates Zasz, one of the Zerg&#x27;s cerebrates in their hive clusters on Char. The cerebrate&#x27;s death results in its forces running amok through the Zerg hives, but briefly links the minds of Zeratul and the Zerg Overmind, allowing the Overmind to finally learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur, which the Overmind has been seeking for millennia. The main Zerg swarm promptly invades Aiur, while Kerrigan is dispatched to deal with Tassadar, and despite facing heavy Protoss resistance, the Overmind is able to embed itself into the crust of the planet.

The final episode of the game sees Aldaris and the Protoss government branding Tassadar a traitor and a heretic for conspiring with the dark templar. The player (later retconned to be Artanis) initially serves Aldaris in defending Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but while on a mission to arrest Tassadar, the player joins him instead. A Protoss civil war erupts, pitting Tassadar, Zeratul, and their allies against the Protoss establishment (known as The Conclave.) The dark templar prove their worth when they use their energies to slay two more of the Zerg cerebrates on Aiur, and the Conclave reconciles with them. Aided by Raynor&#x27;s forces—who sided with Tassadar back on Char—the Protoss break through the Overmind&#x27;s weakened defenses and destroy the Overmind&#x27;s outer shell, but take heavy casualties in the process. Tassadar channels his own psionic energies in combination with those of the dark templar through the hull of his command ship and crashes it into the Overmind, sacrificing himself in order to destroy it.

==Development==
Blizzard Entertainment began development on &quot;StarCraft&quot; in 1995, shortly after the release of highly successful &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot;. Using the &quot;Tides of Darkness&quot; game engine as a base, &quot;StarCraft&quot; made its debut at E3 1996. The version of the game displayed, assembled by the team&#x27;s lead programmer Bob Fitch, received a rather weak response from the convention and was criticized by many for being &quot;&quot;Warcraft&quot; in space.&quot; According to programmer Patrick Wyatt, the E3 1996 build of &quot;StarCraft&quot; fared especially poorly in comparison to &quot;&quot;, another science fiction real-time strategy game which was being demoed at E3, despite the fact that the demo had been faked by Ion Storm employees; in reality, the demo for &quot;Dominion&quot; was actually a pre-rendered video that the employees were merely pretending to play. As a consequence the entire project was overhauled, bringing the focus onto creating three distinct species. Bill Roper, one of the game&#x27;s producers, stated this would be a major departure from the &quot;Warcraft&quot; approach, comparing its two equal sides to those of chess and stating that &quot;StarCraft&quot; would allow players to &quot;develop very unique strategies based on which species is being played, and will require players to think of different strategies to combat the other two species.&quot; The hand-drawn graphics seen in the E3 version were also replaced with rendered graphics. In early 1997, the new version of &quot;StarCraft&quot; was unveiled, receiving a far more positive response.
However, the game was still marred by technical difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the &quot;Warcraft II&quot; engine within two months to ensure that many of the features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to &quot;Warcraft II&quot;″s auxiliary bird&#x27;s eye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard&#x27;s resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.

Despite the progress, &quot;StarCraft&quot; was slow to emerge. The continual delays inspired a group of &quot;StarCraft&quot; fans on the official forums who labeled themselves &quot;Operation: Can&#x27;t Wait Any Longer&quot; to write a series of fictional stories in which the members of Operation CWAL attempted to retrieve the beta version of &quot;StarCraft&quot; from Blizzard&#x27;s headquarters in Irvine, California. To pay homage to their presence on the forums and enthusiasm for the game, Blizzard Entertainment later incorporated the group&#x27;s name into &quot;StarCraft&quot; as a cheat code to speed up the production of units and gave the group thanks in the game&#x27;s credits. The game was released for Windows on March 31, 1998 and in the United Kingdom on April 9, with the Classic Mac OS version following a year later on March 12, 1999. Development on a Nintendo 64 version, &quot;StarCraft 64&quot;, began in 1999, converted from PC by Mass Media Interactive Entertainment—a subsidiary of THQ—and published by Nintendo. &quot;StarCraft 64&quot; was released in the United States on June 13, 2000, and in Australia on May 25, 2001.
===Music===
The musical score to &quot;StarCraft&quot; was composed by Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s composers. Glenn Stafford composed the Terran and Protoss in-game themes, while Derek Duke, who was a contracted composer at the time, wrote all the in-game music for the Zerg. The cinematic scores were composed by Stafford and Hayes. Hayes also collaborated with Stafford on one of the Protoss in-game tracks. Tracy W. Bush provided additional support in composing. The musical score of the game was received well by reviewers, who have described it as &quot;appropriately melodic and dark&quot; and &quot;impressive&quot;, with one reviewer noting that some of the music owed much of its inspiration to Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score for the film &quot;Alien&quot;. The first official game soundtrack, &quot;StarCraft: Game Music Vol. 1&quot;, was released in 2000, comprising tracks from both &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as a sizable portion of remix tracks and music inspired by &quot;StarCraft&quot;, created by several South Korean disc jockeys. The soundtrack was distributed by Net Vision Entertainment. In September 2008, Blizzard Entertainment announced that a second soundtrack, &quot;StarCraft Original Soundtrack&quot;, had been released on iTunes. This soundtrack consisted entirely of the original music from &quot;StarCraft&quot; and &quot;Brood War&quot;, both from in-game themes to music used in the cinematic cutscenes.

==Expansions and versions==

===Computer expansions===
Before the release of &quot;StarCraft&quot;, Blizzard Entertainment released a free-to-download game demo entitled &quot;Loomings&quot;, comprising three missions and a tutorial. The prequel was made available for the full game in October 1999 as a custom map campaign, adding two extra missions and hosting it on Battle.net. In addition, the full release of &quot;StarCraft&quot; included a secondary campaign entitled &quot;Enslavers&quot;. Consisting of five missions played as both the Terrans and the Protoss, &quot;Enslavers&quot; is set in the second campaign in &quot;StarCraft&quot; and follows the story of a Terran smuggler who manages to take control of a Zerg cerebrate and is pursued by both the Protoss and Terran Dominion. &quot;Enslavers&quot; acts as an exemplar single-player campaign for the game&#x27;s level editor, highlighting how to use the features of the program.
&quot;StarCraft&quot;″s first expansion, &quot;&quot;, was released for Windows on July 31, 1998. The expansion was developed by Aztech New Media and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. Its story focused on a separate Confederate colony alluded to in the manual to &quot;StarCraft&quot;, following a group of Terran colonists and a Protoss fleet in their fight against the Zerg and a rising local insurgency. &quot;Insurrection&quot; was not received well, being criticized by reviewers for lacking the quality of the original game. &quot;Insurrection&quot; was followed within a few months by a second expansion, &quot;Retribution&quot;. Developed by Stardock, published by WizardWorks and authorized by Blizzard Entertainment, &quot;Retribution&quot; follows all three races attempting to seize control of a powerful crystal on a Terran Dominion colony. The expansion was not received with critical support, instead being regarded as average but at least challenging. After the release of &quot;Retribution&quot;, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new official expansion pack that would continue on the story of &quot;StarCraft&quot;. &quot;&quot; was consequently created, developed jointly by Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire. &quot;Brood War&quot; continues the story of &quot;StarCraft&quot; from days after its conclusion, and was released for both Windows and Mac to critical praise on December 18, 1998, in the US and in March 1999 in Europe.

Before &quot;Insurrection&quot;, an unauthorized expansion pack, called &quot;Stellar Forces&quot;, was published by Micro Star but was recalled weeks later when Micro Star settled a lawsuit brought by Blizzard against it. It consisted of 22 single player maps and 32 multi-player maps which are considered to be rather plain.

===Nintendo 64 version===
In 2000, &quot;StarCraft 64&quot; was released in North America for the Nintendo 64, co-developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Mass Media and published by Nintendo. The N64 port features all of the missions from both &quot;StarCraft&quot; and the expansion &quot;Brood War&quot;, as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, &quot;Resurrection IV&quot;. Blizzard Entertainment had initially considered releasing a home console port onto the PlayStation, but the team ultimately decided to develop and release it for the Nintendo 64 instead. &quot;Resurrection IV&quot; is set after the conclusion of &quot;Brood War&quot;, and follows Jim Raynor embarking on a mission to rescue the &quot;Brood War&quot; character Alexei Stukov, a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The &quot;Brood War&quot; missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory Expansion Pak to run. In addition, &quot;StarCraft 64&quot; features a split screen cooperative mode, also requiring the expansion pak, allowing two players to control one force in-game. &quot;StarCraft 64&quot; lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened. &quot;StarCraft 64&quot; was a runner-up for GameSpot&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Game Story&quot; and &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; awards among console games, which went respectively to &quot;Summoner&quot; and &quot;Ogre Battle 64&quot;.

== Remaster ==

A remastered edition of the game, &quot;&quot;, released August 14, 2017, preserves the gameplay of the original while adding support for ultra-high-definition graphics, Blizzard&#x27;s modern online features, and re-recorded audio (soundtrack and sound effects).

===&quot;StarCraft: Cartooned&quot;===

On June 8, 2019, as part of the grand finals of the third season of the KSL, Blizzard announced a graphics overhaul pack for the game by Carbot Animations, the producers of multiple Blizzard-related parody animations, including their first and longest-running one, the &quot;StarCrafts&quot; series. As a graphical overhaul, its effect applies to all game modes and menus in &quot;StarCraft: Remastered&quot;. It was released on July 10, 2019, as &quot;StarCraft: Cartooned&quot; alongside an announcer pack featuring South Korean YouTuber and children&#x27;s television host Hyejin &quot;Hey Jini&quot; Kang.

==Cultural impact==
===Reception===
&quot;StarCraft&quot; was released internationally on March 31, 1998, and became the best-selling PC game for that year, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. In the United States, it was the best-selling computer game of 1998, with 746,365 units sold. It was the country&#x27;s 14th best-selling release of the period between 1993 and 1999, selling 916,000 copies. By April 1999, South Korean players had purchased almost 300,000 units of the game, increasing to units sold in Korea by November 1999. &quot;StarCraft&quot;″s worldwide sales reached 4 million units by July 2001; South Korea accounted for 50% of these copies. By May 2007, &quot;StarCraft&quot; had sold over 9.5 million copies across the globe, with 4.5 million of these being sold in South Korea. Since the initial release of &quot;StarCraft&quot;, Blizzard Entertainment reported that its Battle.net online multiplayer service grew by 800 percent.

Generally, &quot;StarCraft&quot; was received positively by critics, with many contemporary reviewers noting that while the game may not have deviated significantly from the status quo of most real-time strategy games, it was one of the best to have applied the formula. In addition, &quot;StarCraft&quot;″s pioneering use of three distinct, unique, and balanced races over two equal sides was praised by critics, with GameSpot commenting that this helped the game to &quot;avoid the problem that has plagued every other game in the genre&quot;. Many critics also praised the strength of the story accompanying the game, with some reviewers being impressed by how well the story was folded into the gameplay. The game&#x27;s voice acting in particular was praised; GameSpot later hailed the voice work in the game as one of the ten best in the industry at the time. Equally, the multiplayer aspects of the game were positively received. &quot;StarCraft&quot; has received multiple awards, including being named as one of the best games of all time by GameSpot, IGN, and &quot;Game Informer&quot;. According to Blizzard Entertainment, &quot;StarCraft&quot; has won 37 awards and has received a star on the floor of the Metreon as part of the Walk of Game in San Francisco in early 2006.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that &quot;The quality of the play balancing and the elegance of the design mean that &quot;StarCraft&quot; sets a new high watermark for all real-time strategy games.&quot;

The reviewer from the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; stated that &quot;One of the most hotly anticipated computer games of the last two years, Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Starcraft&quot; has had a tremendous amount of hype to live up to. The fact that it &quot;does&quot; live up to the high expectations set for it may be the only recommendation it needs.&quot;

Although at the time &quot;StarCraft&quot;″s graphics and audio were praised by critics, later reviews have noted that the graphics do not compare to more modern games. The capacity for the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence to navigate units to waypoints also faced some heavy criticism, with &quot;PC Zone&quot; stating that the inability for developers to make an effective pathfinding system was &quot;the single most infuriating element of the real-time strategy genre&quot;. In addition, several reviewers expressed concern over some familiarities between the unit structures of each race, as well as over the potential imbalance of players using rushing tactics early in multiplayer games. Blizzard Entertainment has strived to balance rush tactics in later updates. The Nintendo 64 version of the game was not received as positively by reviewers, and was criticized for poor graphics in comparison to the PC version. However, critics did praise the game and Mass Media for using effective controls on the gamepad and maintaining the high quality audio.

At the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards), &quot;StarCraft&quot; won &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot;, and tied with &quot;Age of Empires&quot; for &quot;PC Strategy Game of the Year&quot;.
&quot;Starcraft&quot; also won the Origins Award for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1998.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 5th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a strategy game that continues to evolve and surprise many months after its release, and that currently represents the state of the genre&#x27;s art&quot;.

With more than 11 million copies sold worldwide by February 2009, &quot;StarCraft&quot; became one of the best-selling games for the personal computer. It has been praised for pioneering the use of unique &quot;factions&quot; in RTS gameplay, and for having a compelling story.

===Legacy===
GameSpot described &quot;StarCraft&quot; as &quot;The defining game of its genre. It is the standard by which all real-time strategy games are judged.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; stated that &quot;StarCraft&quot; &quot;is hands down one of the best, if not the best, real-time strategy games ever created.&quot; &quot;StarCraft&quot; is frequently included in the industry&#x27;s best games rankings, for example it ranked 37 in &quot;Edge&quot;″s top 100 games of all time. &quot;StarCraft&quot; has even been taken into space, as astronaut Daniel T. Barry took a copy of the game with him on the Space Shuttle mission STS-96 in 1999. &quot;StarCraft&quot;″s popularity resulted in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; awarding the game four world records, including &quot;Best Selling PC Strategy Game,&quot; &quot;Largest Income in Professional Gaming,&quot; and &quot;Largest Audience for a Game Competition&quot; when 120,000 fans turned out to watch the final of the SKY proleague season 2005 in Busan, South Korea. Researchers have shown that the audience for watching &quot;StarCraft&quot; games is diverse and that &quot;StarCraft&quot; uses instances of information asymmetry to make the game more entertaining for spectators. In addition, &quot;StarCraft&quot; has been the subject of an academic course; the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-run introductory course on theory and strategy in spring 2009.

After its release, &quot;StarCraft&quot; rapidly grew in popularity in South Korea. Professional gamers in South Korea are media celebrities, and &quot;StarCraft&quot; games are broadcast over three television channels dedicated to the professional gaming scene. Professional gamers in South Korea have gained television contracts, sponsorships, and tournament prizes, allowing one of the most famous players, Lim &quot;BoxeR&quot; Yo-hwan, to gain a fan club of over half a million people. One player, Lee Yun-yeol, reported earnings in 2005 of .

&quot;StarCraft&quot; was part of the United States Air Force&#x27;s Air and Space Basic Course, used to teach newly active officers about crisis planning under stress and joint service teamwork. Other efforts to make more &#x27;realistic&#x27; current-day battle software led to distractions when simulated hardware didn&#x27;t align with the real hardware active duty officers knew about. The science fiction setting allowed students to focus on the battle tactics.

The annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment hosts a competition for AIs playing the game. As of 2015, humans still win.

In 2014, an unofficial version for the Pandora handheld and the ARM architecture became available by static recompilation and reverse engineering of the original x86 version.

The original game, along with the expansion, was released for free in April 2017.

In 2021, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;StarCraft&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential spokesman and Chief of Staff Oleksiy Arestovych described reports of a potential Russian offensive as a &quot;zerg rush&quot; of 10,000 volunteers (in reference to Zerg swarm species tactics from the game), and proceeded to explain the meaning of the term.

===Merchandise===
The storyline of &quot;StarCraft&quot; has been adapted into several novels. The first novel, &quot;Uprising&quot;, which was written by Blizzard employee Micky Neilson and published in December 2000, acts as a prequel to the events of &quot;StarCraft&quot;. Other novels—&quot;Liberty&#x27;s Crusade&quot; by Jeff Grubb and Aaron Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Blades&quot;—retell the story of the game from different perspectives. At BlizzCon 2007, &quot;StarCraft&quot; creator Chris Metzen stated that he hoped to novelize the entirety of &quot;StarCraft&quot; and its expansion &quot;Brood War&quot; into a definitive text-based story. Later novels, such as Gabriel Mesta&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of the Xel&#x27;Naga&quot; and Christie Golden&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Templar Saga&quot;, further expand the storyline, creating the setting for &quot;StarCraft II&quot;.

A number of action figures and collectable statues based upon the characters and units in &quot;StarCraft&quot; have been produced by ToyCom. A number of model kits, made by Academy Hobby Model Kits, were also produced, displaying 1/30 scale versions of the marine and the hydralisk. In addition, Blizzard Entertainment teamed up with Fantasy Flight Games to create a board game with detailed sculptures of game characters. Blizzard Entertainment also licensed Wizards of the Coast to produce an Alternity based game entitled &quot;StarCraft Adventures&quot;.

<text>Skepticism, also spelled scepticism in British English, is a questioning attitude or doubt toward knowledge claims that are seen as mere belief or dogma. For example, if a person is skeptical about claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate. In such cases, skeptics normally recommend not disbelief but suspension of belief, i.e. maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor denies the claim. This attitude is often motivated by the impression that the available evidence is insufficient to support the claim. Formally, skepticism is a topic of interest in philosophy, particularly epistemology.

More informally, skepticism as an expression of questioning or doubt can be applied to any topic, such as politics, religion, or pseudoscience. It is often applied within restricted domains, such as morality (moral skepticism), atheism (skepticism about the existence of God), or the supernatural. Some theorists distinguish &quot;good&quot; or moderate skepticism, which seeks strong evidence before accepting a position, from &quot;bad&quot; or radical skepticism, which wants to suspend judgment indefinitely.

Philosophical skepticism is one important form of skepticism. It rejects knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense. Radical forms of philosophical skepticism deny that &quot;knowledge or rational belief is possible&quot; and urge us to suspend judgment on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about nonempirical matters, such as whether God exists, whether human beings have free will, or whether there is an afterlife. In ancient philosophy, skepticism was understood as a way of life associated with inner peace.

Skepticism has been responsible for many important developments in science and philosophy. It has also inspired several contemporary social movements. Religious skepticism advocates for doubt concerning basic religious principles, such as immortality, providence, and revelation. Scientific skepticism advocates for testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to investigation using the scientific method, to discover empirical evidence for them.

== Definition and semantic field ==
&quot;Skepticism&quot;, also spelled &quot;scepticism&quot; (from the Greek , to search, to think about or look for), refers to a doubting attitude toward knowledge claims. So if a person is skeptical of their government&#x27;s claims about an ongoing war then the person has doubts that these claims are true. Or being skeptical that one&#x27;s favorite hockey team will win the championship means that one is uncertain about the strength of their performance. Skepticism about a claim implies that one does not believe the claim to be true. But it does not automatically follow that one should believe that the claim is false either. Instead, skeptics usually recommend a neutral attitude: beliefs about this matter should be suspended. In this regard, skepticism about a claim can be defined as the thesis that &quot;the only justified attitude with respect to [this claim] is suspension of judgment&quot;. It is often motivated by the impression that one cannot be certain about it. This is especially relevant when there is significant expert disagreement. Skepticism is usually restricted to a claim or a field of inquiry. So religious and moral skeptics have a doubtful attitude about religious and moral doctrines. But some forms of philosophical skepticism, are wider in that they reject any form of knowledge.

Some definitions, often inspired by ancient philosophy, see skepticism not just as an attitude but as a way of life. This is based on the idea that maintaining the skeptical attitude of doubt toward most concerns in life is superior to living in dogmatic certainty, for example because such a skeptic has more happiness and peace of mind or because it is morally better. In contemporary philosophy, on the other hand, skepticism is often understood neither as an attitude nor as a way of life but as a thesis: the thesis that knowledge does not exist.

Skepticism is related to various terms. It is sometimes equated with agnosticism and relativism. However, there are slight differences in meaning. Agnosticism is often understood more narrowly as skepticism about religious questions, in particular, about the Christian doctrine. Relativism does not deny the existence of knowledge or truth but holds that they are relative to a person and differ from person to person, for example, because they follow different cognitive norms. The opposite of skepticism is dogmatism, which implies an attitude of certainty in the form of an unquestioning belief. A similar contrast is often drawn in relation to blind faith and credulity.

== Types ==
Various types of skepticism have been discussed in the academic literature. Skepticism is usually restricted to knowledge claims on one particular subject, which is why its different forms can be distinguished based on the subject. For example, religious skeptics distrust religious doctrines and moral skeptics raise doubts about accepting various moral requirements and customs. Skepticism can also be applied to knowledge in general. However, this attitude is usually only found in some forms of philosophical skepticism. A closely related classification distinguishes based on the source of knowledge, such as skepticism about perception, memory, or intuition. A further distinction is based on the degree of the skeptical attitude. The strongest forms assert that there is no knowledge at all or that knowledge is impossible. Weaker forms merely state that one can never be absolutely certain.

Some theorists distinguish between a good or healthy form of moderate skepticism in contrast to a bad or unhealthy form of radical skepticism. On this view, the &quot;good&quot; skeptic is a critically-minded person who seeks strong evidence before accepting a position. The &quot;bad&quot; skeptic, on the other hand, wants to &quot;suspend judgment indefinitely... even in the face of demonstrable truth&quot;. Another categorization focuses on the motivation for the skeptical attitude. Some skeptics have ideological motives: they want to replace inferior beliefs with better ones. Others have a more practical outlook in that they see problematic beliefs as the cause of harmful customs they wish to stop. Some skeptics have very particular goals in mind, such as bringing down a certain institution associated with the spread of claims they reject.

Philosophical skepticism is a prominent form of skepticism and can be contrasted with non-philosophical or ordinary skepticism. Ordinary skepticism involves a doubting attitude toward knowledge claims that are rejected by many. Almost everyone shows some form of ordinary skepticism, for example, by doubting the knowledge claims made by flat earthers or astrologers. Philosophical skepticism, on the other hand, is a much more radical and rare position. It includes the rejection of knowledge claims that seem certain from the perspective of common sense. Some forms of it even deny that one knows that &quot;I have two hands&quot; or that &quot;the sun will come out tomorrow&quot;. It is taken seriously in philosophy nonetheless because it has proven very hard to conclusively refute philosophical skepticism.

==In various fields==
Skepticism has been responsible for important developments in various fields, such as science, medicine, and philosophy. In science, the skeptical attitude toward traditional opinions was a key factor in the development of the scientific method. It emphasizes the need to scrutinize knowledge claims by testing them through experimentation and precise measurement. In the field of medicine, skepticism has helped establish more advanced forms of treatment by putting into doubt traditional forms that were based on intuitive appeal rather than empirical evidence. In the history of philosophy, skepticism has often played a productive role not just for skeptics but also for non-skeptical philosophers. This is due to its critical attitude that challenges the epistemological foundations of philosophical theories. This can help to keep speculation in check and may provoke creative responses, transforming the theory in question in order to overcome the problems posed by skepticism. According to Richard H. Popkin, &quot;the history of philosophy can be seen, in part, as a struggle with skepticism&quot;. This struggle has led many contemporary philosophers to abandon the quest for absolutely certain or indubitable first principles of philosophy, which was still prevalent in many earlier periods. Skepticism has been an important topic throughout the history of philosophy and is still widely discussed today.

===Philosophy===

As a philosophical school or movement, skepticism arose both in ancient Greece and India. In India the Ajñana school of philosophy espoused skepticism. It was a major early rival of Buddhism and Jainism, and possibly a major influence on Buddhism. Two of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallāna, were initially students of the Ajñana philosopher Sanjaya Belatthiputta. A strong element of skepticism is found in Early Buddhism, most particularly in the Aṭṭhakavagga sutra. However the total effect these philosophies had on each other is difficult to discern. Since skepticism is a philosophical attitude and a style of philosophizing rather than a position, the Ajñanins may have influenced other skeptical thinkers of India such as Nagarjuna, Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, and Shriharsha.

In Greece, philosophers as early as Xenophanes () expressed skeptical views, as did Democritus
and a number of Sophists. Gorgias, for example, reputedly argued that nothing exists, that even if there were something we could not know it, and that even if we could know it we could not communicate it. The Heraclitean philosopher Cratylus refused to discuss anything and would merely wriggle his finger, claiming that communication is impossible since meanings are constantly changing. Socrates also had skeptical tendencies, claiming to know nothing worthwhile.
There were two major schools of skepticism in the ancient Greek and Roman world. The first was Pyrrhonism, founded by Pyrrho of Elis (). The second was Academic Skepticism, so-called because its two leading defenders, Arcesilaus () who initiated the philosophy, and Carneades (), the philosophy&#x27;s most famous proponent, were heads of Plato&#x27;s Academy. Pyrrhonism&#x27;s aims are psychological. It urges suspension of judgment () to achieve mental tranquility (). The Academic Skeptics denied that knowledge is possible (). The Academic Skeptics claimed that some beliefs are more reasonable or probable than others, whereas Pyrrhonian skeptics argue that equally compelling arguments can be given for or against any disputed view. Nearly all the writings of the ancient skeptics are now lost. Most of what we know about ancient skepticism is from Sextus Empiricus, a Pyrrhonian skeptic who lived in . His works contain a lucid summary of stock skeptical arguments.

Ancient skepticism faded out during the late Roman Empire, particularly after Augustine () attacked the skeptics in his work &quot;Against the Academics&quot; (). There was little knowledge of, or interest in, ancient skepticism in Christian Europe during the Middle Ages. Interest revived during the Renaissance and Reformation, particularly after the complete writings of Sextus Empiricus were translated into Latin in 1569 and after Martin Luther&#x27;s skepticism of holy orders. A number of Catholic writers, including Francisco Sanches (), Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), and Marin Mersenne (1588–1648) deployed ancient skeptical arguments to defend moderate forms of skepticism and to argue that faith, rather than reason, must be the primary guide to truth. Similar arguments were offered later (perhaps ironically) by the Protestant thinker Pierre Bayle in his influential Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697–1702).

The growing popularity of skeptical views created an intellectual crisis in seventeenth-century Europe. An influential response was offered by the French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650). In his classic work, &quot;Meditations of First Philosophy&quot; (1641), Descartes sought to refute skepticism, but only after he had formulated the case for skepticism as powerfully as possible. Descartes argued that no matter what radical skeptical possibilities we imagine there are certain truths (e.g., that thinking is occurring, or that I exist) that are absolutely certain. Thus, the ancient skeptics were wrong to claim that knowledge is impossible. Descartes also attempted to refute skeptical doubts about the reliability of our senses, our memory, and other cognitive faculties. To do this, Descartes tried to prove that God exists and that God would not allow us to be systematically deceived about the nature of reality. Many contemporary philosophers question whether this second stage of Descartes&#x27;s critique of skepticism is successful.

In the eighteenth century a new case for skepticism was offered by the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776). Hume was an empiricist, claiming that all genuine ideas can be traced back to original impressions of sensation or introspective consciousness. Hume argued that on empiricist grounds there are no sound reasons for belief in God, an enduring self or soul, an external world, causal necessity, objective morality, or inductive reasoning. In fact, he argued that &quot;Philosophy would render us entirely Pyrrhonian, were not Nature too strong for it.&quot; As Hume saw it, the real basis of human belief is not reason, but custom or habit. We are hard-wired by nature to trust, say, our memories or inductive reasoning, and no skeptical arguments, however powerful, can dislodge those beliefs. In this way, Hume embraced what he called a &quot;mitigated&quot; skepticism, while rejecting an &quot;excessive&quot; Pyrrhonian skepticism that he saw as both impractical and psychologically impossible.

Hume&#x27;s skepticism provoked a number of important responses. Hume&#x27;s Scottish contemporary, Thomas Reid (1710–1796), challenged Hume&#x27;s strict empiricism and argued that it is rational to accept &quot;common-sense&quot; beliefs such as the basic reliability of our senses, our reason, our memories, and inductive reasoning, even though none of these things can be proved. In Reid&#x27;s view, such common-sense beliefs are foundational and require no proof in order to be rationally justified. Not long after Hume&#x27;s death, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) argued that human empirical experience has possibility conditions which could not have been realized unless Hume&#x27;s skeptical conclusions about causal synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgements were false.

Today, skepticism continues to be a topic of lively debate among philosophers. British philosopher Julian Baggini posits that reason is perceived as &quot;an enemy of mystery and ambiguity,&quot; but, if used properly, can be an effective tool for solving many larger societal issues.

===Religion===

Religious skepticism generally refers to doubting particular religious beliefs or claims. For example, a religious skeptic might believe that Jesus existed (see historicity of Jesus) while questioning claims that he was the messiah or performed miracles. Historically, religious skepticism can be traced back to Xenophanes, who doubted many religious claims of his time, although he recognized that &quot;God is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind.&quot; He maintained that there was one greatest God. God is one eternal being, spherical in form, comprehending all things within himself, is the absolute mind and thought, therefore is intelligent, and moves all things, but bears no resemblance to human nature either in body or mind.&quot;

Religious skepticism is not the same as atheism or agnosticism, though these often do involve skeptical attitudes toward religion and philosophical theology (for example, towards divine omnipotence). Religious people are generally skeptical about claims of other religions, at least when the two denominations conflict concerning some belief. Additionally, they may also be skeptical of the claims made by atheists.

The historian Will Durant writes that Plato was &quot;as skeptical of atheism as of any other dogma&quot;. The Baháʼí Faith encourages skepticism that is mainly centered around self-investigation of
truth.

===Science===

A scientific or empirical skeptic is one who questions beliefs on the basis of scientific understanding and empirical evidence.

Scientific skepticism may discard beliefs pertaining to &quot;purported phenomena&quot; not subject to reliable observation and thus not systematic or empirically testable. Most scientists, being scientific skeptics, test the reliability of certain kinds of claims by subjecting them to systematic investigation via the scientific method. As a result, a number of ostensibly scientific claims are considered to be &quot;pseudoscience&quot; if they are found to improperly apply or to ignore the fundamental aspects of the scientific method.

=== Auditing ===
Professional skepticism is an important concept in auditing. It requires an auditor to have a &quot;questioning mind&quot;, to make a critical assessment of evidence, and to consider the sufficiency of the evidence.

<text>Stagflation is the combination of high inflation, stagnant economic growth, and elevated unemployment. The term &quot;stagflation&quot;, a blend of &quot;stagnation&quot; and &quot;inflation,&quot; was popularized by British politician Iain Macleod in the 1960s, during a period of economic distress in the United Kingdom. It gained broader recognition in the 1970s after a series of global economic shocks, particularly the 1973 oil crisis, which disrupted supply chains and led to rising prices and slowing growth. Stagflation challenges traditional economic theories, which suggest that inflation and unemployment are inversely related, as depicted by the Phillips Curve.

Stagflation presents a policy dilemma, as measures to curb inflation—such as tightening monetary policy—can exacerbate unemployment, while policies aimed at reducing unemployment may fuel inflation. In economic theory, there are two main explanations for stagflation: supply shocks, such as a sharp increase in oil prices, and misguided government policies that hinder industrial output while expanding the money supply too rapidly. The stagflation of the 1970s led to a reevaluation of Keynesian economic policies and contributed to the rise of alternative economic theories, including monetarism and supply-side economics.

== Etymology ==
The term, a portmanteau of &quot;stagnation&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot;, is generally attributed to Iain Macleod, a British Conservative Party politician who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1970. Macleod used the word in a 1965 speech to Parliament during a period of simultaneously high inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom. Warning the House of Commons of the gravity of the situation, he said:

Macleod used the term again on 7 July 1970, and the media began also to use it, for example in &quot;The Economist&quot; on 15 August 1970, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; on 19 March 1973. John Maynard Keynes did not use the term, but some of his work refers to the conditions that most would recognise as stagflation. 

== 1976 Sterling crisis ==

The United Kingdom experienced an outbreak of inflation in the 1960s and 1970s. As inflation rose, British policy makers failed to recognise the primary role of monetary policy in controlling inflation. They tried to use non-monetary policies and devices to respond to the economic crisis. Policy makers also made &quot;inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy, [which] contributed significantly to the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.&quot;

Stagflation was not limited to the United Kingdom. Economists have shown that stagflation was prevalent among seven major market economies from 1973 to 1982. After inflation rates began to fall in 1982, economists&#x27; focus shifted from the causes of stagflation to the &quot;determinants of productivity growth and the effects of real wages on the demand for labor&quot;.

==Causes==

Economists offer two principal explanations for why stagflation occurs. First, stagflation can result when the economy faces a supply shock, such as a rapid increase in the price of oil. An unfavourable situation like that tends to raise prices at the same time as it slows economic growth by making production more costly and less profitable.

Second, the government can cause stagflation if it creates policies that harm industry while growing the money supply too quickly. These two things would probably have to occur together because policies that slow economic growth rarely cause inflation, and policies that cause inflation rarely slow economic growth.

===Supply shock===

As soon as the Six-Day War started in 1967 and Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula down to the Suez Canal, the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was aligning with the Soviet Union, closed down the Suez Canal for eight years. Oil from the Middle East to Europe had to be rerouted around Africa. Egypt then tried to cross the Suez Canal and take back the Sinai Peninsula in the Yom Kippur War in late 1973. Richard Nixon supported funding Israel with $2.2 billion over the conflict, which triggered an oil embargo in October 1973 when the countries of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) cut production of oil and placed an embargo on oil exports to the United States and other countries backing Israel.

===Excess demand===

Money supply in the early 1970s increased at almost 15% year over year in the United States and the Consumer price index lags behind about one year or two. Britain&#x27;s monetary policy was also dovish causing excess demand.
===End of Bretton Woods system===

In the mid 1970s the Bretton Woods system was failing and countries&#x27; fixed exchange rate system between currencies started to float, and the Gold standard where currencies were pegged to gold was abandoned. The price of gold and oil became very volatile after many years of steadiness.
===Other reasons===
There is evidence supporting the second explanation against the supply shock view that the 1970s stagflation was due to OPEC&#x27;s quadrupling of oil prices in October 1973. Data show that its seeds were sown during the late sixties and began to be reaped in that decade. Between 1968 and 1970 unemployment rose from 3.6% to 4.9% while the CPI inflation rose from 4.7% to 5.6%. Further in the Michigan survey expected inflation rose from 3.8% to 4.9% between 1967 and 1970. The rise in expected inflation strongly supports the view that Expected Augmented Phillips Curve (EAPC) can explain the early, mild stagflation. Although the weakening economy was putting some downward pressure on inflation overall inflation rose in accordance with EAPC, as expected inflation kept rising. The stagflation became more severe in the early 1970s but was suppressed by the price controls and wage freeze imposed by President Nixon starting in August 1971 and through 1972. But when the controls were lifted in mid-1973 the CPI surged to 8.5%. Arguably, if there were no wage-price controls, the mini stagflation documented above would have been clearly evident before the October 1973 OPEC oil price hike.

As for the direct impact of dollar depreciation on inflation, data again imply that just as higher inflation shifted up the labor supply curve and made workers demand and get higher money wages, similarly a falling dollar made commodity producers demand higher prices to compensate for the dollar decline. Further, the weakening of the dollar, while exogeneous to oil prices, was itself a delayed response to rising inflation from 1968 onwards. This pattern of an overheated economy, leading to inflation, dollar depreciation, and then to higher oil prices and another bout of stagflation repeated itself in 1979.

Both explanations are offered in analyses of the 1970s stagflation in the West. It began with a large rise in oil prices, but then continued as central banks used excessively stimulative monetary policy to counteract the resulting recession, thereby causing a price/wage spiral.

Increased requirements on skill (education and experience) on work force, for example because of increased technical complexity, can cause shortage on skilled employees and rising salaries for them, at the same time as uneducated work tasks have in part moved to low salary countries such as in Asia, causing high unemployment.

==Postwar Keynesian and monetarist views==

===Early Keynesianism and monetarism===
Up to the 1960s, many Keynesian economists ignored the possibility of stagflation, because history suggested high unemployment correlated with low inflation, and vice versa (the Phillips curve). The idea was that high demand for goods drives up prices and encourages firms to hire more; and high employment raises demand. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, when stagflation occurred, it became clear that the relationship between inflation and employment levels was not necessarily stable: that is, the Phillips relationship could shift. Macroeconomists became more sceptical of Keynesian theories, and Keynesians reconsidered their ideas in search of an explanation for stagflation.

Explanations for the shift of the Phillips curve were initially provided by the monetarist economist Milton Friedman, and also by Edmund Phelps. Both argued that when workers and firms expect more inflation, the Phillips curve shifts up (meaning that more inflation occurs at any given level of unemployment). In particular, they suggested that if inflation lasted for several years, workers and firms would start to take it into account during wage negotiations, causing workers&#x27; wages and firms&#x27; costs to rise more quickly, thus further increasing inflation. While this idea was a criticism of early Keynesian theories, it was gradually accepted by most Keynesians, and has been incorporated into New Keynesian economic models.

===Neo-Keynesianism===

Neo-Keynesian theory distinguished two distinct kinds of inflation: demand-pull (caused by shifts of the aggregate demand curve) and cost-push (caused by shifts of the aggregate supply curve). Stagflation, in this view, is caused by cost-push inflation. Cost-push inflation occurs when some force or condition increases the costs of production. This could be caused by government policies (such as taxes) or from purely external factors such as a shortage of natural resources or an act of war.

Contemporary Keynesian analyses argue that stagflation can be understood by distinguishing factors that affect aggregate demand from those that affect aggregate supply. While monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilise the economy in the face of aggregate demand fluctuations, they are not very useful in confronting aggregate supply fluctuations. In particular, an adverse shock to aggregate supply, such as an increase in oil prices, can give rise to stagflation.

=== Supply theory ===

==== Fundamentals ====
Supply theories are based on the neo-Keynesian cost-push model and attribute stagflation to large disruptions to the supply side of the supply-demand market equation, such as when there is a sudden scarcity of key commodities, natural resources, or the natural capital needed to produce goods and services. In this view, stagflation is thought to occur when there is an adverse supply shock (for example, a sudden increase in the price of oil or a new tax) that causes a subsequent jump in the &quot;cost&quot; of goods and services (often at the wholesale level). In technical terms, this leads to contraction or negative shift in an economy&#x27;s aggregate supply curve.

In the resource scarcity scenario (Zinam 1982), stagflation results when a restricted supply of raw materials inhibits economic growth. That is, when the supply of basic materials (fossil fuels (energy), minerals, agricultural land in production, timber, etc.) decreases and/or cannot rise fast enough to respond to demand. The resource shortage may be real or relative due to factors such as taxes or bad monetary policy influencing the &quot;cost&quot; or availability of raw materials. This is consistent with the cost-push inflation factors in neo-Keynesian theory (above). After supply shock occurs, the economy tries to maintain momentum. That is, consumers and businesses begin paying higher prices to maintain their level of demand. The central bank may exacerbate this by increasing the money supply, by lowering interest rates for example, in an effort to combat a recession. The increased money supply props up the demand for goods and services, though demand would normally drop during a recession.

In the Keynesian model, higher prices prompt increases in the supply of goods and services. However, during a supply shock (i.e., scarcity, &quot;bottleneck&quot; in resources, etc.), supplies do not respond as they normally would to these price pressures. So, inflation jumps and output drops, producing stagflation.

==== Explaining the 1970s stagflation ====

Following Richard Nixon&#x27;s imposition of wage and price controls on 15 August 1971, an initial wave of cost-push shocks in commodities were blamed for causing spiraling prices. The second major shock was the 1973 oil crisis, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) constrained the worldwide supply of oil. Both events, combined with the overall energy shortage that characterised the 1970s, resulted in actual or relative scarcity of raw materials. The price controls resulted in shortages at the point of purchase, causing, for example, queues of consumers at fuelling stations and increased production costs for industry.

==Recent views==

Through the mid-1970s, it was alleged that none of the major macroeconomic models (Keynesian, New Classical, and monetarist) were able to explain stagflation.

Later, an explanation was provided based on the effects of adverse supply shocks on both inflation and output. According to Blanchard (2009), these adverse events were one of two components of stagflation; the other was &quot;ideas&quot;—which Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Robert Barro were cited as expressing as &quot;wildly incorrect&quot; and &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; predictions (of Keynesian economics) which, they said, left stagflation to be explained by &quot;contemporary students of the business cycle&quot;. In this discussion, Blanchard hypothesizes that the recent oil price increases could trigger another period of stagflation, although this has not yet happened (pg. 152).

==Neoclassical views==

A purely neoclassical view of the macroeconomy rejects the idea that monetary policy can have real effects. Neoclassical macroeconomists argue that real economic quantities, like real output, employment, and unemployment, are determined by real factors only. Nominal factors like changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables like inflation. The neoclassical idea that nominal factors cannot have real effects is often called &quot;monetary neutrality&quot; or also the &quot;classical dichotomy&quot;.

Since the neoclassical viewpoint says that real phenomena like unemployment are essentially unrelated to nominal phenomena like inflation, a neoclassical economist would offer two separate explanations for &quot;stagnation&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot;. Neoclassical explanations of stagnation (low growth and high unemployment) include inefficient government regulations or high benefits for the unemployed that give people less incentive to look for jobs. Another neoclassical explanation of stagnation is given by real business cycle theory, in which any decrease in labour productivity makes it efficient to work less. The main neoclassical explanation of inflation is very simple: it happens when the monetary authorities increase the money supply too much.

In the neoclassical viewpoint, the real factors that determine output and unemployment affect the aggregate supply curve only. The nominal factors that determine inflation affect the aggregate demand curve only. When some adverse changes in real factors are shifting the aggregate supply curve left at the same time that unwise monetary policies are shifting the aggregate demand curve right, the result is stagflation.

Thus the main explanation for stagflation under a classical view of the economy is simply policy errors that affect both inflation and the labour market. Ironically, a very clear argument in favour of the classical explanation of stagflation was provided by Keynes himself. In 1919, John Maynard Keynes described the inflation and economic stagnation gripping Europe in his book &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot;. Keynes wrote:

Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. [...] Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.

Keynes explicitly pointed out the relationship between governments printing money and inflation.

The inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to extraordinary lengths. The various belligerent Governments, unable, or too timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the resources they required, have printed notes for the balance.

Keynes also pointed out how government price controls discourage production.

The presumption of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of law expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however, the seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of ultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his labours for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to purchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has received for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself, dispose of it to his friends and neighbours as a favour, or relax his efforts in producing it. A system of compelling the exchange of commodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes production, but leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter.

Keynes detailed the relationship between German government deficits and inflation.

In Germany the total expenditure of the Empire, the Federal States, and the Communes in 1919–20 is estimated at 25 milliards of marks, of which not above 10 milliards are covered by previously existing taxation. This is without allowing anything for the payment of the indemnity. In Russia, Poland, Hungary, or Austria such a thing as a budget cannot be seriously considered to exist at all. Thus the menace of inflationism described above is not merely a product of the war, of which peace begins the cure. It is a continuing phenomenon of which the end is not yet in sight.

===Zimmermann conclusion===
While most economists believe that changes in money supply can have some real effects in the short run, neoclassical and neo-Keynesian economists tend to agree that there are no long-run effects from changing the money supply. Therefore, even economists who consider themselves neo-Keynesians usually believe that in the long run, money is neutral. In other words, while neoclassical and neo-Keynesian models are often seen as competing points of view, they can also be seen as two descriptions appropriate for different time horizons. Many mainstream textbooks today treat the neo-Keynesian model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the short run, when prices are &quot;sticky&quot;, and treat the neoclassical model as a more appropriate description of the economy in the long run, when prices have sufficient time to adjust fully.

Therefore, while mainstream economists today might often attribute short periods of stagflation (not more than a few years) to adverse changes in supply, they would not accept this as an explanation of very prolonged stagflation. More prolonged stagflation would be explained as the effect of inappropriate government policies: excessive regulation of product markets and labour markets leading to long-run stagnation, and excessive growth of the money supply leading to long-run inflation.

==Alternative views==

=== As differential accumulation ===

Political economists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler have proposed an explanation of stagflation as part of a theory they call differential accumulation, which says firms seek to beat the average profit and capitalisation rather than maximise. According to this theory, periods of mergers and acquisitions oscillate with periods of stagflation. When mergers and acquisitions are no longer politically feasible (governments clamp down with anti-monopoly rules), stagflation is used as an alternative to have higher relative profit than the competition. With increasing mergers and acquisitions, the power to implement stagflation increases.

Stagflation appears as a societal crisis, such as during the period of the oil crisis in the 70s and in 2007 to 2010. Inflation in stagflation, however, does not affect all firms equally. Dominant firms are able to increase their own prices at a faster rate than competitors. While in the aggregate no one appears to profit, differentially dominant firms improve their positions with higher relative profits and higher relative capitalisation. Stagflation is not due to any actual supply shock, but because of the societal crisis that hints at a supply crisis. It is mostly a 20th and 21st century phenomenon that has been mainly used by the &quot;weapondollar-petrodollar coalition&quot; creating or using Middle East crises for the benefit of pecuniary interests.

===Demand-pull stagflation theory===
Demand-pull stagflation theory explores the idea that stagflation can result exclusively from monetary shocks without any concurrent supply shocks or negative shifts in economic output potential. Demand-pull theory describes a scenario where stagflation can occur following a period of monetary policy implementations that cause inflation. This theory was first proposed in 1999 by Eduardo Loyo of Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

===Supply-side theory===
Supply-side economics emerged as a response to US stagflation in the 1970s. It largely attributed inflation to the ending of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 and the lack of a specific price reference in the subsequent monetary policies (Keynesian and Monetarism). Supply-side economists asserted that the contraction component of stagflation resulted from an inflation-induced rise in real tax rates (see bracket creep).

===Austrian School of economics===
Adherents to the Austrian School maintain that creation of new money ex nihilo benefits the creators and early recipients of the new money relative to late recipients. Money creation is not wealth creation; it merely allows early money recipients to outbid late recipients for resources, goods, and services. Since the actual producers of wealth are typically late recipients, increases in the money supply weakens wealth formation and undermines the rate of economic growth. Austrian economist Frank Shostak says: &quot;The increase in the money supply rate of growth coupled with the slowdown in the rate of growth of goods produced is what the increase in the rate of price inflation is all about. (Note that a price is the amount of money paid for a unit of a good.) What we have here is a faster increase in price inflation and a decline in the rate of growth in the production of goods. But this is exactly what stagflation is all about, i.e., an increase in price inflation and a fall in real economic growth. Popular opinion is that stagflation is totally made up. It seems therefore that the phenomenon of stagflation is the normal outcome of loose monetary policy. This is in agreement with Phelps and Friedman (PF). Contrary to PF, however, we maintain that stagflation is not caused by the fact that in the short run people are fooled by the central bank. Stagflation is the natural result of monetary pumping which weakens the pace of economic growth and at the same time raises the rate of increase of the prices of goods and services.&quot;

===Jane Jacobs and the influence of cities on stagflation===

In 1984, journalist and activist Jane Jacobs proposed the failure of major macroeconomic theories to explain stagflation was due to their focus on the nation as the salient unit of economic analysis, rather than the city. She proposed that the key to avoiding stagflation was for a nation to focus on the development of &quot;import-replacing cities&quot; that would experience economic ups and downs at different times, providing overall national stability and avoiding widespread stagflation. According to Jacobs, import-replacing cities are those with developed economies that balance their own production with domestic imports—so they can respond with flexibility as economic supply and demand cycles change. While lauding her originality, clarity, and consistency, urban planning scholars have criticised Jacobs for not comparing her own ideas to those of major theorists (e.g., Adam Smith, Karl Marx) with the same depth and breadth they developed, as well as a lack of scholarly documentation. Despite these issues, Jacobs&#x27; work is notable for having widespread public readership and influence on decision-makers.

==Responses==
Stagflation undermined support for the Keynesian consensus.

Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker very sharply increased interest rates from 1979 to 1983 in what was called a &quot;disinflationary scenario&quot;. After U.S. prime interest rates had soared into the double-digits, inflation did come down; these interest rates were the highest long-term prime interest rates that had ever existed in modern capital markets. Volcker is often credited with having stopped at least the inflationary side of stagflation, although the American economy dipped into a recession with the unemployment rate peaking at 10.4% in February 1983. Economic recovery began in 1983. Both fiscal stimulus and money supply growth were policy at this time. A five- to six-year jump in unemployment during the Volcker disinflation suggests Volcker may have trusted unemployment to self-correct and return to its natural rate within a reasonable period.

<text>In logic and deductive reasoning, an argument is sound if it is both valid in form and has no false premises. Soundness has a related meaning in mathematical logic, wherein a formal system of logic is sound if and only if every well-formed formula that can be proven in the system is logically valid with respect to the logical semantics of the system.

== Definition ==
In deductive reasoning, a sound argument is an argument that is valid and all of its premises are true (and as a consequence its conclusion is true as well). An argument is valid if, assuming its premises are true, the conclusion &quot;must be&quot; true. An example of a sound argument is the following well-known syllogism:
: All men are mortal. 
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

Because of the logical necessity of the conclusion, this argument is valid; and because the argument is valid and its premises are true, the argument is sound. 

However, an argument can be valid without being sound. For example:

: All birds can fly.
: Penguins are birds.
: Therefore, penguins can fly.

This argument is valid as the conclusion &quot;must be&quot; true assuming the premises are true. However, the first premise is false. Not all birds can fly (for example, ostriches). For an argument to be sound, the argument must be valid &quot;and&quot; its premises must be true.

Some authors, such as Lemmon, have used the term &quot;soundness&quot; as synonymous with what is now meant by &quot;validity&quot;, which left them with no particular word for what is now called &quot;soundness&quot;. But nowadays, this division of the terms is very widespread.

== Use in mathematical logic ==

=== Logical systems ===
In mathematical logic, a logical system has the soundness property if every formula that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the semantics of the system.
In most cases, this comes down to its rules having the property of &quot;preserving truth&quot;. The converse of soundness is known as completeness. 

A logical system with syntactic entailment formula_1 and semantic entailment formula_2 is sound if for any sequence formula_3 of sentences in its language, if formula_4, then formula_5. In other words, a system is sound when all of its theorems are validities.

Soundness is among the most fundamental properties of mathematical logic. The soundness property provides the initial reason for counting a logical system as desirable. The completeness property means that every validity (truth) is provable. Together they imply that all and only validities are provable.

Most proofs of soundness are trivial. For example, in an axiomatic system, proof of soundness amounts to verifying the validity of the axioms and that the rules of inference preserve validity (or the weaker property, truth). If the system allows Hilbert-style deduction, it requires only verifying the validity of the axioms and one rule of inference, namely modus ponens (and sometimes substitution).

Soundness properties come in two main varieties: weak and strong soundness, of which the former is a restricted form of the latter.

====Weak soundness====

Weak soundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence that is provable in that deductive system is also true on all interpretations or structures of the semantic theory for the language upon which that theory is based. In symbols, where &quot;S&quot; is the deductive system, &quot;L&quot; the language together with its semantic theory, and &quot;P&quot; a sentence of &quot;L&quot;: if ⊢&quot;S&quot; &quot;P&quot;, then also ⊨&quot;L&quot; &quot;P&quot;.

====Strong soundness====

Strong soundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence &quot;P&quot; of the language upon which the deductive system is based that is derivable from a set Γ of sentences of that language is also a logical consequence of that set, in the sense that any model that makes all members of Γ true will also make &quot;P&quot; true. In symbols, where Γ is a set of sentences of &quot;L&quot;: if Γ ⊢&quot;S&quot; &quot;P&quot;, then also Γ ⊨&quot;L&quot; &quot;P&quot;. Notice that in the statement of strong soundness, when Γ is empty, we have the statement of weak soundness.

====Arithmetic soundness====

If &quot;T&quot; is a theory whose objects of discourse can be interpreted as natural numbers, we say &quot;T&quot; is &quot;arithmetically sound&quot; if all theorems of &quot;T&quot; are actually true about the standard mathematical integers. For further information, see ω-consistent theory.

===Relation to completeness===

The converse of the soundness property is the semantic completeness property. A deductive system with a semantic theory is strongly complete if every sentence &quot;P&quot; that is a semantic consequence of a set of sentences Γ can be derived in the deduction system from that set. In symbols: whenever , then also . Completeness of first-order logic was first explicitly established by Gödel, though some of the main results were contained in earlier work of Skolem.

Informally, a soundness theorem for a deductive system expresses that all provable sentences are true. Completeness states that all true sentences are provable.

Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem shows that for languages sufficient for doing a certain amount of arithmetic, there can be no consistent and effective deductive system that is complete with respect to the intended interpretation of the symbolism of that language. Thus, not all sound deductive systems are complete in this special sense of completeness, in which the class of models (up to isomorphism) is restricted to the intended one. The original completeness proof applies to &quot;all&quot; classical models, not some special proper subclass of intended ones.

<text>In the linguistic study of written languages, a syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent the syllables or (more frequently) morae which make up words. 

A symbol in a syllabary, called a syllabogram, typically represents an (optional) consonant sound (simple onset) followed by a vowel sound (nucleus)—that is, a CV (consonant+vowel) or V syllable—but other phonographic mappings, such as CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasals at the end of syllables), are also found in syllabaries.

== Types ==

A writing system using a syllabary is &quot;complete&quot; when it covers all syllables in the corresponding spoken language without requiring complex orthographic / graphemic rules, like implicit codas ( ⇒ /C1VC2/), silent vowels ( ⇒ /C1V1C2/) or echo vowels ( ⇒ /C1V1C2/). This loosely corresponds to &quot;shallow&quot; orthographies in alphabetic writing systems.

&quot;True&quot; syllabograms are those that encompass all parts of a syllable, i.e., initial onset, medial nucleus and final coda, but since onset and coda are optional in at least some languages, there are &quot;middle&quot; (nucleus), &quot;start&quot; (onset-nucleus), &quot;end&quot; (nucleus-coda) and &quot;full&quot; (onset-nucleus-coda) true syllabograms. Most syllabaries only feature one or two kinds of syllabograms and form other syllables by graphemic rules.

Syllabograms, hence syllabaries, are &quot;pure&quot;, &quot;analytic&quot; or &quot;arbitrary&quot; if they do not share graphic similarities that correspond to phonic similarities, e.g. the symbol for &quot;ka&quot; does not resemble in any predictable way the symbol for &quot;ki&quot;, nor the symbol for &quot;a&quot;. Otherwise, they are &quot;synthetic&quot;, if they vary by onset, rime, nucleus &quot;or&quot; coda, or &quot;systematic&quot;, if they vary by all of them.
Some scholars, e.g., Daniels, reserve the general term for analytic syllabaries and invent other terms (abugida, abjad) as necessary.

==Languages using syllabaries==
Languages that use syllabic writing include Japanese, Cherokee, Vai, the Yi languages of eastern Asia, the English-based creole language Ndyuka, Xiangnan Tuhua, and the ancient language Mycenaean Greek (Linear B). In addition, the undecoded Cretan Linear A is also believed by some to be a syllabic script, though this is not proven.

Chinese characters, the cuneiform script used for Sumerian, Akkadian and other languages, and the former Maya script are largely syllabic in nature, although based on logograms. They are therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;logosyllabic&quot;.

The contemporary Japanese language uses two syllabaries together called kana (in addition to the non-syllabic systems kanji and romaji), namely hiragana and katakana, which were developed around 700. Because Japanese uses mainly CV (consonant + vowel) syllables, a syllabary is well suited to write the language. As in many syllabaries, vowel sequences and final consonants are written with separate glyphs, so that both &quot;atta&quot; and &quot;kaita&quot; are written with three kana: あった (&quot;a-t-ta&quot;) and かいた (&quot;ka-i-ta&quot;). It is therefore more correctly called a &quot;moraic&quot; writing system, with syllables consisting of two moras corresponding to two kana symbols.

Languages that use syllabaries today tend to have simple phonotactics, with a predominance of monomoraic (CV) syllables. For example, the modern Yi script is used to write languages that have no diphthongs or syllable codas; unusually among syllabaries, there is a separate glyph for every consonant-vowel-tone combination (CVT) in the language (apart from one tone which is indicated with a diacritic).

Few syllabaries have glyphs for syllables that are not monomoraic, and those that once did have simplified over time to eliminate that complexity. 
For example, the Vai syllabary originally had separate glyphs for syllables ending in a coda &quot;(doŋ),&quot; a long vowel &quot;(soo),&quot; or a diphthong &quot;(bai),&quot; though not enough glyphs to distinguish all CV combinations (some distinctions were ignored). The modern script has been expanded to cover all moras, but at the same time reduced to exclude all other syllables. Bimoraic syllables are now written with two letters, as in Japanese: diphthongs are written with the help of V or &quot;h&quot;V glyphs, and the nasal codas will be written with the glyph for &quot;ŋ&quot;, which can form a syllable of its own in Vai.

In Linear B, which was used to transcribe Mycenaean Greek, a language with complex syllables, complex consonant onsets were either written with two glyphs or simplified to one, while codas were generally ignored, e.g., &quot;ko-no-so&quot; for &quot;Knōsos&quot;, &quot;pe-ma&quot; for &quot;sperma.&quot;

The Cherokee syllabary generally uses dummy vowels for coda consonants, but also has a segmental grapheme for /s/, which can be used both as a coda and in an initial /sC/ consonant cluster.

== Difference from abugidas ==
The languages of India and Southeast Asia, as well as the Ethiopian Semitic languages, have a type of alphabet called an &quot;abugida&quot; or &quot;alphasyllabary&quot;. In these scripts, unlike in pure syllabaries, syllables starting with the same consonant are largely expressed with graphemes regularly based on common graphical elements. Usually each character representing a syllable consists of several elements which designate the individual sounds of that syllable.

In the 19th century these systems were called &quot;syllabics&quot;, a term which has survived in the name of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics (also an abugida).

In a true syllabary there may be graphic similarity between characters that share a common consonant or vowel sound, but it is not systematic or at all regular. For example, the characters for &quot;ka ke ko&quot; in Japanese hiragana – か け こ – have no similarity to indicate their common /k/ sound. Compare this with Devanagari script, an abugida, where the characters for &quot;ka ke ko&quot; are क के को respectively.

==Comparison to alphabets==
English, along with many other Indo-European languages like German and Russian, allows for complex syllable structures, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. A &quot;pure&quot; English syllabary would require over 10,000 separate glyphs for each possible syllable (e.g., separate glyphs for &quot;half&quot; and &quot;have&quot;). However, such pure systems are rare. A workaround to this problem, common to several syllabaries around the world (including English loanwords in Japanese), is to add a paragogic dummy vowel, as if the syllable coda were a second syllable: &quot;ha-fu&quot; for &quot;half&quot; and &quot;ha-vu&quot; for &quot;have&quot;.

<text>Stephen Michael Reich ( ; born October 3, 1936) is an American composer best known as a pioneer of minimal music in the mid to late 1960s. Reich&#x27;s work is marked by its use of repetitive figures, slow harmonic rhythm, and canons. Reich describes this concept in his essay, &quot;Music as a Gradual Process&quot;, by stating, &quot;I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music.&quot; For example, his early works experiment with phase shifting, in which one or more repeated phrases plays slower or faster than the others, causing it to go &quot;out of phase.&quot; This creates new musical patterns in a perceptible flow. 

His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns, as on the early compositions &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; (1965) and &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966), and the use of simple, audible processes, as on &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; (1968) and &quot;Four Organs&quot; (1970). Works like &quot;Drumming&quot; (1971) and &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot; (1976), both considered landmarks of minimalism and important influences on experimental music, rock, and contemporary electronic music, would help entrench minimalism as a movement. Reich&#x27;s work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage, notably &quot;Different Trains&quot; (1988).

Reich&#x27;s style of composition has influenced many contemporary composers and groups, especially in the United States. It has been suggested that Reich is one of &quot;a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history&quot;.

== Early life ==

Reich was born in New York City to Jewish parents, the Broadway lyricist June Sillman and Leonard Reich. When he was one year old, his parents divorced, and Reich divided his time between New York and California. He is the half-brother of writer Jonathan Carroll. He was given piano lessons as a child and describes growing up with the &quot;middle-class favorites&quot;, having no exposure to music written before 1750 or after 1900. At the age of 14 he began to study music in earnest, after hearing music from the Baroque period and earlier, as well as music of the 20th century. Reich studied drums with Roland Kohloff in order to play jazz. While attending Cornell University, he minored in music and graduated in 1957 with a B.A. in Philosophy. Reich&#x27;s B.A. thesis was on Ludwig Wittgenstein; later he would set texts by that philosopher to music in &quot;Proverb&quot; (1995) and &quot;You Are (variations)&quot; (2006).

For a year following graduation, Reich studied composition privately with Hall Overton before he enrolled at Juilliard to work with William Bergsma and Vincent Persichetti (1958–1961). Subsequently, he attended Mills College in Oakland, California, where he studied with Luciano Berio and Darius Milhaud (1961–1963) and earned a master&#x27;s degree in composition. At Mills, Reich composed &quot;Melodica&quot; for melodica and tape, which appeared in 1986 on the three-LP release &quot;Music from Mills&quot;.

Reich worked with the San Francisco Tape Music Center along with Pauline Oliveros, Ramon Sender, Morton Subotnick, Phil Lesh and Terry Riley. He was involved with the premiere of Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot; and suggested the use of the eighth note pulse, which is now standard in performance of the piece.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===

Reich&#x27;s early forays into composition involved experimentation with twelve-tone composition, but he found the rhythmic aspects of the number twelve more interesting than the pitch aspects. Reich also composed film soundtracks for &quot;Plastic Haircut&quot; (1963), &quot;Oh Dem Watermelons&quot; (1965), and &quot;Thick Pucker&quot; (1965), three films by Robert Nelson. The soundtrack of &quot;Plastic Haircut&quot;, composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich&#x27;s first. The &quot;Watermelons&quot; soundtrack used two 19th-century minstrel tunes as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part canon. The music for &quot;Thick Pucker&quot; arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled &quot;Thick Pucker II&quot;, was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it.

Reich was influenced by fellow minimalist Terry Riley, whose work &quot;In C&quot; combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a sermon about the end of the world given by a Black Pentecostal street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, &quot;it&#x27;s gonna rain!&quot;, to multiple tape loops that gradually move out of phase with one another. 

The 13-minute &quot;Come Out&quot; (1966) uses similarly manipulated sound collage recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused Harlem Six, who was severely injured by police. The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police to allow him to receive medical aid for his injury from the police beating. Out of Hamm&#x27;s spoken line &quot;I had to, like, open the bruise up and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them,&quot; Reich rerecorded the fragment &quot;come out to show them&quot; on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech&#x27;s rhythmic and tonal patterns.

In &quot;Melodica&quot; (1966), Reich applies the phase looping approach of his previous works to a musical instrument. He started by playing and recording a simple melody on a melodica. He then places the recording on two separate channels, and by slowly moving them out of phase creates an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to &quot;Come Out&quot; in rhythmic structure, and is an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day. &quot;Melodica&quot; was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.

Reich&#x27;s first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 &quot;Piano Phase&quot;, for two pianos. In &quot;Piano Phase&quot; the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note melodic figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. &quot;Violin Phase&quot;, also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. &quot;Piano Phase&quot; and &quot;Violin Phase&quot; both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.

A similar, lesser known example of this so-called process music is &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing feedback as they do so. &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by Sonic Youth in the late 1990s.

Reich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece &quot;that would need no instrument beyond the human body&quot;. He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed &quot;Clapping Music&quot; (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one eighth note beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.

The 1967 prototype piece &quot;Slow Motion Sound&quot; was not performed although Chris Hughes performed it 27 years later as &quot;Slow Motion Blackbird&quot; on his Reich-influenced 1994 album &quot;Shift&quot;. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to &quot;Four Organs&quot; (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has maracas playing a fast eighth note pulse, while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with repetition and subtle rhythmic change. In contrast to Reich&#x27;s typical cyclical structure, &quot;Four Organs&quot; is unique among his work in using a linear structure—the superficially similar &quot;Phase Patterns&quot;, also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a cyclical phase piece similar to others composed during the period. &quot;Four Organs&quot; was performed as part of a Boston Symphony Orchestra program, and was Reich&#x27;s first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.

=== 1970s ===

In 1970, Reich embarked on a five-week trip to study music in Ghana, during which he learned from the master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. Reich also studied Balinese gamelan in Seattle in 1973 and 1974. From his African experience, as well as A. M. Jones&#x27;s &quot;Studies in African Music&quot; about the music of the Ewe people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece &quot;Drumming&quot;, which he composed shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and piccolo, &quot;Drumming&quot; marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians, and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians was the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, and they remain a &quot;living laboratory&quot; for his music. The ensemble still remains active with many of its original members.

After &quot;Drumming&quot;, Reich moved on from the &quot;phase shifting&quot; technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He investigated other musical processes such as augmentation (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). It was during this period that he wrote works such as &quot;Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ&quot; (1973) and &quot;Six Pianos&quot; (1973).

In 1974, Reich began writing &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also recalls earlier pieces. It is based on a cycle of eleven chords introduced at the beginning (called &quot;Pulses&quot;), followed by a small section of music based on each chord (&quot;Sections I-XI&quot;), and finally a return to the original cycle (&quot;Pulses&quot;). This was Reich&#x27;s first attempt at writing for larger ensembles. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to &quot;explore this idea further&quot;. Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on ECM Records.

One of Reich’s characteristic compositional strategies for his minimalist work is his omission of bass notes to avoid tonal structure. “The reason lay in his antipathy to the functionality, which Reich thought inevitable, of the bass in determining and spelling out a tonal center and the relationships developed around this”. &quot;Music for 18 Musicians” maintains his minimalist feel through these “phases” and harmonic shifts. A piece with rich tonal exploration about an hour’s length performance can only provide so much melodic opportunity, so repetitive rhythmic structure also plays a large role in this.

Reich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces &quot;Music for a Large Ensemble&quot; (1978) and &quot;Octet&quot; (1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with &quot;the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform&quot;. Human voices are part of the musical palette in &quot;Music for a Large Ensemble&quot; but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in &quot;Drumming&quot;). With &quot;Octet&quot; and his first orchestral piece &quot;Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards&quot; (also 1979), Reich&#x27;s music showed the influence of Biblical cantillation, which he had studied in Israel since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich&#x27;s music.

In 1974 Reich published the book &quot;Writings About Music&quot;, containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection, &quot;Writings On Music (1965–2000)&quot;, was published in 2002.

=== 1980s ===

Reich&#x27;s work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage. &quot;Tehillim&quot; (1981), Hebrew for &quot;psalms&quot;, is the first of Reich&#x27;s works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women&#x27;s voices (one high soprano, two lyric sopranos and one alto), piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, two clarinets, six percussion (playing small tuned tambourines without jingles, clapping, maracas, marimba, vibraphone and crotales), two electronic organs, two violins, viola, cello and double bass, with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2–5 (19:1–4 in Christian translations), 34:13–15 (34:12–14), 18:26–27 (18:25–26), and 150:4–6, &quot;Tehillim&quot; is a departure from Reich&#x27;s other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal counterpoint and functional harmony also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously. The musicologist Ronit Seter described it as &quot;one of a very few non-Israeli works where the setting of the Hebrew text feels natural&quot;, reflecting Reich&#x27;s extensive research into modern Hebrew-Israeli speech, ancient Psalmic prosody and Jewish cantillation traditions.
&quot;Different Trains&quot; (1988), for string quartet and tape, uses recorded speech, as in his earlier works, but this time as a melodic rather than a rhythmic element. In &quot;Different Trains&quot;, Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939–1941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under Nazi rule. The Kronos Quartet recording of &quot;Different Trains&quot; was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 1990. The composition was described by Richard Taruskin as &quot;the only adequate musical response—one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium—to the Holocaust&quot;, and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.

=== 1990s ===

In 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist Beryl Korot, on an opera, &quot;The Cave&quot;, which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis, Palestinians, and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron, where a mosque now stands and Abraham is said to have been buried. According to musicologist Ronit Seter, the work &quot;share[s] the confrontational, yet peaceful message&quot; conveyed by contemporaneous Israeli composers.

Reich and Korot collaborated on the opera &quot;Three Tales&quot;, which concerns the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster, the testing of nuclear weapons on Bikini Atoll, and other more modern concerns, specifically Dolly the sheep, cloning, and the technological singularity.

Reich used sampling techniques for pieces like &quot;Three Tales&quot; and &quot;City Life&quot; from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with &quot;Triple Quartet&quot; in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by Bartók&#x27;s and Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s string quartets, and Michael Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Yo Shakespeare&quot;.

===2000s===
The instrumental series for the concert hall continued with &quot;Dance Patterns&quot; (2002), &quot;Cello Counterpoint&quot; (2003), and multiple works centered around variations: &quot;You Are (Variations)&quot; (2004), &quot;Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings&quot; (2005), and the &quot;Daniel Variations&quot; (2006). &quot;You Are&quot; looks back to the vocal writing of &quot;Tehillim&quot; and &quot;The Desert Music&quot; while the &quot;Daniel Variations&quot;, which Reich called &quot;much darker, not at all what I&#x27;m known for&quot;, are partly inspired by the death of Daniel Pearl.

In 2002 Reich was invited by Walter Fink to the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival, as the 12th composer featured.

In December 2010 Nonesuch Records and Indaba Music held a community remix contest in which over 250 submissions were received, and Steve Reich and Christian Carey judged the finals. Reich spoke in a related BBC interview that once he composed a piece he would not alter it again himself; &quot;When it&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s done,&quot; he said. On the other hand, he acknowledged that remixes have an old tradition e.g. famous religious music pieces where melodies were further developed into new songs.

===2010s ===
Reich premiered a piece, &quot;WTC 9/11&quot;, written for String Quartet and Tape (a similar instrumentation to that of &quot;Different Trains&quot;) in March 2011. This was a response to the September 11 attacks and used recordings from emergency services and from family members who were in New York during the attacks. It was premiered by the Kronos Quartet, at Duke University, North Carolina, US.

On March 5, 2013, the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Brad Lubman, at the Royal Festival Hall in London gave the world premiere of &quot;Radio Rewrite&quot;, Reich&#x27;s work inspired by the band Radiohead. The programme also included &quot;Double Sextet&quot;, &quot;Clapping Music&quot;, featuring Reich himself alongside percussionist Colin Currie, &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot;, with electric guitar by Mats Bergström as well as two of Reich&#x27;s ensemble pieces.

&quot;Music for Ensemble and Orchestra&quot; was premiered on November 4, 2018 by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Susanna Mälkki at Walt Disney Concert Hall, marking Reich&#x27;s return to writing for orchestra after an interval of more than thirty years.

Reich has lived with his wife Beryl Korot in a home in upstate New York since 2006.

==Awards==
In 2005, Reich was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal.

Reich was awarded with the Praemium Imperiale Award in Music in October 2006.

On January 25, 2007, Reich was named 2007 recipient of the Polar Music Prize with jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins.

On April 20, 2009, Reich was awarded the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Music, recognizing &quot;Double Sextet&quot;, first performed in Richmond March 26, 2008. The citation called it &quot;a major work that displays an ability to channel an initial burst of energy into a large-scale musical event, built with masterful control and consistently intriguing to the ear&quot;.

In May 2011 Steve Reich received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music.

In 2012, Steve Reich received the Gold Medal in Music by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

In 2013 Reich received the US$400,000 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in contemporary music for bringing a new conception of music, based on the use of realist elements from the realm of daily life and others drawn from the traditional music of Africa and Asia.

In September 2014, Reich was awarded the &quot;Leone d&#x27;Oro&quot; (Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in Music) from the Venice Biennale.

In March 2016, Reich was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Royal College of Music in London.

== Influence ==
The American composer and critic Kyle Gann has said that Reich &quot;may ... be considered, by general acclamation, America&#x27;s greatest living composer&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, music critic Andrew Clements has suggested that Reich is one of &quot;a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history&quot;. 

Reich&#x27;s style of composition has influenced many other composers and musical groups, including John Adams, Michael Nyman, Aphex Twin, Björk, Sonic Youth, Stereolab, the progressive rock band King Crimson, the electronic music duos Autechre and Matmos, the new-age guitarist Michael Hedges, the art-pop and electronic musician Brian Eno, the experimental art/music group the Residents, the electronic group Underworld, the composers associated with the Bang on a Can festival (including David Lang, Michael Gordon, and Julia Wolfe), and numerous indie rock musicians including songwriters Sufjan Stevens and Matthew Healy of the 1975, and instrumental ensembles Tortoise, The Mercury Program, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor (who titled an unreleased song &quot;Steve Reich&quot;).

John Adams commented, &quot;He didn&#x27;t reinvent the wheel so much as he showed us a new way to ride.&quot; He has also influenced visual artists such as Bruce Nauman, and many notable choreographers have made dances to his music, Eliot Feld, Jiří Kylián, Douglas Lee and Jerome Robbins among others; he has expressed particular admiration of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker&#x27;s work set to his pieces.

In featuring a sample of Reich&#x27;s &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot; (1987) in the 1990 track &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; the British ambient techno act the Orb exposed a new generation of listeners to his music. In 1999 the album &quot;Reich Remixed&quot; featured remixes of a number of Reich&#x27;s works by various electronic dance-music producers, such as DJ Spooky, Kurtis Mantronik, Ken Ishii, and Coldcut among others.

Reich&#x27;s &quot;Cello Counterpoint&quot; (2003) was the inspiration for a series of commissions for solo cello with pre-recorded cellos made by Ashley Bathgate in 2017 including new works by Emily Cooley and Alex Weiser.

Reich often cites Pérotin, J. S. Bach, Debussy, Bartók, and Stravinsky as composers whom he admires and who greatly influenced him when he was young. Jazz is a major part of the formation of Reich&#x27;s musical style, and two of the earliest influences on his work were vocalists Ella Fitzgerald and Alfred Deller, whose emphasis on the artistic capabilities of the voice alone with little vibrato or other alteration was an inspiration to his earliest works. John Coltrane&#x27;s style, which Reich has described as &quot;playing a lot of notes to very few harmonies&quot;, also had an impact; of particular interest was the album &quot;Africa/Brass&quot;, which &quot;was basically a half-an-hour in E&quot;. Reich&#x27;s influence from jazz includes its roots, also, from the West African music he studied in his readings and visit to Ghana. Other important influences are Kenny Clarke and Miles Davis, and visual artist friends such as Sol LeWitt and Richard Serra. Reich has also stated that he admires the music of the band Radiohead, which led to his composition &quot;Radio Rewrite&quot;.

<doc id="26823" wikidata="Q484918" url="?curid=26823" title="Simon &amp; Garfunkel">
<text>Simon &amp; Garfunkel were an American folk rock duo comprising the singer-songwriter Paul Simon and the singer Art Garfunkel. They were one of the best-selling music acts of the 1960s. Their most famous recordings include three US number ones—&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and the two Record of the Year Grammy winners &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;—and &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, &quot;I Am a Rock&quot;, &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot;, &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; (also a cover hit for the Bangles), &quot;America&quot;, &quot;The Boxer&quot; and &quot;Cecilia&quot;.

Simon and Garfunkel met in elementary school in Queens, New York City, in 1953, where they learned to harmonize and Simon began writing songs. As teenagers, under the name Tom &amp; Jerry, they had minor success with &quot;Hey Schoolgirl&quot; (1957), a song imitating their idols, the Everly Brothers. In 1963, they regrouped and were signed to Columbia Records as Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Their debut album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; (October 1964), sold poorly; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. In 1965, a remixed version of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, became a US AM radio hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. They released their second album, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;, in 1966, and toured colleges nationwide. They assumed more creative control on their &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot;, released in 1966. Their music featured prominently in Mike Nichols&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;, and in 1968 the soundtrack album and the duo&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Bookends,&quot; featuring the hit version of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, alternated at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200.

Simon and Garfunkel had a troubled relationship, leading to artistic disagreements and their breakup in 1970. Their final studio album, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, released that January, became one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums. Following their split, Simon hit big on both the singles chart (13 top-40 hits, 1972–1986) and the album chart, including the acclaimed &quot;Graceland&quot; (1986). Garfunkel charted with hits such as &quot;All I Know&quot; (1973) and the two UK number ones &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; (1975) and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; (Britain&#x27;s top single of 1979), and briefly pursued an acting career, with leading roles in the Mike Nichols films &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970) and &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971) and in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Bad Timing&quot; (1980). The duo have reunited several times; their 1981 concert in Central Park may have attracted more than 500,000 people, one of the largest concert attendances in history. 

Simon &amp; Garfunkel won seven Grammy Awards—plus four Grammy Hall of Fame Awards—and in 1990 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Richie Unterberger described them as &quot;the most successful folk-rock duo of the 1960s&quot; and one of the most popular artists from the decade. They are among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 100 million records. They were ranked 40th on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 2010 list of the Greatest Artists of All Time and third on its list of the greatest duos.

==History==
===1953–1956: Early years===
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel grew up in the 1940s and 1950s in their predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Kew Gardens Hills in Queens, New York, three blocks away from one another. They attended the same schools: Public School 164 in Kew Gardens Hills, Parsons Junior High School, and Forest Hills High School. They were both fascinated by music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. Simon first noticed Garfunkel when Garfunkel was singing in a fourth grade talent show, which Simon thought was a good way to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship, which started in 1953, when they appeared in a sixth grade adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. They formed a streetcorner doo-wop group called the Peptones with three friends and learned to harmonize. They began performing as a duo at school dances.

Simon and Garfunkel later attended Forest Hills High School, where in 1956 they wrote their first song, &quot;The Girl for Me&quot;; Simon&#x27;s father sent a handwritten copy to the Library of Congress to register a copyright. While trying to remember the lyrics to the Everly Brothers song &quot;Hey Doll Baby&quot;, they wrote &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl&quot;, which they recorded for $25 at Sanders Recording Studio in Manhattan. While recording they were overheard by promoter Sid Prosen, who signed them to his independent label Big Records after speaking to their parents. They were both 15.

===1957–1964: From Tom &amp; Jerry and early recordings===

Under Big Records, Simon and Garfunkel assumed the name Tom &amp; Jerry; Garfunkel named himself Tom Graph, a reference to his interest in mathematics, and Simon Jerry Landis, after the surname of a girl he had dated. Their first single, &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl&quot;, was released with the B-side &quot;Dancin&#x27; Wild&quot; in 1957. Prosen, using the payola system, bribed DJ Alan Freed $200 to play the single on his radio show, where it became a nightly staple. &quot;Hey, Schoolgirl&quot; attracted regular rotation on nationwide AM pop stations, leading it to sell over 100,000 copies and to land on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number 49. Prosen promoted the group heavily, getting them a headlining spot on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; alongside Jerry Lee Lewis. Simon and Garfunkel shared approximately $4,000 from the song—earning two percent each from royalties, the rest staying with Prosen. They released two more singles on Big Records (&quot;Our Song&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Story&quot;) neither of them successful.

After graduating from Forest Hills High School in 1958, the pair continued their education should a music career not unfold. Simon studied English at Queens College, City University of New York, and Garfunkel studied architecture before switching to art history at Columbia College, Columbia University. While still with Big Records as a duo, Simon released a solo single, &quot;True or False&quot;, under the name &quot;True Taylor&quot;. This upset Garfunkel, who regarded it as a betrayal; the emotional tension from the incident occasionally surfaced throughout their relationship.

Simon and Garfunkel continued recording as solo artists: Garfunkel composed and recorded &quot;Private World&quot; for Octavia Records, and—under the name Artie Garr—&quot;Beat Love&quot; for Warwick; Simon recorded with the Mystics and Tico and the Triumphs, and wrote and recorded under the names Jerry Landis and Paul Kane. Simon also wrote and performed demos for other artists, working for a while with Carole King and Gerry Goffin.

After graduating in 1963, Simon joined Garfunkel, who was still at Columbia University, to perform again as a duo, this time with a shared interest in folk music. Simon enrolled part-time in Brooklyn Law School. By late 1963, billing themselves as Kane &amp; Garr, they performed at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City, a Greenwich Village club that hosted Monday night open mic performances. They performed three new songs—&quot;Sparrow&quot;, &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;—and attracted the attention of Columbia Records staffer Tom Wilson, a prominent A&amp;R man and producer (who would later become a key architect of Bob Dylan&#x27;s transition from folk to rock). As a &quot;star producer&quot; for the label, he wanted to record &quot;He Was My Brother&quot; with a new British act, the Pilgrims. Simon convinced Wilson to let him and Garfunkel audition in the studio, where they performed &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. At Wilson&#x27;s urging, Columbia signed them.

Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, produced by Wilson, was recorded over three sessions in March 1964 and released in October. It contains five songs by Simon, three traditional folk songs, and four folk-influenced singer-songwriter songs. Simon was adamant that they would no longer use stage names. Columbia set up a promotional showcase at Folk City on March 31, 1964, the duo&#x27;s first public concert as Simon &amp; Garfunkel.

===1964–1965: Simon in England; Garfunkel in college===
&quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; sold only 3,000 copies on release. Simon moved to England, where he toured small folk clubs and befriended folk artists such as Bert Jansch, Martin Carthy, Al Stewart, and Sandy Denny. He also met Kathy Chitty, who became the object of his affection and is the Kathy in &quot;Kathy&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;America&quot;.

A small music publishing company, Lorna Music, licensed &quot;Carlos Dominguez&quot;, a single Simon had recorded two years prior as Paul Kane, for a new recording by Val Doonican that sold well. Simon visited Lorna to thank them, and the meeting resulted in a publishing and recording contract. He signed to the Oriole label and released &quot;He Was My Brother&quot; as a single. Simon invited Garfunkel to stay for the summer of 1964.

Near the end of the season, Garfunkel returned to Columbia for class. Simon also returned to the US, and resumed his studies at Brooklyn Law School for one semester, partially at his parents&#x27; insistence. He returned to England in January 1965, now certain that music was his calling. In the meantime, his landlady, Judith Piepe, had compiled a tape from his work at Lorna and sent it to the BBC in hopes they would play it. The demos aired on the &quot;Five to Ten&quot; morning show, and were instantly successful. Oriole had folded into CBS by that point, and hoped to record a new Simon album.

Simon recorded his first solo album, &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook,&quot; in June 1965, featuring future Simon &amp; Garfunkel staples including &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; and &quot;April Come She Will&quot;. CBS flew Wilson over to produce the record, and he stayed at Simon&#x27;s flat. The album was released in August; although sales were poor, Simon felt content with his future in England. Garfunkel graduated in 1965, returning to Columbia University to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics.

===1965–1966: Mainstream breakthrough and success===
In the United States, Dick Summer, a late-night DJ at WBZ in Boston, played &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;; it became popular with a college audience. It was picked up the next day along the East Coast of the United States. When Wilson heard about this new wave of interest, he took inspiration from the success of the folk-rock hybrid that he had created with Dylan in &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; and crafted a rock remix of &quot;Sound of Silence&quot; using studio musicians. The remix was issued in September 1965, and it eventually reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was &quot;horrified&quot; when he first heard it.

By January 1966, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; had topped the Hot 100, selling over one million copies. Simon reunited with Garfunkel in New York, leaving Chitty and his friends in England behind. CBS demanded a new album to be called &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; to ride the wave of the hit. Recorded in three weeks and consisting of rerecorded songs from &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; plus four new tracks, &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; was rush-released in mid-January 1966, peaking at number 21 &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. A week later, &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; was released as a single, entering the USA top ten, followed by &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; peaking at number three. The duo supported the recordings with a nationwide tour of the US including a performance during the first Spring Weekend of the University of Massachusetts Boston where the duo was the headline act. CBS continued its promotion by re-releasing &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, which charted at number 30. Despite the success, the duo was derided by some critics as a manufactured imitation of folk music.
Since they considered &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; a &quot;rush job&quot; to capitalize on their sudden success, Simon &amp; Garfunkel spent more time crafting the follow-up. It was the first time Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording. Work began in 1966 and took nine months. Garfunkel considered the recording of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; to be the point at which they stepped into the role of producer, as they were constantly beside engineer Roy Halee mixing. &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; was issued in October 1966, following the release of several singles and sold-out college campus shows. The duo resumed their college circuit tour eleven days later, crafting an image that was described as &quot;alienated&quot;, &quot;weird&quot;, and &quot;poetic&quot;. Manager Mort Lewis also was responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist. Simon, then 26, felt he had &quot;made it&quot; into an upper echelon of rock and roll while retaining artistic integrity; according to his biographer Marc Eliot, this made him &quot;spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin&quot;. The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, also a friend of Wilson&#x27;s.

During the sessions for &quot;Parsley&quot;, Simon and Garfunkel recorded &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot;; it was released as a single, peaking at number 13 on the national charts. &quot;At the Zoo&quot;, recorded in early 1967 for a single release, charted at number 16. Simon began work for their next album around this time, telling &quot;High Fidelity&quot; he was no longer interested in singles. He developed writer&#x27;s block, which prevented the duo from releasing an album in 1967. Many other successful artists at the time were expected to release two or three albums each year, and the lack of productivity worried Columbia executives. Amid concerns for Simon&#x27;s apparent idleness, Columbia Records chairman Clive Davis arranged for up-and-coming producer John Simon to kick-start the recording. Simon was distrustful of label executives; on one occasion, he and Garfunkel recorded a meeting with Davis, who was giving a &quot;fatherly talk&quot; on speeding up production, to laugh at it later. The rare television appearances at this time saw the duo performing on network broadcasts as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; in 1966, and twice on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1967.

Meanwhile, director Mike Nichols, then filming &quot;The Graduate&quot;, had become fascinated with Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s records, listening to them extensively before and after filming. He met Davis to ask for permission to license Simon &amp; Garfunkel music for his film. Davis viewed it as a perfect fit and envisioned a best-selling soundtrack album. Simon was not as receptive and was cautious of &quot;selling out&quot;. After meeting Nichols and being impressed by his wit and the script, he agreed to write new songs for the film. Leonard Hirshan, a powerful agent at William Morris, negotiated a deal that paid Simon $25,000 to submit three songs to Nichols and producer Lawrence Turman. When Nichols was not impressed by Simon&#x27;s songs &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Overs&quot;, Simon and Garfunkel offered another, incomplete song, which became &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;; Nichols loved it.

===1967–1968: Studio time and low profile===
Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Bookends&quot;, was recorded in fits and starts from late 1966 to early 1968. Although the album had long been planned, work did not begin in earnest until late 1967. The duo were signed under an older contract that specified the label pay for sessions, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel took advantage of this, hiring viola and brass players and percussionists. The record&#x27;s brevity reflects its concise and perfectionist production; the team spent over 50 hours recording &quot;Punky&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, for example, and rerecorded vocal parts, sometimes note by note, until they were satisfied. Garfunkel&#x27;s songs and voice took a lead role on some of the songs, and the harmonies for which the duo was known gradually disappeared. For Simon, &quot;Bookends&quot; represented the end of the collaboration and became an early indicator of his intentions to go solo.

Prior to release, the band helped put together and performed at the Monterey Pop Festival, which signaled the beginning of the Summer of Love on the West Coast. &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot; was issued as a single that summer and found only modest success on AM radio; the duo were much more focused on the rising FM format, which played album tracks and treated their music with respect. In January 1968, the duo appeared on a &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; special, &quot;Three for Tonight&quot;, performing ten songs, largely taken from their previous album. &quot;Bookends&quot; was released by Columbia Records in April 1968, 24 hours before the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which spurred nationwide outrage and riots. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs in the issue dated April 27, 1968, climbing to number one and staying at that position for seven non-consecutive weeks; it remained on the chart as a whole for 66 weeks. &quot;Bookends&quot; received such heavy orders weeks in advance of its release that Columbia was able to apply for award certification before copies left the warehouse, a fact it touted in magazine ads. The album became the duo&#x27;s best-selling to date, helped by the attention for the &quot;Graduate&quot; soundtrack ten weeks earlier, creating an initial combined sales figure of over five million units.

Davis had predicted this, and suggested raising the list price of &quot;Bookends&quot; by one dollar to $5.79, above the then standard retail price, to compensate for a large poster included in vinyl copies. Simon scoffed and viewed it as charging a premium on &quot;what was sure to be that year&#x27;s best-selling Columbia album&quot;. According to biographer Marc Eliot, Davis was &quot;offended by what he perceived as their lack of gratitude for what he believed was his role in turning them into superstars&quot;. Rather than implement Davis&#x27; plan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel signed a contract extension with Columbia that guaranteed them a higher royalty rate. At the 1969 Grammy Awards, the lead single &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; became the first rock and roll song to receive Record of the Year, and also won Best Contemporary Pop Performance by a Duo or Group.

===1969–1970: Growing apart and final album===
&quot;Bookends&quot;, alongside the &quot;Graduate&quot; soundtrack, made Simon &amp; Garfunkel the biggest rock duo in the world. Simon was approached by producers to write music for films or license songs; he turned down Franco Zeffirelli, who was preparing to film &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;, and John Schlesinger, who was preparing to film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. In addition to Hollywood proposals, Simon declined a request by producers from the Broadway show &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot; (starring Simon&#x27;s friend Dustin Hoffman, also the lead in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;). He collaborated briefly with Leonard Bernstein on a sacred mass before withdrawing from the project due to &quot;finding it perhaps too far afield from his comfort zone&quot;.

Garfunkel began acting, and played Captain Nately in the Nichols film &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970). Simon was to play the character of Dunbar, but the screenwriter, Buck Henry, felt the film was already crowded with characters and wrote Simon&#x27;s part out. Filming began in January 1969 and lasted about eight months, longer than expected. The production endangered the duo&#x27;s relationship; Simon had completed no new songs, and the duo planned to collaborate after filming ended. Simon wrote in his memoir: &quot;I think if Artie had become a big movie star he would have left. Instead of just being the guy who sang Paul Simon songs, he could be Art Garfunkel, a big star all by himself … This made me think about how I could still be the guy who wrote songs and sing them. I didn’t need Artie.&quot;

Following the end of filming in October, the first performance of what was planned to be the last Simon &amp; Garfunkel tour took place in Ames, Iowa. The US leg ended in the sold-out Carnegie Hall on November 27. Meanwhile, the duo, working with director Charles Grodin, produced an hourlong CBS special, &quot;Songs of America&quot;, a mixture of scenes featuring notable political events and leaders concerning the US, such as the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy&#x27;s funeral procession, Cesar Chavez and the Poor People&#x27;s March. It was broadcast only once, due to tension at the network regarding its content. The BBC said that &quot;one million viewers responded by turning the dial and watching the figure skating on NBC instead.&quot;

&quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s final studio album, was released in January 1970 and charted in over 11 countries, topping the charts in 10, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LP&#x27;s chart in the US and the UK Albums Chart. It was the best-selling album in 1970, 1971 and 1972 and was at that time the best-selling album of all time. It was also CBS Records&#x27; best-selling album before the release of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1982. The album topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 10 weeks and stayed in the charts for 85 weeks. In the United Kingdom, the album topped the charts for 35 weeks, and spent 285 weeks in the top 100, from 1970 to 1975. It has since sold over 25 million copies worldwide. &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, the lead single, reached number one in five countries and became the duo&#x27;s biggest seller. The song has been covered by over 50 artists, including Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Jim Nabors, Charlotte Church, Maynard Ferguson, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, Michael W. Smith, Josh Groban, and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. &quot;Cecilia&quot;, the follow-up, reached number four in the US, and &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; hit number 18. A brief British tour followed the album release, and the duo&#x27;s last concert as Simon &amp; Garfunkel took place at Forest Hills Stadium. In 1971, the album won six awards at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year.

===1971–1990: Breakup, rifts, and reunions===
The recording of &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; was difficult, and Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s relationship had deteriorated. &quot;At that point, I just wanted out,&quot; Simon later said. At the urging of his wife, Peggy Harper, Simon called Davis to confirm the duo&#x27;s breakup. For the next few years, they spoke only two or three times a year.

In the 1970s, the duo reunited several times. Their first reunion was Together for McGovern, a benefit concert for presidential candidate George McGovern at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in June 1972. In 1975, they reconciled when they visited a recording session with John Lennon and Harry Nilsson. For the rest of the year, they attempted to make the reunion work, but their collaboration only yielded one song, &quot;My Little Town&quot;, that was featured on Simon&#x27;s &quot;Still Crazy After All These Years&quot; and Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Breakaway&quot;, both released in 1975. That year, Garfunkel joined Simon for a medley of three songs on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; guest-hosted by Simon. In 1977, Garfunkel joined Simon for a brief performance of their songs on &quot;The Paul Simon Special&quot;, and later that year they recorded a cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;(What a) Wonderful World&quot; with James Taylor. Old tensions appeared to dissipate upon Garfunkel&#x27;s return to New York in 1978, when the duo began interacting more often. On May 1, 1978, Simon joined Garfunkel for a concert held at Carnegie Hall to benefit the hearing disabled.
By 1980, the duo&#x27;s solo careers were not doing well. To help boost morale for New Yorkers during a serious economic decline in the city, concert promoter Ron Delsener suggested a free concert in Central Park. Delsener contacted Simon with the idea of a Simon &amp; Garfunkel reunion, and once Garfunkel had agreed, plans were made. The concert, held on September 19, 1981, attracted more than 500,000 people, at that time the largest ever concert attendance. Warner Bros. Records released a live album of the show, &quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot;, which went double platinum in the US. A 90-minute recording of the concert was sold to Home Box Office (HBO) for over $1 million. The concert created a renewed interest in Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s work. They had several &quot;heart-to-heart talks&quot;, attempting to put their disagreements behind them. The duo undertook a world tour beginning in May 1982, but their relationship grew contentious; for the majority of the tour, they did not speak to one another.

Warner Bros. pushed for the duo to extend the tour and release a new studio album. Simon had new material ready, and, according to Simon, &quot;Artie made a persuasive case that he could make it into a natural duo record.&quot; They quarreled again as Garfunkel refused to learn the songs in the studio and would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits, despite Simon&#x27;s requests. Instead, the material became Simon&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;. A spokesperson said: &quot;Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life that it had to be his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I&#x27;m sure there will be other projects that they will work on together.&quot; Another rift opened when the lengthy recording of Simon&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Graceland&quot; prevented Garfunkel from working with engineer Roy Halee on his Christmas album &quot;The Animals&#x27; Christmas&quot; (1985). In 1986, Simon said he and Garfunkel remained friends and got on well, &quot;like when we were 10 years old&quot;, when they were not working together.

===1990–2010: Awards and final tour===
In 1990, Simon and Garfunkel were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked Simon, calling him &quot;the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me&quot;; Simon responded, &quot;Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it&#x27;s true, I have enriched his life quite a bit.&quot; After performing three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991, Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, released as a live album, &quot;Paul Simon&#x27;s Concert in the Park,&quot; a few months later. He declined an offer from Garfunkel to perform with him at the park.
By 1993, the relationship had thawed, and Simon invited Garfunkel on an international tour. Following a sold-out 21-date run at the Paramount Theater in New York and an appearance at that year&#x27;s Bridge School Benefit in California, they toured the Far East. They became acrimonious again for the rest of the decade. Simon thanked Garfunkel at his 2001 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist: &quot;I regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that some day before we die we will make peace with each other,&quot; adding after a pause, &quot;No rush.&quot;

In 2003, Simon and Garfunkel received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, for which the promoters convinced them to open with a performance of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. The performance was satisfying for both, and they planned a full-scale reunion tour. The Old Friends tour began in October 2003 and played to sold-out audiences across the United States for 40 dates until mid-December, earning an estimated $123 million. A second US leg commenced in June 2004, consisting of 20 cities. Following a 12-city run in Europe in 2004, they ended their nine-month tour with a free concert along Via dei Fori Imperiali, in front of the Colosseum in Rome, on July 31, 2004. It attracted 600,000 fans, more than their Concert in Central Park. In 2005, Simon and Garfunkel performed three songs for a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert in Madison Square Garden, including a performance with singer Aaron Neville.
In February 2009, Simon and Garfunkel reunited for three songs during Simon&#x27;s two-night engagement at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre. This led to a reunion tour of Asia and Australia in June and July 2009. On October 29, 2009, they performed five songs at the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Concert at Madison Square Garden. In January 2010, Garfunkel developed vocal problems following damage to his vocal cords as the result of an incident in which he had briefly choked on a piece of lobster. Their headlining set several months later at the 2010 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival was difficult for Garfunkel. &quot;I was terrible, and crazy nervous. I leaned on Paul Simon and the affection of the crowd,&quot; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; several years later. Garfunkel was diagnosed with vocal cord paresis, and the remaining tour dates were canceled. They reunited two months later to perform &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; at an American Film Institute Life Achievement Award tribute to director Mike Nichols, in what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested might have been their last performance together. Garfunkel&#x27;s manager, John Scher, informed Simon&#x27;s camp that Garfunkel would be ready within a year, which did not happen, damaging relations between the two. Simon continued to publicly wish Garfunkel better health and praised his &quot;angelic&quot; voice. Garfunkel regained his vocal strength over the course of the next four years, performing shows in a Harlem theater and to underground audiences.

In 2014, Garfunkel told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he believed he and Simon would tour again, but said: &quot;I know that audiences all over the world like Simon and Garfunkel. I&#x27;m with them. But I don&#x27;t think Paul Simon&#x27;s with them.&quot; In a 2015 interview with Nigel Farndale for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Garfunkel said: &quot;How can you walk away from this lucky place on top of the world, Paul? What&#x27;s going on with you, you idiot? How could you let that go, jerk?&quot; In 2016, Simon denied that another reunion could happen as he did not enjoy performing under their fractious relationship. In February 2018, Simon announced his retirement from touring. In November 2024, Garfunkel said he had been a &quot;fool&quot; and that he and Simon had reconciled as friends.

==Musical style==
Over the course of their career, Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s music gradually moved from a basic folk rock sound to incorporate more experimental elements for the time, including Latin and gospel music. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, their music struck a chord among lonely, alienated young adults near the end of the 1960s. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, though Simon &amp; Garfunkel were a highly regarded folk act &quot;distinguished by their intuitive harmonies and Paul Simon&#x27;s articulate songwriting&quot;, they were more conservative than the folk music revivalists of Greenwich Village. By the late 1960s, they had become the &quot;folk establishment ... primarily unthreatening and accessible, which forty years later makes them an ideal gateway act to the weirder, harsher, more complex folkies of the 60s counterculture&quot;. Their later albums explored more ambitious production techniques and incorporated elements of gospel, rock, R&amp;B, and classical, revealing a &quot;voracious musical vocabulary&quot;.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Simon &amp; Garfunkel received criticism at the height of their success. In 1968, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Arthur Schmidt described their music as &quot;questionable ... it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Robert Shelton said that the duo had &quot;a kind of Mickey Mouse, timid, contrived&quot; approach. According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, their clean sound and muted lyricism &quot;cost them some hipness points during the psychedelic era ... the pair inhabited the more polished end of the folk-rock spectrum and was sometimes criticized for a certain collegiate sterility.&quot; He noted that some critics regard Simon&#x27;s later solo work as superior to Simon &amp; Garfunkel.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; at number 51, &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; at number 201, &quot;Bookends&quot; at number 233, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; at number 293. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; at number 47, &quot;The Boxer&quot; at number 105, and &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; at number 156.

====1993 SPDR innovation====
In 1993, the company created the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF, the first exchange-traded fund (ETF), and is now one of the largest ETF providers worldwide. Trading on SPDR began January 29, 1993.

===State Street Global Markets===
Global Markets is State Street&#x27;s securities business that offers research, trading, and securities lending services for foreign exchange, equities, fixed income, and derivatives. To avoid a conflict of interest, the company does not run proprietary trading books. Global Markets maintains trading desks in Boston, Hong Kong, London, Singapore, Sydney, Toronto, Tokyo and São Paulo .

==History==
The company traces its roots to Union Bank, which received a charter in 1792 from Massachusetts Governor John Hancock. It was the third bank to be chartered in Boston and its office was at the corner of State and Exchange Streets. In 1865, Union Bank received a national charter and became the National Union Bank of Boston. The bank later built a headquarters at Washington and State streets.

State Street Deposit &amp; Trust Co opened in July 1891. The name was shortened to State Street Trust Company in 1897. It became the custodian of the first U.S. mutual fund in 1924, the Massachusetts Investors Trust (now MFS Investment Management).

===20th century===
State Street and National Union merged in October 1925. The merged bank took the State Street name, but National Union was the nominal survivor, and it operated under National Union&#x27;s charter, thus giving the current entity its rank among the oldest banks in the United States.

The company merged with Second National Bank in 1955 and with the Rockland-Atlas National Bank in 1961.

In 1966, the company completed construction of the State Street Bank Building, a new headquarters building, the first high-rise office tower in downtown Boston.

In 1972, the company opened its first international office in Munich.

In 1973, as a 50/50 joint venture with DST Systems, the company formed Boston Financial Data Services, a provider of shareholder record-keeping, intermediary and investor services, and regulatory compliance. More than 100 top staff from IBM were hired by State Street as it set about implementing IBM mainframe computer systems.

In 1975, William Edgerly became president and chief executive officer of the bank and shifted the company&#x27;s strategy from commercial banking to investments and securities processing.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the company opened offices in Montreal, Toronto, Dublin, London, Paris, Dubai, Sydney, Wellington, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.

By 1992, most of State Street&#x27;s revenue came from fees for holding securities, settling trades, keeping records, and performing accounting. In 1994, the company formed State Street Global Advisors, a global asset management business.

In 1995, State Street acquired Investors Fiduciary Trust of Kansas City for $162 million from DST Systems and Kemper Financial Services. In 1996, Bank of New York acquired the unit investment trust servicing business of Investors Fiduciary Trust Co., Kansas City, Mo.

In 1997, State Street setup its office in Singapore.

In 1999, State Street sold its retail and commercial banking businesses to Citizens Financial Group.

===21st century===
In 1990, State Street Bank Luxembourg was founded, and is the largest player in the country&#x27;s fund industry by assets.

In 2003, the company acquired the securities services division of Deutsche Bank for $1.5 billion. The company also sold its corporate trust business to U.S. Bancorp for $725 million. Also in 2003, State Street sold its private asset management business to U.S. Trust.

In July 2007, the company acquired Investors Bank &amp; Trust for $4.5 billion.

In October 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $2 billion in the company as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in July 2009, the company became the first major financial firm to repay the Treasury.

In 2010, the company acquired Mourant International Finance Administration. It also acquired the securities services group of Intesa Sanpaolo for $1.87 billion. In December 2010, the company announced that it would be retrenching 5% of its workforce and effectively reducing the hourly wages of remaining employees by 10% via increased standard work hours.

In November 2011, the company was named as amongst the world&#x27;s 29 systemic banks.

In 2012, the company acquired Goldman Sachs Administration Services, a hedge fund administrator, for $550 million.

In November 2014, the company sold SSARIS Advisors, its hedge fund unit, to senior management.

In 2016, State Street launched a program called Beacon, focused on cutting costs and improving reporting technology. Their main focus was to shrink their US workforce in order to bolster profits in excess of $2.5 billion (2018 figures). Also in 2016, the company acquired the asset management business of General Electric.

In 2017, the company announced that Jay Hooley, the chief executive officer of the company, would retire, to be succeeded by Ronald P. O’Hanley, then vice chairman, president and CEO of State Street Global Advisors.

In 2018, State Street completed its acquisition of Charles River Development, a Burlington, Massachusetts provider of investment management software. The deal closed October 1, 2018, at a cost of approximately $2.6 billion that will be financed by the suspension of share repurchases and the issuing of common and preferred equity. News of the acquisition led to a drop in State Street shares of nearly 10% with share prices remaining flat since the purchase.

In January 2019, State Street announced that it planned to lay off 1,500 employees, increasing the number to 2,300 in July. During that period, the company shifted their workforce from the United States to countries like China, India and Poland and operated under a hiring freeze. The increased overseas hiring resulted in a net gain of employment of over 3,000.

In September 2021, State Street agreed to buy Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.&#x27;s investor-services business for $3.5 billion in cash. Following continued scrutiny in receiving regulatory approvals, the deal was mutually agreed to be dropped in November 2022.

==Controversies==
===Currency trade fraud===
In 2009, California alleged on behalf of its pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS that State Street had committed fraud on currency trades handled by the custodian bank.

===Non-disclosure of short position===
On February 28, 2012, State Street Global Advisors entered into a consent order with the Massachusetts Securities Division. The Division was investigating the firm&#x27;s role as the investment manager of a $1.65 billion (USD) hybrid collateralized debt obligation. The investigation resulted in a fine of $5 million (USD) for the non-disclosure of certain initial investors taking a short position on portions of the CDO.

===Shareholder complaints===
During the May 2012 annual shareholders meeting, chairman and chief executive Jay Hooley was shouted down on numerous occasions by protesters in relation to the outsourcing and other grievances.

===Undisclosed commissions===
On January 18, 2017, State Street agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve U.S. investigations into what prosecutors said was a scheme to defraud six clients through secret commissions on billions of dollars of trades.

===&quot;Fearless Girl&quot; statue===
In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue called &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; by Kristen Visbal and placed it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon &quot;Charging Bull&quot;. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership. While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as &quot;corporate feminism&quot; that violated their own feminist principles. In October 2017, the company paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit charging that it had paid certain female and black executives less than their male and white peers.

=== Climate change ===
State Street announced in January 2020 that State Street Global Advisors will vote against directors of companies in major stock indices that do not meet targets for environmental, social, and governance changes. According to Morningstar Proxy Data, State Street, &quot;supported a majority of the climate-related disclosure requests that shareholders placed on the ballot,&quot; during the 2020 proxy season.

=== Investments in China ===
In February 2025, a group of 17 U.S. state attorneys general criticized State Street for making improper or inadequate disclosures about investments in China.

<text>Spanish () or Castilian() is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family that evolved from the Vulgar Latin spoken on the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today, it is a global language with about 500 million native speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain, and about 600 million speakers including second language speakers. Spanish is the official language of 20 countries, as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Spanish is the world&#x27;s second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese; the world&#x27;s fourth-most spoken language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the world&#x27;s most widely spoken Romance language. The country with the largest population of native speakers is Mexico.

Spanish is part of the Ibero-Romance language group, in which the language is also known as &quot;Castilian&quot; (). The group evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century, and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Spanish colonialism in the early modern period spurred the introduction of the language to overseas locations, most notably to the Americas.

As a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin. Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is Latin in origin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek. Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world. Spanish is well represented in the humanities and social sciences. Spanish is also the third most used language on the internet by number of users after English and Chinese and the second most used language by number of websites after English.

Spanish is used as an official language by many international organizations, including the United Nations, European Union, Organization of American States, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, African Union, among others.
== Name of the language and etymology ==
=== Name of the language ===
In Spain and some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called not only but also (Castilian), the language from the Kingdom of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque, Asturian, Catalan/Valencian, Aragonese, Occitan and other minor languages.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term to define the official language of the whole of Spain, in contrast to (lit. &quot;the other Spanish languages&quot;). Article III reads as follows:

The Royal Spanish Academy (), on the other hand, currently uses the term in its publications. However, from 1713 to 1923, it called the language .

The (a language guide published by the Royal Spanish Academy) states that, although the Royal Spanish Academy prefers to use the term in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms— and —are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.

===Etymology===
The term is related to Castile ( or archaically ), the kingdom where the language was originally spoken. The name &quot;Castile&quot;, in turn, is usually assumed to be derived from (&#x27;castle&#x27;).

In the Middle Ages, the language spoken in Castile was generically referred to as and later also as . Later in the period, it gained geographical specification as (, ), , and ultimately simply as (noun).

Different etymologies have been suggested for the term (Spanish). According to the Royal Spanish Academy, derives from the Occitan word and that, in turn, derives from the Vulgar Latin * (&#x27;of Hispania&#x27;). Hispania was the Roman name for the entire Iberian Peninsula.

There are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal suggested that the classic or took the suffix from Vulgar Latin, as happened with other words such as (Breton) or (Saxon).

== History ==


Like the other Romance languages, the Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC. Several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)—some distantly related to Latin as Indo-European languages, and some that are not related at all—were previously spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Proto-Basque, Iberian, Lusitanian, Celtiberian and Gallaecian.

The first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era, the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages—Mozarabic (Andalusi Romance), Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Catalan/Valencian, Portuguese, Galician, Occitan, and later, French and Italian. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from Arabic, as well as a minor influence from the Germanic Gothic language through the period of Visigoth rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both Classical Latin and Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin in use at that time.

According to the theories of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of Burgos, and this dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century. In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the , and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, much of it indirectly, through the Romance Mozarabic dialects (some 4,000 Arabic-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today). The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of Toledo, in the 13th to 16th centuries, and Madrid, from the 1570s.

The development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin &gt; Spanish ). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short and —which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:


Spanish is marked by palatalization of the Latin double consonants (geminates) and (thus Latin
 &gt; Spanish , and Latin &gt; Spanish

The consonant written or in Latin and pronounced in Classical Latin had probably &quot;fortified&quot; to a bilabial fricative in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written &quot;b&quot; (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic and .

Typical of Spanish (as also of neighboring Gascon extending as far north as the Gironde estuary, and found in a small area of Calabria), attributed by some scholars to a Basque substratum was the mutation of Latin initial into whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The , still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects, it is still aspirated in some words. Because of borrowings from Latin and neighboring Romance languages, there are many -/- doublets in modern Spanish: and (both Spanish for &quot;Ferdinand&quot;), and (both Spanish for &quot;smith&quot;), and (both Spanish for &quot;iron&quot;), and and (both words pertaining to depth in Spanish, though means &quot;bottom&quot;, while means &quot;deep&quot;); additionally, (&quot;to make&quot;) is cognate to the root word of (&quot;to satisfy&quot;), and (&quot;made&quot;) is similarly cognate to the root word of (&quot;satisfied&quot;).

Compare the examples in the following table:

Some consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the , which resulted in the distinctive velar pronunciation of the letter and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental (&quot;th-sound&quot;) for the letter (and for before or ). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.

The , written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language. According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire. In his introduction to the grammar, dated 18 August 1492, Nebrija wrote that &quot;... language was always the companion of empire.&quot;

From the 16th century onwards, the language was taken to the Spanish-discovered America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes, author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called (&quot;the language of Cervantes&quot;).

In the 20th century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City. For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see Influences on the Spanish language.

== Geographical distribution ==

Spanish is the primary language in 20 countries worldwide. As of 2023, it is estimated that about 486 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it the second most spoken language by number of native speakers. An additional 75 million speak Spanish as a second or foreign language, making it the fourth most spoken language in the world overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi with a total number of 538 million speakers. Spanish is also the third most used language on the Internet, after English and Chinese.

=== Europe ===

Spanish is the official language of Spain. Upon the emergence of the Castilian Crown as the dominant power in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the Middle Ages, the Romance vernacular associated with this polity became increasingly used in instances of prestige and influence, and the distinction between &quot;Castilian&quot; and &quot;Spanish&quot; started to become blurred. Hard policies imposing the language&#x27;s hegemony in an intensely centralising Spanish state were established from the 18th century onward.

Other European territories in which it is also widely spoken include Gibraltar and Andorra.

Spanish is also spoken by immigrant communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. Spanish is an official language of the European Union.

=== Americas ===
==== Hispanic America ====

Today, the majority of the Spanish speakers live in Hispanic America. Nationally, Spanish is the official language—either &quot;de facto&quot; or &quot;de jure&quot;—of Argentina, Bolivia (co-official with 36 indigenous languages), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (co-official with 63 indigenous languages), Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay (co-official with Guaraní), Peru (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, and &quot;the other indigenous languages&quot;), Puerto Rico (co-official with English), Uruguay, and Venezuela.

====United States====

Spanish language has a long history in the territory of the current-day United States dating back to the 16th century. In the wake of the 1848 Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty, hundreds of thousands of Spanish speakers became a minoritized community in the United States. The 20th century saw further massive growth of Spanish speakers in areas where they had been hitherto scarce.

According to the 2020 census, over 60 million people of the U.S. population were of Hispanic or Hispanic American by origin. In turn, 41.8 million people in the United States aged five or older speak Spanish at home, or about 13% of the population. Spanish predominates in the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico, where it is also an official language along with English.

Spanish is by far the most common second language in the country, with over 50 million total speakers if non-native or second-language speakers are included. While English is the de facto national language of the country, Spanish is often used in public services and notices at the federal and state levels. Spanish is also used in administration in the state of New Mexico. The language has a strong influence in major metropolitan areas such as those of Los Angeles, Miami, San Antonio, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Tucson and Phoenix of the Arizona Sun Corridor, as well as more recently, Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, Raleigh and Baltimore-Washington, D.C. due to 20th- and 21st-century immigration.

====Rest of the Americas====
Although Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize (known until 1973 as British Honduras) where English is the sole official language, according to the 2022 census, 54% of the total population are able to speak the language.

Due to its proximity to Spanish-speaking countries and small existing native Spanish speaking minority, Trinidad and Tobago has implemented Spanish language teaching into its education system. The Trinidadian and Tobagonian government launched the &quot;Spanish as a First Foreign Language&quot; (SAFFL) initiative in March 2005. 

Spanish has historically had a significant presence on the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao (ABC Islands) throughout the centuries and in present times. The majority of the populations of each island (especially Aruba) speaking Spanish at varying although often high degrees of fluency. The local language Papiamentu (Papiamento on Aruba) is heavily influenced by Venezuelan Spanish.

In addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish-speaking countries, the creation of Mercosur in the early 1990s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil. In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil. In September 2016 this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff. In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay, a mixed language known as Portuñol is spoken.

=== Africa ===
==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
Equatorial Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country located entirely in Africa, with the language introduced during the Spanish colonial period. Enshrined in the constitution as an official language (alongside French and Portuguese), Spanish features prominently in the Equatoguinean education system and is the primary language used in government and business. Whereas it is not the mother tongue of virtually any of its speakers, the vast majority of the population is proficient in Spanish. The Instituto Cervantes estimates that 87.7% of the population is fluent in Spanish. The proportion of proficient Spanish speakers in Equatorial Guinea exceeds the proportion of proficient speakers in other West and Central African nations of their respective colonial languages.

Spanish is spoken by very small communities in Angola due to Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned for their country&#x27;s independence.

==== North Africa and Macaronesia ====
Spanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in Africa, namely the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean some off the northwest of the African mainland. The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the 15th century, and, in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns, it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas, which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish. The Spanish spoken in North Africa by native bilingual speakers of Arabic or Berber who also speak Spanish as a second language features characteristics involving the variability of the vowel system.

While far from its heyday during the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, the Spanish language has some presence in northern Morocco, stemming for example from the availability of certain Spanish-language media. According to a 2012 survey by Morocco&#x27;s Royal Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), penetration of Spanish in Morocco reaches 4.6% of the population. Many northern Moroccans have rudimentary knowledge of Spanish, with Spanish being particularly significant in areas adjacent to Ceuta and Melilla. Spanish also has a presence in the education system of the country (through either selected education centers implementing Spain&#x27;s education system, primarily located in the North, or the availability of Spanish as foreign language subject in secondary education).

In Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, a primarily Hassaniya Arabic-speaking territory, Spanish was officially spoken as the language of the colonial administration during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Today, Spanish is present in the partially-recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as its secondary official language, and in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria), where the Spanish language is still taught as a second language, largely by Cuban educators. The number of Spanish speakers is unknown.

Spanish is also an official language of the African Union.

=== Asia ===

Spanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish administration in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During Spanish colonization, it was the language of government, trade, and education, and was spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos (&quot;Ilustrados&quot;). Despite a public education system set up by the colonial government, by the end of Spanish rule in 1898, only about 10% of the population had knowledge of Spanish, mostly those of Spanish descent or elite standing.
Spanish continued to be official and used in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration after the Spanish–American War but was eventually replaced by English as the primary language of administration and education by the 1920s. Nevertheless, despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines upon independence in 1946, alongside English and Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog.

Spanish was briefly removed from official status in 1973 but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later. It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in 1987, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language. Additionally, the constitution, in its Article XIV, stipulates that the Government shall provide the people of the Philippines with a Spanish-language translation of the country&#x27;s constitution. In recent years changing attitudes among non-Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language, and starting in 2009 Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools, becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system, with over 7,000 students studying the language in the 2021–2022 school year alone. The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language&#x27;s economic prospects. Today, while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around 400,000, or under 0.5% of the population, a new generation of Spanish speakers in the Philippines has likewise emerged, though speaker estimates vary widely.

Aside from standard Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language called Chavacano developed in the southern Philippines. However, it is not mutually intelligible with Spanish. The number of Chavacano-speakers was estimated at 1.2 million in 1996. The local languages of the Philippines also retain significant Spanish influence, with many words derived from Mexican Spanish, owing to the administration of the islands by Spain through New Spain until 1821, until direct governance from Madrid afterwards to 1898.

===Oceania===

Spanish is the official and most spoken language on Easter Island, which is geographically part of Polynesia in Oceania and politically part of Chile. However, Easter Island&#x27;s traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language.

As a legacy of comprising the former Spanish East Indies, Spanish loan words are present in the local languages of Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands and Micronesia.

In addition, in Australia and New Zealand, there are native Spanish communities, resulting from emigration from Spanish-speaking countries (mainly from the Southern Cone).

=== Spanish speakers by country ===
20 countries and one United States territory speak Spanish officially, and the language has a significant unofficial presence in the rest of the United States along with Andorra, Belize and the territory of Gibraltar.
== Grammar ==

Most of the grammatical and typological features of Spanish are shared with the other Romance languages. Spanish is a fusional language. The noun and adjective systems exhibit two genders and two numbers. In addition, articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty conjugated forms per verb, with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 verboid forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. The indicative mood is the unmarked one, while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination, and is commonly paired with the conditional, which is a mood used to express &quot;would&quot; (as in, &quot;I would eat if I had food&quot;); the imperative is a mood to express a command, commonly a one word phrase – &quot;¡Di!&quot; (&quot;Talk!&quot;).

Verbs express T-V distinction by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.)

Spanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually—though not always—places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages.

Spanish is classified as a subject–verb–object language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by topicalization and focus. It is a &quot;pro-drop&quot;, or &quot;null-subject&quot; language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a &quot;verb-framed&quot; language, meaning that the &quot;direction&quot; of motion is expressed in the verb while the &quot;mode&quot; of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. &quot;subir corriendo&quot; or &quot;salir volando&quot;; the respective English equivalents of these examples—&#x27;to run up&#x27; and &#x27;to fly out&#x27;—show that English is, by contrast, &quot;satellite-framed&quot;, with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).

== Phonology ==

The Spanish phonological system evolved from that of Vulgar Latin. Its development exhibits some traits in common with other Western Romance languages, others with the neighboring Hispanic varieties—especially Leonese and Aragonese—as well as other features unique to Spanish. Spanish is alone among its immediate neighbors in having undergone frequent aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial sound (e.g. Cast. vs. Leon. and Arag. ). The Latin initial consonant sequences , , and in Spanish typically merge as (originally pronounced ), while in Aragonese they are preserved in most dialects, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including , , and . Where Latin had before a vowel (e.g. ) or the ending , (e.g. ), Old Spanish produced , that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative (, ), whereas neighboring languages have the palatal lateral (e.g. Portuguese , ; Catalan , ).

=== Segmental phonology ===

The Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes (, , , , ) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels and to glides— and respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels and , determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs and respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.

The Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate ; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents—, , , and sometimes —which alternate between approximant and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the &quot;tapped&quot; and &quot;trilled&quot; &quot;r&quot;-sounds (single and double in orthography).

In the following table of consonant phonemes, is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with in the merger called . Similarly, is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from (see ), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.

The phoneme is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes , , , and appears to the right of a &quot;pair&quot; of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the &quot;voiceless&quot; phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the &quot;voiced&quot; ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.

=== Prosody ===
Spanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language: each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.

Spanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.) and rising tone for yes/no questions. There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus, the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.

Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-to-last or earlier syllables. Stress tends to occur as follows:
* in words that end with a monophthong, on the penultimate syllable
* when the word ends in a diphthong, on the final syllable.
* in words that end with a consonant, on the last syllable, with the exception of two grammatical endings: , for third-person-plural of verbs, and , for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs. However, even though a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with are also stressed on the penult (, , ), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with are stressed on their last syllable (, , , ).
* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached (e.g. &#x27;saving them for him/her/them/you&#x27;).

In addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as (&#x27;sheet&#x27;) and (&#x27;savannah&#x27;); (&#x27;boundary&#x27;), (&#x27;he/she limits&#x27;) and (&#x27;I limited&#x27;); (&#x27;liquid&#x27;), (&#x27;I sell off&#x27;) and (&#x27;he/she sold off&#x27;).

The orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is , , or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (See Spanish orthography.)

== Speaker population ==

Spanish is the official, or national language in 18 countries and one territory in the Americas, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea. With a population of over 410 million, Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers, of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country. In the European Union, Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language. Additionally, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students. In 2015, it was estimated that over 50 million Americans spoke Spanish, about 41 million of whom were native speakers. With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades.

== Dialectal variation ==
While being mutually intelligible, there are important variations (phonological, grammatical, and lexical) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.

The national variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world&#x27;s Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.

In Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. The speech from the educated classes of Madrid is the standard variety for use on radio and television in Spain and it is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish. Central (European) Spanish speech patterns have been noted to be in the process of merging with more innovative southern varieties (including Eastern Andalusian and Murcian), as an emerging interdialectal levelled &quot;koine&quot; buffered between the Madrid&#x27;s traditional national standard and the Seville speech trends.

=== Phonology ===

The four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme , (2) the debuccalization of syllable-final , (3) the sound of the spelled , (4) and the phoneme .
* The phoneme (spelled before or and spelled elsewhere), a voiceless dental fricative as in English &quot;thing&quot;, is maintained by a majority of Spain&#x27;s population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Americas), does not exist and occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called in Spanish, while the merger is generally called (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as ) or, occasionally, (referring to its interdental realization, , in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled before or , and spelled is always pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant.
* The debuccalization (pronunciation as , or loss) of syllable-final is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called &quot;aspiration&quot; in English, and in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final is pronounced as voiceless &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; sibilant or as a voiceless dental sibilant in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.
* The sound that corresponds to the letter is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a voiceless &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; sibilant (also described acoustically as &quot;grave&quot; and articulatorily as &quot;retracted&quot;), with a weak &quot;hushing&quot; sound reminiscent of fricatives. In Andalusia, Canary Islands and most of Hispanic America (except in the Paisa region of Colombia) it is pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant , much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. 
* The phoneme , spelled , a palatal lateral consonant that can be approximated by the sound of the of English &quot;million&quot;, tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in the highland areas of South America, as well as in Paraguay and lowland Bolivia. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish speakers, it is merged with (&quot;curly-tail &quot;j&quot;&quot;), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English (&quot;yod&quot;) as in &quot;yacht&quot; and spelled in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled and the spelled is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called in Spanish. In Rioplatense Spanish, the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced (as in English &quot;measure&quot; or the French ) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region (), or voiceless (as in the French or Portuguese ) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ().

=== Morphology ===
The main morphological variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns, especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.

==== Voseo ====

Virtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular and thus have two different pronouns meaning &quot;you&quot;: in the formal and either or in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of or varying from one dialect to another. The use of and its verb forms is called . In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with , , and denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.

In , is the subject form (, &quot;you say&quot;) and the form for the object of a preposition (, &quot;I am going with you&quot;), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with : (&quot;You know your friends respect you&quot;).

The verb forms of the general are the same as those used with except in the present tense (indicative and imperative) verbs. The forms for generally can be derived from those of (the traditional second-person familiar &quot;plural&quot;) by deleting the glide , or , where it appears in the ending: &gt; ; &gt; , () &gt; (), () &gt; ().
In Central American , the and forms differ in the present subjunctive as well:

In Chilean , almost all forms are distinct from the corresponding standard -forms.
The use of the pronoun with the verb forms of () is called &quot;pronominal &quot;. Conversely, the use of the verb forms of with the pronoun ( or ) is called &quot;verbal &quot;. In Chile, for example, verbal &quot;voseo&quot; is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun &quot;vos&quot;, which is usually reserved for highly informal situations.

===== Distribution in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas =====
Although is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, with wide differences in social consideration. Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of (the use of ) in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and coastal Ecuador.

 as a cultured form alternates with as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.

 exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.

Areas of generalized include Argentina, Nicaragua, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio and Valle del Cauca.

==== Ustedes ====

 functions as formal and informal second-person plural in all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and parts of Andalusia. It agrees with verbs in the 3rd person plural. Most of Spain maintains the formal/familiar distinction with and respectively. The use of with the second person plural is sometimes heard in Andalusia, but it is non-standard.

==== Usted ====
 is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (&quot;you, sir&quot;/&quot;you, ma&#x27;am&quot;). It is also used in a &quot;familiar&quot; context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of or . This usage is sometimes called in Spanish.

In Central America, especially in Honduras, is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

==== Third-person object pronouns ====
Most speakers use (and the prefers) the pronouns and for direct objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;), and for indirect objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning &quot;to him&quot;, &quot;to her&quot;, or &quot;to it&quot;). The usage is sometimes called &quot;etymological&quot;, as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.

A number of dialects (more common in Spain than in the Americas) use additional rules for the pronouns, such as animacy, or count noun vs. mass noun, rather than just direct vs. indirect object. The ways of using the pronouns in such varieties are called &quot;, &quot;, or &quot;&quot;, according to which respective pronoun, , , or , covers more than just the etymological usage ( as a direct object, or or as an indirect object).

=== Vocabulary ===
Some words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish , and (respectively, &#x27;butter&#x27;, &#x27;avocado&#x27;, &#x27;apricot&#x27;) correspond to (word used for lard in Peninsular Spanish), , and , respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except ), Paraguay, Peru (except and ), and Uruguay. In the healthcare context, an assessment of the Spanish translation of the QWB-SA identified some regional vocabulary choices and US-specific concepts, which cannot be successfully implemented in Spain without adaptation. 

== Vocabulary ==
Around 85% of everyday Spanish vocabulary is of Latin origin. Most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in Spanish comes from Latin. The Spanish words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly words of Latin origin. These words of Latin origin can be classified as heritage words, cultisms (learned borrowings) and semi-cultisms.

Most of the Spanish lexicon is made up of heritage lexicon. Heritage or directly inherited words are those whose presence in the spoken language has been continued since before the differentiation of the Romance languages. Heritage words are characterized by having undergone all the phonetic changes experienced by the language. This differentiates it from the cultisms and semi-cultisms that were no longer used in the spoken language and were later reintroduced for restricted uses. Because of this, cultisms generally have not experienced some of the phonetic changes and present a different form than they would have if they had been transmitted with heritage words.

In the philological tradition of Spanish, cultism is called a word whose morphology very strictly follows its Greek or Latin etymological origin, without undergoing the changes that the evolution of the Spanish language followed from its origin in Vulgar Latin. The same concept also exists in other Romance languages. Reintroduced into the language for cultural, literary or scientific considerations, cultism only adapts its form to the orthographic and phonological conventions derived from linguistic evolution, but ignores the transformations that the roots and morphemes underwent in the development of the Romance language.

In some cases, cultisms are used to introduce technical or specialized terminology that, present in the classical language, did not appear in the Romance language due to lack of use; This is the case of many of the literary, legal and philosophical terms of classical culture, such as &quot;ataraxia&quot; (from the Greek ἀταραξία, &quot;dispassion&quot;) or &quot;legislar&quot; (built from the Latin &quot;legislator&quot;). In other cases, they construct neologisms, such as the name of most scientific disciplines.

A semi-cultism is a word that did not evolve in the expected way, in the vernacular language (Romance language), unlike heritage words; its evolution is incomplete. Many times interrupted by cultural influences (ecclesiastical, legal, administrative, etc.). For the same reason, they maintain some features of the language of origin. &quot;Dios&quot; is a clear example of semi-cultism, where it came from the Latin &quot;Deus&quot;. It is a semi-cultism, because it maintains (without fully adapting to Castilianization, in this case) some characteristics of the Latin language—the ending in -s—, but, at the same time, it undergoes slight phonetic modifications (change of eu for io). &quot;Deus&quot; &gt; &quot;Dios&quot; (instead of remaining cultist: &quot;Deus&quot; &gt; &quot;*Deus&quot;, or becoming a heritage word: &quot;Deus&quot; &gt; &quot;*Dío&quot;). The Catholic Church influenced by stopping the natural evolution of this word, and, in this way, converted this word into a semi-cultism and unconsciously prevented it from becoming a heritage word.

Spanish vocabulary has been influenced by several languages. As in other European languages, Classical Greek words (Hellenisms) are abundant in the terminologies of several fields, including art, science, politics, nature, etc. Its vocabulary has also been influenced by Arabic, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula, with around 8% of its vocabulary having Arabic lexical roots. It has also been influenced by Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and other neighboring Ibero-Romance languages. Additionally, it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages, particularly other Romance languages such as French, Mozarabic, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Occitan, and Sardinian, as well as from Quechua, Nahuatl, and other indigenous languages of the Americas. In the 18th century, words taken from French referring above all to fashion, cooking and bureaucracy were added to the Spanish lexicon. In the 19th century, new loanwords were incorporated, especially from English and German, but also from Italian in areas related to music, particularly opera and cooking. In the 20th century, the pressure of English in the fields of technology, computing, science and sports was greatly accentuated.

In general, Latin America is more susceptible to loanwords from English or Anglicisms. For example: mouse (computer mouse) is used in Latin America, in Spain &quot;ratón&quot; is used. This happens largely due to closer contact with the United States. For its part, Spain is known by the use of Gallicisms or words taken from neighboring France (such as the Gallicism &quot;ordenador&quot; in European Spanish, in contrast to the Anglicism &quot;computador&quot; or &quot;computadora&quot; in American Spanish).

== Relation to other languages ==

Spanish is closely related to the other West Iberian Romance languages, including Asturian, Aragonese, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese. It is somewhat less similar, to varying degrees, from other members of the Romance language family. 

It is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Mutual intelligibility of the &quot;written&quot; Spanish and Portuguese languages is high, lexically and grammatically. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; gives estimates of the lexical similarity between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%, although phonologically the two languages are quite dissimilar. Italian on the other hand, is phonologically similar to Spanish, while sharing lower lexical and grammatical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or between Spanish and Romanian is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively. Comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.

The following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:


=== Judaeo-Spanish ===


Judaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and some old Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the 15th century. While in Portugal the conversion of Jews occurred earlier and the assimilation of New Christians was overwhelming, in Spain the Jews kept their language and identity. The relationship of Ladino and Spanish is therefore comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America. Judaeo-Spanish lacks the Native American vocabulary which was acquired by standard Spanish during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.

Judaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly &quot;olim&quot; (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to assimilation by modern Spanish.

A related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too, tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.

== Writing system ==
Spanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character (, representing the phoneme , a letter distinct from , although typographically composed of an with a tilde). Formerly the digraphs (, representing the phoneme ) and (, representing the phoneme or ), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph (, &#x27;strong r&#x27;, , &#x27;double r&#x27;, or simply ), which also represents a distinct phoneme , was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 and have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with are now alphabetically sorted between those with and , instead of following as they used to. The situation is similar for .

Thus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:

Since 2010, none of the digraphs () are considered letters by the Royal Spanish Academy.

The letters and are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (, etc.).

With the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including ) or with a vowel followed by or an ; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.

The acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare (&#x27;the&#x27;, masculine singular definite article) with (&#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;it&#x27;), or (&#x27;you&#x27;, object pronoun) with (&#x27;tea&#x27;), (preposition &#x27;of&#x27;) versus (&#x27;give&#x27; [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and (reflexive pronoun) versus (&#x27;I know&#x27; or imperative &#x27;be&#x27;).

The interrogative pronouns (, , , , etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives (, , , etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.

When is written between and a front vowel or , it indicates a &quot;hard g&quot; pronunciation. A diaeresis indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., , &#x27;stork&#x27;, is pronounced ; if it were written *, it would be pronounced *).

Interrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks ( and , respectively) and closed by the usual question and exclamation marks.

== Organizations ==
=== Royal Spanish Academy ===
The Royal Spanish Academy (), founded in 1713, together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.
Because of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.

=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===
The Association of Spanish Language Academies (, or ) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language. It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. It comprises the academies of 23 countries, ordered by date of academy foundation: Spain (1713), Colombia (1871), Ecuador (1874), Mexico (1875), El Salvador (1876), Venezuela (1883), Chile (1885), Peru (1887), Guatemala (1887), Costa Rica (1923), Philippines (1924), Panama (1926), Cuba (1926),
Paraguay (1927), Dominican Republic (1927), Bolivia (1927), Nicaragua (1928), Argentina (1931), Uruguay (1943), Honduras (1949), Puerto Rico (1955), United States (1973) and Equatorial Guinea (2016).
=== Cervantes Institute ===

The (&#x27;Cervantes Institute&#x27;) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branches in 45 countries, with 88 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The institute&#x27;s 2015 report &quot;El español, una lengua viva&quot; (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report &quot;El español en el mundo 2018&quot; (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.

<doc id="26826" wikidata="Q658" url="?curid=26826" title="Sodium">
<text>Sodium is a chemical element; it has symbol Na (from Neo-Latin ) and atomic number 11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive metal. Sodium is an alkali metal, being in group 1 of the periodic table. Its only stable isotope is 23Na. The free metal does not occur in nature and must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust and exists in numerous minerals such as feldspars, sodalite, and halite (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been leached by the action of water from the Earth&#x27;s minerals over eons, and thus sodium and chlorine are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.

Sodium was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1807 by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. Among many other useful sodium compounds, sodium hydroxide (lye) is used in soap manufacture, and sodium chloride (edible salt) is a de-icing agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.

Sodium is an essential element for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF osmotic pressure. Animal cells actively pump sodium ions out of the cells by means of the sodium–potassium pump, an enzyme complex embedded in the cell membrane, in order to maintain a roughly ten-times higher concentration of sodium ions outside the cell than inside. In nerve cells, the sudden flow of sodium ions into the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels enables transmission of a nerve impulse in a process called the action potential.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===

Sodium at standard temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air, forming sodium oxides. Bulk sodium is usually stored in oil or an inert gas. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife. It is a good conductor of electricity and heat. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium.

The melting (98 °C) and boiling (883 °C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.
In a flame test, sodium and its compounds glow yellow because the excited 3s electrons of sodium emit a photon when they fall from 3p to 3s; the wavelength of this photon corresponds to the D line at about 589.3 nm. Spin-orbit interactions involving the electron in the 3p orbital split the D line into two, at 589.0 and 589.6 nm; hyperfine structures involving both orbitals cause many more lines.

===Isotopes===

Twenty isotopes of sodium are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is created in the carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute.

Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in human blood to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.

==Chemistry==

Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, one more than the stable configuration of the noble gas neon. The first and second ionization energies are 495.8 kJ/mol and 4562 kJ/mol, respectively. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.

===Metallic sodium===
Metallic sodium is generally less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium. Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the standard reduction potential for the Na+/Na couple being −2.71 volts, though potassium and lithium have even more negative potentials.

===Salts and oxides===
Sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions and is viewed as a hard Lewis acid.
Most soaps are sodium salts of fatty acids. Sodium soaps have a higher melting temperature (and seem &quot;harder&quot;) than potassium soaps.

Like all the alkali metals, sodium reacts exothermically with water. The reaction produces caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) and flammable hydrogen gas. When burned in air, it forms primarily sodium peroxide with some sodium oxide.

===Aqueous solutions===
Sodium tends to form water-soluble compounds, such as halides, sulfates, nitrates, carboxylates and carbonates. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes [Na(H2O)&quot;n&quot;]+, where &quot;n&quot; = 4–8; with &quot;n&quot; = 6 indicated from X-ray diffraction data and computer simulations.

Direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water. An exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3), which is insoluble in cold water and decomposes in hot water. Because of the high solubility of its compounds, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic antisolvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35 g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. A crown ether such as 15-crown-5 may be used as a phase-transfer catalyst.

Sodium content of samples is determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or by potentiometry using ion-selective electrodes.

===Electrides and sodides===
Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the coordination complex [Na(NH3)6]+, with the positive charge counterbalanced by electrons as anions; cryptands permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands.

For example, 15-crown-5 has a high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2 Å, which is enough to fit the sodium ion (1.9 Å). Cryptands, like crown ethers and other ionophores, also have a high affinity for the sodium ion; derivatives of the alkalide Na− are obtainable by the addition of cryptands to solutions of sodium in ammonia via disproportionation.

===Organosodium compounds===
Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well-known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Sodium naphthalene, Na+[C10H8•]−, a strong reducing agent, forms upon mixing Na and naphthalene in ethereal solutions.

===Intermetallic compounds===
Sodium forms alloys with many metals, such as potassium, calcium, lead, and the group 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of the electrolytic production of sodium from a binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium, and the 1–2% of it dissolved in the sodium obtained from said mixtures can be precipitated by cooling to 120 °C and filtering.

In a liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolytically on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 are some of the known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.

==History==
Because of its importance in human health, salt has long been an important commodity. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of &quot;sodanum&quot; was used as a headache remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic &quot;suda&quot;, meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times.

Although sodium, sometimes called &quot;soda&quot;, had long been recognized in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide. In 1809, the German physicist and chemist Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert proposed the names &quot;Natronium&quot; for Humphry Davy&#x27;s &quot;sodium&quot; and &quot;Kalium&quot; for Davy&#x27;s &quot;potassium&quot;.

The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in his system of atomic symbols, and is an abbreviation of the element&#x27;s Neo-Latin name &quot;natrium&quot;, which refers to the Egyptian &quot;natron&quot;, a natural mineral salt mainly consisting of hydrated sodium carbonate. Natron historically had several important industrial and household uses, later eclipsed by other sodium compounds.

Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in Annalen der Physik und Chemie:

In a corner of our 60 m3 room farthest away from the apparatus, we exploded 3 mg of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.

==Occurrence==
The Earth&#x27;s crust contains 2.27% sodium, making it the sixth most abundant element on Earth and the fourth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium.Sodium&#x27;s estimated oceanic abundance is 10.8 grams per liter. Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate. In the universe, sodium is the 15th most abundant element with a 20,000 parts-per-billion abundance, making sodium 0.002% of the total atoms in the universe.

===Astronomical observations===
Atomic sodium has a very strong spectral line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium-vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the &quot;D&quot; line, although it is now known to actually be a group of closely spaced lines split by a fine and hyperfine structure.

The strength of the D line allows its detection in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly F-type and cooler. Many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground interstellar medium. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by stellar rotation.

Sodium has also been detected in numerous Solar System environments, including the exospheres of Mercury and the Moon, and numerous other bodies. Some comets have a sodium tail, which was first detected in observations of Comet Hale–Bopp in 1997. Sodium has even been detected in the atmospheres of some extrasolar planets via transit spectroscopy.

==Commercial production==
Employed in rather specialized applications, about 100,000 tonnes of metallic sodium are produced annually. Metallic sodium was first produced commercially in the late nineteenth century by carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate at 1100 °C, as the first step of the Deville process for the production of aluminium:
:Na2CO3 + 2 C → 2 Na + 3 CO

The high demand for aluminium created the need for the production of sodium. The introduction of the Hall–Héroult process for the production of aluminium by electrolysing a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.

Sodium is now produced commercially through the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride (common salt), based on a process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700 °C. As calcium is less electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).
If sodium of high purity is required, it can be distilled once or several times.

The market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry inert gas atmosphere or anhydrous mineral oil to prevent the formation of a surface layer of sodium oxide or sodium superoxide.

==Uses==

Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions of tons of sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; examples of the uses of sodium bicarbonate include baking, as a raising agent, and sodablasting. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry.

Metallic sodium is used mainly for the production of sodium borohydride, sodium azide, indigo, and triphenylphosphine. A once-common use was the making of tetraethyllead and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970. Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an anti-scaling agent, and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective.

Note the free element is not used as a scaling agent, ions in the water are exchanged for sodium ions. Sodium plasma (&quot;vapor&quot;) lamps are often used for street lighting in cities, shedding light that ranges from yellow-orange to peach as the pressure increases. By itself or with potassium, sodium is a desiccant; it gives an intense blue coloration with benzophenone when the desiccate is dry.

In organic synthesis, sodium is used in various reactions such as the Birch reduction, and the sodium fusion test is conducted to qualitatively analyse compounds. Sodium reacts with alcohols and gives alkoxides, and when sodium is dissolved in ammonia solution, it can be used to reduce alkynes to trans-alkenes. Lasers emitting light at the sodium D line are used to create artificial laser guide stars that assist in the adaptive optics for land-based visible-light telescopes.

===Heat transfer===

Liquid sodium is used as a heat transfer fluid in sodium-cooled fast reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its strongly reducing properties. Sodium will explode in contact with water, although it will only burn gently in air.

Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) is used. Because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. The pyrophoricity of the NaK means extra precautions must be taken to prevent and detect leaks.

Another heat transfer application of sodium is in poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.

==Biological role==
=== Biological role in humans ===
In humans, sodium is an essential mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH. The minimum physiological requirement for sodium is estimated to range from about 120 milligrams per day in newborns to 500 milligrams per day over the age of 10.

==== Diet ====
Sodium chloride, also known as &#x27;edible salt&#x27; or &#x27;table salt&#x27; (chemical formula ), is the principal source of sodium () in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky. For Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine set its tolerable upper intake level for sodium at 2.3 grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4 grams per day. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 1.5 g of sodium per day.

The Committee to Review the Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium and Potassium, which is part of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, has determined that there isn&#x27;t enough evidence from research studies to establish Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) values for sodium. As a result, the committee has established Adequate Intake (AI) levels instead, as follows. The sodium AI for infants of 0–6 months is established at 110 mg/day, 7–12 months: 370 mg/day; for children 1–3 years: 800 mg/day, 4–8 years: 1,000 mg/day; for adolescents: 9–13 years – 1,200 mg/day, 14–18 years 1,500 mg/day; for adults regardless of their age or sex: 1,500 mg/day.

Sodium chloride () contains approximately 39.34% of its total mass as elemental sodium (). This means that of sodium chloride contains approximately of elemental sodium. For example, to find out how much sodium chloride contains 1500 mg of elemental sodium (the value of 1500 mg sodium is the adequate intake (AI) for an adult), we can use the proportion:
:393.4 mg Na : 1000 mg NaCl = 1500 mg Na : x mg NaCl
Solving for &quot;x&quot; gives us the amount of sodium chloride that contains 1500 mg of elemental sodium
:x = (1500 mg Na × 1000 mg NaCl) / 393.4 mg Na = 3812.91 mg
This mean that 3812.91 mg of sodium chloride contain 1500 mg of elemental sodium.

==== High sodium consumption ====

High sodium consumption is unhealthy, and can lead to alteration in the mechanical performance of the heart. High sodium consumption is also associated with chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and stroke.

===== High blood pressure =====
There is a strong correlation between higher sodium intake and higher blood pressure. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2 g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mm Hg. It has been estimated that such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to 9–17% fewer cases of hypertension.

Hypertension causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide each year. Since edible salt contains about 39.3% sodium—the rest being chlorine and trace chemicals; thus, 2.3 g sodium is about 5.9 g, or 5.3 ml, of salt—about one US teaspoon.

One scientific review found that people with or without hypertension who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3 g/d) had a &quot;higher&quot; risk of death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7 g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily sodium intake to 1.5 g.

==== Physiology ====
The renin–angiotensin system regulates the amount of fluid and sodium concentration in the body. Reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result in the production of renin, which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin, which stimulates the reabsorption of sodium back into the bloodstream. When the concentration of sodium increases, the production of renin decreases, and the sodium concentration returns to normal. The sodium ion (Na+) is an important electrolyte in neuron function, and in osmoregulation between cells and the extracellular fluid. This is accomplished in all animals by Na+/K+-ATPase, an active transporter pumping ions against the gradient, and sodium/potassium channels. The difference in extracellular and intracellular ion concentration, maintained by the sodium-potassium pump, produce electrical signals in the form of action potentials that supports cardiac muscle contraction and promote long distance communication between neurons. Sodium is the most prevalent metallic ion in extracellular fluid.

In humans, unusually low or high sodium levels in the blood is recognized in medicine as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. These conditions may be caused by genetic factors, ageing, or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.

=== Biological role in plants ===
In C4 plants, sodium is a micronutrient that aids metabolism, specifically in regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate and synthesis of chlorophyll. In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding in the opening and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to enzyme inhibition, which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis.

In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves. Excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth. Halophytes have adapted to be able to flourish in sodium rich environments.

==Safety and precautions==

Sodium forms flammable hydrogen and caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes in the presence of water due to the formation of hydrogen (highly explosive) and sodium hydroxide (which dissolves in the water, liberating more surface). However, sodium exposed to air and ignited or reaching autoignition (reported to occur when a molten pool of sodium reaches about ) displays a relatively mild fire.

In the case of massive (non-molten) pieces of sodium, the reaction with oxygen eventually becomes slow due to formation of a protective layer. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires. Those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are effective when used to extinguish sodium fires. An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and dry sand.

Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen with surrounding pipes containing inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using diverse design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.

Liquid sodium fires are more dangerous to handle than solid sodium fires, particularly if there is insufficient experience with the safe handling of molten sodium. In a technical report for the United States Fire Administration, R. J. Gordon writes (emphasis in original)
