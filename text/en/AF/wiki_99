<text>The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the Sun&#x27;s outermost atmospheric layer, the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between . The composition of the solar wind plasma also includes a mixture of particle species found in the solar plasma: trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei of elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and iron. There are also rarer traces of some other nuclei and isotopes such as phosphorus, titanium, chromium, and nickel&#x27;s isotopes 58Ni, 60Ni, and 62Ni. Superimposed with the solar-wind plasma is the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind varies in density, temperature and speed over time and over solar latitude and longitude. Its particles can escape the Sun&#x27;s gravity because of their high energy resulting from the high temperature of the corona, which in turn is a result of the coronal magnetic field. The boundary separating the corona from the solar wind is called the Alfvén surface.

At a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind reaches speeds of and is supersonic, meaning it moves faster than the speed of fast magnetosonic waves. The flow of the solar wind is no longer supersonic at the termination shock. Other related phenomena include the aurora (northern and southern lights), comet tails that always point away from the Sun, and geomagnetic storms that can change the direction of magnetic field lines.

==History==
===Observations from Earth===
The existence of particles flowing outward from the Sun to the Earth was first suggested by British astronomer Richard C. Carrington. In 1859, Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently made the first observations of what would later be called a solar flare. This is a sudden, localised increase in brightness on the solar disc, which is now known to often occur in conjunction with an episodic ejection of material and magnetic flux from the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, known as a coronal mass ejection. The following day, a powerful geomagnetic storm was observed, and Carrington suspected that there might be a connection; the geomagnetic storm is now attributed to the arrival of the coronal mass ejection in near-Earth space and its subsequent interaction with the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. Irish academic George FitzGerald later suggested that matter was being regularly accelerated away from the Sun, reaching the Earth after several days.

In 1910, British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington essentially suggested the existence of the solar wind, without naming it, in a footnote to an article on Comet Morehouse. Eddington&#x27;s proposition was never fully embraced, even though he had also made a similar suggestion at a Royal Institution address the previous year, in which he had postulated that the ejected material consisted of electrons, whereas in his study of Comet Morehouse he had supposed them to be ions.

The idea that the ejected material consisted of both ions and electrons was first suggested by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland. His geomagnetic surveys showed that auroral activity was almost uninterrupted. As these displays and other geomagnetic activity were being produced by particles from the Sun, he concluded that the Earth was being continually bombarded by &quot;rays of electric corpuscles emitted by the Sun&quot;. He proposed in 1916 that, &quot;From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds&quot;; in other words, the solar wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions. Three years later, in 1919, British physicist Frederick Lindemann also suggested that the Sun ejects particles of both polarities: protons as well as electrons.

Around the 1930s, scientists had concluded that the temperature of the solar corona must be a million degrees Celsius because of the way it extended into space (as seen during a total solar eclipse). Later spectroscopic work confirmed this extraordinary temperature to be the case. In the mid-1950s, British mathematician Sydney Chapman calculated the properties of a gas at such a temperature and determined that the corona being such a superb conductor of heat, it must extend way out into space, beyond the orbit of Earth. Also in the 1950s, German astronomer Ludwig Biermann became interested in the fact that the tail of a comet always points away from the Sun, regardless of the direction in which the comet is travelling. Biermann postulated that this happens because the Sun emits a steady stream of particles that pushes the comet&#x27;s tail away. German astronomer Paul Ahnert is credited (by Wilfried Schröder) as being the first to relate solar wind to the direction of a comet&#x27;s tail based on observations of the comet Whipple–Fedke (1942g).

American astrophysicist Eugene Parker realised that heat flowing from the Sun in Chapman&#x27;s model, and the comet tail blowing away from the Sun in Biermann&#x27;s hypothesis, had to be the result of the same phenomenon which he termed the &quot;solar wind&quot;. In 1957, Parker showed that although the Sun&#x27;s corona is strongly attracted by solar gravity, it is such a good conductor of heat that it is still very hot at large distances from the Sun. As solar gravity weakens with increasing distance from the Sun, the outer coronal atmosphere is able to escape supersonically into interstellar space. Parker was also the first person to notice that the weakening influence of the Sun&#x27;s gravity has the same effect on hydrodynamic flow as a de Laval nozzle, inciting a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow. There was strong opposition to Parker&#x27;s hypothesis on the solar wind; the paper he submitted to &quot;The Astrophysical Journal&quot; in 1958 was rejected by two reviewers, before being accepted by the editor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

===Observations from space===
In January 1959, the Soviet spacecraft &quot;Luna 1&quot; first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength, using hemispherical ion traps. The discovery, made by , was verified by &quot;Luna 2&quot;, &quot;Luna 3&quot;, and the more distant measurements of &quot;Venera 1&quot;. Three years later, a similar measurement was performed by American geophysicist Marcia Neugebauer and collaborators using the &quot;Mariner 2&quot; spacecraft.

The first numerical simulation of the solar wind in the solar corona, including closed and open field lines, was performed by Pneuman and Kopp in 1971. The magnetohydrodynamics equations in steady state were solved iteratively starting with an initial dipolar configuration.

In 1990, the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe was launched to study the solar wind from high solar latitudes. All prior observations had been made at or near the Solar System&#x27;s ecliptic plane.

In the late 1990s, the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer (UVCS) instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft observed the acceleration region of the fast solar wind emanating from the poles of the Sun and found that the wind accelerates much faster than can be accounted for by thermodynamic expansion alone. Parker&#x27;s model predicted that the wind should make the transition to supersonic flow at an altitude of about four solar radii (approx. 3,000,000 km) from the photosphere (surface); but the transition (or &quot;sonic point&quot;) now appears to be much lower, perhaps only one solar radius (approx. 700,000 km) above the photosphere, suggesting that some additional mechanism accelerates the solar wind away from the Sun. The acceleration of the fast wind is still not understood and cannot be fully explained by Parker&#x27;s theory. However, the gravitational and electromagnetic explanation for this acceleration is detailed in an earlier paper by 1970 Nobel laureate in Physics, Hannes Alfvén.

From May 10 to May 12, 1999, NASA&#x27;s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and WIND spacecraft observed a 98% decrease of solar wind density. This allowed energetic electrons from the Sun to flow to Earth in narrow beams known as &quot;strahl&quot;, which caused a highly unusual &quot;polar rain&quot; event, in which a visible aurora appeared over the North Pole. In addition, Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere increased to between 5 and 6 times its normal size.

The STEREO mission was launched in 2006 to study coronal mass ejections and the solar corona, using stereoscopy from two widely separated imaging systems. Each STEREO spacecraft carried two heliospheric imagers: highly sensitive wide-field cameras capable of imaging the solar wind itself, via Thomson scattering of sunlight off of free electrons. Movies from STEREO revealed the solar wind near the ecliptic, as a large-scale turbulent flow.
On December 13, 2010, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; determined that the velocity of the solar wind, at its location from Earth had slowed to zero. &quot;We have gotten to the point where the wind from the Sun, which until now has always had an outward motion, is no longer moving outward; it is only moving sideways so that it can end up going down the tail of the heliosphere, which is a comet-shaped-like object&quot;, said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone.

In 2018, NASA launched the &quot;Parker Solar Probe&quot;, named in honor of American astrophysicist Eugene Parker, on a mission to study the structure and dynamics of the solar corona, in an attempt to understand the mechanisms that cause particles to be heated and accelerated as solar wind. During its seven-year mission, the probe will make twenty-four orbits of the Sun, passing further into the corona with each orbit&#x27;s perihelion, ultimately passing within 0.04 astronomical units of the Sun&#x27;s surface. It is the first NASA spacecraft named for a living person, and Parker, at age 91, was on hand to observe the launch.

==Acceleration mechanism==
While early models of the solar wind relied primarily on thermal energy to accelerate the material, by the 1960s it was clear that thermal acceleration alone cannot account for the high speed of solar wind. An additional unknown acceleration mechanism is required and likely relates to magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere.

The Sun&#x27;s corona, or extended outer layer, is a region of plasma that is heated to over a megakelvin. As a result of thermal collisions, the particles within the inner corona have a range and distribution of speeds described by a Maxwellian distribution. The mean velocity of these particles is about , which is well below the solar escape velocity of . However, a few of the particles achieve energies sufficient to reach the terminal velocity of , which allows them to feed the solar wind. At the same temperature, electrons, due to their much smaller mass, reach escape velocity and build up an electric field that further accelerates ions away from the Sun.

The total number of particles carried away from the Sun by the solar wind is about per second. Thus, the total mass loss each year is about solar masses, or about 1.3–1.9 million tonnes per second. This is equivalent to losing a mass equal to the Earth every 150 million years. However, since the Sun&#x27;s formation, only about 0.01% of its initial mass has been lost through the solar wind. Other stars have much stronger stellar winds that result in significantly higher mass-loss rates.

=== Jetlets ===
In March 2023 solar extreme ultraviolet observations have shown that small-scale magnetic reconnection could be a driver of the solar wind as a swarm of nanoflares in the form omnipresent jetting activity a.k.a. jetlets producing short-lived streams of hot plasma and Alfvén waves at the base of the solar corona. This activity could also be connected to the magnetic switchback phenomenon of the solar wind.

== Properties and structure ==
===Fast and slow solar wind===
The solar wind is observed to exist in two fundamental states, termed the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind, though their differences extend well beyond their speeds. In near-Earth space, the slow solar wind is observed to have a velocity of , a temperature of ~ and a composition that is a close match to the corona. By contrast, the fast solar wind has a typical velocity of , a temperature of and it nearly matches the composition of the Sun&#x27;s photosphere. The slow solar wind is twice as dense and more variable in nature than the fast solar wind.

The slow solar wind appears to originate from a region around the Sun&#x27;s equatorial belt that is known as the &quot;streamer belt&quot;, where coronal streamers are produced by magnetic flux open to the heliosphere draping over closed magnetic loops. The exact coronal structures involved in slow solar wind formation and the method by which the material is released is still under debate. Observations of the Sun between 1996 and 2001 showed that emission of the slow solar wind occurred at latitudes up to 30–35° during the solar minimum (the period of lowest solar activity), then expanded toward the poles as the solar cycle approached maximum. At solar maximum, the poles were also emitting a slow solar wind.

The fast solar wind originates from coronal holes, which are funnel-like regions of open field lines in the Sun&#x27;s magnetic field. Such open lines are particularly prevalent around the Sun&#x27;s magnetic poles. The plasma source is small magnetic fields created by convection cells in the solar atmosphere. These fields confine the plasma and transport it into the narrow necks of the coronal funnels, which are located only 20,000 km above the photosphere. The plasma is released into the funnel when these magnetic field lines reconnect.

=== Velocity and density ===
Near the Earth&#x27;s orbit at 1 astronomical unit (AU) the plasma flows at speeds ranging from 250 to 750 km/s with a density ranging between 3 and 10 particles per cubic centimeter and temperature ranging from 104 to 106 kelvin.

On average, the plasma density decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun, while the velocity decreases and flattens out at 1 AU.

Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 reported plasma density &quot;n&quot; between 0.001 and 0.005 particles/cm3 at distances of 80 to 120 AU, increasing rapidly beyond 120 AU at heliopause to between 0.05 and 0.2 particles/cm3.

===Pressure===
At , the wind exerts a pressure typically in the range of (), although it can readily vary outside that range.

The ram pressure is a function of wind speed and density. The formula is

:formula_1

where &quot;m&quot;p is the proton mass, pressure &quot;P&quot; is in Pa (pascals), &quot;n&quot; is the density in particles/cm3 and &quot;V&quot; is the speed in km/s of the solar wind.

===Coronal mass ejection===

Both the fast and slow solar wind can be interrupted by large, fast-moving bursts of plasma called coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are caused by a release of magnetic energy at the Sun. CMEs are often called &quot;solar storms&quot; or &quot;space storms&quot; in the popular media. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with solar flares, which are another manifestation of magnetic energy release at the Sun. CMEs cause shock waves in the thin plasma of the heliosphere, launching electromagnetic waves and accelerating particles (mostly protons and electrons) to form showers of ionizing radiation that precede the CME.

When a CME impacts the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, it temporarily deforms the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, changing the direction of compass needles and inducing large electrical ground currents in Earth itself; this is called a geomagnetic storm and it is a global phenomenon. CME impacts can induce magnetic reconnection in Earth&#x27;s magnetotail (the midnight side of the magnetosphere); this launches protons and electrons downward toward Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, where they form the aurora.

CMEs are not the only cause of space weather. Different patches on the Sun are known to give rise to slightly different speeds and densities of wind depending on local conditions. In isolation, each of these different wind streams would form a spiral with a slightly different angle, with fast-moving streams moving out more directly and slow-moving streams wrapping more around the Sun. Fast-moving streams tend to overtake slower streams that originate westward of them on the Sun, forming turbulent co-rotating interaction regions that give rise to wave motions and accelerated particles, and that affect Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere in the same way as, but more gently than, CMEs. 

CMEs have a complex internal structure, with a highly turbulent region of hot and compressed plasma (known as sheath) preceding an arrival of relatively cold and strongly magnetized plasma region (known as magnetic cloud or ejecta). Sheath and ejecta have very different impact on the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere and on various space weather phenomena, such as the behavior of Van Allen radiation belts.

===Magnetic switchbacks===

Magnetic switchbacks are sudden reversals in the magnetic field of the solar wind. They can also be described as traveling disturbances in the solar wind that caused the magnetic field to bend back on itself. They were first observed by the NASA–ESA mission &quot;Ulysses&quot;, the first spacecraft to fly over the Sun&#x27;s poles. Parker Solar Probe observed first switchbacks in 2018.

==Solar System effects==

Over the Sun&#x27;s lifetime, the interaction of its surface layers with the escaping solar wind has significantly decreased its surface rotation rate. The wind is considered responsible for comets&#x27; tails, along with the Sun&#x27;s radiation. The solar wind contributes to fluctuations in celestial radio waves observed on the Earth, through an effect called interplanetary scintillation.

===Magnetospheres===

Where the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed magnetic field (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the Lorentz force. This region, known as the magnetosphere, causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a hemisphere on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the magnetopause, and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.

The solar wind is responsible for the overall shape of Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. Fluctuations in its speed, density, direction, and entrained magnetic field strongly affect Earth&#x27;s local space environment. For example, the levels of ionizing radiation and radio interference can vary by factors of hundreds to thousands; and the shape and location of the magnetopause and bow shock wave upstream of it can change by several Earth radii, exposing geosynchronous satellites to the direct solar wind. These phenomena are collectively called space weather.

From the European Space Agency&#x27;s Cluster mission, a new study has taken place that proposes that it is easier for the solar wind to infiltrate the magnetosphere than previously believed. A group of scientists directly observed the existence of certain waves in the solar wind that were not expected. A recent study shows that these waves enable incoming charged particles of solar wind to breach the magnetopause. This suggests that the magnetic bubble forms more as a filter than a continuous barrier. This latest discovery occurred through the distinctive arrangement of the four identical Cluster spacecraft, which fly in a controlled configuration through near-Earth space. As they sweep from the magnetosphere into interplanetary space and back again, the fleet provides exceptional three-dimensional insights on the phenomena that connect the sun to Earth.

The research characterised variances in formation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) largely influenced by Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (which occur at the interface of two fluids) as a result of differences in thickness and numerous other characteristics of the boundary layer. Experts believe that this was the first occasion that the appearance of Kelvin–Helmholtz waves at the magnetopause had been displayed at high latitude downward orientation of the IMF. These waves are being seen in unforeseen places under solar wind conditions that were formerly believed to be undesired for their generation. These discoveries show how Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere can be penetrated by solar particles under specific IMF circumstances. The findings are also relevant to studies of magnetospheric progressions around other planetary bodies. This study suggests that Kelvin–Helmholtz waves can be a somewhat common, and possibly constant, instrument for the entrance of solar wind into terrestrial magnetospheres under various IMF orientations.

===Atmospheres===
The solar wind affects other incoming cosmic rays interacting with planetary atmospheres. Moreover, planets with a weak or non-existent magnetosphere are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind.

Venus, the nearest and most similar planet to Earth, has 100 times denser atmosphere, with little or no geo-magnetic field. Space probes discovered a comet-like tail that extends to Earth&#x27;s orbit.

Earth itself is largely protected from the solar wind by its magnetic field, which deflects most of the charged particles; however, some of the charged particles are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt. A smaller number of particles from the solar wind manage to travel, as though on an electromagnetic energy transmission line, to the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and ionosphere in the auroral zones. The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce phenomena such as the aurora and geomagnetic storms. Bright auroras strongly heat the ionosphere, causing its plasma to expand into the magnetosphere, increasing the size of the plasma geosphere and injecting atmospheric matter into the solar wind. Geomagnetic storms result when the pressure of plasmas contained inside the magnetosphere is sufficiently large to inflate and thereby distort the geomagnetic field.

Although Mars is larger than Mercury and four times farther from the Sun, it is thought that the solar wind has stripped away up to a third of its original atmosphere, leaving a layer 1/100 as dense as the Earth&#x27;s. It is believed the mechanism for this atmospheric stripping is gas caught in bubbles of the magnetic field, which are ripped off by the solar wind. In 2015 the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping caused by the magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars, which generates an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity. This electric field accelerates electrically charged gas atoms, called ions, in Mars&#x27;s upper atmosphere and shoots them into space. The MAVEN mission measured the rate of atmospheric stripping at about 100 grams (≈1/4 lb) per second.

===Moons and planetary surfaces===
Mercury, the nearest planet to the Sun, bears the full brunt of the solar wind, and since its atmosphere is vestigial and transient, its surface is bathed in radiation.

Mercury has an intrinsic magnetic field, so under normal solar wind conditions, the solar wind cannot penetrate its magnetosphere and particles only reach the surface in the cusp regions. During coronal mass ejections, however, the magnetopause may get pressed into the surface of the planet, and under these conditions, the solar wind may interact freely with the planetary surface.

The Earth&#x27;s Moon has no atmosphere or intrinsic magnetic field, and consequently its surface is bombarded with the full solar wind. The Project Apollo missions deployed passive aluminum collectors in an attempt to sample the solar wind, and lunar soil returned for study confirmed that the lunar regolith is enriched in atomic nuclei deposited from the solar wind. These elements may prove useful resources for future lunar expeditions.

== Limits ==

===Alfvén surface===
The Alfvén surface is the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind defined as where the coronal plasma&#x27;s Alfvén speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.

Researchers were unsure exactly where the Alfvén critical surface of the Sun lay. Based on remote images of the corona, estimates had put it somewhere between 10 and 20 solar radii from the surface of the Sun. On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, NASA&#x27;s Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfvén surface.

===Outer limits===
The solar wind &quot;blows a bubble&quot; in the interstellar medium (the rarefied hydrogen and helium gas that permeates the galaxy). The point where the solar wind&#x27;s strength is no longer great enough to push back the interstellar medium is known as the heliopause and is often considered to be the outer border of the Solar System. The distance to the heliopause is not precisely known and probably depends on the current velocity of the solar wind and the local density of the interstellar medium, but it is far outside Pluto&#x27;s orbit. Scientists hope to gain perspective on the heliopause from data acquired through the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission, launched in October 2008.

The heliopause is noted as one of the ways of defining the extent of the Solar System, along with the Kuiper Belt and the radius at which the Sun&#x27;s gravitational influence is matched by other stars. The maximum extent of that influence has been estimated at between 50,000 AU and 2 light-years, compared to the heliopause (the outer boundary of the heliosphere), which has been detected at about 120 AU by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; spacecraft.

The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft crossed the termination shock more than five times between August 30 and December 10, 2007. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; crossed the shock about a Tm closer to the Sun than the 13.5 Tm distance where &quot;Voyager 1&quot; came upon the termination shock. The spacecraft moved outward through the termination shock into the heliosheath and onward toward the interstellar medium.

<doc id="28543" wikidata="Q1133076" url="?curid=28543" title="Spoonerism">
<text>A spoonerism is an occurrence of speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched (see metathesis) between two words of a phrase. These are named after the Oxford don and priest William Archibald Spooner, who reportedly commonly spoke in this way.

An example is saying &quot;blushing crow&quot; instead of &quot;crushing blow&quot;, or &quot;runny babbit&quot; instead of &quot;bunny rabbit&quot;. While spoonerisms are commonly heard as slips of the tongue, they can also be used intentionally as a word play.

The first known spoonerisms were published by the 16th-century author François Rabelais and termed . In his novel &quot;Pantagruel&quot;, he wrote (&quot;insane woman at Mass, woman with flabby buttocks&quot;).

==Etymology==
Spoonerisms are named for the Reverend William Archibald Spooner (1844–1930), Warden from 1903 to 1924 of New College, Oxford, who was allegedly susceptible to this mistake.
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the word &quot;spoonerism&quot; as early as 1900.
The term was well-established by 1921. An article in &quot;The Times&quot; from that year reports that:

The boys of Aldro School, Eastbourne, ... have been set the following task for the holidays: Discover and write down something about: The Old Lady of Threadneedle-street, a Spoonerism, a Busman&#x27;s Holiday...

An article in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in 1928 reported spoonerisms to be a &quot;legend&quot;. In that piece Robert Seton, once a student of Spooner&#x27;s, admitted that Spooner:
...made, to my knowledge, only one &quot;Spoonerism&quot; in his life, in 1879, when he stood in the pulpit and announced the hymn: &#x27;Kinkering Kongs their Titles Take&#x27; [&quot;Conquering Kings their Titles Take&quot;]...Later, a friend and myself brought out a book of &quot;spoonerisms&quot;.
In 1937, &quot;The Times&quot; quoted a detective describing a man as &quot;a bricklabourer&#x27;s layer&quot; and used &quot;Police Court Spoonerism&quot; as the headline.

A spoonerism is also known as a &quot;marrowsky&quot; or &quot;morowski&quot;, purportedly after an 18th-century Polish count who suffered from the same impediment.

==Examples==

Most of the quotations attributed to Spooner are apocryphal; &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot; (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: &quot;The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer&quot; (instead of &quot;rate of wages&quot;). Spooner himself claimed that &quot;The Kinquering Congs Their Titles Take&quot; (in reference to a hymn) was his sole spoonerism. Most spoonerisms were probably never uttered by William Spooner himself but rather invented by colleagues and students as a pastime. Richard Lederer, calling &quot;Kinkering Kongs their Titles Take&quot; (with an alternative spelling) one of the &quot;few&quot; authenticated Spoonerisms, dates it to 1879, and he gives nine examples &quot;attributed to Spooner, most of them spuriously&quot;. They are as follows:
*&quot;Three cheers for our queer old dean!&quot; (while giving a toast at a dinner, which Queen Victoria was also attending)
*&quot;Is it kisstomary to cuss the bride?&quot; (as opposed to &quot;customary to kiss&quot;)
*&quot;The Lord is a shoving leopard.&quot; (instead of &quot;a loving shepherd&quot;)
*&quot;A blushing crow.&quot; (&quot;crushing blow&quot;)
*&quot;A well-boiled icicle&quot; (&quot;well-oiled bicycle&quot;)
*&quot;You were fighting a liar in the quadrangle.&quot; (&quot;lighting a fire&quot;)
*&quot;Is the bean dizzy?&quot; (&quot;Dean busy&quot;)
*&quot;Someone is occupewing my pie. Please sew me to another sheet.&quot; (&quot;Someone is occupying my pew. Please show me to another seat.&quot;)
*&quot;You have hissed all my mystery lectures. You have tasted a whole worm. Please leave Oxford on the next town drain.&quot; (&quot;You have missed all my history lectures. You have wasted a whole term. Please leave Oxford on the next down train.&quot;)

==Popular use/culture==
In modern terms, &quot;spoonerism&quot; generally refers to any changing of sounds in this manner.

===Comedy===
* The long-running British comedy television show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; regularly featured segments with Ronnie Barker delivering a mock-serious speech littered with spoonerisms, written by Barker.
Writing in tribute for the inaugural Ronnie Barker Talk, Ben Elton wrote:

What an honour. I grew up loving Ronnie Barker and can only hope the news that I am to give a talk in his name doesn’t leave him spitting spiritedly splenetic spoonerisms in comedy heaven.

*The Washington, D.C. political comedy group Capitol Steps had a long-standing tradition of performing a routine named &quot;Lirty Dies&quot; during every performance, which features a typically 10-minute-long barrage of rapid-fire topical spoonerisms. A few examples over the years range from &quot;Resident Pagan&quot; (President Reagan) and the US&#x27;s periodic practice of &quot;Licking their Peaders&quot; (Picking their leaders) to the NSA &quot;poopin&#x27; on Snutin&quot; (Snoopin&#x27; on Putin) and &quot;phugging everybody&#x27;s bones&quot; (bugging everybody&#x27;s phones).
*Comedian Jane Ace was notorious for her spoonerisms and other similar plays on words during her time as main actress of the radio situation comedy &quot;Easy Aces&quot;.

===Literature===
* Comedian F. Chase Taylor was the main actor of the 1930s radio program &quot;Stoopnagle and Budd&quot;, in which his character, Colonel Stoopnagle, used spoonerisms. In 1945, he published a book, &quot;My Tale Is Twisted&quot;, consisting of 44 &quot;spoonerised&quot; versions of well-known children&#x27;s stories. Subtitled &quot;Wart Pun: Aysop&#x27;s Feebles&quot; and &quot;Tart Pooh: Tairy and Other Fales,&quot; these included such tales as &quot;Beeping Sleauty&quot; for &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. The book was republished in 2001 by Stone and Scott Publishers as &quot;Stoopnagle&#x27;s Tale is Twisted&quot;.
* In 2005, HarperCollins published the late humorist Shel Silverstein&#x27;s &quot;Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook,&quot; a book about a rabbit whose parents &quot;Dummy and Mad&quot; gave him spoonerized chores, such as having to &quot;Dash the wishes&quot; (for &quot;wash the dishes&quot;).
*In his poem &quot;Translation,&quot; Brian P. Cleary describes a boy named Alex who speaks in spoonerisms (like &quot;shook a tower&quot; instead of &quot;took a shower&quot;). Humorously, Cleary leaves the poem&#x27;s final spoonerism to the reader when he says:

* In &quot;D. H. Lawrence &amp; Susan his Cow&quot; (1939), literary critic William York Tindall described behavioral psychologists as &quot;occupied with nothing more spiritual than pulling habits out of rats&quot;. (This quip is commonly cited to Douglas Bush, who used it in a lecture two years later.)

===Music===
* The title of the Van der Graaf Generator&#x27;s album &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot; resulted from a spoonerism by David Jackson, who said one time: &quot;I&#x27;ll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn hearts&quot;, meaning to say &#x27;horn parts&#x27;.
* American indie rock musician Ritt Momney&#x27;s name is a spoonerism of the name of the American politician Mitt Romney.
* American synthwave musician Com Truise&#x27;s name is a spoonerism of the name of American actor Tom Cruise.
* Estonian complextro musician Mord Fustang&#x27;s name is a spoonerism of the well-known Ford Mustang muscle car.
* English rapper Loyle Carner&#x27;s stage name is a spoonerism of his double-barrelled surname Coyle-Larner as well as a reference to his childhood struggle with his ADHD and dyslexia diagnoses.
* American mathcore band The Callous Daoboys is a spoonerism of the Dallas Cowboys.
* Dutch electronic musician San Holo is a spoonerism of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Han Solo. This led Walt Disney Pictures to send a cease and desist letter for copyright infringement with potential penalty estimated between $5 million and $10 million.
* American thrash metal band Metallica released a live concert DVD in 1998, titled &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot;, with it being meant as a spoonerism for “stunning cunts”.
* American hip-hop artist Tyler, the Creator&#x27;s street-wear brand, Golf Wang, is a spoonerism of LA hip-hop music collective &quot;Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All&quot;, which he was a former member of.

===Radio===
On the 3 December 1950 episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; Jack mentions that he ran into his butler Rochester while in his car that was on a grease rack. Mary Livingston was supposed to say &quot;How could you run into him on a grease rack?&quot; but flubbed her line with &quot;How could you run into him on a grass reek?&quot; The audience laughed so much that Jack was unable to reply as the show ran out of time.

===False etymology===
Spoonerisms are used sometimes in false etymologies. For example, according to linguist Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, some wrongly believe that the English word &quot;butterfly&quot; derives from&quot; &#x27;utter y&quot;&#x27;.

==Kniferisms and forkerisms==
As complements to &quot;spoonerism&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter used the nonce words &quot;kniferism&quot; and &quot;forkerism&quot; to refer to changing, respectively, the vowels or the final consonants of two syllables, giving them a new meaning. Examples of so-called kniferisms include a British television newsreader once referring to the police at a crime scene removing a &#x27;hypodeemic nerdle&#x27;; a television announcer once saying that &quot;All the world was thrilled by the marriage of the Duck and Doochess of Windsor&quot;; and during a live radio broadcast in 1931, radio presenter Harry von Zell accidentally mispronouncing US President Herbert Hoover&#x27;s name as &quot;Hoobert Heever&quot;.

<text>Self-reference is a concept that involves referring to oneself or one&#x27;s own attributes, characteristics, or actions. It can occur in language, logic, mathematics, philosophy, and other fields.

In natural or formal languages, self-reference occurs when a sentence, idea or formula refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some encoding.

In philosophy, self-reference also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself, that is, to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun &quot;I&quot; in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in mathematics, philosophy, computer programming, second-order cybernetics, and linguistics, as well as in humor. Self-referential statements are sometimes paradoxical, and can also be considered recursive.

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical philosophy, paradoxes were created by self-referential concepts such as the omnipotence paradox of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The Epimenides paradox, &#x27;All Cretans are liars&#x27; when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.

In mathematics and computability theory, self-reference (also known as impredicativity) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. Gödel&#x27;s theorem uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. The halting problem equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s paradox and Berry&#x27;s paradox, and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In game theory, undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other&#x27;s mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In computer programming, self-reference occurs in reflection, where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data. Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in recursion (related to the mathematical recurrence relation) in functional programming, where a code structure refers back to itself during computation. &#x27;Taming&#x27; self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of computer science, and is now used routinely in, for example, writing compilers using the &#x27;meta-language&#x27; ML. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as bootstrapping. Self-modifying code is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with assembler and with functional languages such as Lisp, but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in flip-flops, the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as GNU (&#x27;GNU&#x27;s not Unix&#x27;) and PINE (&#x27;Pine is not Elm&#x27;). The GNU Hurd is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

Tupper&#x27;s self-referential formula is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

==In art==


Self-reference occurs in literature and film when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Denis Diderot&#x27;s &quot;Jacques le fataliste et son maître&quot;, Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot;, many stories by Nikolai Gogol, &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; by John Barth, Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; and Bryan Forbes&#x27;s &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;. Speculative fiction writer Samuel R. Delany makes use of this in his novels &quot;Nova&quot; and &quot;Dhalgren&quot;. In the former, Katin (a space-faring novelist) is wary of a long-standing curse wherein a novelist dies before completing any given work. &quot;Nova&quot; ends mid-sentence, thus lending credence to the curse and the realization that the novelist is the author of the story; likewise, throughout &quot;Dhalgren&quot;, Delany has a protagonist simply named The Kid (or Kidd, in some sections), whose life and work are mirror images of themselves and of the novel itself. In the sci-fi spoof film &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, Director Mel Brooks includes a scene wherein the evil characters are viewing a VHS copy of their own story, which shows them watching themselves &quot;watching themselves&quot;, ad infinitum. Perhaps the earliest example is in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, where Helen of Troy laments: &quot;for generations still unborn/we will live in song&quot; (appearing in the song itself).

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of breaking the fourth wall and meta-reference, which often involve self-reference. The short stories of Jorge Luis Borges play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the rubber reality movement, notably in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s films &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and &quot;Adaptation&quot;, the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation, in a dramatized version of the Droste effect.

Various creation myths invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example, the Egyptian creation myth has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. The Ouroboros is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The Quran includes numerous instances of self-referentiality.

The surrealist painter René Magritte is famous for his self-referential works. His painting &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;, includes the words &quot;this is not a pipe&quot;, the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word &quot;ceci&quot; (in English, &quot;this&quot;) refers to the pipe depicted—or to the painting or the word or sentence itself. M.C. Escher&#x27;s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

==In language==
A word that describes itself is called an &quot;autological word&quot; (or &quot;autonym&quot;). This generally applies to adjectives, for example (i.e. &quot;sesquipedalian&quot; is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as , as a three-letter abbreviation for &quot;three-letter abbreviation&quot;.

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an autogram.

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. &quot;This is a sentence.&quot; can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However &quot;This sentence is false&quot; is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential paradox. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. Kurt Gödel claimed to have found such a loophole in the United States Constitution at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the media when it is required to write about itself, for example the BBC reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as Wikipedia&#x27;s article on Wikipedia.

Fumblerules are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as &quot;Avoid cliches like the plague&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t use no double negatives&quot;. The term was coined in a published list of such rules by William Safire.

Circular definition is a type of self-reference in which the definition of a term or concept includes the term or concept itself, either explicitly or implicitly. Circular definitions are considered fallacious because they only define a term in terms of itself. This type of self-reference may be useful in argumentation, but can result in a lack of clarity in communication.

The adverb &quot;hereby&quot; is used in a self-referential way, for example in the statement &quot;I hereby declare you husband and wife.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s books, especially &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; and &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. Hofstadter&#x27;s law, which specifies that &quot;It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#x27;s Law&quot; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a &#x27;Reviews of this book&#x27;, a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using wikis and other technologies. Hofstadter&#x27;s &#x27;strange loop&#x27; metaphysics attempts to map consciousness onto self-reference, but is a minority position in philosophy of mind.
* The subgenre of &quot;recursive science fiction&quot; or metafiction is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the New England Science Fiction Association&#x27;s website; some of it is about science-fiction fandom, some about science fiction and its authors.

==In law==
Several constitutions contain self-referential clauses defining how the constitution itself may be amended. An example is Article Five of the United States Constitution.

<text>The Sokal affair, also known as the Sokal hoax, was a demonstrative scholarly hoax performed by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to &quot;Social Text&quot;, an academic journal of cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal&#x27;s intellectual rigor, specifically to investigate whether &quot;a leading North American journal of cultural studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross—[would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors&#x27; ideological preconceptions.&quot;

The article, &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot;, was published in the journal&#x27;s Spring/Summer 1996 &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue. It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. The journal did not practice academic peer review at the time, so it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist. Three weeks after its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in the magazine &quot;Lingua Franca&quot; that the article was a hoax.

The hoax caused controversy about the scholarly merit of commentary on the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general; and academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors or readers of &quot;Social Text&quot;; and whether &quot;Social Text&quot; had abided by proper scientific ethics.

In 2008, Sokal published &quot;Beyond the Hoax&quot;, which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications.

== Background ==

In an interview on the U.S. radio program &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading &quot;Higher Superstition&quot; (1994), in which authors Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt claim that some humanities journals will publish anything as long as it has &quot;the proper leftist thought&quot; and quoted (or was written by) well-known leftist thinkers.

Gross and Levitt had been defenders of the philosophy of scientific realism, opposing postmodernist academics who questioned scientific objectivity. They asserted that anti-intellectual sentiment in liberal arts departments (especially English departments) caused the increase of deconstructionist thought, which eventually resulted in a deconstructionist critique of science. They saw the critique as a &quot;repertoire of rationalizations&quot; for avoiding the study of science.

== Article ==
Sokal reasoned that if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct, the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it. What would matter would be ideological obsequiousness, fawning references to deconstructionist writers, and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon. After the article was published and the hoax revealed, he wrote:
The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy. The editors of &quot;Social Text&quot; liked my article because they liked its conclusion: that &quot;the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project&quot; [sec. 6]. They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion.
=== Content of the article ===
&quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot; proposed that quantum gravity has progressive political implications, and that the &quot;morphogenetic field&quot; could be a valid theory of quantum gravity. (A morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by Rupert Sheldrake in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair&#x27;s aftermath as &quot;a bizarre New Age idea&quot;) Sokal wrote that the concept of &quot;an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being&quot; was &quot;dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook&quot;.

After referring skeptically to the &quot;so-called scientific method&quot;, the article declared that &quot;it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical &#x27;reality is fundamentally &quot;a social and linguistic construct.&quot; It went on to state that because scientific research is &quot;inherently theory-laden and self-referential&quot;, it &quot;cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities&quot;, and that therefore a &quot;liberatory science&quot; and an &quot;emancipatory mathematics&quot;, spurning &quot;the elite caste canon of &#x27;high science, needed to be established for a &quot;postmodern science [that] provide[s] powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project.&quot;

Moreover, the article&#x27;s footnotes conflate academic terms with sociopolitical rhetoric, e.g.:
=== Publication ===
Sokal submitted the article to &quot;Social Text&quot;, whose editors were collecting articles for the &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue. &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries&quot; was notable as an article by a natural scientist; biologist Ruth Hubbard also had an article in the issue. Later, after Sokal revealed the hoax in &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;, &quot;Social Text&quot; editors wrote that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make, and had had concerns about the quality of the writing: &quot;We requested him (a) to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and (b) to excise most of his footnotes.&quot; Still, despite calling Sokal a &quot;difficult, uncooperative author&quot;, and noting that such writers were &quot;well known to journal editors&quot;, based on Sokal&#x27;s credentials &quot;Social Text&quot; published the article in the May 1996 Spring/Summer &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue. The editors did not seek peer review of the article by physicists or otherwise; they later defended this decision on the basis that &quot;Social Text&quot; was a journal of open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to physics.

== Responses ==

=== Follow-up between Sokal and the editors ===
In the article &quot;A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies&quot; in the May 1996 issue of &quot;Lingua Franca&quot;, Sokal revealed that &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries&quot; was a hoax and concluded that &quot;Social Text&quot; &quot;felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject&quot; because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias.

In their defense, &quot;Social Text&quot; editors said they believed that Sokal&#x27;s essay &quot;was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field&quot; and that &quot;its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document.&quot; Besides criticizing his writing style, &quot;Social Text&quot; editors accused Sokal of behaving unethically in deceiving them.

Sokal said the editors&#x27; response demonstrated the problem that he sought to identify. &quot;Social Text&quot;, as an academic journal, published the article not because it was faithful, true, and accurate to its subject, but because an &quot;academic authority&quot; had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing. The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation. Sokal remarked:

&quot;Social Text&quot; response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal&#x27;s piece was a parody. Instead, they speculated Sokal&#x27;s admission &quot;represented a change of heart, or a folding of his intellectual resolve&quot;. Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article&#x27;s absurdity was hard to spot:

=== Book by Sokal and Bricmont ===

In 1997, Sokal and Jean Bricmont co-wrote &quot;Impostures intellectuelles&quot; (published in the US as &quot;Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals&#x27; Abuse of Science&quot; and in the UK as &quot;Intellectual Impostures&quot;, 1998). The book featured analysis of extracts from established intellectuals&#x27; writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology. It closed with a critical summary of postmodernism and criticism of the strong programme of social constructionism in the sociology of scientific knowledge.

In 2008, Sokal published a followup book, &quot;Beyond the Hoax&quot;, which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications.

=== Jacques Derrida ===
The French philosopher Jacques Derrida, whose 1966 statement about Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity was quoted in Sokal&#x27;s paper, was singled out for criticism, particularly in U.S. newspaper coverage of the hoax. One weekly magazine used two images of him, a photo and a caricature, to illustrate a &quot;dossier&quot; on Sokal&#x27;s paper. Arkady Plotnitsky commented: Even given Derrida&#x27;s status as an icon of intellectual controversy on the Anglo-American cultural scene, it is remarkable that out of thousands of pages of Derrida&#x27;s published works, a single extemporaneous remark on relativity made in 1966 (before Derrida was &quot;the Derrida&quot; and, in a certain sense, even before &quot;deconstruction&quot;) ... is made to stand for nearly all of deconstructive or even postmodernist (not a term easily, if at all, applicable to Derrida) treatments of science.
Derrida later responded to the hoax in &quot;&quot; (&quot;Sokal and Bricmont Aren&#x27;t Serious&quot;), first published on November 20, 1997, in . He called Sokal&#x27;s action &quot;sad&quot; for having trivialized Sokal&#x27;s mathematical work and &quot;ruining the chance to carefully examine controversies&quot; about scientific objectivity. Derrida then faulted him and Bricmont for what he considered &quot;an act of intellectual bad faith&quot; in their follow-up book, &#x27;: they had published two articles almost simultaneously, one in English in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; on October 17, 1997 and one in French in &#x27; on October 18–19, 1997, but while the two articles were almost identical, they differed in how they treated Derrida.

The English-language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal&#x27;s and Bricmont&#x27;s book: &quot;Such well-known thinkers as Althusser, Barthes, and Foucault—who, as readers of the TLS will be well aware, have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel—appear in our book only in a minor role, as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize.&quot; The French-language list, however, included Derrida: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Famous thinkers such as Althusser, Barthes, Derrida and Foucault are essentially absent from our book&quot;).

According to Brian Reilly, Derrida may also have been sensitive to another difference between the French and English versions of &quot;Impostures intellectuelles&quot;. In the French, his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an &quot;isolated&quot; instance of abuse, whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida&#x27;s work contained &quot;no systematic misuse (or indeed attention to) science&quot;.

Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was &quot;banal&quot;. Nevertheless, Derrida concluded that Sokal was not serious in his method, but had used the spectacle of a &quot;quick practical joke&quot; to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.

=== Criticism of social sciences ===
Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner, chairman of Cornell University&#x27;s science and technology studies department, wrote &quot;The Sokal Affair in Context&quot; (1997), comparing Sokal&#x27;s hoax to &quot;Confirmational Response: Bias Among Social Work Journals&quot; (1990), an article by William M. Epstein published in &quot;Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values&quot;. Epstein used a similar method to Sokal&#x27;s, submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response. Though much more systematic than Sokal&#x27;s work, it received scant media attention. Hilgartner argued that the &quot;asymmetric&quot; effect of the successful Sokal hoax compared with Epstein&#x27;s experiment cannot be attributed to its quality, but that &quot;[t]hrough a mechanism that resembles confirmatory bias, audiences may apply less stringent standards of evidence and ethics to attacks on targets that they are predisposed to regard unfavorably.&quot; As a result, according to Hilgartner, though competent in terms of method, Epstein&#x27;s experiment was largely muted by the more socially accepted social work discipline he critiqued, while Sokal&#x27;s attack on cultural studies, despite lacking experimental rigor, was accepted. Hilgartner also argued that Sokal&#x27;s hoax reinforced the views of well-known pundits such as George Will and Rush Limbaugh, so that his opinions were amplified by media outlets predisposed to agree with his argument.

The Sokal Affair extended from academia to the public press. Anthropologist Bruno Latour, who was criticized in &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;, described the scandal as a &quot;tempest in a teacup&quot;. Retired Northeastern University mathematician-turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays criticizing the statements of Sokal and his allies, arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized, rendering their criticism meaningless. In &quot;Social Studies of Science&quot;, Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg, denouncing his representations of their work and criticizing his commentary about the &quot;strong programme&quot; of the sociology of science. Stolzenberg replied in the same issue that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings. He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments of each party, bearing in mind that &quot;the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true&quot;.

== Influence ==

=== Sociological follow-up study ===
In 2009, Cornell sociologist Robb Willer performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal&#x27;s paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic. He found that students who believed the paper&#x27;s author was a high-status intellectual rated it better in quality and intelligibility.

=== Sokal III ===
In October 2021, the scholarly journal &quot;Higher Education Quarterly&quot; published a bogus article &quot;authored&quot; by &quot;Sage Owens&quot; and &quot;Kal Avers-Lynde III&quot;. The initials stand for &quot;Sokal III&quot;. The &quot;Quarterly&quot; retracted the article.

<doc id="28551" wikidata="Q4260251" url="?curid=28551" title="Sweet tea">
<text>Sweet tea, also known as sweet iced tea, is a popular style of iced tea commonly consumed in the United States (especially the South) and Indonesia. Sweet tea is most commonly made by adding sugar or simple syrup to black tea while the tea is either brewing or still hot, although artificial sweeteners are also frequently used. Sweet tea is almost always served ice cold. It may sometimes be flavored, most commonly with lemon but also with peach, raspberry, or mint. The drink is sometimes tempered with baking soda to reduce its acidity. Although sweet tea may be brewed with a lower sugar and calorie content than most fruit juices and sodas, it is not unusual to find sweet tea with a sugar level as high as 22 degrees Brix, or per of liquid, a level twice that of Coca-Cola.

Sweet tea is regarded as an important regional staple in the cuisine of the Southern United States and Indonesia. The availability of sweet tea in restaurants and other establishments is popularly used as an indicator to gauge whether an area can be considered part of the South.

==History==

=== United States ===
Sweet tea began as an item of luxury due to the expensive nature of its basic ingredients: tea, ice, and sugar. Ice was possibly the most valued of the ingredients since it had to be shipped from afar at a time when access to cool drinking water was already a relative luxury. In modern times, sweet tea can be made in large quantities quickly and inexpensively.

The oldest known recipe for sweet tea was published in a community cookbook called &quot;Housekeeping in Old Virginia&quot; (copyright 1878) by Marion Cabell Tyree. The recipe called for green tea, since most sweet tea consumed during this period was green tea. However, during World War II, the major sources of green tea were cut off from the United States due to the Japanese invasion and occupation of green tea–producing regions. As an alternative, green tea was replaced with black tea from British India. By the end of World War II, black tea had become the tea most drunk by Americans. Sweet tea was once consumed as a punch mixed with liquor and flavorings of mint and cream. The modern mint julep evolved from this punch.

In 2003, supposedly as an April Fool&#x27;s joke, the Georgia State House of Representatives introduced a bill making it a &quot;...misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature&quot; to sell iced tea in a restaurant that did not also offer sweet iced tea on the menu. The bill never went to a vote.

===Indonesia===
Tea drinking in Indonesia began during the Dutch colonial rule. In the 17th century, the Dutch brought tea plants to Batavia via Sukabumi Beach. Tea plants were subsequently planted in Indonesia which were suitable to West Java. At the same time, in Central Java, sugar cane cultivation was successfully introduced. The ready availability of the two ingredients led to development of sweet tea, which remains the most popular beverage in the country.

<doc id="28553" wikidata="Q381416" url="?curid=28553" title="Cuisine of the Southern United States">
<text>The cuisine of the Southern United States encompasses diverse food traditions of several subregions, including cuisine of Southeastern Native American tribes, Tidewater, Appalachian, Ozarks, Lowcountry, Cajun, Creole, African American cuisine and Floribbean, Spanish, French, British, Ulster-Scots and German cuisine. In recent history, elements of Southern cuisine have spread to other parts of the United States, influencing other types of American cuisine.

Many elements of Southern cooking—tomatoes, squash, corn (and its derivatives, such as hominy and grits), and deep-pit barbecuing—are borrowings from Indigenous peoples of the region (e.g., Cherokee, Caddo, Choctaw, and Seminole). From the Old World, European colonists introduced sugar, flour, milk, eggs, and livestock, along with a number of vegetables; meanwhile, enslaved West Africans trafficked to the North American colonies through the Atlantic slave trade introduced black-eyed peas, okra, eggplant, sesame, sorghum, melons, and various spices. Rice also became prominent in many dishes in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina because the enslaved people who settled the region (now known as the Gullah people), were already quite familiar with the crop.

Many Southern foodways are local adaptations of Old World traditions. In Appalachia, many Southern dishes are Scottish or British Border in origin. For instance, the South&#x27;s fondness for a full breakfast derives from the British full breakfast or fry-up. Pork, once considered informally taboo in Scotland, has taken the place of lamb and mutton. Instead of chopped oats, Southerners have traditionally eaten grits, a porridge normally made from coarsely ground, nixtamalized maize, also known as hominy.

Certain regions have been infused with different Old World traditions. Louisiana Creole cuisine draws upon vernacular French cuisine, West African cuisine, and Spanish cuisine; Floribbean cuisine is Spanish-based with obvious Caribbean influences; and Tex-Mex has considerable Mexican and Indigenous influences with its abundant use of New World vegetables (e.g. corn, tomatoes, squash, and peppers) and barbecued meat. In Southern Louisiana, West African influences have persisted in dishes such as gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice.

==History==

===Indigenous cuisine before colonization===
Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American cuisine that have been blended with the methods of early Europeans to form the basis of what is now Southern cuisine. Prior to the 1600s, native peoples lived off the land in very diverse bioregions and had done so for thousands of years, often living a nomadic life where their diet changed with the season.

Many practiced a form of agriculture revolving around the Three Sisters, the rotation of beans, maize, and squash as staples of their diet. Wild game was equally a staple of nearly every tribe: generally, deer, elk, and bison were staples, as were rabbits and hare. The Cherokee of the Southern Appalachians used blowguns made of an indigenous type of bamboo to hunt squirrels.

Though a less important staple, potatoes were also adopted from Native American cuisine and have been used in many ways similar to corn. Native Americans introduced the first non-Native American Southerners to many other vegetables still familiar on southern tables. Squash, pumpkin, many types of beans, many types of peppers, and sassafras all came to the settlers via Indigenous peoples. The Virginia Algonquian word &quot;pawcohiccora&quot; means hickory-nut meat or a nut milk drink made from it.

Many fruits are available in this region. Muscadines, blackberries, raspberries, and many other wild berries were part of Southern Native Americans&#x27; diet.

===Colonial era 1513 to 1776 and Antebellum era 1776 to 1861===

Southern food have influences from Native American, European, and West African cuisines and foods. From corn Southeastern Native American tribes made grits, cornmeal mush, corn chowder, hush puppies, and cornbread that were adapted by European settlers and enslaved Africans cuisine called soul food. Another Native American influence in Southern cuisine is fried green tomatoes. Squash was (and continues to be cooked) by Native Americans and has a long shelf life when not cooked, and because of its long shelf-life African Americans and European Americans placed it in their kitchens. An additional Native American influence in Southern cuisine is the use of maple syrup. Indigenous people used maple syrup to sweeten and add flavor to dishes; this influenced the foodways of enslaved Africans and European settlers as they used maple syrup to sweeten their dishes and poured syrup over pancakes and other breakfast foods.

Other Indigenous influences are dried meats, smoked fish, and preparing meals with deer, rabbit, turtle, catfish, and eating local strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and cranberries. A few of these foods are potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, chilies, tomatoes, squash, pumpkins, peanuts, pineapple, avocado, papaya, pecans, and chocolate. Foods cultivated by Indigenous people in the Western Hemisphere influenced Southern and global cuisine.

The first European nation to colonize the mainland portion of North America was Spain in the early 16th century in the year 1513 under Juan Ponce de León. In the year 1565, Spanish explorer Pedro Menéndez de Avilés established a settlement in St. Augustine, Florida and was accompanied by free and enslaved Africans. Two Spanish expeditions encountered the Apalachee in the first half of the 16th century. The expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez entered the Apalachee domain in 1528, and arrived at a village, which Narváez believed was the main settlement in Apalachee. The Apalachee Indigenous people influenced the foodways of Spanish colonists in Florida. Apalachee people prepared meals with hunted animals such as deer, rabbit, raccoon, and turkey (a bird indigenous to North America). They grew in their gardens corn, beans, squash, and sunflowers, and foraged for wild berries and nuts. From these food sources the Apalachee made stews and sweet flavored dishes. Spanish colonists enjoyed Native American cacina tea and turkey.

New Spain was in the present-day southern states of Florida and Louisiana. An article from the Florida Department of State explains the influence of the Spaniards in Southern cuisine: &quot;The Spanish brought many foods to Florida (and the Americas) that are commonly eaten today. One major change to the landscape of Florida was the Spanish introduction of domesticated animals to provide favored meats, like beef, pork, and chicken! Olive oil and wine (brought over to the colonies in large earthenware jars) were essential staples for any Spanish kitchen. Fruits (like peaches, figs, and watermelons), nuts and beans (like almonds, field peas, and garbonzo beans) and spices (like saffron, cinnamon, and different types of peppers) were brought to Florida from all over the world.&quot;

The British established a permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. They brought their food traditions from London that influenced Southern cuisine. British cuisine has cured and aged ham and English bread. These foods were augmented in colonial Jamestown with North American ingredients. For example, the ham dishes in Britain became Virginia hams, and English breads became hot breads and other sweets. However, the predominant cooks in Virginia&#x27;s kitchens were enslaved African Americans. Enslaved cooks in white plantation homes combined food traditions from West Africa with Native American and European cooking methods and prepared new dishes that influenced Southern cuisine, such as fried okra.

The origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has been traced to precedents in Scottish and West African cuisine. Scottish fried chicken was battered with seasonings and cooked in lard, later West African fried chicken added different seasonings, and was battered and cooked in palm oil. Scottish frying and seasoning techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in the American South by enslaved Africans. At Monticello in Virginia, President Thomas Jefferson noted how the enslaved prepared meals with the African crop sesame seeds. Enslaved people ate sesame raw, toasted, or boiled and prepared stews, baked breads, boiled their greens with sesame seeds, and made sesame pudding. European colonists used sesame seeds to make baked breads.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, English colonists in Virginia came into contact with Powhatan Indigenous people and adapted corn into their cuisine and Johnny cakes, corn pone, and fry bread became a part of their diet. English settlers at Jamestown were not prepared on how to survive in Virginia&#x27;s wilderness. Settlers experienced the &quot;starving time&quot; in the winter of 1609 to 1610. Powhatan people taught the English how to hunt, fish and grow corn to survive. The food and survival skills English settlers learned from Natives became a part of their diet and cuisine. However, most Jamestown&#x27;s residents did not survive that winter because of dwindling food supplies.

Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia was founded in 1632 by the English. Historians at Colonial Williamsburg researched colonial records and found what colonists in Williamsburg ate. The dishes colonial cooks prepared for Williamsburg&#x27;s upper class were roast pigeon, fried ox tongue, mince pies, made meat dishes from beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and fish with vegetables, and made baked breads. For beverages they drank coffee, tea and chocolate. An article in the newspaper, &quot;The Warren Record,&quot; explains the influence of the English and Scottish on Southern American food: &quot;English settlers in the South baked yeast bread, made savory puddings and drank beer...&quot; &quot;Settlers from lowland Scotland brought with them a tradition of cooking a kale soup and drinking distilled beverages.&quot;

English and Scottish settlers introduced biscuits into Southern breakfast. In England and Ireland people ate biscuits as part of a meal and were taken aboard ships during long voyages because they lasted longer and did not spoil like other foods. In the Southern United States, Americans evolved the recipe and made fluffier biscuits and poured gravy, honey and jam over them which became a popular breakfast item. Biscuits were an economical food for Southerners after the mid-19th century as they were made with simple ingredients of flour, baking powder, salt, butter, and milk.

In 1614, the Dutch established several settlements in Maryland and other Northern colonies. Dutch colonists introduced pancakes, waffles, doughnuts, cookies, coleslaw and pretzels into the cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies. Colonial records showed Dutch people brought their waffle irons from the Netherlands to colonial America. The English and Dutch introduced pies and Dutch settlers introduced deep-dish crust pie recipes which enslaved African Americans and other Southerners adapted into their cuisine. The first documented pie recipe in Colonial America was in 1675; it was a pumpkin pie recipe modified from British spiced and boiled squash. European settlers prepared pies because they preserved food. They made meat and sweet pies using local ingredients and other ingredients from foreign countries. An article from Southern Living Magazine explains the history of the Southern American pie tradition: &quot;The mixture of eggs, butter, sugar, vanilla, and flour made its way to the American South from England. It became popular in Virginia and has had many incarnations, from the Classic Chess Pie to fruity versions, like Lemon Chess Pie.&quot;

Enslaved Africans influence in Southern cuisine are food items from West Africa such as okra, black-eyed peas, one-pot rice cooking methods to make stews that influenced the making of gumbo and jambalaya, and adding a variety of spices and hot and sweet sauces to Southern dishes. West-Central Africans were trafficked to the South as early as 1526 under Spanish explorers to the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia called San Miguel de Gualdape, and enslaved people from Angola were brought to colonial Virginia in 1619. Other foods brought from West Africa during the slave trade that influenced Southern cuisine were guinea pepper, gherkin, sesame seeds, kola nuts, eggplant, watermelon, rice, and cantaloupe.

Gullah Geechee people in the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia influenced some of the Southern rice-based dishes. West Africans in the rice growing regions of present-day Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Liberia cultivated African rice for about 3,000 years. African rice is a species related to, yet distinct from, Asian rice. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River. Once Carolinian and Georgian planters in the American South discovered that African rice would grow in that region, they often sought enslaved Africans from rice-growing regions because they had the skills and knowledge needed to develop and build irrigation, dams and earthworks. The rice-based dished created by Gullah people are Charleston red rice and Hoppin&#x27; John. Enslaved African Americans grew collard greens in their gardens. They incorporated collards in their soups and stews a tradition that came from West Africa. As the National Museum of African American History and Culture explained that African Americans in the American South spread the recipe of collard greens to other parts of the United States when they left the South during the Great Migration.

The French established a permanent settlement in the South in present-day New Orleans, Louisiana in 1718. French colonists relied on Indigenous people to survive. As historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall explained how the French learned from the Chitimacha and other Indigenous people about the flora and fauna, topography of the land, how to build boats and navigate the waters, how to preserve food, and cultivate corn, squash, potatoes, and other indigenous crops. The first enslaved Africans to arrive in Louisiana came in 1719 aboard two slave ships that brought several barrels of rice seeds. African rice became a staple in Louisiana cuisine cultivated by enslaved people from West Africa&#x27;s rice growing regions.

French people incorporated roux into Louisiana cuisine that influenced the making of gumbo. Another French influence is mirepoix made with carrots, celery, and onion that became a Creole and Cajun version in Louisiana called the &quot;holy trinity&quot; made with bell peppers, celery and onions. Indigenous peoples of Louisiana during the colonial period (and into present day) made fry bread and Indian tacos. They also prepared meals with hunted animals such as turkey and deer and caught fish. Native Americans in Louisiana influenced the foodways of African Americans and European Americans as non-Natives prepared their meals with turkey, cornbread, and other Indigenous staples.

Spaniards and enslaved West Africans influenced the making of jambalaya in New Orleans. Some historians suggest jambalaya has its roots in West African cuisine. The French introduced the tomato (a food native to the Americas) to West Africans, and they incorporated the food into their one-pot rice cooking meals and enhanced jollof rice and created jambalaya. Author Ibraham Seck, director of research at the Whitney Plantation Slave Museum in St. John the Baptist Parish, suggests jambalaya originated on the Senegalese coast of West Africa. Senegalese people had knowledge of rice cultivation and created dishes using rice and meats that were brought to Louisiana during the era of the slave trade. About sixty percent of enslaved Africans brought to Louisiana came from Senegambia. Senegambians had knowledge of rice cultivation and prepared meals using rice and other grains adding meat and vegetables into one pot. An article from the United Nations states that the cuisines of Nigeria, Senegal, Guinea, and Benin influenced the development of jambalaya: &quot;Jambalaya (mixed rice, meat and vegetables), feijoada (black beans and meat), gombo(okra), and hopping johns (peas) are all dishes that have been re-adapted from Senegal, Nigeria, Guinea and Benin. You will find variations of these dishes in America and the Caribbean region.&quot;

German immigrants came to colonial America beginning in 1608 and helped to start the colony of Jamestown, Virginia and established settlements in the Shenandoah Valley. They brought their food traditions from Germany and influenced cuisine in America. The classic southern dish chicken and dumplings have origins in German cuisine. &quot;...the famous southern dish, Chicken and Dumplings, received its birth from the German influence of Spaetzel, which are small potato dumplings, even smaller than its Italian cousin, gnocchi.&quot; Other German influences are liver beef dishes, German sausages, and liver dumplings. German people also influenced cuisine in Louisiana after their arrival to the colony in 1722. For example, &quot;German sausage making is called andouille. Andouille sausage is a combination of pork, pork fat, salt, garlic, red pepper and black pepper, all packed into a sausage casing, which is smoked over sugar cane and pecan logs. When smoked, the sausage becomes very dark in color.&quot; This method of preparation of sausage is found in between St. Charles and St. John Baptist parishes. German foods such as marinated meats, pastries, sour flavors, and wursts were assimilated into the Southern diet and they became classic American foods that are eaten today in the form of hot dogs and hamburgers.

The Southern side dish potato salad have German influences. An article from South Carolina National Public Radio (NPR) explains:

 Culinary historians do not know who added mayonnaise to potato salad. Mayonnaise became available to purchase in the early 1900s. By the 1920s and 1930s, people were adding mayonnaise to potato salad.

===American Civil War (1861 to 1865)===
During the American Civil War, food supplies were limited for Union and Confederate soldiers. Civil War soldiers received limited food rations which consisted of bread, coffee, salt pork, hard bread, a pound of beef or pork and a pound of bread or flour, and sometimes extras which included dried beans or peas, rice, vinegar, and molasses. Historians found that a lot of food was fried during the Civil War. An article from the Florida Department of State explains the soldier&#x27;s diet: &quot;The most common form of hard bread, was called hardtack, a basic wheat biscuit that did not easily decay and could survive a rough march. It was extremely hard, and was often soaked in water, coffee, or in meat fat to soften it enough to eat. Other items, such as beans, peas, rice, coffee, sugar, or salt, were also issued, but not on a daily basis.&quot; Enslaved African Americans prepared meals for wealthy Confederate soldiers. In Union camps, contraband of war (Freedmen) and other cooks prepared meals for the Union army. Over time, rations between Union and Confederate armies varied as Confederate rations were reduced in wheat and livestock because of a Union blockade that prevented the Confederates from obtaining food and supplies.

Hardtack was not available to many Confederates because it was made from wheat, and wheat was not grown in many Southern states except for Georgia and Virginia. Cornbread replaced the hardtack rations in the Confederate army. Confederate soldiers made Johnnie cakes and &quot;corn dodgers&quot; that was similar to hardtack. In addition, they made fried flatbread and balls of cornmeal called &quot;flapjacks&quot; cooked over an open fire, and ate bacon, imitation coffee, and molasses. In some Southern hospitals patients ate dried fruit, potatoes, mush, beef, chicken soup, and bread. Despite limited rations, some Union soldiers were able to make hearty meals. The meals prepared were &quot;...chicken fricassee, mushroom ketchup (a condiment made by boiling mushrooms), a beef-and-potato stew, cornish game hens and ham and beans.&quot; Union and Confederates foraged for food when rations were low and cooked the fresh food they found. They also ate desiccated vegetables which were dehydrated and compressed vegetables into one inch by one-foot rectangular bricks that were made from string beans, turnips, carrots, beets, and onions. Other vegetables were packed into cakes, dried, and boiled for consumption.

===Post antebellum era===
Interest in American regional cooking continued to grow after the Civil War, especially concerning the traditions of the Southern United States. Many new cookbooks were added to the existing body of literature. Some of these fell within the scope of domestic manuals offering instruction to southern homemakers to the maintenance of homes in the new post-Slavery era. Some of these works like Mary Stuart Smith&#x27;s &quot;Virginia Cookery Book&quot; (1885) aimed to preserve the culinary heritage of the South. Recipes made by former slaves were published in African-American cookbooks after the Civil War. The earliest such cookbook was self-published in 1866 by Malinda Russell as a pamphlet titled, &quot;A Domestic Cookbook: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen&quot;. A cookbook published in 1900 in the city of Charleston, South Carolina had recipes used by formerly enslaved Gullah people. Benne seeds from &quot;sesame&quot;, a plant native to West Africa, were eaten raw with sugar or milk. Enslaved people also made cakes, wafers, and brittles from them for white plantation families.

In the Appalachian region, 19th-century meals included greens fried in bear grease, elk backstrap steaks and venison stew. Ashcakes were cornbread cooked directly on hearth coals. Cornbread was the most common bread in the mountains, and still remains a staple. As wheat flour and baking powder/baking soda became available in the late 19th century, buttermilk biscuits became popular. Today, buttermilk biscuits and sausage gravy are the classic Appalachian breakfast; they are also a common breakfast everywhere where Appalachian people have emigrated. Both North Carolina and West Virginia have statewide biscuit chain restaurants; many Southern or originally-Southern chains offer biscuits and gravy, and when McDonald&#x27;s introduced a new breakfast menu selling either Egg McMuffins (with English muffins) or a variant with biscuits, the biscuit zone was practically a map of the South with the exception of Virginia, Maryland, and Florida.

The American hot dog originated from German sausages called &quot;frankfurts&quot; in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. Sausages in Germany were served without bread. Charles L Feltman was a German immigrant and came to Coney Island, New York in 1856 and served sausages wrapped in a bun beginning in 1867. This method of eating sausages later spread across America making its way into the Southern states and are eaten at baseball games. Southerners make different versions of hot dogs, giving them a southern flavor. Some Southern hot dogs have brown sugar mustard as a topping. In Huntsville, Alabama, hot dogs are served with chili and ketchup-slaw. In Mobile, Alabama, hot dogs are served on a toasted bun with a mustard-based coleslaw.

===Other cultural influences===
Since the 20th century into present day, immigrants from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and other European countries brought their cuisines to the South and influenced southern cuisine. An article from &quot;Time Magazine&quot; explains: &quot;...immigrants and their American-born sons and daughters have helped transform the perception of Southern cuisine into something beyond biscuits and gravy and mint juleps. Southern food is now kebabs in Nashville&#x27;s Little Kurdistan, one of the largest enclaves of Kurds in the U.S. It&#x27;s Greek diners across Alabama and Ethiopian restaurants standing next to Salvadoran pupuserías in Virginia. In rural towns that have seen their populations decline, it&#x27;s the Chinese or Mexican restaurant that took over former greasy spoons while preserving them as de facto community centers. And in reborn urban centers, it&#x27;s the Michelin-approved fine-dining restaurants where chefs have fused techniques from India, Laos and Nigeria with the staples of the Southern canon.&quot;

Mexican food culture influence on Southern cuisine is tacos. Texas was once a part of Mexico until it declared independence on March 2, 1836, and became a US state in 1845. Tex-Mex food is a fusion of Texas cuisine with Northern Mexican. Tacos in Texas have barbecued meats from pork, chicken, brisket, vegetables, and Mexican salsa. Indigenous people of Texas hunted pronghorn, deer, rabbits, turkeys, and quail. They made flour from ground acorns and mesquite pods. The Indigenous nations of the Antelope Creek in the Panhandle, the Caddo in East Texas, and the Jornada Mogollon near El Paso influenced Southern foodways as venison, catfish, and pecans are staples in Texas cuisine. The Tejanos are a multiethnic people of Spanish and Native American heritage, and their food influenced Texas cuisine. A common dish in Texas is chili con carne made with cumin, black pepper, garlic, onion, and beef are all foreign imported foods, and the chiles come from Mexico. Tamale is a dish native to Central America and Mexico. The Tejanos&#x27; Indigenous ancestors brought tamales to Texas.

===Southern food in restaurants===
Chains serving Southern foods—often along with American comfort food—have had great success; many have spread across the country or across the world, while others have chosen to stay in the South. Pit barbecue is popular all over the American South; unlike the rest of the country, most of the rural South has locally owned, non-franchise pit-barbecue restaurants, many serving the regional style of barbecue instead of the nationally predominant Kansas City style. Family-style restaurants serving Southern cuisine are common throughout the South, and range from the humble and down-home to the decidedly upscale. 

During the civil rights movement, soul food restaurants were places where civil rights leaders and activists met to discuss and strategize civil rights protests and ideas for implementing social and political change. Paschal&#x27;s Restaurant in Atlanta, like Georgia Gilmore&#x27;s eatery in Montgomery, had an important part in the civil rights movement. Upon returning to Atlanta from Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr. got permission &quot;to bring his team members and guests to Paschal&#x27;s to eat, meet, rest, plan, and strategize.&quot;

==Traditional Southern dishes==

A traditional Southern meal may include pan-fried chicken, field peas (such as black-eyed peas), greens (such as collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, or poke sallet), mashed potatoes, cornbread or corn pone, sweet tea, and dessert—typically a pie (sweet potato, chess, shoofly, pecan, and peach are the most common), or a cobbler (peach, blackberry, sometimes apple in Kentucky or Appalachia).

Other Southern foods include grits, country ham, hushpuppies, beignets (in the Gulf South), Southern styles of succotash, brisket, meatloaf, chicken fried steak, buttermilk biscuits (may be served with butter, jelly, fruit preserves, honey, gravy or sorghum molasses), pimento cheese, boiled or baked sweet potatoes, pit barbecue, fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, macaroni and cheese, bread pudding, okra (principally fried okra that has been dredged in cornmeal, but also steamed, stewed, sauteed, or pickled), , and pinto beans.

===Barbecue===
&quot;White barbecue sauce&quot; made with mayonnaise, pepper and vinegar is a specialty of Alabama barbecue usually served with smoked barbecue chicken.

&quot;Yellow barbecue sauce&quot; made with a mustard base is unique to South Carolina barbecue and has roots in the mass immigration of Germans to the area in the mid-1700s.

For barbecue in the United States, each Southern locale has its own variety of barbecue, particularly sauces. In recent years, the regional variations have blurred as restaurants and consumers experiment and adapt the styles of other regions. South Carolina is the only state that traditionally features all four recognized barbecue sauces, including mustard-based, vinegar-based, and light and heavy tomato-based sauces. North Carolina sauces vary by region; eastern North Carolina uses a vinegar-based sauce, the center of the state uses Lexington-style barbecue, with a combination of ketchup and vinegar as its base, and western North Carolina uses a heavier ketchup base. Memphis barbecue is best known for tomato- and vinegar-based sauces. In some Memphis establishments and in Kentucky, meat is rubbed with dry seasoning (dry rubs) and smoked over hickory wood without sauce. The finished barbecue is then served with barbecue sauce on the side.

===Fried chicken===
Fried chicken is among the region&#x27;s best-known exports. It is believed that the Scots, and later Scottish immigrants to many southern states had a tradition of deep frying chicken in fat, unlike their English counterparts who baked or boiled chicken. However, some sources trace the origin of fried chicken to Southern and Western England where most of the Early settlers to the South came from. They conclude that Southern and Western England had a strong tradition of frying, simmering, and sautéing meats in a skillet as opposed to East Anglia which favored baking and boiling meats.

The importance of fried chicken to southern cuisine is apparent through the multiple traditions and different adaptations of fried chicken, such as KFC; Nashville&#x27;s Prince&#x27;s Hot Chicken Shack; or the Cajun-inspired Bojangles&#x27; Famous Chicken &#x27;n Biscuits and Popeyes Chicken.

===Pork and ham===
Pork is an integral part of the cuisine. Stuffed ham is served in Southern Maryland. A traditional holiday get-together featuring whole hog barbecue is known in Virginia and the Carolinas as a &quot;pig pickin&#x27;&quot;.

Green beans are often flavored with bacon and salt pork, turnip greens are stewed with pork and served with vinegar, ham biscuits (biscuits cut in half with slices of salt ham served between the halves) often accompany breakfast, and ham with red-eye gravy or country gravy is a common dinner dish.

Country ham, a heavily salt-cured ham, is common across the Southern United States, with the most well-known being the Virginia-originating Smithfield ham.

Pig feet, often called trotters, are perhaps less common because they are considered a southern delicacy, but can be prepared in a variety of ways. They are most often either pickled in white vinegar or braised in a mixture of sweet and smoky flavors, but can also be deep-fried, grilled, and stewed. They are usually served among other soul dishes such as yams, cornbread, and collard greens.

===Vegetables===
Southern meals sometimes consist only of vegetables, with a little meat (especially salt pork) used in cooking but with no meat dish served. &quot;Beans and greens&quot;—white or brown beans served alongside a &quot;mess&quot; of greens stewed with a little bacon—is a traditional meal in many parts of the South (Turnip greens are the typical greens for such a meal; they&#x27;re cooked with some diced turnip and a piece of fatback).

Other low-meat Southern meals include beans and cornbread—the beans being pinto beans stewed with ham or bacon—and Hoppin&#x27; John (black-eyed peas, rice, onions, red or green pepper, and bacon).

Cabbage is largely used as the basis of coleslaw, both as a side dish and on a variety of barbecued and fried meats. Sauteéd red cabbage, flavored with vinegar and sugar, is popular in German-influenced areas of the South such as central Texas.

Butternut squash is common in winter, often prepared as a roasted casserole with butter and honey. Other typical vegetable sides include collard greens and congealed salads. Double stuffed potatoes with barbecue pork, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, mayonnaise and chives are served at barbecue restaurants throughout the South.

The tomato sandwich is associated with Southern cuisine and according to &quot;Yahoo News&quot; is considered an important part of the cuisine. According to Chuck Reece, editor of &quot;Georgia Public Radio&quot;&#x27;s Salvation South, the tomato sandwich is &quot;one thing—&quot;one perfect thing&quot;—about which every Southerner can agree&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the sandwich southerners wait for all year&quot;. Jenn Rice, writing in &quot;Garden &amp; Gun&quot;, says &quot;The taste of tomato slathered in mayo is such a part of our summer memories that it&#x27;s practically part of our DNA.&quot; Kathleen Purvis of the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Of all the foods that define Southernness, the tomato sandwich may be right up there with grits as the true dividing line.&quot; According to &quot;Garden &amp; Gun&quot; it is &quot;the south&#x27;s most beloved sandwich&quot;.

Though usually considered a snack, boiled peanuts are often sold throughout sports games and roadside stands as a southern favorite. This practice was adapted from West African culture and was recorded as early as 1899. It also has cultural significance drawn from the American Civil War with a song titled “Goober peas” from 1866 that reflected its purpose as a ration food.

===Rice===
Country Captain is a regional dish of curry chicken and rice that dates back to at least the 1920s. It became well known after a Columbus, Georgia cook served the dish to then President Franklin D. Roosevelt. George Patton once said &quot;If you can&#x27;t give me a party and have Country Captain, meet me at the train with a bucket of it.&quot;

Red Rice is another staple of Low Country southern cuisine, which is a rice dish simmered in tomato paste, usually cooked with bacon, onion, and other spices

===Sweets and pastries===
Georgia is known for peach cultivation and variations of Peach melba are commonly served as desserts. Chess pie is a traditional pastry made with eggs, butter and sugar or molasses. Bananas foster is a specialty of New Orleans.

===Seafood===
Gulf seafood like black grouper, shrimp and swordfish can be found, and &quot;channel catfish&quot; (&quot;Ictalurus punctatus&quot;) farmed locally in the Mississippi Delta region is especially popular in Oxford, Mississippi. Fried catfish battered in cornmeal is commonly served at local establishments with hot sauce and a side of fries and coleslaw. Oysters Rockefeller is a New Orleans specialty, believed to have originated in the state. Creole dishes like gumbo and jambalaya often feature crawfish, oysters, blue crab and shrimp.

==By region==

Southern cuisine varies widely by region. Generally speaking:
* Appalachian areas have many ramps (a variety of wild onion) and berries. Appalachia uses butter extensively but makes little use of cheese, and eats more wild game (as well as wild fruits and vegetables) than the rest of the South; apples, oats, and potatoes are also common in Appalachian cuisine, since the mountains are cooler and drier than the lowlands.
* The Upper South favors pork and whiskey; the Low Country (the coast, especially coastal Georgia and coastal South Carolina) favors seafood, rice, and grits.
* Texas and Oklahoma tend to prefer beef; the rest of the South prefers pork.
* Arkansas is the top rice-producing state in the nation. It produces Riceland rice and sweet corn, both of which are staples of the cuisine of Southeastern Arkansas. Arkansas is also noted for catfish, pork barbecue at restaurants, and chicken.
* Florida is home of the Key lime pie and swamp cabbage. Orange juice is the well-known beverage of the state. It has a large beef industry, as well as a seafood industry, and both are reflected in local cuisine. Rock shrimp is beloved on the coast, while beef is common in the state&#x27;s interior. Due to its long-term economic and trading relationship with the rest of the Caribbean, a particular form of fusion cuisine known as Floribbean cuisine has developed in the state, a fusion of traditional southern food with Caribbean cuisine, often relying on both peppers and fruit to flavor meat dishes.
* Georgia is known for its peaches, pecans, peanuts, and Vidalia onions.
* In Southern Louisiana, there is Cajun and Creole cuisine. Louisiana is the largest supplier of crawfish in the US.
* Kentucky is famous for Burgoo, beer cheese, and the Hot Brown. Kentucky is also known for KFC and fried chicken.
* Maryland and Virginia are known for their blue and soft-shell crabs, and Smith Island Cake.
* Mississippi and Alabama produce the most catfish in the United States.
* Oklahoma has an official state meal which consists of barbecued pork, chicken fried steak, sausage with biscuits and gravy, fried okra, squash, grits, corn, black-eyed peas, corn bread, strawberries and a slice of pecan pie.
* Carolina-style barbecue is common in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, and is made traditionally from pulled-pork and a vinegar based sauce.
* Southwest Virginia has a reputation for many grain- and bean-based dishes, such as &quot;cornbread and beans&quot; or the breakfast dish biscuits and gravy. Mississippi specializes in farm-raised catfish, found in traditional &quot;fish houses&quot; throughout the state.
* In the coastal areas of South Carolina, rice was an important crop, leading to local specialties like &quot;Hoppin&#x27; John&quot; (a mixture of rice and black-eyed peas flavored with salt pork) and Charleston red rice.
* Tennessee is known for its country ham and Memphis is known for several famous barbecue restaurants and a major barbecue cooking competition held in May. Memphis barbecue usually consists of pork and is distinct for its dry rub. No sauce is applied during the cooking process instead flavor is gained from the rub when cooking. Nashville is known for its famous hot chicken from places like Prince&#x27;s Hot Chicken Shack, Bolton&#x27;s Hot Chicken, Hattie B&#x27;s, and Biscuit Love. Nashville is also home to the restaurant Husk run by world-class chef Sean Brock. 
* Texas specializes in barbecue, chili, and Southern cuisine as well as a regional variation of Mexican food unique to Texas called Tex-Mex.
* Virginia produces Smithfield ham and Virginia peanuts. Brunswick stew, which originated in the town of Brunswick, Virginia is also popular. The state&#x27;s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay and the ideal conditions of the Rappahannock River, makes oysters a popular dish in Virginia, be they served fried, raw, or in a cream-based oyster stew.
* West Virginia is the area where pepperoni rolls are most popular, which typically consists of a white bread roll with pepperoni baked in the middle. The fats in the pepperoni melt into the bread, giving the bread an extra dimension of flavor. Other ingredients are sometimes added, such as cheese, peppers, or melted butter on top. The state also has Tudor&#x27;s Biscuit World restaurants specializing in biscuits and sausage gravy.

===Louisiana Creole cuisine===

Southern Louisiana is geographically part of the South, but its cuisine is probably best understood as having only mild Southern influences. Creole cuisine makes good use of many coastal animals—crawfish (commonly called crayfish outside the region), crab, oysters, shrimp, and saltwater fish. Mirliton (chayote squash), is popular in Louisiana. Coffee blended with Chicory is sometimes preferred over pure ground—especially as an accompaniment to beignets.

===Lowcountry cuisine===
The Lowcountry region of the coastal Carolinas and Georgia shares many of the same food resources as the Upper Gulf Coast: fish, shrimp, oysters, rice, and okra. It also displays some similarities to Creole and Cajun cuisines.

===Appalachian cuisine===

Because of its geographic location, Appalachia cuisine offers a wide range of ingredients and products that can be transformed using traditional methods and contemporary applications. Staples of Appalachian cuisine that are common in other regional cuisines of the south include coconut cream cake, peanut brittle, sweet potato casserole, pork chops, biscuits and gravy, and chicken and dumplings. Basic soul food dishes like collard greens, hominy, cracklings and ham hocks are also common to the Appalachian kitchen.

European fruits—especially apples and pears—can grow in the mountains, and sweet fried apples are a common side dish. Appalachian cuisine also makes use of berries, both native and European, and some parts of the mountains are high enough or far enough north that sugar maple grows there—allowing for maple syrup and maple sugar production. Wild morel mushrooms and ramps (similar to scallions and leeks) are often collected; there are even festivals dedicated to ramps, and they figure in some Appalachian fairy tales. The diet included corn, beans, squash, mixed pickles, milk, cheeses, butter, cream, tea, and coffee.

Salt, a necessity for life, was always available (much of it coming from Saltville, Virginia), and local seasonings like spicebush were certainly known and used; but the only other seasonings used in the mountains are black pepper and flaked red pepper, along with a little use of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves around Christmas. Gunpowder seasoning is also popular in the Appalachian region, often made from activated charcoal, dehydrated onion and garlic, paprika, salt, sugar, corn starch, and sunflower oil. Its ‘smoky’ flavor is commonly used as a dry rub, making it perfect for regional game as well as a variety of grilled vegetables such as bell peppers, white onion, and yellow squash.  

Coffee, drunk without milk and only lightly sweetened, is a basic drink in Appalachia, often consumed with every meal; in wartime, chicory was widely used as a coffee substitute.

Rice and cane sugar, grown further south, were not easy to come by in Appalachia and generally sorghum, honey and maple syrup were used as sweetener in local dishes. Travel distances, conditions, and poor roads limited most early settlements to foods that could be grown or produced locally.

For farmers, pigs and chickens were the primary source of meat, with many farmers maintaining their own smokehouses to produce a variety of hams, bacon, and sausages. Seafood, beyond the occasionally locally caught fresh-water fish (pan-fried catfish is much loved, as is trout in the mountains of western North Carolina, East Tennessee, and Southwest Virginia) and crawfish, were unavailable until modern times.

However, Appalachia did offer a wide variety of wild game, with venison, rabbit and squirrel particularly common, thus helping to compensate for distance from major cities and transportation networks. The popularity of hunting and fishing in Appalachia means that game and fresh-water fish were often staples of the table. Deer, wild turkey, grouse and other game birds are hunted and utilized in many recipes from barbecue to curing and jerky.

Home canning, of both garden and foraged foods, is a strong tradition in Appalachia as well; mason jars are an everyday sight in mountain life; the most common canned foods are savory vegetables: green beans (half-runners, snaps), shelly beans (green beans that were more mature and had ripe beans along with the green husks), and tomatoes, as well as jam, jelly and local fruits.

Dried pinto beans are a major staple food during the winter months, used to make the ubiquitous ham-flavored bean soup usually called soup beans. Kieffer pears and apple varietals are used to make pear butter and apple butter.

Also popular are bread and butter pickles, fried mustard greens with vinegar, pickled beets, chow-chow (commonly called &quot;chow&quot;), a relish known as corn ketchup and fried green tomatoes; tomatoes are also used in tomato gravy, a variant of sausage gravy with a thinner, lighter roux. A variety of wild fruits like pawpaws, wild blackberries, and persimmons are also commonly available in Appalachia as well.

The gravy for biscuits and gravy is typically sausage or sawmill, not the red-eye gravy (made with coffee) used in the lowland South. Pork drippings from frying sausage, bacon, and other types of pan-fried pork are collected and saved, used for making gravy and in greasing cast-iron cookware. (Appalachia is overwhelmingly Protestant, the Catholic prohibition on meat-eating during Lent had no impact on Appalachian cuisine.)

Chicken and dumplings and fried chicken remain much-loved dishes. Cornbread, corn pone, hominy grits, mush, cornbread pudding and hominy stew are also quite common foods, as corn is the primary grain grown in the Appalachian hills and mountains, but are less common than in the past.

<doc id="28554" wikidata="Q51639" url="?curid=28554" title="Second Coming">
<text>The Second Coming (sometimes called the Second Advent or the Parousia) is the Christian belief that Jesus Christ will return to Earth after his ascension to Heaven (which is said to have occurred about two thousand years ago). The idea is based on messianic prophecies and is part of most Christian eschatologies. Other faiths have various interpretations of it.

==Terminology==
Several different terms are used to refer to the Second Coming of Christ:

In the New Testament, the Greek word ἐπιφάνεια (&quot;epiphaneia&quot;, appearing) is used six times to refer to the return of Christ.

The Greek New Testament uses the Greek term &quot;parousia&quot; (παρουσία, meaning &quot;arrival&quot;, &quot;coming&quot;, or &quot;presence&quot;) 24 times, seventeen of them concerning Christ. However, parousia has the distinct reference to a period of time rather than an instant in time. At , the word &quot;parousia&quot; is used to clearly describe the period of time in which Noah lived. The Greek word &quot;eleusis&quot;, which means &quot;coming&quot;, is not interchangeable with &quot;parousia&quot;. So this parousia or &quot;presence&quot; would be unique and distinct from anything that had occurred before. The word is also used six times referring to individuals (Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus, Titus, and Paul the Apostle) and once referring to the &quot;coming of the lawless one&quot;.

Gustav Adolf Deissmann (1908) showed that the Greek word &quot;parousia&quot; occurred as early as the 3rd century BC to describe the visit of a king or dignitary to a city – a visit arranged in order to show the visitor&#x27;s magnificence to the people.

In Islam, the term Rajʽa () refers to the Second Coming. The term is most commonly used by Shia Muslims.

==Specific date predictions and claims==

Views about the nature of the Second Coming vary among Christian denominations and among individual Christians. Many specific dates have been predicted for the Second Coming, some now in the distant past, others still in the future.

==Christianity==

Most English versions of the Nicene Creed include the following statements:
A 2010 survey showed that about 40% of Americans believe that Jesus is likely to return by 2050. This varies from 58% of white evangelical Christians, through 32% of Catholics to 27% of white mainline Protestants. Belief in the Second Coming was popularised in the US in the late nineteenth century by the evangelist Dwight L. Moody and the premillennial interpretation became one of the core components of Christian fundamentalism in the 1920s.

===Early Christianity===

Jesus told his disciples,

The most common English translation of &quot;genea&quot; is &quot;generation&quot;, which led some to conclude that the Second Coming was to be witnessed by the people living in the same generation as Jesus. According to historian Charles Freeman, early Christians expected Jesus to return within a generation of his death, and the non-occurrence of the second coming surprised them. N. T. Wright disputes this.

In most German Bibles, &quot;genea&quot; is instead translated as &quot;family/lineage&quot; (Geschlecht). Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (slægt, släkte and slekt, respectively). The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word &quot;generation&quot; as it was used in the King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct translation of &quot;genea&quot; in the context of the second coming is &quot;kind of people&quot; (specifically the &quot;good&quot; kind of people; the disciple&#x27;s kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14, the King James version uses &quot;generation&quot; in this wide and outdated sense, when it declares that &quot;God is in the generation of the righteous&quot;. According to Larsen, the &quot;Oxford Universal Dictionary&quot; states that the latest attested use of &quot;genea&quot; in the sense of &quot;class, kind or set of persons&quot; dates from 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of &quot;generation&quot; in the English language has narrowed considerably since then.

Bible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that &quot;genea&quot; is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in the New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24. In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word &quot;genea&quot; here denotes the &quot;bad kind of people&quot;, because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23). He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars who support the different views:

* &quot;This generation&quot; refers to Jesus&#x27;s contemporaries who would witness &quot;all these things&quot; [πάντα ταῦτα] as outlined in verses 4–31, including Jesus&#x27; second coming (Davies &amp; Allison 1997: 367–368; Hare 1993: 281; Maddox 1982: 111–115). Because Jesus&#x27; contemporaries did not witness his second coming, some contend that Jesus erred in his predictions (Luz 2005: 209; cf. Schweitzer 1910: 356–364).
* &quot;This generation&quot; refers to Jesus&#x27;s contemporaries who would witness &quot;all these things&quot; as outlined in verses 4–22 or 4–28, pointing to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE and everything leading up to it. Jesus&#x27; second coming (vv. 29–31) is thus excluded from &quot;all these things&quot; (Blomberg 1992: 364; Carson 1984: 507; France 2007: 930; Hagner 1995: 715).
* &quot;This generation&quot; points to the Ἰουδαῖοι [Jews or Judaeans], implying that they as a race would last until the Parousia (Hendriksen 1973: 868–869; Schweizer 1976: 458).
* In patristic opinion, &quot;this generation&quot; points to the church against which the gates of Hades would not prevail (cf. Chrysostom, Hom. Matt. 77:1; Eusebius, Frag. in Lc. ad loc).
* &#x27;This generation&#x27; points to some future generation, from Matthew&#x27;s perspective, that sees &quot;all these things&quot; (Bock 1996: 538–539; Conzelmann 1982: 105).
* The words &quot;take place&quot; or &quot;have happened&quot; [γένηται] are interpreted as an ingressive aorist: &quot;to begin&quot; or &quot;to have a beginning&quot;. In other words, &quot;all these things&quot; would start to happen in the generation of Jesus&#x27; present disciples, but would not necessarily finish in their time (Cranfield 1954: 291; Talbert 2010: 270).
* &quot;This generation&quot; points to a certain kind of people in accordance with the pejorative connotations to &quot;generation&quot; [γενεά] elsewhere in the gospel (Morris 1992: 613; Nelson 1996: 385; Rieske 2008: 225; see, e.g., Mt 11:16; 12:39, 41–42, 45; 16:4; 17:17; 23:36). While DeBruyn (2010: 190) and Lenski (1943: 953) interpret the expression in a similar way, they connect &quot;this generation&quot; to a certain kind of people from the Ἰουδαῖοι who resisted Jesus (cf. view 3 discussed earlier).

Jesus is also recorded as saying,
He makes similar predictions in five other places in the Gospels. In religious sceptic Victor J. Stenger&#x27;s view, when the coming did not happen within the life-times of his disciples, Christianity changed its emphasis to the resurrection and promise of eternal life. A competing view is that it is Jesus&#x27; Transfiguration that provides the correct interpretative frame for the &quot;not taste death&quot; statement. The author of Second Peter describes a similar event:

===Preterism===

The position associating the Second Coming with 1st century events such as the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Jewish Temple in AD 70 is known as Preterism.

Some Preterists see this &quot;coming of the Son of Man in glory&quot; primarily fulfilled in Jesus&#x27;s death on the cross. They believe the apocalyptic signs are already fulfilled including &quot;the sun will be dark&quot;, the &quot;powers ... will be shaken&quot;, and &quot;then they will see&quot;. Yet some critics note that many are missing, such as &quot;But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.&quot; And &quot;Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.&quot;

===Catholicism===

According to the Catholic Church, the second coming will happen in a single moment, suddenly and unexpectedly (not even the angels, saints, or demons know when it will occur). It will cause the fullness of the reign of God and the consummation of the universe and mankind.

The fullness of the reign of God means God fully manifests the victory he won over his enemies (sin, suffering, and Satan) on the Cross. Just as God gradually revealed himself to Israel until the birth of Jesus, so also God gradually manifests his victory through the church&#x27;s sacraments (baptism, forgiving sin, exorcising Satan, holy unction, relieving suffering, etc.), until the moment when he will fully manifest his victory through the consummation of the universe and mankind, e.g., by granting the universe and mankind a share in Jesus&#x27; resurrection (the universe being transfigured and the dead being resurrected, judged, and recompensed).

The church does not believe the second coming will happen via a catastrophe (such as a nuclear war or extinction event), reincarnation (such as someone claiming to be Jesus), social or technological progress (such as mankind abolishing slavery or curing disease), or ascendancy (such as the church having political power). Nor does the church believe in double predestination.

At the moment of Jesus&#x27; arrival, three events will happen all at once in an instant, in the blink of an eye: the living will die, the universe will be transfigured, and the dead will be resurrected, judged, and recompensed. After this single instant or moment, the church does not know what will happen for the rest of eternity – only that the damned will continue to be in hell and the saved will continue to experience the beatific vision.

The second coming is suspended until Jesus is recognized by &quot;all of Israel&quot;, and it will be followed by a final and ultimate temptation to sin – in this case, apostasy – caused by the antichrist. Yet there are three things that hasten the second coming: the celebration of the Eucharist; Christians living with the mind of Jesus; and Christians praying for the Second Coming.

Like many Christian denominations, the church considers this second coming of Christ to be the final and eternal judgment by God of the people in every nation resulting in the glorification of some and the punishment of others. The concept is found in all the Canonical gospels, particularly the Gospel of Matthew.

A decisive factor in this Last Judgment during the second coming of Christ will be the question of whether the corporal and spiritual works of mercy were practised or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of mercy, charity and justice. Therefore, and according to the Biblical sources (Matthew 25:31–46), the conjunction of the Last Judgment and the works of mercy is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.

===Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy===

It is the traditional view of Orthodox Christians, preserved from the early Church, that the Second Coming will be a sudden and unmistakable incident, like &quot;a flash of lightning&quot;. They hold the general view that Jesus will not spend any time on the earth in ministry or preaching, but come to judge mankind. They teach that the ministry of the Antichrist will take place right before the Second Coming.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church, a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion of churches, teaches that the second coming of Jesus will be radically different from his first coming, which &quot;was to save the lost world&quot;.

Orthodox layman Alexander Kalomiros explains the original Church&#x27;s position regarding the Second Coming in &quot;River of Fire&quot; and &quot;Against False Union&quot;, stating that those who contend that Christ will reign on earth for a thousand years &quot;do not wait for Christ, but for the Antichrist&quot;. The idea of Jesus returning to this earth as a king is a heretical concept to the Church, equated to &quot;the expectations of the Jews who wanted the Messiah to be an earthly King.&quot; The Church instead teaches that which it has taught since the beginning.

===Lutheranism and Anglicanism===

A reference to the second coming is contained in the Nicene Creed and Apostles Creed, which is recited during the Lutheran and Anglican liturgies: &quot;He [Jesus] shall come again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and His kingdom shall have no end.&quot; An analogous statement is also in the biblical Pauline Creed ().

The Lutheran and Anglican churches proclaim the Mystery of Faith in their liturgies: &quot;Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again.&quot;

===Methodism===
Methodist denominations teach that the Second Coming is connected with the Last Judgment, as professed in the Creeds.

Methodist denominations differ on the nature of the Second Coming. For example, the United Methodist Church does not teach that there will be a &quot;rapture&quot;. On the other hand, the Evangelical Methodist Church Conference teaches, with regard to the Second Coming of Christ:
===Latter Day Saint movement===

The standard works of the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), say that Christ will return, as stated in the Bible. They also teach that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its leaders do not make predictions of the actual date of the Second Coming. Mormons believe Jesus appeared to his &quot;new world disciples&quot; in the Americas sometime after his crucifixion. This is a central tenet of the religion.

Latter-day Saints have particularly distinct and specific interpretations of what are considered to be signs stated in the Book of Revelation.
According to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the restored gospel will be taught in all parts of the world prior to the Second Coming. Church members believe that there will be increasingly severe wars, earthquakes, hurricanes, and other man-made and natural disasters prior to the Second Coming.

===Seventh-day Adventists===

Fundamental Belief #25 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church states:
===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses rarely use the term &quot;second coming&quot;, preferring the term &quot;presence&quot; as a translation of &quot;parousia&quot;. They believe that Jesus&#x27; comparison of &quot;the presence of the Son of man&quot; with &quot;the days of Noah&quot; at and suggests a duration rather than a moment of arrival. They also believe that biblical chronology points to 1914 as the start of Christ&#x27;s &quot;presence&quot;, which continues until the final battle of Armageddon. Other biblical expressions they correlate with this period include &quot;the time of the end&quot; (), &quot;the conclusion of the system of things&quot; (, ; ) and &quot;the last days&quot; (; ). Witnesses believe Christ&#x27;s millennial reign begins after Armageddon.

===Emanuel Swedenborg and the New Church===
Emanuel Swedenborg, an 18th-century scientist turned theologian, taught that his time (that historians have called the Age of Enlightenment) was an age of darkness and doubt for the Christian church. Historian Marguerite Beck Block writes,

===Esoteric Christian teachings===
In Max Heindel&#x27;s teaching, there is a distinction between the cosmic Christ, or Christ without, and the Christ within. According to this tradition, the Christ within is regarded as the true Saviour who needs to be born within each individual in order to evolve toward the future Sixth Epoch in the Earth&#x27;s etheric plane, that is, toward the &quot;new heavens and a new earth&quot;: the &quot;New Galilee.&quot; The Second Coming or Advent of the Christ is not in a physical body, but in the new &quot;soul body&quot; of each individual in the etheric plane of the planet where man &quot;shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&quot; The &quot;day and hour&quot; of this event is not known. The esoteric Christian tradition teaches that first there will be a preparatory period as the Sun enters Aquarius, an astrological concept, by precession: the coming Age of Aquarius.

==Islam==

===Traditional view===

In Islam, Jesus (or Isa; ) is considered to be a Messenger of God and the &quot;masih&quot; (messiah) who was sent to guide &quot;banī isrā&#x27;īl&quot; (the Israelites) with a new scripture, the &quot;Injīl&quot; (Gospel). The belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is required in Islam, and a requirement of being a Muslim. However, Muslims believe that Jesus was never crucified or resurrected, instead ascending directly into heaven. Additionally, they do not recognize Jesus as the Son of God, as they believe God has no equals, but rather that he was a prophet. The Quran states that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary. Muslims believe that Jesus performed all the miracles in the Gospels (with God&#x27;s permission). The pertinent verses in Sura An-Nisa 4:157 reads &quot;And for their saying, &#x27;Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.&#x27; And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but another was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.&quot; 4:158 continues &quot;rather, Allah raised him to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.&quot;

The Quran refers to a conversation between Jesus and God on judgement day in Sura Al-Ma&#x27;idah 5:116, 5:117. Jesus is questioned 5:116 &quot;Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?&quot; To which Jesus replies 5:117 &quot;I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: &quot;Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!&quot; And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them.&quot;

In the Quran, the second coming of Jesus is heralded in Sura Az-Zukhruf as a sign of the Day of Judgment.
Ibn Kathir presents this verse as proof of Jesus&#x27; second coming in the Quran in his exegesis &quot;Tafsir al-Qur&#x27;an al-Azim&quot;.

There are also hadiths that foretell Jesus&#x27; future return such as: &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;, Volume 3, Book 43: &quot;Kitab-ul-`Ilm&quot; (Book of Knowledge), Hadith Number 656:
According to Islamic tradition, Jesus&#x27; descent will be in the midst of wars fought by the Mahdi (&quot;lit&quot;. &quot;the rightly guided one&quot;), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against the al-Masih ad-Dajjal (literally &quot;the false messiah&quot;, synonymous with the Antichrist) and his followers. Jesus will descend at the point of a white minaret, east of Damascus, dressed in saffron robes—his head anointed. He will then join the Mahdi in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered in Islam as a Muslim (one who submits to God) and one of God&#x27;s messengers, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist Dajjal, and then everyone from the People of the Book (&quot;ahl al-kitāb&quot;, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community. 

After the death of the Mahdi, Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of Ya&#x27;juj and Ma&#x27;juj (Gog and Magog), ancient tribes that will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus&#x27; prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks. Jesus&#x27; rule is said to be around forty years, after which he will die (since according to Islam, Jesus did not die on the cross but was taken up to heaven and continues to live until his return in the second coming). Muslims will then perform the &quot;Salat al-Janazah&quot; (funeral prayer) for him and bury him in the city of Medina in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad.

===Ahmadiyya===
The Ahmadiyya movement believe that the promised Mahdi and Messiah arrived in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908). This is widely rejected by other Muslims, who do not regard Ahmadis as a legitimate sect of Islam.

The Ahmadiyya movement interpret the Second Coming of Jesus prophesied as being that of a person &quot;similar to Jesus&quot; (&quot;mathīl-i ʿIsā&quot;) and not his physical return, in the same way as John the Baptist resembled the character of the biblical prophet Elijah in Christianity. Ahmadis believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (the founder of the movement) demonstrated that the prophecy in Muslim and Christian religious texts were traditionally misunderstood to suggest that Jesus of Nazareth himself would return, and hold that Jesus survived the crucifixion and later died a natural death. Ahmadis consider Ghulam, in both his character and teachings, to be representative of Jesus, and that he attained the same spiritual rank of Prophethood as Jesus. Thus, Ahmadis believe this prediction was fulfilled and continued by his movement.

==Baháʼí Faith==

According to the Baháʼí Faith, the Second Coming is a gradual process that coincides with the advancement of human civilization from the beginning of humanity. It teaches that the founders of the major world religions each represent a return of the Word and Spirit of God as a new, unique personification sent by God, who introduces new teachings, laws and revelations, such that all major religions are part of a progressive revelation. Each Coming is said to build upon the major world religions emerging from earlier ages, verifying previous spiritual truths, and fulfilling its prophesies regarding a future return or coming. In this context, the Second Coming is depicted as a continuation of God&#x27;s will in one continuous faith, with different names as presented by the founders of each religion as the voice of God at different times in history.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh announced that he was a manifestation of the returned Christ, understood as a reappearance of the Word and Spirit of God: He wrote to Pope Pius IX, He referred to himself as the &quot;Ancient of Days&quot; and the &quot;Pen of Glory&quot;, and also claimed: Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah also wrote, 

Followers of the Baháʼí Faith believe that prophecies of the second coming of Jesus (along with prophecies from other religions) were fulfilled by his forerunner the Báb in 1844 and then by the events occurring during the days of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. They believe that the fulfillment of Christian prophecies by Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah is similar to Jesus&#x27; fulfillment of Jewish prophecies, where in both cases people were expecting the literal fulfillment of apocalyptic statements that led to rejections of the Return, instead of accepting fulfillment in symbolic and spiritual ways. Baháʼís understand that the return of the Christ with a new name was intended by Jesus to be a Return in a spiritual sense, due to Jesus explaining in the Gospels that the return of Elijah in John the Baptist was a return in a spiritual sense.

==Judaism==
Judaism teaches that Jesus is one of the false Jewish Messiah claimants because he failed to fulfill any Messianic prophecies, which include:

# Build the Third Temple ().
# Gather all Jews back to the Land of Israel ().
# Usher in an era of world peace, and end all hatred, oppression, suffering and disease. As it says: &quot;Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall man learn war anymore.&quot; ()
# Spread universal knowledge of the God of Israel, which will unite humanity as one. As it says: &quot;God will be King over all the world―on that day, God will be One and His Name will be One&quot; (). Regarding the Christian idea that these prophecies will be fulfilled during a &quot;second coming,&quot; &quot;Ohr Samayach&quot; states &quot;we find this to be a contrived answer, since there is no mention of a second coming in the Jewish Bible. Second, why couldn&#x27;t God accomplish His goals the first time round?&quot; Rabbi David Wolpe believes that the Second Coming was &quot;grown out of genuine disappointment. [...] When Jesus died, true believers had to theologically compensate for the disaster.&quot;

==Rastafari==
In the early developments of the Rastafari religion, Haile Selassie (the Ethiopian Emperor) was regarded as a member of the House of David, is worshipped as God incarnate, and is thought to be the &quot;black Jesus&quot; and &quot;black messiah&quot; – the second coming of Christ. It was claimed that Marcus Garvey preached the coming of the black messiah on the eve of Selassie&#x27;s coronation. Due to this prophecy, Selassie was the source of inspiration of the poor and uneducated Christian populations of Jamaica, who believed that the Emperor would liberate the black people from the subjugation of European colonists.

==Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s commentary==

In modern times some traditional Indian religious leaders have moved to embrace Jesus as an avatar, or incarnation, of God. In light of this, the Indian guru Paramahansa Yogananda, author of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, wrote an extensive commentary on the Gospels published in 2004 as a two-volume set: &quot;The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You&quot;. The book offers a mystical interpretation of the Second Coming in which it is understood to be an inner experience, something that takes place within the individual heart. In the introduction of this book, Yogananda wrote that the true Second Coming is the resurrection within you of the Infinite Christ Consciousness. Also stated in the Book of Luke – &quot;Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.&quot; ()

Daya Mata wrote in the preface of &quot;The Second Coming of Christ&quot; that the &quot;...scriptural treatise thus represents the inclusive culmination of Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s divine commission to make manifest to the world the essence of original Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ.&quot; In sharing her memories of when she wrote down his words, she shares – &quot;the great Guru, his face radiantly enraptured, as he records for the world the inspired exposition of the Gospel teachings imparted to him through direct, personal communion with Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; Larry Dossey, M.D., wrote that &quot;Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;The Second Coming of Christ&quot; is one of the most important analyses of Jesus&#x27; teachings that exists. ... Many interpretations of Jesus&#x27; words divide peoples, cultures, and nations; these foster unity and healing, and that is why they are vital for today&#x27;s world&quot;.

==In modern culture==
Jesus Christ returning to earth has been a theme in several movies and books, for example:

<doc id="28555" wikidata="Q1127410" url="?curid=28555" title="Serialization">
<text>In computing, serialization (or serialisation, also referred to as [[pickling]] in Python) is the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (e.g. files in secondary storage devices, data buffers in primary storage devices) or transmitted (e.g. data streams over computer networks) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment). When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not straightforward. Serialization of objects does not include any of their associated methods with which they were previously linked.

This process of serializing an object is also called marshalling an object in some situations. The opposite operation, extracting a data structure from a series of bytes, is deserialization, (also called unserialization or [[unmarshalling]]).

In networking equipment hardware, the part that is responsible for serialization and deserialization is commonly called SerDes.

==Uses==
Uses of serialization include:
* serializing data for transfer across wires and networks (messaging).
* storing data (in databases, on hard disk drives).
* remote procedure calls, e.g., as in SOAP.
* distributing objects, especially in component-based software engineering such as COM, CORBA, etc.
* detecting changes in time-varying data.

For some of these features to be useful, architecture independence must be maintained. For example, for maximal use of distribution, a computer running on a different hardware architecture should be able to reliably reconstruct a serialized data stream, regardless of endianness. This means that the simpler and faster procedure of directly copying the memory layout of the data structure cannot work reliably for all architectures. Serializing the data structure in an architecture-independent format means preventing the problems of byte ordering, memory layout, or simply different ways of representing data structures in different programming languages.

Inherent to any serialization scheme is that, because the encoding of the data is by definition serial, extracting one part of the serialized data structure requires that the entire object be read from start to end, and reconstructed. In many applications, this linearity is an asset, because it enables simple, common I/O interfaces to be utilized to hold and pass on the state of an object. In applications where higher performance is an issue, it can make sense to expend more effort to deal with a more complex, non-linear storage organization.

Even on a single machine, primitive pointer objects are too fragile to save because the objects to which they point may be reloaded to a different location in memory. To deal with this, the serialization process includes a step called &quot;unswizzling&quot; or &quot;pointer unswizzling&quot;, where direct pointer references are converted to references based on name or position. The deserialization process includes an inverse step called &quot;pointer swizzling&quot;.

Since both serializing and deserializing can be driven from common code (for example, the &quot;Serialize&quot; function in Microsoft Foundation Classes), it is possible for the common code to do both at the same time, and thus, 1) detect differences between the objects being serialized and their prior copies, and 2) provide the input for the next such detection. It is not necessary to actually build the prior copy because differences can be detected on the fly, a technique called differential execution. This is useful in the programming of user interfaces whose contents are time-varying — graphical objects can be created, removed, altered, or made to handle input events without necessarily having to write separate code to do those things.

==Drawbacks==
Serialization breaks the opacity of an abstract data type by potentially exposing private implementation details. Trivial implementations which serialize all data members may violate encapsulation.

To discourage competitors from making compatible products, publishers of proprietary software often keep the details of their programs&#x27; serialization formats a trade secret. Some deliberately obfuscate or even encrypt the serialized data. Yet, interoperability requires that applications be able to understand each other&#x27;s serialization formats. Therefore, remote method call architectures such as CORBA define their serialization formats in detail.

Many institutions, such as archives and libraries, attempt to future proof their backup archives—in particular, database dumps—by storing them in some relatively human-readable serialized format.

==Serialization formats==

The Xerox Network Systems Courier technology in the early 1980s influenced the first widely adopted standard. Sun Microsystems published the External Data Representation (XDR) in 1987. XDR is an open format, and standardized as STD 67 (RFC 4506).

In the late 1990s, a push to provide an alternative to the standard serialization protocols started: XML, an SGML subset, was used to produce a human-readable text-based encoding. Such an encoding can be useful for persistent objects that may be read and understood by humans, or communicated to other systems regardless of programming language. It has the disadvantage of losing the more compact, byte-stream-based encoding, but by this point larger storage and transmission capacities made file size less of a concern than in the early days of computing. In the 2000s, XML was often used for asynchronous transfer of structured data between client and server in Ajax web applications. XML is an open format, and standardized as a W3C recommendation.

JSON is a lightweight plain-text alternative to XML, and is also commonly used for client-server communication in web applications. JSON is based on JavaScript syntax, but is independent of JavaScript and supported in many other programming languages. JSON is an open format, standardized as STD 90 (), ECMA-404, and ISO/IEC 21778:2017.

YAML is a strict superset of JSON and includes additional features such as a data type tags, support for cyclic data structures, indentation-sensitive syntax, and multiple forms of scalar data quoting. YAML is an open format.

Property lists are used for serialization by NeXTSTEP, GNUstep, macOS, and iOS frameworks. &quot;Property list&quot;, or &quot;p-list&quot; for short, doesn&#x27;t refer to a single serialization format but instead several different variants, some human-readable and one binary.

For large volume scientific datasets, such as satellite data and output of numerical climate, weather, or ocean models, specific binary serialization standards have been developed, e.g. HDF, netCDF and the older GRIB.

==Programming language support==
Several object-oriented programming languages directly support &quot;object serialization&quot; (or &quot;object archival&quot;), either by syntactic sugar elements or providing a standard interface for doing so. The languages which do so include Ruby, Smalltalk, Python, PHP, Objective-C, Delphi, Java, and the .NET family of languages. There are also libraries available that add serialization support to languages that lack native support for it.

===C and C++===
C and C++ do not provide serialization as any sort of high-level construct, but both languages support writing any of the built-in data types, as well as plain old data structs, as binary data. As such, it is usually trivial to write custom serialization functions. Moreover, compiler-based solutions, such as the ODB ORM system for C++ and the gSOAP toolkit for C and C++, are capable of automatically producing serialization code with few or no modifications to class declarations. Other popular serialization frameworks are Boost.Serialization from the Boost Framework, the S11n framework, and Cereal. MFC framework (Microsoft) also provides serialization methodology as part of its Document-View architecture.

===CFML===
CFML allows data structures to be serialized to WDDX with the codice_1 tag and to JSON with the SerializeJSON() function.

===Delphi===
Delphi provides a built-in mechanism for serialization of components (also called persistent objects), which is fully integrated with its IDE. The component&#x27;s contents are saved to a DFM file and reloaded on-the-fly.

===Go===
Go natively supports unmarshalling/marshalling of JSON and XML data. There are also third-party modules that support YAML and Protocol Buffers. Go also supports &quot;Gobs&quot;.

===Haskell===
In Haskell, serialization is supported for types that are members of the Read and Show type classes. Every type that is a member of the codice_2 type class defines a function that will extract the data from the string representation of the dumped data. The codice_3 type class, in turn, contains the codice_4 function from which a string representation of the object can be generated. The programmer need not define the functions explicitly—merely declaring a type to be deriving Read or deriving Show, or both, can make the compiler generate the appropriate functions for many cases (but not all: function types, for example, cannot automatically derive Show or Read). The auto-generated instance for Show also produces valid source code, so the same Haskell value can be generated by running the code produced by show in, for example, a Haskell interpreter. For more efficient serialization, there are haskell libraries that allow high-speed serialization in binary format, e.g. binary.

===Java===
Java provides automatic serialization which requires that the object be marked by implementing the interface. Implementing the interface marks the class as &quot;okay to serialize&quot;, and Java then handles serialization internally. There are no serialization methods defined on the codice_5 interface, but a serializable class can optionally define methods with certain special names and signatures that if defined, will be called as part of the serialization/deserialization process. The language also allows the developer to override the serialization process more thoroughly by implementing another interface, the interface, which includes two special methods that are used to save and restore the object&#x27;s state. There are three primary reasons why objects are not serializable by default and must implement the codice_5 interface to access Java&#x27;s serialization mechanism.Firstly, not all objects capture useful semantics in a serialized state. For example, a object is tied to the state of the current JVM. There is no context in which a deserialized codice_7 object would maintain useful semantics.Secondly, the serialized state of an object forms part of its class&#x27; compatibility contract. Maintaining compatibility between versions of serializable classes requires additional effort and consideration. Therefore, making a class serializable needs to be a deliberate design decision and not a default condition.Lastly, serialization allows access to non-transient private members of a class that are not otherwise accessible. Classes containing sensitive information (for example, a password) should not be serializable nor externalizable. The standard encoding method uses a recursive graph-based translation of the object&#x27;s class descriptor and serializable fields into a byte stream. Primitives as well as non-transient, non-static referenced objects are encoded into the stream. Each object that is referenced by the serialized object via a field that is not marked as codice_8 must also be serialized; and if any object in the complete graph of non-transient object references is not serializable, then serialization will fail. The developer can influence this behavior by marking objects as transient, or by redefining the serialization for an object so that some portion of the reference graph is truncated and not serialized. Java does not use constructor to serialize objects. It is possible to serialize Java objects through JDBC and store them into a database. While Swing components do implement the Serializable interface, they are not guaranteed to be portable between different versions of the Java Virtual Machine. As such, a Swing component, or any component which inherits it, may be serialized to a byte stream, but it is not guaranteed that this will be re-constitutable on another machine.

===JavaScript===
Since ECMAScript 5.1, JavaScript has included the built-in codice_9 object and its methods codice_10 and codice_11. Although JSON is originally based on a subset of JavaScript, there are boundary cases where JSON is not valid JavaScript. Specifically, JSON allows the Unicode line terminators and to appear unescaped in quoted strings, while ECMAScript 2018 and older does not. See the main article on JSON.

===Julia===
Julia implements serialization through the codice_12 / codice_13 modules, intended to work within the same version of Julia, and/or instance of the same system image. The codice_14 package offers a more stable alternative, using a documented format and common library with wrappers for different languages, while the default serialization format is suggested to have been designed rather with maximal performance for network communication in mind.

===Lisp===
Generally a Lisp data structure can be serialized with the functions &quot;codice_15&quot; and &quot;codice_16&quot;. A variable foo containing, for example, a list of arrays would be printed by codice_17. Similarly an object can be read from a stream named s by codice_18. These two parts of the Lisp implementation are called the Printer and the Reader. The output of &quot;codice_16&quot; is human readable; it uses lists demarked by parentheses, for example: . In many types of Lisp, including Common Lisp, the printer cannot represent every type of data because it is not clear how to do so. In Common Lisp for example the printer cannot print CLOS objects. Instead the programmer may write a method on the generic function codice_20, this will be invoked when the object is printed. This is somewhat similar to the method used in Ruby. Lisp code itself is written in the syntax of the reader, called read syntax. Most languages use separate and different parsers to deal with code and data, Lisp only uses one. A file containing lisp code may be read into memory as a data structure, transformed by another program, then possibly executed or written out, such as in a read–eval–print loop. Not all readers/writers support cyclic, recursive or shared structures.

===.NET===
.NET has several serializers designed by Microsoft. There are also many serializers by third parties. More than a dozen serializers are discussed and tested here. and here

===OCaml===
OCaml&#x27;s standard library provides marshalling through the codice_21 module and the Pervasives functions codice_22 and codice_23. While OCaml programming is statically type-checked, uses of the codice_21 module may break type guarantees, as there is no way to check whether an unmarshalled stream represents objects of the expected type. In OCaml it is difficult to marshal a function or a data structure which contains a function (e.g. an object which contains a method), because executable code in functions cannot be transmitted across different programs. (There is a flag to marshal the code position of a function but it can only be unmarshalled in exactly the same program). The standard marshalling functions can preserve sharing and handle cyclic data, which can be configured by a flag.

===Perl===
Several Perl modules available from CPAN provide serialization mechanisms, including codice_25 , codice_26 and codice_27. Storable includes functions to serialize and deserialize Perl data structures to and from files or Perl scalars. In addition to serializing directly to files, codice_25 includes the codice_29 function to return a serialized copy of the data packed into a scalar, and codice_30 to deserialize such a scalar. This is useful for sending a complex data structure over a network socket or storing it in a database. When serializing structures with codice_25, there are network safe functions that always store their data in a format that is readable on any computer at a small cost of speed. These functions are named codice_32, codice_33, etc. There are no &quot;n&quot; functions for deserializing these structures — the regular codice_30 and codice_35 deserialize structures serialized with the &quot;codice_36&quot; functions and their machine-specific equivalents.

===PHP===
PHP originally implemented serialization through the built-in codice_12 and codice_38 functions. PHP can serialize any of its data types except resources (file pointers, sockets, etc.). The built-in codice_38 function is often dangerous when used on completely untrusted data. For objects, there are two &quot;magic methods&quot; that can be implemented within a class — codice_40 and codice_41 — that are called from within codice_12 and codice_38, respectively, that can clean up and restore an object. For example, it may be desirable to close a database connection on serialization and restore the connection on deserialization; this functionality would be handled in these two magic methods. They also permit the object to pick which properties are serialized. Since PHP 5.1, there is an object-oriented serialization mechanism for objects, the codice_5 interface.

===Prolog===
Prolog&#x27;s &quot;term&quot; structure, which is the only data structure of the language, can be serialized out through the built-in predicate codice_45 and serialized-in through the built-in predicates codice_46 and codice_47. The resulting stream is uncompressed text (in some encoding determined by configuration of the target stream), with any free variables in the term represented by placeholder variable names. The predicate codice_45 is standardized in the ISO Specification for Prolog (ISO/IEC 13211-1) on pages 59 ff. (&quot;Writing a term, § 7.10.5&quot;). Therefore it is expected that terms serialized-out by one implementation can be serialized-in by another without ambiguity or surprises. In practice, implementation-specific extensions (e.g. SWI-Prolog&#x27;s dictionaries) may use non-standard term structures, so interoperability may break in edge cases. As examples, see the corresponding manual pages for SWI-Prolog, SICStus Prolog, GNU Prolog. Whether and how serialized terms received over the network are checked against a specification (after deserialization from the character stream has happened) is left to the implementer. Prolog&#x27;s built-in Definite Clause Grammars can be applied at that stage.

===Python===
The core general serialization mechanism is the codice_49 standard library module, alluding to the database systems term &quot;pickling&quot; to describe data serialization (&quot;unpickling&quot; for &quot;deserializing&quot;). Pickle uses a simple stack-based virtual machine that records the instructions used to reconstruct the object. It is a cross-version customisable but unsafe (not secure against erroneous or malicious data) serialization format. Malformed or maliciously constructed data, may cause the deserializer to import arbitrary modules and instantiate any object. The standard library also includes modules serializing to standard data formats: codice_50 (with built-in support for basic scalar and collection types and able to support arbitrary types via encoding and decoding hooks). codice_51 (with support for both binary and XML property list formats). codice_52 (with support for the External Data Representation (XDR) standard as described in RFC 1014). Finally, it is recommended that an object&#x27;s codice_53 be evaluable in the right environment, making it a rough match for Common Lisp&#x27;s codice_20. Not all object types can be pickled automatically, especially ones that hold operating system resources like file handles, but users can register custom &quot;reduction&quot; and construction functions to support the pickling and unpickling of arbitrary types. Pickle was originally implemented as the pure Python codice_49 module, but, in versions of Python prior to 3.0, the codice_56 module (also a built-in) offers improved performance (up to 1000 times faster). The codice_56 was adapted from the Unladen Swallow project. In Python 3, users should always import the standard version, which attempts to import the accelerated version and falls back to the pure Python version.

===R===
R has the function codice_58 which writes an ASCII text representation of an R object to a file or connection. A representation can be read from a file using codice_59. More specific, the function codice_60 serializes an R object to a connection, the output being a raw vector coded in hexadecimal format. The codice_61 function allows to read an object from a connection or a raw vector.

===REBOL===
REBOL will serialize to file (codice_62) or to a codice_63 (codice_64). Strings and files can be deserialized using the polymorphic codice_65 function. codice_66 provides cross-language data serialization in R, using Protocol Buffers.

===Ruby===
Ruby includes the standard module codice_21 with 2 methods codice_68 and codice_65, akin to the standard Unix utilities codice_70 and codice_71. These methods serialize to the standard class codice_72, that is, they effectively become a sequence of bytes. Some objects cannot be serialized (doing so would raise a codice_73 exception): bindings, procedure objects, instances of class IO, singleton objects and interfaces. If a class requires custom serialization (for example, it requires certain cleanup actions done on dumping / restoring), it can be done by implementing 2 methods: codice_74 and codice_75. The instance method codice_74 should return a codice_72 object containing all the information necessary to reconstitute objects of this class and all referenced objects up to a maximum depth given as an integer parameter (a value of -1 implies that depth checking should be disabled). The class method codice_75 should take a codice_72 and return an object of this class.

===Rust===

codice_80 is the most widely used library, or crate, for serialization in Rust which provides the and traits.

===Smalltalk===
In general, non-recursive and non-sharing objects can be stored and retrieved in a human readable form using the codice_81/codice_82 protocol. The codice_81 method generates the text of a Smalltalk expression which – when evaluated using codice_82 – recreates the original object. This scheme is special, in that it uses a procedural description of the object, not the data itself. It is therefore very flexible, allowing for classes to define more compact representations. However, in its original form, it does not handle cyclic data structures or preserve the identity of shared references (i.e. two references a single object will be restored as references to two equal, but not identical copies). For this, various portable and non-portable alternatives exist. Some of them are specific to a particular Smalltalk implementation or class library. There are several ways in Squeak Smalltalk to serialize and store objects. The easiest and most used are codice_85 and binary storage formats based on codice_86 serializers. In addition, bundled objects can be stored and retrieved using codice_87. Both provide a so-called &quot;binary-object storage framework&quot;, which support serialization into and retrieval from a compact binary form. Both handle cyclic, recursive and shared structures, storage/retrieval of class and metaclass info and include mechanisms for &quot;on the fly&quot; object migration (i.e. to convert instances which were written by an older version of a class with a different object layout). The APIs are similar (storeBinary/readBinary), but the encoding details are different, making these two formats incompatible. However, the Smalltalk/X code is open source and free and can be loaded into other Smalltalks to allow for cross-dialect object interchange. Object serialization is not part of the ANSI Smalltalk specification. As a result, the code to serialize an object varies by Smalltalk implementation. The resulting binary data also varies. For instance, a serialized object created in Squeak Smalltalk cannot be restored in Ambrai Smalltalk. Consequently, various applications that do work on multiple Smalltalk implementations that rely on object serialization cannot share data between these different implementations. These applications include the MinneStore object database and some RPC packages. A solution to this problem is SIXX, which is a package for multiple Smalltalks that uses an XML-based format for serialization.

===Swift===
The Swift standard library provides two protocols, codice_88 and codice_89 (composed together as codice_90), which allow instances of conforming types to be serialized to or deserialized from JSON, property lists, or other formats. Default implementations of these protocols can be generated by the compiler for types whose stored properties are also codice_89 or codice_88.

===PowerShell===
PowerShell implements serialization through the built-in cmdlet codice_93. codice_93 serializes .NET objects and stores the resulting XML in a file. To reconstitute the objects, use the codice_95 cmdlet, which generates a deserialized object from the XML in the exported file. Deserialized objects, often known as &quot;property bags&quot; are not live objects; they are snapshots that have properties, but no methods. Two dimensional data structures can also be (de)serialized in CSV format using the built-in cmdlets codice_96 and codice_97.

<text>The separation of powers principle functionally differentiates several types of state power (usually law-making, adjudication, and execution) and requires these operations of government to be conceptually and institutionally distinguishable and articulated, thereby maintaining the integrity of each. To put this model into practice, government is divided into structurally independent branches to perform various functions (most often a legislature, a judiciary and an administration, sometimes known as the ). When each function is allocated strictly to one branch, a government is described as having a high degree of separation; whereas, when one person or branch plays a significant part in the exercise of more than one function, this represents a fusion of powers.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===

In the Roman Republic, the Roman Senate, Consuls and the Assemblies showed an example of a mixed government according to Polybius (&quot;Histories&quot;, Book 6, 11–13). It was Polybius who described and explained the system of checks and balances in detail, crediting Lycurgus of Sparta with the first government of this kind.

=== Early modern concepts of mixed government ===

John Calvin (1509–1564) favoured a system of government that divided political power between democracy and aristocracy (mixed government). Calvin appreciated the advantages of democracy, stating: &quot;It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates.&quot; In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions that should complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances. In this way, Calvin and his followers resisted political absolutism and furthered the growth of democracy. Calvin aimed to protect the rights and the well-being of ordinary people.

In 1620 a group of English separatist Congregationalists and Anglicans (later known as the Pilgrim Fathers) founded Plymouth Colony in North America. Enjoying self-rule, they established a bipartite democratic system of government. The &quot;freemen&quot; elected the General Court, which functioned as legislature and judiciary and which in turn elected a governor, who together with his seven &quot;assistants&quot; served in the functional role of providing executive power. Massachusetts Bay Colony (founded 1628), Rhode Island (1636), Connecticut (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania had similar constitutions – they all separated political powers.

John Locke (1632–1704) deduced from a study of the English constitutional system the advantages of dividing political power into the legislative (which should be distributed among several bodies, for example, the House of Lords and the House of Commons), on the one hand, and the executive and federative power, responsible for the protection of the country and prerogative of the monarch, on the other hand, as the Kingdom of England had no written constitution.

=== Tripartite system ===

During the English Civil War, the parliamentarians viewed the English system of government as composed of three branches – the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons – where the first should have executive powers only, and the latter two legislative powers. One of the first documents proposing a tripartite system of separation of powers was the Instrument of Government, written by the English general John Lambert in 1653, and soon adopted as the constitution of England for few years during The Protectorate. The system comprised a legislative branch (the Parliament) and two executive branches, the English Council of State and the Lord Protector, all being elected (though the Lord Protector was elected for life) and having checks upon each other.

A further development in English thought was the idea that the judicial powers should be separated from the executive branch. This followed the use of the juridical system by the Crown to prosecute opposition leaders following the Restoration, in the late years of Charles II and during the short reign of James II (namely, during the 1680s).

The first constitutional document to establish the principle of the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches was Pacts and Constitutions of Rights and Freedoms of the Zaporizhian Host, written in 1710 by Ukrainian Hetman Pylyp Orlyk.

=== John Locke&#x27;s legislative, executive, and federative powers ===

An earlier forerunner to Montesquieu&#x27;s tripartite system was articulated by John Locke in his work &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; (1690). In the &quot;Two Treatises&quot;, Locke distinguished between legislative, executive, and federative power. Locke defined legislative power as having &quot;... the right to direct how the force of the commonwealth shall be employed&quot; (2nd Tr., § 143), while executive power entailed the &quot;execution of the laws that are made, and remain in force&quot; (2nd Tr., § 144). Locke further distinguished federative power, which entailed &quot;the power of war and peace, leagues and alliances, and all transactions with all persons and communities without [outside] the commonwealth&quot; (2nd Tr., § 145), or what is now known as foreign policy. Locke distinguishes between separate powers but not discretely separate institutions, and notes that one body or person can share in two or more of the powers. Within these factors Locke heavily argues for &quot;Autry for Action&quot; as the scope and intensity of these campaigns are extremely limited in their ability to form concentrations of power. For instance, Locke noted that while the executive and federative powers are different, they are often combined in a single institution (2nd Tr., § 148).

Locke believed that the legislative power was supreme over the executive and federative powers, which are subordinate. Locke reasoned that the legislative was supreme because it has law-giving authority; &quot;[F]or what can give laws to another, must need to be superior to him&quot; (2nd Tr., §150). According to Locke, legislative power derives its authority from the people, who have the right to make and unmake the legislature. He argues that once people consent to be governed by laws, only those representatives they have chosen can create laws on their behalf, and they are bound solely by laws enacted by these representatives.

Locke maintains that there are restrictions on the legislative power. Locke says that the legislature cannot govern arbitrarily, cannot levy taxes, or confiscate property without the consent of the governed (cf. &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;), and cannot transfer its law-making powers to another body, known as the nondelegation doctrine (2nd Tr., §142).

=== Montesquieu&#x27;s separation of powers system ===
The term &quot;tripartite system&quot; is commonly ascribed to French Enlightenment political philosopher Montesquieu, although he did not use such a term but referred to the &quot;distribution&quot; of powers. In &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; (1748), Montesquieu described the various forms of distribution of political power among a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary. Montesquieu&#x27;s approach was to present and defend a form of government whose powers were not excessively centralized in a single monarch or similar ruler (a form known then as &quot;aristocracy&quot;). He based this model on the Constitution of the Roman Republic and the British constitutional system. Montesquieu took the view that the Roman Republic had powers separated so that no one could usurp complete power. In the British constitutional system, Montesquieu discerned a separation of powers among the monarch, Parliament, and the courts of law.

Montesquieu argues that each Power should only exercise its functions. He was quite explicit here:

Separation of powers requires a different source of legitimization, or a different act of legitimization from the same source, for each of the separate powers. If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.

Montesquieu actually specified that the judicial independence has to be real, and not merely apparent. The judiciary was generally seen as the most important of the three powers, independent and unchecked.

=== Checks and balances ===
According to the principle of checks and balances, each of the branches of the state should have the power to limit or check the other two, creating a balance between the three separate powers of the state. Each branch&#x27;s efforts to prevent either of the other branches from becoming supreme form part of an eternal conflict, which leaves the people free from government abuses. Immanuel Kant was an advocate of this, noting that &quot;the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils&quot; so long as they possess an appropriate constitution to pit opposing factions against each other.
Checks and balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place. The idea is that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but the branches need to have the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches. Under this influence it was implemented in 1787 in the Constitution of the United States. In Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton, citing Montesquieu, redefined the judiciary as a separately distinct branch of government with the legislative and the executive branches. Before Hamilton, many colonists in the American colonies had adhered to British political ideas and conceived of government as divided into executive and legislative branches (with judges operating as appendages of the executive branch).

James Madison wrote about checks (and balances) in Federalist No. 51:

Thomas Paine wrote about balances in &quot;Common Sense&quot;:

== Theories of division of state power ==
There are different theories about how to differentiate the functions of the state (or types of government power), so that they may be distributed among multiple structures of government (usually called branches of government, or arms). There are analytical theories that provide a conceptual lens through which to understand the separation of powers as realized in real-world governments (developed by the academic discipline of comparative government); there are also normative theories, both of political philosophy and constitutional law, meant to propose a reasoned (not conventional or arbitrary) way to separate powers. Disagreement arises between various normative theories in particular about what is the (desirable, in the case of political philosophy, or prescribed, in the case of legal studies) allocation of functions to specific governing bodies or branches of government. How to correctly or usefully delineate and define the ‘state functions’ is another major bone of contention.

=== Legislation ===

The legislative function of the government broadly consists of authoritatively issuing binding rules.

=== Adjudication ===
The function of adjudication (judicial function) is the binding application of legal rules to a particular case, which usually involves creatively interpreting and developing these rules.

=== Execution ===
The executive function of government includes many exercises of powers in fact, whether in carrying into effect legal decisions or affecting the real world on its own initiative.

=== Additional types ===
Adjudicating constitutional disputes is sometimes conceptually distinguished from other types of power, because applying the often unusually indeterminate provisions of constitutions tends to call for exceptional methods to come to reasoned decisions. Administration is sometimes proposed as a hybrid function, combining aspects of the three other functions; opponents of this view conceive of the actions of administrative agencies as consisting of the three established functions being exercised next to each other merely in fact. Supervision and integrity-assuring activities (e.g., supervision of elections), as well as mediating functions (), are also in some instances regarded as their type, rather than a subset or combination of other types. For instance, Sweden has four powers, judicial, executive, legislative, and administrative branches.

One example of a country with more than 3 branches is Taiwan, which uses a five-branch system. This system consists of the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, and Examination Yuan.

<text>The Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC) was the second of three wars fought between Carthage and Rome, the two main powers of the western Mediterranean in the 3rd century BC. For 17 years the two states struggled for supremacy, primarily in Italy and Iberia, but also on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia and, towards the end of the war, in North Africa. After immense materiel and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were once again defeated. Macedonia, Syracuse and several Numidian kingdoms were drawn into the fighting, and Iberian and Gallic forces fought on both sides. There were three main military theatres during the war: Italy, where Hannibal defeated the Roman legions repeatedly, with occasional subsidiary campaigns in Sicily, Sardinia and Greece; Iberia, where Hasdrubal, a younger brother of Hannibal, defended the Carthaginian colonial cities with mixed success before moving into Italy; and Africa, where Rome finally won the war.

The First Punic War had ended in a Roman victory in 241BC after 23 years and enormous losses on both sides. After the war Carthage expanded its holdings in Iberia where in 219BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal besieged, captured and sacked the pro-Roman city of Saguntum. In spring 218BC Rome declared war on Carthage, beginning the Second Punic War. Later that year, Hannibal surprised the Romans by marching his army overland from Iberia, through Gaul and over the Alps to Cisalpine Gaul (modern northern Italy). Reinforced by Gallic allies he obtained crushing victories over the Romans at the battles of Trebia (218) and Lake Trasimene (217). Moving to southern Italy in 216 Hannibal defeated the Romans again at the battle of Cannae, where he annihilated the largest army the Romans had ever assembled. After the death or capture of more than 120,000 Roman troops in less than three years, many of Rome&#x27;s Italian allies, notably Capua, defected to Carthage, giving Hannibal control over much of southern Italy. As Syracuse and Macedonia joined the Carthaginian side after Cannae, the conflict spread. Between 215 and 210 BC the Carthaginians attempted to capture Roman-held Sicily and Sardinia, but were unsuccessful. The Romans took drastic steps to raise new legions: enrolling slaves, criminals and those who did not meet the usual property qualification; this vastly increased the number of men they had under arms. For the next decade the war in southern Italy continued, with Roman armies slowly recapturing most of the Italian cities that had joined Carthage.

The Romans established a lodgement in north-east Iberia in 218 BC; the Carthaginians repeatedly attempted and failed to reduce it. In 211 the Romans took the offensive in Iberia and were badly defeated but maintained their hold on the north-east. In 209 BC the new Roman commander Publius Scipio captured Carthago Nova, the main Carthaginian base in the peninsula. In 208 Scipio defeated Hasdrubal, although Hasdrubal was able to withdraw most of his troops into Gaul and then Cisalpine Gaul in early 207 BC. This new Carthaginian invasion was defeated at the Battle of the Metaurus. At the battle of Ilipa in 206 Scipio permanently ended the Carthaginian presence in Iberia.

Scipio invaded Carthaginian Africa in 204 BC, compelling the Carthaginian Senate to recall Hannibal&#x27;s army from Italy. The final engagement of the war took place between armies under Scipio and Hannibal at Zama in 202 and resulted in Hannibal&#x27;s defeat and in Carthage suing for peace. The peace treaty dictated by Rome stripped Carthage of all of its overseas territories and some of its African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 silver talents was to be paid over 50 years. Carthage was prohibited from waging war outside Africa, and in Africa only with Rome&#x27;s express permission. Henceforth it was clear Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome. Rome used Carthaginian military activity against the Numidians as a pretext to declare war again in 149BC starting the Third Punic War. In 146BC the Romans stormed the city of Carthage, sacked it, slaughtered most of its population and completely demolished it.

== Primary sources ==
The most reliable source for the Second Punic War is the historian Polybius (), a Greek sent to Rome in 167BC as a hostage. He is best known for &quot;The Histories&quot;, written sometime after 146BC. Polybius&#x27;s work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible interviewed participants, from both sides, in the events he wrote about. Modern historians consider Polybius to have treated the relatives of Scipio Aemilianus, his patron and friend, unduly favourably but the consensus is to accept his account largely at face value. The modern historian Andrew Curry sees Polybius as being &quot;fairly reliable&quot;; Craige Champion describes him as &quot;a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian&quot;.

Much of Polybius&#x27;s account of the Second Punic War is missing after 216 BC or only exists in fragmentary form. As a result, the main source for much of the war is the account written by the Roman historian Livy. This is commonly used by modern historians where Polybius&#x27;s account is not extant. Livy relied heavily on Polybius, but wrote in a more structured way, with more details about Roman politics; he was also openly pro-Roman. His accounts of military encounters are often demonstrably inaccurate; the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy says Livy&#x27;s &quot;reliability is often suspect&quot;, and the historian Phillip Sabin refers to Livy&#x27;s &quot;military ignorance&quot;.

Other, later, ancient histories of the war exist, although often in fragmentary or summary form. Modern historians usually take into account the writings of Diodorus Siculus and Cassius Dio, two Greek authors writing during the Roman era; they are described by John Lazenby as &quot;clearly far inferior&quot; to Livy, but some fragments of Polybius can be recovered from their texts. The Greek moralist Plutarch wrote several biographies of Roman commanders in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;. Other sources include coins, inscriptions, archaeological evidence and empirical evidence from reconstructions.

== Opposing forces ==
Most male Roman citizens were liable for military service and would serve as infantry, the wealthier equites providing a cavalry component. Traditionally, when at war the Romans would raise four legions, each of 4,200 infantry and 300 cavalry. Approximately 1,200 of the infantry, poorer or younger men unable to afford the armour and equipment of a standard legionary, served as javelin-armed skirmishers, known as velites. They carried several javelins, which would be thrown from a distance, a short sword and a shield. The rest were equipped as heavy infantry, with body armour, a large shield and short thrusting swords. They were divided into three ranks: the front rank also carried two javelins, while the second and third ranks were equipped with a thrusting spear instead. Legionary sub-units and individual legionaries both fought in relatively . It was the long-standing Roman procedure to elect two men each year as senior magistrates, known as consuls, who in time of war would each lead an army. An army was usually formed by combining two Roman legions with a similarly sized and equipped pair of legions provided by their Latin allies. These legions usually had a larger attached complement of cavalry than Roman ones.

Carthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. When they did, they fought as well-armoured heavy infantry armed with long thrusting spears, although they were notoriously ill-trained and ill-disciplined. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many were from North Africa and these were frequently referred to as &quot;Libyans&quot;. The region provided several types of fighters, including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting spears; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry also known as &quot;heavy cavalry&quot; carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat. The latter cavalry were usually Numidians. 

The close-order Libyan infantry and the citizen-militia would fight in a tightly packed formation known as a phalanx. On occasion some of the infantry would wear captured Roman armour, especially among Hannibal&#x27;s troops. Both Iberia and Gaul provided large numbers of experienced infantry and cavalry. These infantry were unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted. The Gallic cavalry, and possibly some of the Iberians, wore armour and fought as close-order troops; most or all of the mounted Iberians were light cavalry. Slingers were frequently recruited from the Balearic Islands. The Carthaginians also employed war elephants; North Africa had indigenous African forest elephants at the time.

Garrison duty and land blockades were the most common operations. When armies were campaigning, surprise attacks, ambushes and stratagems were common. More formal battles were usually preceded by the two armies camping apart for days or weeks; sometimes forming up in battle order each day. If either commander felt at a disadvantage, they might march off without engaging. In such circumstances it was difficult to force a battle if the other commander was unwilling to fight. Forming up in battle order was a complicated and premeditated affair, which took several hours. Infantry were usually positioned in the centre of the battle line, with light infantry skirmishers to their front and cavalry on each flank. Many battles were decided when one side&#x27;s infantry force was attacked in the flank or rear and they were partially or wholly enveloped.

Both states possessed large fleets throughout the war. The Carthaginian fleet rarely put to sea, and when it did it was usually to escort transport ships; it rarely acted aggressively. This gave the Romans naval superiority for the duration of the war.

== Background ==
The Roman Republic had been aggressively expanding in the southern Italian mainland for a century and had conquered peninsular Italy south of the Arno River by 270BC, after the Pyrrhic War when the Greek cities of southern Italy (Magna Graecia) submitted. During this period of Roman expansion, Carthage, with its capital in what is now Tunisia, had come to dominate southern Iberia, much of the coastal regions of North Africa, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia and the western half of Sicily. 

By 264BC Carthage was the dominant external power on Sicily, and Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean. Relationships were good, the two states had several times declared their mutual friendship and there were strong commercial links. According to the classicist Richard Miles Rome&#x27;s expansionary attitude after southern Italy came under its control combined with Carthage&#x27;s proprietary approach to Sicily caused the two powers to stumble into war more by accident than design. The immediate cause of the First Punic War was the issue of control of the independent Sicilian city state of Messana (modern Messina). In 264BC Carthage and Rome went to war.

The war was fought primarily on Sicily and its surrounding waters; the Romans also unsuccessfully invaded North Africa in 256BC. It was the longest continuous conflict and the greatest naval war of antiquity, with immense materiel and human losses on both sides. In 241BC, after 23 years of war, the Carthaginians were defeated. Under the Roman-dictated Treaty of Lutatius Carthage ceded its Sicilian possessions to Rome. Rome exploited Carthage&#x27;s distraction during the Truceless War against rebellious mercenaries and Libyan subjects to break the peace treaty and annex Carthaginian Sardinia and Corsica in 238 BC. Under the leadership of Hamilcar Barca, Carthage defeated the rebels in 237 BC.

With the suppression of the rebellion, Hamilcar understood that Carthage needed to strengthen its economic and military base if it was to confront Rome again; Carthaginian possessions in Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal) were limited to a handful of prosperous coastal cities in the south and Hamilcar took the army which he had led in the Truceless War to Iberia in 237BC and carved out a quasi-monarchical, autonomous state in southern and eastern Iberia. This gave Carthage the silver mines, agricultural wealth, manpower, military facilities such as shipyards, and territorial depth to stand up to future Roman demands with confidence. Hamilcar ruled as a viceroy and was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal, in 229BC and then his son, Hannibal, in 221BC. 

In 226BC the Ebro Treaty was agreed with Rome, specifying the Ebro River as the northern boundary of the Carthaginian sphere of influence. At some time during the next six years Rome made a separate agreement with the city of Saguntum, which was situated well south of the Ebro. In 219BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal besieged Saguntum, and after eight months captured and sacked it. Rome complained to the Carthaginian government, sending an embassy headed by Quintus Fabius Maximus to its senate with peremptory demands. When these were rejected Rome declared war in the spring of 218BC.

Since the end of the First Punic War Rome had also been expanding, especially in the area of north Italy either side of the River Po known as Cisalpine Gaul. Roman attempts to establish towns and farms in the region from 232 BC led to repeated wars with the local Gallic tribes, who were finally defeated in 222. In 218 the Romans pushed even further north, establishing two new towns, or &quot;colonies&quot;, on the Po and appropriating large areas of the best land. Most of the Gauls resented this intrusion.

== Italy ==

=== Hannibal crosses the Alps, 218 BC ===
During 218BC there was some naval skirmishing in the waters around Sicily; the Romans repulsed a Carthaginian attack and captured the island of Malta. In Cisalpine Gaul (modern northern Italy), the major Gallic tribes attacked the Roman colonies there, causing the settlers to flee to their previously established colony of Mutina (modern Modena), where they were besieged. A Roman relief force broke through the siege, but was then ambushed and itself besieged. An army had previously been raised by the Romans to campaign in Iberia, but the Roman Senate detached one Roman and one allied legion from it to send to north Italy. Recruiting fresh troops to replace these delayed the army&#x27;s departure for Iberia until September. At the same time a Roman army in Sicily under the consul Sempronius Longus was preparing for an invasion of Africa.

Meanwhile, Hannibal assembled a Carthaginian army in New Carthage (modern Cartagena) and led it northwards along the Iberian coast in May or June. It entered Gaul and took an inland route, to avoid the Roman allies to the south. At the battle of Rhone Crossing, Hannibal defeated a force of local Gauls which sought to bar his way. A Roman fleet carrying the Iberian-bound army landed at Rome&#x27;s ally Massalia (modern Marseille) at the mouth of the Rhone, but Hannibal evaded the Romans and continued to Italy. 

The Carthaginians reached the foot of the Alps by late autumn and crossed them in 15 days, surmounting the difficulties of climate, terrain and the guerrilla warfare tactics of the native Ligurians. Hannibal arrived in Cisalpine Gaul with 20,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and an unknown number of elephantsthe survivors of the 37 with which he left Iberia some time in November; the Romans had already gone into their winter quarters. Hannibal&#x27;s surprise entry into the Italian peninsula led to the cancellation of Rome&#x27;s planned campaign for the year: an invasion of Africa.

=== Carthaginian victories, 218–216 BC ===

Shortly after arriving in Italy the Carthaginians captured the chief city of the hostile Taurini (in the area of modern Turin) and seized its food stocks. In late November 218BC the Carthaginian cavalry routed the cavalry and light infantry of the Romans at the battle of Ticinus. As a result, most of the Gallic tribes declared for the Carthaginian cause and Hannibal&#x27;s army grew to more than 40,000 men. The Senate ordered the army in Sicily north to join the force already facing Hannibal, thus abandoning the plan to invade Africa. The combined Roman force under the command of Sempronius was lured into combat by Hannibal on ground of his choosing at the battle of the Trebia. The Carthaginians encircled the Romans and only 10,000 out of 40,000 were able to fight their way to safety. Having secured his position in Cisalpine Gaul by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter among the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, bringing it up to 50,000 men.

There was shock when news of the defeat reached Rome, but this calmed once Sempronius arrived, to preside over the consular elections in the usual manner. The consuls-elect recruited further legions, both Roman and from Rome&#x27;s Latin allies; reinforced Sardinia and Sicily against the possibility of Carthaginian raids or invasion; placed garrisons at Tarentum and other places for similar reasons; built a fleet of 60 quinqueremes; and established supply depots at Ariminum and Arretium in preparation for marching north later in the year. Two armies of four legions each, two Roman and two allied but with stronger than usual cavalry contingents, were formed. One was stationed at Arretium and one on the Adriatic coast; they would be able to block Hannibal&#x27;s possible advance into central Italy and were positioned to move north to operate in Cisalpine Gaul.

In early spring 217BC the Carthaginians crossed the Apennines unopposed, taking a difficult but unguarded route. Hannibal attempted to draw the main Roman army under Gaius Flaminius into a pitched battle by devastating the area they had been sent to protect provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit. Hannibal set an ambush and in the battle of Lake Trasimene completely defeated the Roman army, killing 15,000 Romans, including Flaminius, and taking 10,000 prisoners. A cavalry force of 4,000 from the other Roman army was also defeated at the battle of Umbrian Lake and annihilated. The prisoners were badly treated if they were Romans; captured Latin allies were well treated by the Carthaginians and many were freed and sent back to their cities, in the expectation they would speak well of Carthaginian martial prowess and of their treatment. Hannibal hoped some of these allies could be persuaded to defect.

The Carthaginians continued their march through Etruria, then Umbria, to the Adriatic coast, then turned south into Apulia, hoping to win over some of the ethnic Greek and Italic cities of southern Italy. News of the defeat again caused a panic in Rome. The head of the embassy that was sent to Carthage right before the war broke out in 218 BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus, was elected dictator by the Roman Assembly and adopted the &quot;Fabian strategy&quot; of avoiding pitched battles, relying instead on low-level harassment to wear the invader down, until Rome could rebuild its military strength. Hannibal was left largely free to ravage Apulia for the next year. 

Fabius was unpopular at this period with parts of the Roman army, public and the senate, for avoiding battle while Italy was being devastated by the enemy: there was awareness that his tactics would not lead to a quick end to the war. Hannibal marched through the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping the devastation would draw Fabius into battle, but Fabius refused. The Roman populace derided Fabius as &quot;the Delayer&quot; (in Latin, ) and in 216 BC elected new consuls: Gaius Terentius Varro, who advocated pursuing a more aggressive war strategy, and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, who advocated a strategy somewhere between Fabius&#x27;s and that suggested by Varro. 

In the spring of 216 BC Hannibal seized the large supply depot at Cannae on the Apulian plain. The Roman Senate authorised the raising of double-sized armies by Varro and Paullus, a force of 86,000 men, the largest in Roman history up to that point. Paullus and Varro marched southward to confront Hannibal and encamped away. Hannibal accepted battle on the open plain between the armies in the battle of Cannae. The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal&#x27;s deliberately weak centre, but Libyan heavy infantry on the wings swung around their advance, menacing their flanks. Hasdrubal Gisco led the Carthaginian cavalry on the left wing and routed the Roman cavalry opposite, then swept around the rear of the Romans to attack their cavalry on the other wing. The heavily outnumbered Carthaginian infantry held out until Hasdrubal charged into the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman infantry was surrounded with no means of escape. At least 67,500 Romans were killed or captured.

Miles describes Cannae as &quot;Rome&#x27;s greatest military disaster&quot;. Toni Ñaco del Hoyo describes the Trebia, Lake Trasimene and Cannae as the three &quot;great military calamities&quot; suffered by the Romans in the first three years of the war. Brian Carey writes that these three defeats brought Rome to the brink of collapse. Within a few weeks of Cannae a Roman army of 25,000 was ambushed by Boii Gauls in Cisalpine Gaul at the battle of Silva Litana and annihilated. Fabius became consul in 215 BC and was re-elected in 214 BC.

=== Roman allies defect, 216–214 BC ===
Little has survived of Polybius&#x27;s account of Hannibal&#x27;s army in Italy after Cannae. Livy gives a fuller record, but according to Goldsworthy &quot;his reliability is often suspect&quot;, especially with regard to his descriptions of battles; many modern historians agree, but nevertheless his is the best surviving source for this part of the war.

Several of the city states in southern Italy allied with Hannibal, or were captured when pro-Carthaginian factions betrayed their defences. These included the large city of Capua and the major port city of Tarentum (modern Taranto). Two of the major Samnite tribes also joined the Carthaginian cause. By 214BC the bulk of southern Italy had turned against Rome, although there were many exceptions and the majority of Rome&#x27;s allies in central Italy remained loyal. All except the smallest towns were too well fortified for Hannibal to take by assault, and blockade could be a long-drawn-out affair, or if the target was a port, impossible. Carthage&#x27;s new allies felt little sense of community with Carthage, or even with each other. They increased the number of places which Hannibal&#x27;s army was expected to defend from Roman retribution, but provided relatively few fresh troops to assist him in doing so. Such Italian forces as were raised resisted operating away from their home cities and performed poorly when they did.

An important part of Hannibal&#x27;s campaign in Italy was to attempt to fight the Romans by using local resources; raising recruits from among the local population. His subordinate Hanno was able to raise troops in Samnium in 214 BC, but the Romans intercepted these new levies in the battle of Beneventum and eliminated them before they rendezvoused with Hannibal. Hannibal could win allies, but defending them against the Romans was a new and difficult problem, as the Romans could still field multiple armies, which in total greatly outnumbered his own forces.

The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, Capua, when Hannibal&#x27;s army marched into Campania in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved too strong a temptation. The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations. When the port city of Locri defected to Carthage in the summer of 215BC it was immediately used to reinforce the Carthaginian forces in Italy with soldiers, supplies and war elephants. It was the only time during the war Carthage reinforced Hannibal. A second force, under Hannibal&#x27;s youngest brother Mago, was meant to land in Italy in 215BC but was diverted to Iberia after a major Carthaginian defeat there.

Meanwhile, the Romans took drastic steps to raise new legions: enrolling slaves, criminals and those who did not meet the usual property qualification. By early 215BC they were fielding at least 12 legions; by 214BC 18; and by 213BC 22. By 212 BC the full complement of the legions deployed would have been in excess of 100,000 men, plus, as always, a similar number of allied troops. The majority were deployed in southern Italy in field armies of approximately 20,000 men each. This was insufficient to challenge Hannibal&#x27;s army in open battle, but sufficient to force him to concentrate his forces and to hamper his movements.

=== Macedonia, Sardinia and Sicily ===
During 215BC the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome in 215BC. The Romans were concerned that the Macedonians would attempt to cross the Strait of Otranto and land in Italy. They strongly reinforced their navy in the area and despatched a legion to stand guard, and the threat petered out. In 211BC Rome contained the Macedonians by allying with the Aetolian League, a coalition of Greek city states which was already at war with Macedonia. In 205BC this war ended with a negotiated peace.

A rebellion in support of the Carthaginians broke out on Sardinia in 213BC, but it was quickly put down by the Romans.

Prior to 215 BC Sicily remained firmly in Roman hands, blocking the ready seaborne reinforcement and resupply of Hannibal from Carthage. Hiero II, the old tyrant of Syracuse of forty-five-years standing and a staunch Roman ally, died in 215BC and his successor Hieronymus was discontented with his situation. Hannibal negotiated a treaty whereby Syracuse came over to Carthage, at the price of making the whole of Sicily a Syracusan possession. The Syracusan army proved no match for a Roman army led by Claudius Marcellus and by spring 213BC Syracuse was besieged. Both Polybius&#x27; and Livy&#x27;s accounts of the siege focus on Archimedes&#x27; invention of war machines to counteract Roman siege warfare, which was already made difficult by the strong defences of the city.

A large Carthaginian army led by Himilco was sent to relieve the city in 213BC and several further Sicilian cities deserted the Romans. In the spring of 212BC the Romans stormed Syracuse in a surprise night assault and captured several districts of the city. Meanwhile, the Carthaginian army was crippled by plague. After the Carthaginians failed to resupply the city, the rest of Syracuse fell in the autumn of 212BC; Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier.

Carthage sent more reinforcements to Sicily in 211BC and went on the offensive. In 211 BC Hannibal sent a force of Numidian cavalry to Sicily, which was led by the skilled Liby-Phoenician officer Mottones, who inflicted heavy losses on the Roman army through hit-and-run attacks. A fresh Roman army attacked the main Carthaginian stronghold on the island, Agrigentum, in 210BC and the city was betrayed to the Romans by a discontented Carthaginian officer. The remaining Carthaginian-controlled towns then surrendered or were taken through force or treachery and the Sicilian grain supply to Rome and its armies was resumed.

=== Italy, 213–208 BC ===
For 11 years after Cannae the war surged around southern Italy as cities went over to the Carthaginians or were taken by subterfuge and the Romans recaptured them by siege or by suborning factions within to give them entry. Hannibal repeatedly defeated Roman armies, but wherever his main army was not active the Romans threatened Carthaginian-supporting towns or sought battle with Carthaginian or Carthaginian-allied detachments; frequently with success. By 208BC many of the cities and territories which had joined the Carthaginian cause had returned to their Roman allegiance.

Fabius captured the Carthaginian-allied town Arpi in 213 BC. In 212 BC Hannibal destroyed the Roman army of Centenius Penula at the battle of the Silarus in northwest Lucania. Later the same year, Hannibal defeated another Roman army at the battle of Herdonia, with 16,000 men lost from a force of 18,000. Despite these losses, the Romans besieged Capua, the Carthaginians&#x27; key ally in Italy. Hannibal offered battle to the Romans; Livy&#x27;s account of the subsequent fighting is unclear, but the Romans seem to have suffered heavy casualties while the Carthaginians were unable to lift the siege. Hannibal then assaulted the Romans&#x27; siege works, but was again unable to relieve the city. In 211BC Hannibal again offered battle to the besieging Roman forces, this time they declined to leave their fortifications. In desperation Hannibal again assaulted them and again failed to break through. He next marched his army towards Rome, hoping to compel the Romans to abandon the siege to defend it; however, the besieging force stayed in place and Capua fell soon afterwards. The city was stripped of its political autonomy and placed under Roman appointees.

In 210 the Carthaginians caught a Roman army off guard outside Herdonia, heavily defeating it after its commander accepted battle. Livy then has Hannibal fighting the inconclusive battle of Numistro, although modern historians doubt his account. The Romans stayed on Hannibal&#x27;s heels, fighting another pitched battle at Canusium in 209 BC and again suffering heavy losses. This battle enabled another Roman army to approach Tarentum and capture it by treachery.

=== Italy, 207–203 BC ===
In the spring of 207BC Hasdrubal Barca repeated the feat of his elder brother by marching an army across the Alps. He invaded Cisalpine Gaul with an army of 35,000 men, intending to join forces with Hannibal, but Hannibal was unaware of his presence. The Romans facing Hannibal in southern Italy tricked him into believing the whole Roman army was still in camp, while a large portion marched north under the consul Claudius Nero. They reinforced the Romans under the second consul, Marcus Salinator, who were already facing Hasdrubal. This combined Roman force attacked at the battle of the Metaurus and destroyed the Carthaginian army, killing Hasdrubal. This battle confirmed Roman dominance in Italy and marked the end of their Fabian strategy. Without the expected reinforcement Hannibal&#x27;s forces were compelled to evacuate allied towns and withdraw to Bruttium.

In 205BC Mago Barca, another of Hannibal&#x27;s younger brothers, landed in Genua in north-west Italy with the remnants of his Spanish army. It soon received Gallic and Ligurian reinforcements. Mago&#x27;s arrival in the north of the Italian peninsula was followed by Hannibal&#x27;s inconclusive battle of Crotona in 204BC in the far south of the peninsula. Mago marched his reinforced army towards the lands of Carthage&#x27;s main Gallic allies in Cisalpine Gaul, but was checked by a large Roman army and defeated at the battle of Insubria in 203BC.

After a Roman army invaded the Carthaginian homeland in 204BC, defeating the Carthaginians in two major battles and winning the allegiance of the Numidian kingdoms of North Africa, Hannibal and the remnants of his army were recalled. They sailed from Croton and landed at Carthage with 15,000–20,000 experienced veterans. Mago was also recalled; he died of wounds on the voyage and some of his ships were intercepted by the Romans, but 12,000 of his troops reached Carthage.

== Iberia ==

=== Iberia 218–211 BC ===
The Roman fleet continued on from Massala in the autumn of 218BC, landing the army it was transporting in north-east Iberia, where it won support among the local tribes. The Romans&#x27; lodgement between the Ebro and the Pyrenees blocked the route from Iberia to Italy, making the despatch of reinforcements from Iberia to Hannibal difficult. A Carthaginian attack in late 218BC was repelled at the battle of Cissa. In 217BC 40 Carthaginian and Iberian warships were beaten by 35 Roman and Massalian vessels at the battle of Ebro River, with the loss of 29 Carthaginian ships.

In 216 Hasdrubal received orders from Carthage to move into Italy and join up with Hannibal to put pressure on the Romans in their homeland. Hasdrubal demurred, arguing that Carthaginian authority over the Iberian tribes was too fragile and the Roman forces in the area too strong for him to execute the planned movement. In 215 Hasdrubal eventually acted, besieging a pro-Roman town and offering battle at Dertosa, where he attempted to use his cavalry superiority to clear the flanks of the Roman army while enveloping their centre on both sides with his infantry. However, the Romans broke through the centre of the Carthaginian line and then defeated each wing separately, inflicting severe losses. It was no longer possible for Hasdrubal to reinforce Hannibal in Italy.

The Carthaginians suffered a wave of defections of local Celtiberian tribes to Rome. The Roman commanders captured Saguntum in 212BC and in 211BC hired 20,000 Celtiberian mercenaries to reinforce their army. Observing that the Carthaginian forces in Iberia were divided into three armies which were deployed apart from each other, the Romans split their forces. This strategy resulted in two separate battles in 211, usually referred to jointly as the battle of the Upper Baetis. Both battles ended in complete defeat for the Romans, as Hasdrubal had bribed the Romans&#x27; mercenaries to desert. The Roman survivors retreated to their coastal stronghold north of the Ebro, from which the Carthaginians again failed to expel them. Claudius Nero brought over reinforcements in 210BC and stabilised the situation.

=== Iberia, 211–205 BC ===
In 210 BC Publius Cornelius Scipio, arrived in Iberia with further Roman reinforcements. In a carefully planned assault in 209BC he captured the lightly defended centre of Carthaginian power in Iberia, New Carthage, seizing a vast booty of gold, silver and siege artillery. He released the captured population and liberated the Iberian hostages held there by the Carthaginians, in an attempt to ensure the loyalty of their tribes.

In the spring of 208BC Hasdrubal moved to engage Scipio at the battle of Baecula. The Carthaginians were defeated, but Hasdrubal was able to withdraw the majority of his army and prevent any Roman pursuit; most of his losses were among his Iberian allies. Scipio was not able to prevent Hasdrubal from leading his depleted army over the western passes of the Pyrenees into Gaul. In 207BC, after recruiting heavily in Gaul, Hasdrubal crossed the Alps into Italy in an attempt to join his brother, Hannibal, but was defeated before he could.

In 206BC, at the battle of Ilipa, Scipio with 48,000 men, half Italian and half Iberian, defeated a Carthaginian army of 54,500 men and 32 elephants. This sealed the fate of the Carthaginians in Iberia. The last Carthaginian-held city in Iberia, Gades, defected to the Romans. Later the same year a mutiny broke out among Roman troops, which attracted support from Iberian leaders, disappointed that Roman forces had remained in the peninsula after the expulsion of the Carthaginians, but it was put down by Scipio. In 205BC an attempt was made by Mago to recapture New Carthage when the Roman occupiers were shaken by another mutiny and an Iberian uprising, but he was repulsed. Mago left Iberia for northern Italy with his remaining forces. In 203BC Carthage succeeded in recruiting at least 4,000 mercenaries from Iberia, despite Rome&#x27;s nominal control.

== Africa ==

=== Africa, 213–206 BC ===
In 213BC Syphax, a powerful Numidian king in North Africa, declared for Rome. In response Carthaginian troops were sent to North Africa from Spain. In 206BC the Carthaginians ended this drain on their resources by dividing several Numidian kingdoms with Syphax. One of those disinherited was the Numidian prince Masinissa, who was thus driven into the arms of Rome.

=== Roman invasion of Africa, 204–201 BC ===
In 205BC Publius Scipio was given command of the legions in Sicily and allowed to enrol volunteers for his plan to end the war by an invasion of Africa. After landing in Africa in 204BC he was joined by Masinissa and a force of Numidian cavalry. Scipio twice gave battle and destroyed two large Carthaginian armies. After the second encounter Syphax was pursued and taken prisoner by Masinissa at the battle of Cirta; Masinissa then seized most of Syphax&#x27;s kingdom with Roman help.

Rome and Carthage entered into peace negotiations and Carthage recalled both Hannibal and Mago from Italy. The Roman Senate ratified a draft treaty, but because of mistrust and a surge in confidence when Hannibal arrived from Italy, Carthage repudiated it. Hannibal was placed in command of another army, formed from his veterans from Italy and newly raised troops from Africa, but with few cavalry. The decisive battle of Zama followed in October 202BC. Unlike most battles of the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians in infantry. Hannibal attempted to use 80 elephants to break into the Roman infantry formation, but the Romans countered them effectively and the elephants routed back through the Carthaginian ranks. The Roman and allied Numidian cavalry then pressed their attacks and drove the Carthaginian cavalry from the field. The two sides&#x27; infantry fought inconclusively until the Roman cavalry returned and attacked the Carthaginian rear. The Carthaginian formation collapsed; Hannibal was one of the few to escape the field.

== Roman victory ==
The new peace treaty dictated by Rome stripped Carthage of all of its overseas territories and some of its African ones. An indemnity of 10,000 talents of silver was to be paid over 50 years and hostages were taken. Carthage was forbidden to possess war elephants and its fleet was restricted to ten warships. It was prohibited from waging war outside Africa and in Africa only with Rome&#x27;s permission. Many senior Carthaginians wanted to reject the treaty but Hannibal spoke strongly in its favour and it was accepted in spring 201BC. Henceforth it was clear Carthage was politically subordinate to Rome. Scipio was awarded a triumph and received the &quot;Africanus&quot;.

Rome&#x27;s African ally, King Masinissa of Numidia, exploited the prohibition on Carthage waging war to repeatedly raid and seize Carthaginian territory with impunity. In 149 BC, fifty years after the end of the Second Punic War, Carthage sent an army, under Hasdrubal, against Masinissa, the treaty notwithstanding. The campaign ended in disaster at the battle of Oroscopa and anti-Carthaginian factions in Rome used the illicit military action as a pretext to prepare a punitive expedition. The Third Punic War began later in 149 BC when a large Roman army landed in North Africa and besieged Carthage. In the spring of 146 BC the Romans launched their final assault, systematically destroying the city and killing its inhabitants; 50,000 survivors were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian territories became the Roman province of Africa. It was a century before the site of Carthage was rebuilt as a Roman city.

<text>Stuttgart (; Swabian: ; ) is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley known as the &quot;Stuttgarter Kessel&quot; (Stuttgart Cauldron) and lies an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart has a population of 632,865 as of 2022, making it the sixth largest city in Germany, while over 2.8 million people live in the city&#x27;s administrative region and nearly 5.5 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. The city and metropolitan area are consistently ranked among the top 5 European metropolitan areas by GDP; Mercer listed Stuttgart as 21st on its 2015 list of cities by quality of living; innovation agency 2thinknow ranked the city 24th globally out of 442 cities in its Innovation Cities Index; and the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked the city as a Beta-status global city in their 2020 survey. Stuttgart was one of the host cities for the official tournaments of the 1974 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.

Stuttgart is unusual in the scheme of German cities. It is spread across a variety of hills (some of them covered in vineyards), valleys (especially around the Neckar river and the Stuttgart basin) and parks. The city is known as the &quot;cradle of the automobile&quot;. As such, it is home to famous automobile museums like the Mercedes-Benz Museum and Porsche Museum, as well as numerous auto-enthusiast magazines, which contributes to Stuttgart&#x27;s status as Germany&#x27;s &quot;Autohauptstadt&quot; (&quot;car capital city&quot;/&quot;capital of cars&quot;). The city&#x27;s tourism slogan is &quot;Stuttgart offers more&quot;. Under current plans to improve transport links to the international infrastructure (as part of the Stuttgart 21 project), Stuttgart unveiled a new city logo and slogan in March 2008, describing itself as &quot;&quot; (&quot;The new Heart of Europe&quot;). For business, it describes itself as &quot;Where business meets the future&quot;. In July 2010, the city unveiled a new logo, designed to entice more business people to stay in the city and enjoy breaks in the area.

Since the seventh millennium BC, the Stuttgart area has been an important agricultural area and has been host to a number of cultures seeking to utilize the rich soil of the Neckar valley. The Roman Empire conquered the area in AD 83 and built a massive near Bad Cannstatt, making it the most important regional centre for several centuries. Stuttgart&#x27;s roots were truly laid in the tenth century with its founding by Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, as a stud farm for his warhorses. Initially overshadowed by nearby Bad Cannstatt, the town grew steadily and was granted a charter in 1320. The fortunes of Stuttgart turned with those of the House of Württemberg, and they made it the capital of their county, duchy, and kingdom from the 15th century to 1918. Stuttgart prospered despite setbacks in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and devastating air raids by the Allies on the city and its automobile production during World War II. However, by 1952, the city had bounced back and became the major cultural, economic, industrial, financial, tourism and publishing centre it is today.

Stuttgart is known for its strong high-tech industry, especially in the automotive sector. It has the highest general standard of prosperity of any German city. In addition to many medium-sized companies, several major corporations are headquartered in Stuttgart, including Porsche, Bosch, Exyte, and Mercedes-Benz Group. Stuttgart is an important financial center; the Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt), and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) is Germany&#x27;s largest Landesbank. Stuttgart is also a major transport junction; it is among the most congested conurbations of Europe, and its airport is the sixth-busiest in Germany (2019). Stuttgart is a city with a high number of immigrants; according to Dorling Kindersley&#x27;s &quot;Eyewitness Travel Guide to Germany&quot;, &quot;In the city of Stuttgart, every third inhabitant is a foreigner.&quot; 40% of Stuttgart&#x27;s residents, and 64% of the population below the age of five, are of immigrant background. In the rest of Germany, 28.7% of people are of immigrant background, with a relatively higher percentage living in cities and former western Germany (such as Stuttgart).

==Etymology==
Stuttgart, often nicknamed the &quot;Schwabenmetropole&quot; () in reference to its location in the centre of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by the native Swabians, has its etymological roots in the Old High German word , or &quot;stud farm&quot;, because the city was founded in 950 AD by Duke Liudolf of Swabia to breed warhorses.

In the local dialects of Alemannic German it can be &quot;, and in Swabian German &quot;; with similar variant spellings, usually dropping the central T sound.

== History ==







=== Antiquity ===
Originally, the most important location in the Neckar river valley was the hilly rim of the Stuttgart basin at what is today Bad Cannstatt. Thus, the first settlement of Stuttgart was a massive Roman &quot;Castra stativa&quot; (Cannstatt Castrum) built AD to protect the Villas and vineyards blanketing the landscape and the road from Mogontiacum (now Mainz) to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). Cannstatt was a part of the Roman imperial province Germania Superior.

As with many military installations, a settlement sprang up nearby and remained there even after the limes moved further east. When they did, the town was left in the capable hands of a local brickworks that produced sophisticated architectural ceramics and pottery. When the Romans were driven back past the Rhine and Danube rivers in the third century by the Alamanni, the settlement temporarily vanished from history until the seventh century.

=== Middle Ages ===

In 700, Duke Gotfrid mentions a &quot;Chan Stada&quot; in a document regarding property. Archaeological evidence shows that later Merovingian era Frankish farmers continued to till the same land the Romans did.

Cannstatt is mentioned in the Abbey of St. Gall&#x27;s archives as &quot;&quot;Canstat ad Neccarum&quot; () in 708. The etymology of the name &quot;Cannstatt&quot;&quot; is not clear, but as the site is mentioned as &quot;condistat&quot; in the Annals of Metz (9th century), it is mostly derived from the Latin word &quot;condita&quot; (&quot;foundation&quot;), suggesting that the name of the Roman settlement might have had the prefix &quot;Condi-&quot;. Alternatively, Sommer (1992) suggested that the Roman site corresponds to the &quot;Civitas Aurelia G&quot; attested to in an inscription found near Öhringen. There have also been attempts at a derivation from a Gaulish &quot;*kondâti-&quot; &quot;confluence&quot;.

In AD 950, Duke Liudolf of Swabia, son of the current Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, decided to establish a stud farm for his cavalry during the Hungarian invasions of Europe on a widened area of the Nesenbach river valley south of the old Roman castrum. The land and title of Duke of Swabia remained in Liudolf&#x27;s hands until his rebellion was quashed by his father four years later. In 1089, Bruno of Calw built the precursor building to the Old Castle.

Stuttgart&#x27;s viticulture, first documented in the Holy Roman Empire in the year AD 1108, kept people in the area of that stud farm for some time, but the area was still largely overshadowed by nearby Cannstatt because of its role as a local crossroad for many major European trade routes. Nevertheless, the existence of a settlement here (despite the terrain being more suited for that original stud farm) during the High Middle Ages is provided by a gift registry from Hirsau Abbey dated to around 1160 that mentions a &quot;Hugo de Stuokarten&quot;. A settlement at this locale was again mentioned in 1229, but this time by Pope Gregory IX. In AD 1219, Stuttgart (then Stuotgarten) became a possession of Herman V, Margrave of Baden. In addition to Backnang, Pforzheim, and Besigheim, Hermann would also found the Stuttgart we know today in . In 1251, the city passed to the Ulrich I von Württemberg as part of Mechthild von Baden&#x27;s dowry. His son, Eberhard I &quot;the Illustrious&quot;, would be the first to begin the many major expansions of Stuttgart under the House of Württemberg.

Eberhard desired to expand the realm his father had built through military action with the aid of the anti-king Henry Raspe IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, but was thwarted by the action of Emperor Rudolph I. Further resistance by Eberhard I against the Emperor&#x27;s created Vogts and Bailiwicks as well as the newly appointed Duke of Swabia Rudolf II, Duke of Austria, eventually led to armed conflict and initial successes upon Emperor Rudolph I&#x27;s death in 1291 against the Emperor&#x27;s men. After initially defeating his regional rivals, Henry VII, newly elected as Emperor, decided to take action against Eberhard I in 1311 during his war with the Free imperial city of Esslingen by ordering his Vogt, Konrad IV von Weinberg, to declare war on Eberhard I. Eberhard I, defeated on the battlefield, lost Stuttgart and his castle (razed in 1311) to Esslingen and the city was thus managed by the city state from 1312 to 1315. Total destruction of the county was prevented by Henry VII&#x27;s death on 24 August 1313 and the elections of Louis IV as King of the Germans and Frederick III as anti-king. Eberhard seized the opportunity granted to him by the political chaos, and recaptured his hometown and birthplace in 1316, and made much territorial gain. With peace restored at last, Eberhard began repairs and expansion to Stuttgart beginning with the reconstruction of Wirtemberg Castle, ancestral home to the House of Württemberg, in 1317 and then began expansion of the city&#x27;s defenses. The early 1320s were important years for Stuttgart: Eberhard I moved the seat of the county to the city to a new and expanded castle, the collegiate church in Beutelsbach, where previous members of the Württemberg dynasty had been buried prior to its destruction in 1311, moved to its current location in Stuttgart in 1320, and the town&#x27;s Stiftkirche was expanded into an abbey, and the control of the Martinskirche by the Bishopric of Constance was broken by Papal order in 1321. A year after the city became the principal seat of the Counts of Württemberg in 1320, the city was granted status as a city and given civic rights. At the end of the 14th century, new suburbs sprang up around Leonhard Church and near the city&#x27;s fortifications as well. Towards the end of the 15th century, Count Ulrich V began construction of a new suburb on the northeastern edge of the city around the Dominican monastery Hospitalkirche. In the 1457, the first Landtag of the Estates of Württemberg was established in Stuttgart and a similar institution was established in Leonberg. After the temporary partitions of the County of Württemberg by the Treaties of Nürtingen, Münsingen, and Esslingen, Stuttgart was once again declared the capital of the county in 1483.

=== Early Modern era ===
In 1488, Stuttgart officially became the de facto residence of the Count himself as opposed to the location of his home, the Old Castle. Eberhard I, then Count Eberhard V, became the first Duke of Württemberg in 1495, and made Stuttgart the seat of the Duchy of Württemberg in addition to the County thereof. All this would be lost to the Württembergs during the reign of his son, Ulrich. Though Ulrich initially made territorial gains as a result of his decision to fight alongside the Emperor Maximilian I, he was no friend of the powerful Swabian League nor of his own subjects, who launched the Poor Conrad rebellion of 1514. Despite this and his rivalry with the Swabian League, his undoing would actually come in the form of his unhappy marriage to Sabina of Bavaria. In 1515, Ulrich killed an imperial knight and lover of Sabina&#x27;s by the name of Hans von Hutten, obliging her to flee to the court of her brother, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, who successfully had Ulrich placed under Imperial ban twice. When the Emperor died in 1519, Ulrich struck, seizing the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen, prompting the League to intervene. That same year, Ulrich was soundly defeated and he was driven into exile in France and Switzerland following the League&#x27;s conquest of Württemberg. Württemberg was then sold by the League to Emperor Charles V, who then granted it to his brother, Ferdinand I, thus beginning the 12 year ownership of the county by the Habsburgs. When the peasants Ulrich had crushed before rose once again in the German Peasants&#x27; War, Stuttgart was occupied by the peasant armies for a few days in the Spring of 1525. Ulrich, with the help of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, seized the chance to restore himself to power (albeit as an Austrian vassal) in the turmoil of the Reformation and War with the Turks and invited Erhard Schnepf to bring the Reformation to Stuttgart. He accepted, was named Court Preacher in Stuttgart, and worked in concert with Ambrosius Blarer until his dismissal following his resistance to the Augsburg Interim by the Duke in 1548. Duke Ulrich himself died two years later, and was succeeded by his son, Christoph. He had grown up in a Württemberg in turmoil, and wished to rebuild its image. To this end, he once again began a construction boom all over the Duchy under the direction of Court Architect Aberlin Tretsch; knowing full well that the time of the Reisekönigtum was over, Christoph and Tretsch rebuilt and remodeled the Old Castle into a Renaissance palace, and from 1542 to 1544, what is today the Schillerplatz was built as a town square. Duke Christoph also responded to the increasing made for drinking water by embarking upon a massive hydraulic engineering project in the form of a tunnel to Pffaf Lake, the Glems, and the Nesenbach from 1566 to 1575. In 1575, Georg Beer was also appointed Court Architect, and he built the Lusthaus. But it was architect Heinrich Schickhardt who would carry Tretsch&#x27;s torch further; Schickhardt constructed the Stammheim Castle in the suburb of Stammheim, rebuilt the Fruchtkasten in the today&#x27;s Schillerplatz, and expanded the Prinzebau.

The Thirty Years&#x27; War devastated the city, and it would slowly decline for a period of time from then on. After the catastrophic defeat of the Protestant Heilbronn League by the Habsburgs at Nörlingen in 1634, Duke Eberhard III and his court fled in exile to Strasbourg, abandoning the Duchy to looting by pro-Habsburg forces. The Habsburgs once again had full reign of the city for another four years, and in that time Stuttgart had to carry the burden of billeting the pro-Habsburg armies in Swabia. Ferdinand III, King of the Romans, entered the city in 1634 and, two years later in 1636, once again attempted to re-Catholicize Württemberg. The next year, the Bubonic plague struck and devastated the population. The Duke returned in 1638 to a realm somewhat partitioned to Catholic factions in the region, and entirely ravaged by the war. In the Duchy itself, battle, famine, plague and war reduced the Duchy&#x27;s population of 350,000 in 1618 to 120,000 in 1648 – about 57% of the population of Württemberg. Recovery would be slow for the next several decades, but began nonetheless with the city&#x27;s first bookstore in 1650 and high school in 1686. This progress was almost entirely undone when French soldiers under Ezéchiel du Mas appeared outside the city&#x27;s walls in 1688 during the Nine Years&#x27; War, but the city was saved from another sack due to the diplomatic ability of Magdalena Sibylla, reigning over Württemberg as regent for her son, Eberhard Ludwig.

For the first time in centuries, Duke Eberhard Ludwig moved the seat of the Duchy out of the declining city of Stuttgart in 1718 to Ludwigsburg, founded in 1704, while the namesake Baroque palace, known as the &quot;Versailles of Swabia&quot;, was still under construction. When Eberhard Ludwig died, his nephew Charles Alexander, ascended to the throne. Charles Alexander himself died in 1737, meaning his son Charles Eugene became the premature Duke (and later King) at the age of nine. When he came of age and returned from his tutoring at the court of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, Charles desired to move the capital back to Stuttgart. He commissioned the construction of the New Castle in 1746, Castle Solitude in 1763, Castle Hohenheim in 1785, and the Karlsschule in 1770. The rule of Charles Eugene also saw the tutoring and origins of Friedrich Schiller in Stuttgart, who studied medicine and completed The Robbers here. Stuttgart, at the end of the 18th century, remained a very provincial town of 20,000 residents, narrow alleys, and agriculture and livestock. Despite being the capital and seat of the Duchy, the general staff of the Army of Württemberg was not present in the city. In 1794, Duke Charles dissolved the Karlsschule to prevent the spreading of revolutionary ideas.

Stuttgart was proclaimed capital once more when Württemberg became an electorate in 1803, and was yet again named as capital when the Kingdom of Württemberg was formed in 1805 by the Peace of Pressburg.

=== Kingdom of Württemberg and German Empire ===
King Frederick I&#x27;s Württemberg was given high status in the Confederation of the Rhine among the College of Kings, and the lands of nearby secondary German states. Within Stuttgart, the royal residence was expanded under Frederick although many of Stuttgart&#x27;s most important buildings, including Wilhelm Palace, Katharina Hospital, the State Gallery, the Villa Berg and the Königsbau were built under the reign of King Wilhelm I. In 1818. King Wilhelm I and Queen Catherine in an attempt to assuage the suffering caused by the Year Without Summer and following famine, introduced the first Cannstatter Volksfest to celebrate the year&#x27;s bountiful harvest. Hohenheim University was founded in 1818, and two years later the Württemberg Mausoleum as completed on the hill where Wirtemberg Castle once stood.

From the outset of the 19th century, Stuttgart&#x27;s development was once again impeded by its location (population of the city at the time was around 50,000), but the city began to experience the beginning of economic revival with the opening of the Main Station in 1846. Prior to then, the signs of rebirth in Stuttgart were evidenced by the construction of such buildings of Rosenstein Castle in 1822–1830, the Wilhelmspalais 1834–1840, and the foundations of the Staatsgalerie in 1843, University of Stuttgart in 1829, the University of Music and Performing Arts later, in 1857. Stuttgart had a role to play during the revolution of 1848/1849 as well. When internal divisions of the Frankfurt Parliament began the demise of that congress, the majority of the Frankfurt Congress voted to move to Stuttgart to flee the reach of the Prussian and Austrian armies in Frankfurt and Mainz. Even though the Congress may have had contacts with revolutionaries in Baden and Württemberg, the Congress, not popular with the content citizens of Stuttgart, were driven out by the King&#x27;s army.

Stuttgart&#x27;s literary tradition also bore yet more fruits, being the home of such writers of national importance as Wilhelm Hauff, Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab, and Eduard Mörike. From 1841 to 1846, the Jubiläumssäule was erected on the Schlossplatz before the New Palace according to the plans of Johann Michael Knapp to celebrate the rule of King Wilhelm I. A decade later, the Königsbau was constructed by Knapp and court architect Christian Friedrich von Leins as a concert hall. Another milestone in Stuttgart&#x27;s history was the running of the first rail line from Cannstatt to Untertürkheim on 22 October 1845. The advent of Industrialisation in Germany heralded a major growth of population for Stuttgart: In 1834, Stuttgart counted 35,200 inhabitants, rose to 50,000 in 1852, 69,084 inhabitants in 1864, and finally 91,000 residents in 1871. By 1874, Stuttgart once again exceeded the 100,000 inhabitant mark. This number doubled, due to the incorporation of local towns, to approximately 185,000 in 1901 and then 200,000 in 1904. In 1871, Württemberg joined the German Empire created by Otto von Bismarck, Prime Minister of Prussia, during the Unification of Germany, as an autonomous kingdom.

Stuttgart is purported to be the location of the automobile&#x27;s invention by Karl Benz and then industrialized by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in a small workshop in Bad Cannstatt that would become Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft in 1887. As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;cradle of the automobile&#x27;, and today Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. The year prior, Robert Bosch opened his first &quot;Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering&quot; in Stuttgart. In 1907, the International Socialist Congress was held in Stuttgart was attended by about 60,000 people. In 1912, VfB Stuttgart was founded. Two years later, the current iteration of the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof was completed according to plan by Paul Bonatz from 1914 to 1927.

During World War I, the city was a target of air raids. In 1915, 29 bombs struck the city and the nearby Rotebühlkaserne, killing four soldiers and injuring another 43, and likewise killing four civilians. The next major air raid on Stuttgart occurred 15 September 1918, when structural damage caused house collapses that killed eleven people.

=== Weimar Republic ===
At the end of the First World War, November revolutionaries stormed the Wilhelmpalais on 30 November 1918 to force King Wilhelm II to abdicate, but failed halfway. Under pressure from the revolutionaries, Wilhelm II refused the crown, but also refused to abdicate the throne. When he did eventually abdicate, the Free State of Württemberg was established as a part of the Weimar Republic, and Stuttgart was declared its capital. On 26 April 1919, a new constitution was devised, and the final draft was approved and ratified on 25 September 1919 by the Constituent Assembly. In 1920, Stuttgart temporarily became the seat of the German National Government when the administration fled from Berlin from the Kapp Putsch. Also in 1920, Erwin Rommel became the company commander of the 13th Infantry Regiment based in Stuttgart and would remain as such for the next nine years.

=== Nazi Germany ===
Due to the Nazi Party&#x27;s practice of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot;, Stuttgart&#x27;s political importance as state capital became totally nonexistent, though it remained the cultural and economic centre of the central Neckar region. Stuttgart, one of the cities bestowed an honorary title by the Nazi regime, was given the moniker &quot;City of the Abroad Germans&quot; in 1936. The first prototypes of the Volkswagen Beetle were manufactured in Stuttgart, according to designs by Ferdinand Porsche, by a design team including Erwin Komenda and Karl Rabe.

The Hotel Silber (), previously occupied by other forms of political police, was occupied by the Gestapo in 1933 to detain and torture political dissidents. The hotel was used for the transit of Nazi prisoners of conscience including Eugen Bolz, Kurt Schumacher, and Lilo Herrmann to concentration camps. The nearby court at Archive Street () 12A was also used as a central location for executions in Southwest Germany, as the headstone located in its atrium dedicated to the 419 lives lost there recalls. Participants of the Kristallnacht burned the Old Synagogue to the ground along with the relics contained within and also destroyed its Jewish cemetery. The next year the Nazi regime began the arrests and deportation of Stuttgart&#x27;s Jewish inhabitants, beginning with the entire male Jewish population of Stuttgart, to the police-run prison camp at Welzheim or directly to Dachau. Other Jews from around Württemberg were brought to Stuttgart and housed in the ghetto on the former Trade Fair grounds in Killesberg. As the Memorial at Stuttgart North records, between 1941 (the first train arrived 1 December 1941, and took around 1,000 men to Riga) and 1945, more than 2,000 Jews from all over Württemberg were deported to Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and the ghettos at Riga and Izbica. Of them, only 180 held in Internment survived the Shoah.

Stuttgart, like many of Germany&#x27;s major cities, was ravaged throughout the war by Allied air raids. For the first four years of the war, successful air raids on the city were rare because of the capable defence of the city by Wehrmacht ground forces, the Luftwaffe, and artificial fog. Despite opinions among some Royal Air Force members that day-time air raids on the city were suicidal, substantial damage to the city&#x27;s industrial capacity still occurred, such as the 25 August bombing of the Daimler AG plant in 1940 that killed five people. With the war increasingly turning against the Third Reich, more and more troops were pulled from the defence of the city in 1943 to fight on the Eastern Front. In 1944, the city centre was entirely in ruins due to Allied bombing raids that could now more easily attack the city. The heaviest raid took place on 12 September 1944, when the Royal Air Force, dropping over 184,000 bombs – including 75 blockbusters – levelled Stuttgart&#x27;s city centre, killing 957 people in the resulting firestorm. In totality, Stuttgart was subjected to 53 bombing raids, resulting in the destruction of 57.7% of all buildings in the city, the deaths of 4,477 inhabitants, the disappearance of 85 citizens, and the injury of 8,908 more people. The Allies lost 300 aircraft and seven to ten enlisted men. To commemorate the city citizens who died during the war, the rubble was assembled and used to create the Birkenkopf. Today Stuttgart consists to over 40% of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.

===French-American tensions===

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Stuttgart in April 1945. Although the attack on the city was to be conducted by the US Seventh Army&#x27;s 100th Infantry Division, French leader Charles de Gaulle found this to be unacceptable, as he felt the capture of the region by Free French forces would increase French influence in post-war decisions. Independently, he directed General de Lattre to order the French 5th Armored Division, 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division and 3rd Algerian Infantry Division to begin their drive to Stuttgart on 18 April 1945. Two days later, the French forces coordinated with the US Seventh Army and VI Corps heavy artillery, who began a barrage of the city. The French 5th Armored Division then captured Stuttgart on 21 April 1945, encountering little resistance. The city fared poorly under their direction; French troops forcefully quartered their troops in what housing remained in the city, rapes were frequent (there were at least 1,389 recorded incidents of rape of civilians by French soldiers), and the city&#x27;s surviving populace were poorly rationed. The circumstances of what later became known as &quot;The Stuttgart Crisis&quot; provoked political repercussions that reached even the White House. President Harry S. Truman was unable to get De Gaulle to withdraw troops from Stuttgart until after the final boundaries of the zones of occupation were established. The French army remained in the city until they finally relented to American demands on 8 July 1945 and withdrew. Stuttgart then became capital of Württemberg-Baden, one of the three areas of Allied occupation in Baden-Württemberg, from 1945 until 1952.

=== Baden-Württemberg ===
The military government of the American occupation zone established a Displaced persons camp for displaced persons, mostly forced labourers from Central and Eastern European industrial firms in the area. There was, however, a camp located in Stuttgart-West that, until its closure and transportation of internees to Heidenheim an der Brenz in 1949, housed almost exclusively 1400 Jewish survivors of the Shoah.

An early concept of the Marshall Plan aimed at supporting reconstruction and economic/political recovery across Europe was presented during a speech 6 September 1946 given by US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes at the Stuttgart Opera House. His speech led to the unification of the British and American occupation zones, resulting in the &#x27;bi-zone&#x27; (later the &#x27;tri-zone&#x27; when the French reluctantly agreed to cede their occupied territory to the new state). In 1948, the city applied to become the capital of the soon to-be Federal Republic of Germany, and was a serious contender against Frankfurt, Kassel, and Bonn. All these cities were examined by the Parlamentarischer Rat, but ultimately Bonn won the bid when the Republic was founded on 23 May 1949. The city&#x27;s bid for capital failed primarily because of the financial burdens its high rents would place on the government.

The immediate aftermath of the War would be marked by the controversial efforts of Arnulf Klett, the first Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart, to restore the city. Klett favored the idea of a modernist Automotive city with functional divisions for residential, commercial and industrial areas according to the Athens Charter. Klett demolished both ruins and entire streets of largely undamaged buildings without rebuilding them to their original visage, a move that earned him much scorn from his contemporaries. In the 150th year since his death (1955), the last remnant of the alma mater of Friedrich Schiller, the Karlsschule, was removed in favor of an expansion to the Bundesstraße 14. Klett also dramatically expanded the public transportation of Stuttgart with the Stuttgart Stadtbahn and, in 1961, initiated a city partnership with the French city of Strasbourg as part of an attempt to mend Franco-German relations. It would be finalized in 1962 and is still active today. Klett&#x27;s Stuttgart saw two major media events: the same year the partnership with Strasbourg was finalized, then French president Charles de Gaulle visited the city and Ludwigsburg Palace in the ending moments of his state visit to Germany, and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited the city 24 May 1965.

On 25 April 1952, the other two parts of the former German states of Baden and Württemberg, South Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern merged and formed the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, with Stuttgart as its capital. Since the 1950s, Stuttgart has been the third largest city in southern Germany behind Frankfurt and Munich. The city&#x27;s population, halved by the Second World War, began sudden growth with the mass influx of German refugees expelled from their homes and communities by the Soviets from the late 1940s until 1950 to the city. Economic migrants, called &quot;&quot;Gastarbeiter&quot;, from Italy, and later Greece and Turkey but primarily from Yugoslavia, came flocking to Stuttgart because of the economic wonder called the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;&quot; unfolding in West Germany. These factors saw the city reach its (then) peak population of 640,000 in 1962.

In May 1965 Queen Elizabeth II made a state visit to Stuttgart and nearby Marbach and Schwäbisch Hall. Her great-grandfather Duke Francis (1837–1900) had been a member of the Württemberg royal family.

In the late 1970s, the municipal district of Stammheim was centre stage to one of the most controversial periods of German post-war history. Stammheim Prison, built from 1959 to 1963, came to be the place of incarceration for Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, and Jan-Carl Raspe, members of a communist terrorist organization known as the Red Army Faction, during their trial at the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart in 1975. Several attempts were made by the organization to free the terrorists during the &quot;German Autumn&quot; of 1977 that culminated in such events as the kidnap and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181. When it became clear, after many attempts to free the inmates including the smuggling of three weapons into the prison by their lawyer, that the terrorists could not escape and that they would receive life sentencing, the terrorists killed themselves in April 1977 in an event remembered locally as the &quot;Todesnacht von Stammheim&quot;, &quot;Night of Death at Stammheim&quot;.

The trauma of the early 1970s was quickly left behind, starting in 1974 with the 1974 FIFA World Cup and the opening of the Stuttgart S-Bahn on 1 October 1978 with a scheduled three routes. from 17 to 19 June 1983, ten European heads of state and representatives from the European Union met in Stuttgart for a summit and there made the Solemn Declaration on European Union. In 1986, the European Athletics Championships of that year were held in the Neckarstadion. Mikhail Gorbachev, while on a trip to West Germany to offer a spot for a West German astronaut in a Soviet space mission, visited Stuttgart 14 June 1989 and was the honored guest of a sumptuous reception held at the New Palace.

Since the monumental happenings of the 1980s, Stuttgart has continued being an important centre of not just Europe, but also the world. In 1993, the World Horticultural Exposition, for which two new bridges were built, and World Athletics Championships of that year took place in Stuttgart in the Killesburg park and Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion respectively, bringing millions of new visitors to the city. At the 1993 WCA, British athlete Sally Gunnell and the United States Relay team both set world records. In 2003, Stuttgart applied for the 2012 Summer Olympics but failed in their bid when the German Committee for the Olympics decided on Leipzig to host the Olympics in Germany. Three years later, in 2006, Stuttgart once again hosted the FIFA World Cup as it had in 1974.

Stuttgart still experienced some growing pains even long after its recovery from the Second World War. In 2010, the inner city become the focal point of the protests against the controversial Stuttgart 21.

==== US military in Stuttgart ====
Since shortly after the end of World War II, there has been a US military presence in Stuttgart. At the height of the Cold War over 45,000 Americans were stationed across over 40 installations in and around the city. Today about 10,000 Americans are stationed on 5 installations (Patch Barracks, Panzer Kaserne, Kelley Barracks, Robinson Barracks, and Stuttgart Army Airfield) representing all branches of service within the Department of Defense, unlike the mostly Army presence of the Occupation and Cold War.

In March 1946 the US Army established a unit of the US Constabulary and a headquarters at Kurmärker Kaserne (later renamed Patch Barracks) in Stuttgart. These units of soldiers retrained in patrol and policing provided the law and order in the American zone of occupied Germany until the civilian German police forces could be re-established. In 1948 the headquarters for all Constabulary forces was moved to Stuttgart. In 2008 a memorial to the US Constabulary was installed and dedicated at Patch Barracks. The US Constabulary headquarters was disbanded in 1950 and most of the force was merged into the newly organized 7th Army. As the Cold War developed US Army VII Corps was re-formed in July 1950 and assigned to Hellenen Kaserne (renamed Kelley Barracks in 1951) where the headquarters was to remain throughout the Cold War.

In 1990 VII Corps was deployed directly from Germany to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm to include many of the VII Corps troops stationed in and around Stuttgart. After returning from the Middle East, the bulk of VII Corps units were reassigned to the United States or deactivated. The VII Corps Headquarters returned to Germany for a short period to close out operations and was deactivated later in the United States. The withdrawal of VII Corps caused a large reduction in the US military presence in the city and region and led to the closure of the majority of US installations in and around Stuttgart which resulted in the layoff of many local civilians who had been career employees of the US Army.

Since 1967, Patch Barracks in Stuttgart has been home to the US EUCOM. In 2007 AFRICOM was established as a cell within EUCOM and in 2008 established as the US Unified Combatant Command responsible for most of Africa headquartered at Kelley Barracks. Due to these 2 major headquarters, Stuttgart has been identified as one of the few &quot;enduring communities&quot; where the United States forces will continue to operate in Germany. The remaining U.S. bases around Stuttgart are organized into US Army Garrison Stuttgart and include Patch Barracks, Robinson Barracks, Panzer Kaserne and Kelley Barracks. From the end of World War II until the early 1990s these installations excepting Patch were almost exclusively Army, but have become increasingly &quot;Purple&quot;—as in joint service—since the end of the Cold War as they are host to United States Department of Defense Unified Commands and supporting activities.

==Geography==

The core area of Stuttgart lies in a fertile bowl-shaped valley about above sea level, an hour from the Black Forest and Swabian Jura on the banks of the Neckar river at to the west and north of Munich. The city is often described as being &quot;zwischen Wald und Reben&quot; (&quot;between forest and vines&quot;) because of its viticulture and surrounding forests. Stuttgart covers an area of and sits at elevation ranging from above sea level by the Neckar river to on Bernhartshöhe hill – something rather unique in large German cities. The most prominent elevated locales in Stuttgart are the Birkenkopf () on the edge of the Stuttgart basin, the Württemberg () rising above the Neckar valley, and the Grüner Heiner () at the northeast end of the city.
Stuttgart is one of 14 regional centers in Baden-Württemberg and is naturally the primary centre of the Stuttgart Region, making it the administrative centre for a region of containing a total of 2.76 million people as of December 2014. In addition, Stuttgart serves as a Mittelzentrum for Esslingen District cities Leinfelden-Echterdingen and Filderstadt as well as Ditzingen, Gerlingen, and Korntal-Münchingen in Ludwigsburg District. Stuttgart is also chief of the three centres Stuttgart Metropolitan Region, an area of containing 5.3 million persons.

=== Climate ===
Stuttgart experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Its summers are warm, with average highs around , while its winters are chilly, with daily means just above freezing. Annually, the city receives average of rain. On average, Stuttgart enjoys 1,807 hours of sunshine per year and an average annual temperature of .

Typically during summer months, the nearby hills, Swabian Alb mountains, the Black Forest, Schurwald, and the Swabian-Franconian Forest act as shields from harsh weather, nevertheless the city can be subject to thunderstorms, whereas in the winter periods snow may last for several days. Snow cover tends to last no longer than a few days although it had lasted several weeks at a time as recently as 2010. Though it is a rare occurrence in Stuttgart, the city sometimes receives damaging hailstorms, such as in July 2013. In order to fight this phenomenon, weather stations known as &quot;Hagelflieger&quot; are stationed near the city and are largely funded by Daimler AG, who maintain several parking lots and factories in the municipal area.
== Landmarks and culture ==
=== Inner city ===

At the center of Stuttgart lies its main square, Schlossplatz. As well as being the largest square in Stuttgart, it stands at the crossover point between the city&#x27;s shopping area, &quot;Schlossgarten&quot; park which runs down to the river Neckar, Stuttgart&#x27;s two central castles and major museums and residential areas to the south west. Königstraße, Stuttgart&#x27;s most important shopping street which runs along the northwestern edge of Schlossplatz, claims to be the longest pedestrianized street in Germany.

Although the city center was heavily damaged during World War II, many historic buildings have been reconstructed and the city boasts some fine pieces of modern post-war architecture. Buildings and squares of note in the inner city include:

*The &quot;Stiftskirche&quot; (Collegiate Church), dates back to the 12th century, but was changed to the Late Gothic style in the 15th century and has been a Protestant church since 1534. Exterior: Romanesque/Gothic; interior: Romanesque/Gothic/Modern. Reconstructed with simplified interior after World War II.
*&quot;Altes Schloss&quot; (the Old Castle), mostly dating from the late 15th century, some parts date back to 1320. Renaissance style; reconstructed.
*&quot;Alte Kanzlei&quot; (the Old Chancellery) on Schillerplatz square which backs onto the 1598 Mercury Pillar
*&quot;Neues Schloss&quot; (the New Castle), completed in 1807. Baroque/Classicism); reconstructed with modern interior, currently houses government offices. The cellars with a collection of stone fragments from the Roman times are open to visitors.
*&quot;Wilhelmpalais&quot; (the Wilhelm Palace) on Charlottenplatz, completed in 1840 and rebuilt in 1965. 
*&quot;Königsbau&quot; (the King&#x27;s Building), 1850. Classicism; reconstructed; has been housing the &quot;Königsbau Passagen&quot; shopping centre since 2006.
*The &quot;Großes Haus&quot; of Stuttgart National Theatre, 1909–1912
*&quot;Markthalle&quot; Market Hall, 1910 (Art Nouveau)
*The &quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot; (Main Railway Station) was designed in 1920; its stark, functional lines are typical of the artistic trend &#x27;Neue Sachlichkeit&#x27; (New Objectivity).
*The &quot;Württembergische Landesbibliothek&quot; state library, rebuilt in 1970
*&quot;Friedrichsbau Varieté&quot; (Friedrich Building), rebuilt in 1994 on the site of the former art nouveau building

=== Architecture in other districts ===

A number of significant castles stand in Stuttgart&#x27;s suburbs and beyond as reminders of the city&#x27;s royal past. These include:

*Castle Solitude, 1700–1800. In Baroque/Rococo style.
*Ludwigsburg Palace, 1704–1758. Baroque, with its enormous Baroque garden.
*Castle Hohenheim, 1771–1793

Other landmarks in and around Stuttgart include (&quot;see also museums below&quot;):

*Castle Rosenstein (1822–1830), classical

=== Parks, lakes, cemeteries and other places of interest ===

At the center of Stuttgart lies a series of gardens which are popular with families and cyclists. Because of its shape on a map, the locals refer to it as the &quot;Green U&quot;. The Green U starts with the old Schlossgarten, castle gardens first mentioned in records in 1350. The modern park stretches down to the river Neckar and is divided into the upper garden (bordering the Old Castle, the Main Station, the State Theater and the State Parliament building), and the middle and lower gardens – a total of 61 hectares. The park also houses Stuttgart planetarium.

At the far end of Schlossgarten lies the second &quot;Green U&quot; park, the larger Rosensteinpark which borders Stuttgart&#x27;s Wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens. Planted by King William I of Württemberg, it contains many old trees and open areas and counts as the largest English-style garden in southern Germany. In the grounds of the park stands the former Rosenstein castle, now the Rosenstein museum.

Beyond bridges over an adjacent main road lies the final &quot;Green U&quot; park, Killesbergpark or &#x27;Höhenpark&#x27; which is a former quarry that was converted for the Third Reich garden show of 1939 (and was used as a collection point for Jews awaiting transportation to concentration camps). The park has been used to stage many gardening shows since the 1950s, including the Bundesgartenschau and 1993 International Gardening Show, and runs miniature trains all around the park in the summer months for children and adults. The viewing tower (Killesbergturm) offers unique views across to the north east of Stuttgart.

On the northern edge of the Rosensteinpark is the famous &#x27;Wilhelma&#x27;, Germany&#x27;s only combined zoological and botanical garden. The whole compound, with its ornate pavilions, greenhouses, walls and gardens was built around 1850 as a summer palace in moorish style for King Wilhelm I of Württemberg. It currently houses around 8000 animals and some 5000 plant species and contains the biggest magnolia grove in Europe.

Other parks in Stuttgart include the historic Botanischer Garten der Universität Hohenheim and Landesarboretum Baden-Württemberg at Castle Hohenheim (which date back to 1776 and are still used to catalog and research plant species), Uhlandshöhe hill (between the city center, Bad Cannstatt and Frauenkopf, and home to Stuttgart observatory), the Weißenburgpark (a five-hectare park in the Bopser area of Stuttgart South which dates back to 1834 and is now home to a &#x27;tea house&#x27; and the &#x27;marble room&#x27; and offers a relaxing view across the city center), the Birkenkopf a Schuttberg (at the highest point in central Stuttgart, where many ruins were laid to commemorate the Second World War), and the Eichenhain park in Sillenbuch (declared a nature reserve in 1958 and home to 200 oak trees, many 300–400 years old).
There are a number of natural and artificial lakes and ponds in Stuttgart. The largest is the Max-Eyth-See, which was created in 1935 by reclaiming a former quarry and is now an official nature reserve. It is surrounded by an expansive open area overlooked by vineyards on the banks of the river Neckar near [Mühlhausen].
There are expansive areas of woodland to the west and south west of Stuttgart which are popular with walkers, families, cyclists and ramblers. The most frequented lakes form a trio made up of the Bärensee, Neuer See and Pfaffensee. The lakes are also used for local water supplies.

In the Feuersee area in the west of Stuttgart lies one of two &#x27;Feuersee&#x27;s (literally fire lakes), striking for its views of the Johanneskirche (St. Johns) church across the lake, surrounded by nearby houses and offices. The other Feuersee can be found in Vaihingen.

Cemeteries in Stuttgart include:

*The Hoppenlaufriedhof in Central Stuttgart, the oldest remaining cemetery which dates back to 1626, an graveyard last used in 1951
*The Waldfriedhof, the 1913 forest cemetery that is connected to Südheimer Platz by funicular railway
*The Pragfriedhof, with its Art Nouveau crematorium. Established in 1873 it was extended to include Jewish graves in 1874 and also now houses the Russian Orthodox Church of Alexander Nevsky.
*The Uff-Kirchhof cemetery in Bad Cannstatt which stands at the crossroads of two ancient Roman roads and Cannstatter Hauptfriedhof, the largest graveyard in Stuttgart which has been used as a Muslim burial ground since 1985

The city boasts the second-largest mineral water deposits in Europe after Budapest, with over 250 springs within the urban area. The Athenebrunnen (or Fountain of Pallas Athena) is along Jean-Amery-Weg in the western part of Stuttgart, dating from 1911.

=== Culture and events ===

Stuttgart is known for its rich cultural heritage, in particular its State Theatre (&quot;Staatstheater&quot;) and State Gallery (&quot;Staatsgalerie&quot;). The &quot;Staatstheater&quot; is home to the State opera and three smaller theatres. It regularly stages opera, ballet and theatre productions as well as concerts. The Staatstheater was named Germany/Austria/Switzerland &quot;Theatre of the year&quot; in 2006; the Stuttgart Opera has won the &#x27;Opera of the year&#x27; award six times. Stuttgart Ballet is connected to names like John Cranko and Marcia Haydée.

Stuttgart is also home to one of Germany&#x27;s most prestigious symphony orchestras, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, with famous English conductor Sir Roger Norrington, who developed a distinct sound of that orchestra, known as the &quot;Stuttgart Sound&quot;. They mostly perform in the &quot;Liederhalle&quot; concert hall.

The city offers two Broadway-style musical theatres, the Apollo and the Palladium Theater (each approx. 1800 seats). Ludwigsburg Palace in the nearby town of Ludwigsburg is also used throughout the year as a venue for concerts and cultural events.

As a result of Stuttgart&#x27;s long history of viticulture (Even today there are vineyards less than from the Main Station), there are more than 400 flights of stairs (known in the local dialect as the &quot;Stäffele&quot;) around the city, equivalent to approximately of steps. Later, in the early 19th century, the city continued to grow and many vineyards were replaced by houses and streets and the &quot;Stäffele&quot; were used as footpaths to connect the newly built neighborhoods. Some of the stairs were elaborately decorated with fountains and plantings.

The Schleyerhalle sports arena is regularly used to stage rock and pop concerts with major international stars on European tour.

Stuttgart&#x27;s Swabian cuisine, beer and wine have been produced in the area since the 17th century and are now famous throughout Germany and beyond. For example, Gaisburger Marsch is a stew that was invented in Stuttgart&#x27;s Gaisburg area of Stuttgart East.
In October 2009 the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced that the European Union was to officially recognise the pasta dish Maultaschen as a &quot;regional specialty&quot;, thus marking its significance to the cultural heritage of Baden-Württemberg.

In 1993 Stuttgart hosted the International Garden Show in the suburb of Killesberg. In 2006 it was also one of the host cities of the Football World Cup. In 2007, Stuttgart hosted the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 2008 it was host to the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships. In 2015, Stuttgart hosted the Protestant Kirchentag (church convention) festival, a festival that takes place in a different German city every two years.

Regular events that take place in Stuttgart:
*The world-famous annual &#x27;Volksfest&#x27;, originally a traditional agricultural fair which now also hosts beer tents and a French village and is second in size only to the Oktoberfest in Munich. There is also a Spring festival on the same grounds in April of each year.
*With more than 3.6 million visitors in 2007 and more than 200 stands, Stuttgart&#x27;s Christmas Market, running from late November to 23 December, is the largest and one of the oldest traditional Christmas markets in Europe. It is especially renowned for its abundant decorations and takes place in the four weeks leading up to Christmas.
*The Fish Market (&quot;Hamburger Fischmarkt&quot;, late July) with fresh fish, other food and beer from Hamburg
*The Summer Festival (&quot;Stuttgart Sommerfest&quot;, usually in early August) with shows, music, children&#x27;s entertainment and local cuisine in Schlossplatz, Stuttgart and adjacent parks
*The Lantern Festival (&quot;Lichterfest&quot;, early July) in Killesberg park with its famous firework display and fairground attractions
*The Wine Village (&quot;Weindorf&quot;, late August/early September) – vintages are sold at this event held at Schillerplatz and Marktplatz (Market Square).

=== Museums ===

Stuttgart is home to five of the eleven state museums in Baden-Württemberg. The foremost of these is the Old State Gallery (opened in 1843, extended in 1984) which holds art dating from the 14th to 19th century including works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, Cézanne and Beuys. Next door to the Old State Gallery is the New State Gallery (1980) with its controversial modern architecture. Among others, this gallery houses works from Max Beckmann, Dalí, Matisse, Miró, Picasso, Klee, Chagall and Kandinsky.

The Old Castle is also home to the State Museum of Württemberg which was founded in 1862 by William I of Württemberg. The museum traces the rich history of Württemberg with many artifacts from its dukes, counts and kings, as well as earlier remnants dating back to the Stone Age. On the Karlsplatz side of the Old Castle is a museum dedicated to the memory of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, former resident of Stuttgart who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944.

Other leading museums in Stuttgart include:
*The History Museum (&quot;Haus der Geschichte&quot;, 1987), examining local history, finds, the conflict between modern society and its cultural history
*State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart (SMNS) in Park Rosenstein housed in Castle Rosenstein (with an emphasis on biology and natural history) and Löwentor Museum (paleontology and geology, home of the Steinheim skull and many unique fossils from the triassic, jurassic and tertiary periods)
*The Mercedes-Benz Museum (1936, moved in 2006), now the most visited museum in Stuttgart (440,000 visits per year). The museum traces the 125-year history of the automobile from the legendary silver arrow to the Mercedes-Benz brand of today.
*Stuttgart Art Museum (&quot;Kunstmuseum Stuttgart&quot;, 2005), the number two museum in Stuttgart in terms of visitors with a strong leaning towards modern art (the foremost exhibition of Otto Dix works). The museum stands on the corner of Schlossplatz, Stuttgart in a huge glass cube, in strong contrast to the surrounding traditional architecture.

=== Churches ===
Stuttgart is the seat of a Protestant bishop (Protestant State Church in Württemberg) and one of the two co-seats of the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart. The Stuttgart-based Pentecostal &quot;Gospel Forum&quot; is the largest place of worship (megachurch) in Germany. It is also home to a large English speaking church, The International Baptist Church of Stuttgart.

=== Libraries ===

The (WLB) is one of two state libraries for Baden-Württemberg. The WLB is specifically responsible for the administrative regions of Stuttgart and Tübingen. Especially devoted to the National Library of acquiring, cataloging, archiving and provision of literature about Württemberg, called &quot;Württembergica&quot;. Together with the Badische Landesbibliothek (BLB) in Karlsruhe it also has the legal deposit for Baden-Württemberg, making it an archive library.

The Stuttgart University Library (UBS) is a central institution of the University of Stuttgart. It forms the center of the library system of the university, ensuring the supply of research, teaching and studies with literature and other information resources. It stands next to the members of the university and citizens of the city are available. Together with other research libraries and documentation centers in the Stuttgart area – such as the University of Hohenheim Library – it forms the UBS Library Information System of the Stuttgart Region (BISS).

The Central State Archive Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the Ministries of the State of Baden-Württemberg. Since 1965, it is located right next to the WLB and belongs since 2005 as a department of the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg in. It includes the stocks of the county and the duchy Württemberg until 1806, the Württemberg central authorities of the 19th and 20th century and the early 19th century as a result of media coverage of fallen Württemberg gentlemen and imperial cities in South Württemberg.

The Stadtarchiv Stuttgart is the archive in charge of the provincial capital Stuttgart. The archived material is in principle open to the public and can be consulted in the reading room in Bellingweg 21 in Bad Cannstatt.

The Landeskirchliche Archives preserve the stocks of the Württemberg church leaders and of other ecclesial bodies and institutions: the ducal and royal Württemberg consistory, the Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council, deanery and parish archives, educational institutions, the works and associations as well as estates and collections. It also has the microfilms of all church books (especially baptism, marriage, and family Death&#x27;s Register) in the area of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg.

The &quot;Archive instigator&quot; is dedicated to the dead of the city. Since 2005, the instigators are working on a memoir about &quot;The dead town&quot;. So far, about 5,000 names of victims of the regime of National Socialism have been acquired.

There are two large tours that are available to visitors to Stuttgart. The first is the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour (also called the CityTour Stuttgart), lasting from 10 AM to 4 PM that takes visitors around the city. The other is the Neckar-Käpt&#x27;n, only available from May to October, which cruises on the Neckar river from its dock at Wilhelma in Bad Cannstatt.

== Demographics ==
Stuttgart has a population of about 630,000 and is the 6th largest city in Germany. Stuttgart reached its population peak of over 100,000 in 1874. In 1946, when Stuttgart became the capital of Baden-Württemberg state, it had a population of about 415,000. In 1960s the industrialization boomed in Stuttgart due to its automobile companies Mercedes-Benz and Porsche and other companies came to Stuttgart. It also saw the growth of foreign population, mostly from Turkey, Greece, India, Italy and former Yugoslavian countries. The population of Stuttgart hasn&#x27;t changed a lot since then due to its high rent of the city where many people moved to neighbouring municipalities.

=== Immigrants ===
More than half of the population today is not of Swabian background, as many non-Swabian Germans have moved here due to the employment situation, which is far better than in most areas of Germany. Since the 1960s, many foreigners have also immigrated to Stuttgart to work here (as part of the &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; program); another wave of immigrants came as refugees from the Wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Thus, as of 2022, 47% of the city&#x27;s population is of foreign background. In 2000, 22.8% of the population did not hold German citizenship, in 2022 this had increased to 27.6%. By end of 2018 the largest groups of foreign nationals were Turks (17,900), Greeks (13,757), Italians (14,021), Croats (15,268), Serbs (5,844) followed by immigrants from Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Portugal, Poland, France, Austria, Morocco and Cameroon. 39% of foreign nationals come from the European Union (mostly Italy, Greece, and Poland).

=== Religion ===
The religious landscape in Stuttgart changed in 1534 as a direct result of the Reformation. Since this time Württemberg has been predominantly Protestant. However, since 1975 the number of Protestants in Stuttgart has dropped from around 300,000 to 200,000. In 2014, 26.2% of inhabitants were Protestant and 24.0% were Roman Catholic. 49.8% of the population fell into other categories: Muslims, Jews and those who either followed no religion or one not accounted for in official statistics.

=== Unemployment ===
Unemployment in the Stuttgart Region is above the average of Baden-Württemberg, but very low compared to other metropolitan areas in Germany. In November 2008, before the annual winter rise, unemployment in the Stuttgart Region stood at 3.8%, 0.1% lower than the rate for Baden-Württemberg, in February 2009 it was 4.7%. Unemployment in the actual city of Stuttgart during the same periods stood at 5.2% and 6.0% (8 November and 9 February respectively). By comparison: unemployment for the whole of Germany stood at 7.1% (8 Nov) and 8.5% (9 Feb).

=== Crime rates ===
Stuttgart ranks as one of the safest cities in Germany. In 2003, 8535 crimes were committed in Stuttgart for every 100,000 inhabitants (versus the average for all German cities of 12,751). Figures for 2006 indicate that Stuttgart ranked second behind Munich. 60% of Stuttgart crimes were solved in 2003, ranking second behind Nuremberg.

== Government and politics ==

When Stuttgart was run as a (or within) the Duchy of Württemberg, it was governed by a type of protectorate called a Vogt appointed by the Duke. After 1811 this role was fulfilled by a City Director or &#x27;Stadtdirektor&#x27;. After 1819 the community elected its own community mayor or &#x27;Schultheiß&#x27;. Since 1930 the title of Oberbürgermeister (the nearest equivalent of which would be an executive form of lord mayor in English) has applied to Stuttgart and all other Württemberg towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants.

At the end of the Second World War, French administrators appointed the independent politician Arnulf Klett as Burgomaster, a role he fulfilled without interruption until his death in 1974. Since this time Stuttgart has mainly been governed by the CDU. One former mayor was Manfred Rommel (son of perhaps the most famous German field marshal of World War II, Erwin Rommel).

As the capital of Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart is an important political centre in Germany and the seat of the State Parliament, or Landtag as well as all Baden-Württemberg state departments.

In June 2009, for the first time the Greens gained the most seats in a German city with more than 500,000 inhabitants, effectively changing the balance of power in the city council. For the first time since 1972 the CDU no longer held the most seats, toppling its absolute majority shared with the Independent Party and the FDP. According to the German newspaper , the main reason for the Greens&#x27; victory was disgruntlement with the controversial Stuttgart 21 rail project.

===Mayor===

The current mayor of Stuttgart is Frank Nopper of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 8 November 2020, with a runoff held on 29 November, and the results were as follows:

===City districts===
The city of Stuttgart is administratively divided into 23 city districts – five &quot;inner&quot; districts and 18 &quot;outer&quot; districts. Each district has a council headed by a district director. From there, the districts are broken down into quarters. Since the changes in city statutes on 1 July 2007 and 1 January 2009, the total number of quarters rose to 152.

== Economy ==
The Stuttgart area is known for its high-tech industry. Companies include Mercedes-Benz Group, Porsche, Robert Bosch GmbH, McKesson Europe, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sika AG – all of whom have their world or European headquarters here.

Stuttgart is home to Germany&#x27;s ninth biggest exhibition center, Stuttgart Trade Fair, which lies on the city outskirts next to Stuttgart Airport. Hundreds of SMEs are still based in Stuttgart (often termed &quot;Mittelstand&quot;), many still in family ownership with strong ties to the automotive, electronics, engineering and high-tech industry.

=== The cradle of the automobile ===
The automobile and motorcycle were purported to have been invented in Stuttgart (by Karl Benz and subsequently industrialized in 1887 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach at the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft). As a result, it is considered to be the starting point of the worldwide automotive industry and is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;cradle of the automobile&#x27;. Today, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche both have their headquarters in Stuttgart, as well as automotive parts giants Bosch and Mahle. A number of auto-enthusiast magazines are published in Stuttgart.

=== Science and research and development ===
The region currently has Germany&#x27;s highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations. No other region in Germany registers so many patents and designs as Stuttgart. 45% of Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s R&amp;D capacities are concentrated in the Swabian capital. More than 11% of all German R&amp;D costs are invested in the Stuttgart region (approximately 4.3 billion euros per year). In addition to several universities and colleges (e.g. University of Stuttgart, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart Institute of Management and Technology and several Stuttgart Universities of Applied Sciences), the area is home to six Fraunhofer institutes, four institutes of collaborative industrial research at local universities, two Max-Planck institutes and a major establishment of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR).

=== Financial services ===
The Stuttgart Stock Exchange is the second largest in Germany (after Frankfurt). Many leading companies in the financial services sector are headquartered in Stuttgart with around 100 credit institutes in total (e.g. LBBW Bank, Wüstenrot &amp; Württembergische, Allianz Life Assurance).
=== A history of wine and beer ===
Stuttgart is the only city in Germany where wine grapes are grown within the urban area, mainly in the districts of Rotenberg, Uhlbach and Untertürkheim.

Wine-growing in the area dates back to 1108 when, according to State archives, Blaubeuren Abbey was given vineyards in Stuttgart as a gift from &#x27;Monk Ulrich&#x27;. In the 17th century the city was the third largest German wine-growing community in the Holy Roman Empire. Wine remained Stuttgart&#x27;s leading source of income well into the 19th century.

Stuttgart is still one of Germany&#x27;s largest wine-growing cities with more than 400 hectares of vine area, thanks in main to its location at the center of Germany&#x27;s fourth largest wine region, the Württemberg wine growing area which covers and is one of only 13 official areas captured under German wine law. The continuing importance of wine to the local economy is marked every year at the annual wine festival (&#x27;Weindorf&#x27;).

Stuttgart also has several famous breweries such as Stuttgarter Hofbräu, Dinkelacker, and Schwaben Bräu.

== Education ==

Stuttgart and its region have been home to some significant figures of German thought and literature, the most important ones being Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Hölderlin.

The city, in its engineering tradition as the cradle of the automobile, has also always been a fruitful place of research and innovation. Stuttgart has Germany&#x27;s second-highest number of institutions (six) of applied research of the Fraunhofer Society (after Dresden).

=== Tertiary education ===
The city is not considered a traditional university city, but nevertheless has a variety of institutions of higher education. The most significant of them are:
*University of Stuttgart, it is the fourth biggest university in Baden-Württemberg after Heidelberg, Tübingen and Freiburg. Founded in 1829, it was a &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; (&quot;Technical University&quot;) until 1967, when it was renamed to &quot;university&quot;. Its campus for social sciences and architecture is located in the city centre, near the main train station, while the natural science campus is in the southwestern city district of Vaihingen. Historically, it has been especially renowned for its faculty of architecture (&quot;Stuttgarter Schule&quot;). Today, its main focus is on engineering and other technical subjects.
*University of Hohenheim, founded in 1818 as an academy for agricultural science and forestry. While these subjects are still taught there today, its other focus today is on business administration. It is located in Hohenheim quarter of the southern city district of Plieningen.
*State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, founded in 1857, located in the city center, next to the Neue Staatsgalerie
*State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart, one of the biggest art colleges in Germany, founded in 1761, located in the Killesberg quarter of the northern city district Stuttgart-Nord
*Stuttgart Media University (Hochschule der Medien Stuttgart), founded in 2001 as a university of applied sciences, a merger of the former &quot;College of Printing and Publishing&quot; and the &quot;College of Librarianship&quot;, located in Vaihingen
*Stuttgart Technology University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart), founded in 1832 as a college for craftsmanship, university of applied sciences since 1971, located in the city center, near the University of Stuttgart&#x27;s city-center campus

Historically, an elite military academy existed in Stuttgart in the late 18th century (1770–1794), the Hohe Karlsschule, at Solitude Castle. Friedrich Schiller and the city&#x27;s most famous Classicist architect, Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, were among its many esteemed alumni.

=== Primary and secondary education ===
The first Waldorf School (also known as Rudolf Steiner School) was founded here in 1919 by the director of the Waldorf Astoria tobacco factory, Emil Molt, and Austrian social thinker Rudolf Steiner, a comprehensive school following Steiner&#x27;s educational principles of anthroposophy and humanistic ideals. Today, four of these schools are located in Stuttgart.

The Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium was created in 1668 from a historical Latin School as a model high school with the goal of modernising education. Later, the Dillman-Gymnasium, Friedrich-Eugens-Gymnasium and Karls-Gymnasium emerged from it.

=== International School ===
Since 1985 Stuttgart is home to the International School of Stuttgart, one of fewer than 100 schools worldwide that offer all three International Baccalaureate programs- the IB Primary Years (Early Learning to Grade 5), IB Middle Years (Grade 6 to 10), IB Diploma (grades 11–12). The International School of Stuttgart is accredited by both the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

== Media and publishing ==

One of the headquarters of the public Südwestrundfunk (SWR; &quot;Southwest Broadcasting&quot;) channels (several radio and one TV channel; regional focus on the southwestern German States of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate) is located in Stuttgart (the other ones being Baden-Baden and Mainz). It also has a &quot;Landesmedienzentrum&quot;, a state media center.

Furthermore, the city is a significant centre of publishing and specialist printing, with renowned houses such as Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, Ernst Klett Verlag (schoolbooks), Kohlhammer Verlag, Metzler Verlag and Motor Presse having their head offices there. The Reclam Verlag is located in nearby Ditzingen.

The newspapers &quot;Stuttgarter Zeitung&quot; (StZ; regional, with significant supra-regional, national and international sections) and Stuttgarter Nachrichten (StN; regional) are published here as well as a number of smaller, local papers such as &quot;Cannstatter Zeitung&quot;.

As is the case wherever the US military is stationed, there is an American Forces Network (AFN) station. It transmits on FM on 102.3 MHz from Fernmeldeturm Frauenkopf and on AM on 1143 kHz from Hirschlanden transmitter.

== Transport ==
Following the suit of other German cities such as Berlin, Cologne and Hanover, on 1 March 2008 a low emission zone (LEZ) came into effect in Stuttgart with the aim of improving air quality. This affects all vehicles entering the Stuttgart &#x27;Environmental zone&#x27; (&quot;Umweltzone&quot;), including vehicles from abroad.

=== Local transport ===


Stuttgart has a light rail system known as the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. In the city center and densely built-up areas, the Stadtbahn runs underground. Stations are signposted with a &#x27;U&#x27; symbol, which stands for &quot;unabhängig&quot; (independent), due to the system being mostly separated from road traffic. Until 2007, Stuttgart also operated regular trams. Stuttgart also has a large bus network. Stadtbahn lines and buses are operated by the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen AG (SSB). The outlying suburbs of Stuttgart and nearby towns are served by a suburban railway system called the Stuttgart S-Bahn, using tracks supplied by the national Deutsche Bahn AG (DB).

A peculiarity of Stuttgart is the &quot;Zahnradbahn&quot;, a rack railway that is powered by electricity and operates between Marienplatz in the southern inner-city district of the city and the district of Degerloch. It is the only urban rack railway in Germany. Stuttgart also has a &quot;Standseilbahn&quot;, a funicular railway that operates in the Heslach area and the forest cemetery (Waldfriedhof). In Killesberg Park, on a prominent hill overlooking the city, there is the miniature railway run by diesel (and on weekends with steam).

=== Rail links ===

Stuttgart is a hub in the Intercity-Express and Intercity networks of Deutsche Bahn AG (DB), with through services to most other major German cities. It also operates international services to Strasbourg, Vienna, Zürich and Paris (five times a day, journey time 3 hours 11 minutes).

Long-distance trains stop at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, the city&#x27;s main line terminus, which is also used by Interregio-Express, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains for services to stations in the Stuttgart metropolitan area. The local rail networks (see above) operate underneath the terminus.

Stuttgart also has its own rail freight centre with marshalling yards and a container terminal in the Obertürkheim area of Hedelfingen.

=== Rail: The &quot;Stuttgart 21&quot; project ===
After years of political debate and controversy, plans were approved in October 2007 to convert the existing above-ground main train station to an underground through station. The &quot;Stuttgart 21 project&quot; will include the rebuilding of surface and underground lines connecting the station in Stuttgart&#x27;s enclosed central valley with existing railway and underground lines. Building work started in 2010 with controversial modifications to the Hauptbahnhof and was slated to be completed in 2019, then 2021 and now 2025.

=== Air transport ===
Stuttgart is served by Stuttgart Airport (, IATA airport code &quot;STR&quot;), an international airport approximately south of the city centre on land belonging mainly to neighboring towns. It takes 30 minutes to reach the airport from the city center using S-Bahn lines S2 or S3 or Stadtbahn line U6. Stuttgart airport is Germany&#x27;s only international airport with one runway. Despite protests and local initiatives, surveys are currently underway to assess the impact of a second runway.

=== Road transport ===
Stuttgart is served by Autobahn A8, that runs east–west from Karlsruhe to Munich, and Autobahn A81 that runs north–south from Würzburg to Singen. The Autobahn A831 is a short spur entering the southern side of Stuttgart.

Besides these Autobahns, Stuttgart is served by a large number of expressways, many of which are built to Autobahn standards, and were once intended to carry an A-number. Important expressways like B10, B14, B27 and B29 connect Stuttgart with its suburbs. Due to the hilly surroundings, there are many road tunnels in and around Stuttgart. There are also a number of road tunnels under intersections in the center of Stuttgart.

=== Waterways ===
Stuttgart has an inland port in Hedelfingen on the Neckar.

<text>Self-propelled artillery (also called locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move toward its firing position. Within the terminology are the self-propelled gun, self-propelled howitzer, self-propelled mortar, and self-propelled rocket artillery. They are high-mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large field gun, howitzer, mortar, or some form of rocket/missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield.

In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct-fire vehicles, such as assault guns and tank destroyers, which were typically well-armoured vehicles often based upon the chassis of a tank. In lieu of the standard tank&#x27;s general-purpose main gun that fired both high-explosive and anti-tank ammunition, direct-fire vehicles had specialized roles, with assault guns providing close fire-support for infantry and tank destroyers mounting an anti-tank gun to take on enemy armour.

Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles often mount their main gun in a turret on a tracked chassis so they superficially resemble tanks. However, they are generally lightly armoured, which is insufficient to withstand direct-fire combat; nonetheless this protects their crews against shrapnel and small arms and therefore they are usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with machine guns for defense against enemy infantry.

The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought—usually towed—to the new location. By comparison, self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This shoot-and-scoot ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance in open battlefields.

Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be deployed in areas that self-propelled guns cannot reach. Since the Vietnam War, heavy transport helicopters have also been used for rapid artillery deployment albeit at considerable expense and risk, mitigating one of towed artillery&#x27;s disadvantages. Both self-propelled and towed artillery remain in the arsenals of many modern armies.

==History==
===Precursors===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, early 17th-century experiments were made with early types of horse artillery. Batteries towed light field guns where most or all of the crew rode horses into battle. The gunners were trained to quickly dismount, deploy the guns and provide instant fire support to cavalry, and act as a flexible reserve. The Russian army organized small units of horse artillery that were distributed among their cavalry formations in the early 18th century. While not forming large batteries and employing only lighter 2- and 3-pound guns, they were still effective and inflicted serious losses to Prussian units in the Seven Years&#x27; War. This inspired Frederick the Great to organize the first regular horse artillery unit in 1759. Other nations quickly realized the capability of the new arm and by the start of French Revolutionary Wars in 1790s Austria, Hannover, Portugal, Russia, France, Great Britain and Sweden had all formed regular units of horse artillery. The arm was employed throughout the Napoleonic Wars and remained in use throughout the entire 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century, when advances in weapons technology finally made it obsolete.

Zamburak was a specialized form of self-propelled artillery from the early modern period. It featured small swivel guns to be mounted and fired from the back of camels. It was used by the Islamic gunpowder empires, especially those of Iran, especially in the rugged Iranian plateau, where the transportation of heavy cannons is difficult.

===World War I===
The British Gun Carrier Mark I was the first example of a self-propelled gun, fielded in 1917 during World War I. It was based on the first tank, the British Mark I and carried a heavy field gun. The gun could either be fired from the vehicle, or removed and set up as normal. In effect, the carrier replaced the use of a separate horse team or internal combustion engine-powered artillery tractor, and allowed a new way for the gun to be used.

===Between the wars===
The next major advance can be seen in the Birch gun developed by the British for their motorised warfare experimental brigade (the Experimental Mechanized Force) after the end of the War. This mounted an 18-pounder field gun, capable of both the usual artillery trajectories and high-angle anti-aircraft fire, on a Vickers medium tank chassis. It was designed and built for investigations into a general approach to warfare where all arms, infantry and artillery included, would be able to operate over the same terrain as tanks. The Red Army also experimented with truck- and tank-mounted artillery, but produced none in quantity.

===World War II===


At the outbreak of World War II, virtually all artillery was still being moved around by artillery tractors or horses. While the German Blitzkrieg doctrine called for combined-arms action, which required fire support for armoured units, during the invasion of Poland and France this was provided by the Luftwaffe using Junkers Ju 87 &#x27;Stuka&#x27; dive-bombers effectively acting as artillery. Conventional towed howitzers followed.

As the war progressed, most nations developed self-propelled artillery. Some early attempts were often no more than a field gun or anti-tank gun mounted on a truck—a technique known in the British Army as carrying &quot;portee&quot;. These were mobile, but lacked protection for the crew. The next step was to mount the guns on a tracked chassis (often that of an obsolete or superseded tank) and provide an armoured superstructure to protect the gun and its crew. Many of the early designs were improvised, and the lessons learned led to better designs later in the war. For example, the first British design, &quot;Bishop&quot;, carried the 25 pdr gun-howitzer on a Valentine tank chassis, but in a mounting that severely limited the gun&#x27;s performance. It was replaced by the more effective Sexton.

The first battery of self-propelled artillery guns was created when Hauptmann Alfred Becker, a mechanical engineer and battery captain in the 227th Infantry Division, mounted his 10.5 cm leFH 16 howitzers on the chassis of captured British Vickers Mk.VI light tanks to mobilize his guns. His 10.5 cm leFH 16 Geschützwagen Mk VI 736 (e) was the forerunner to German tracked field guns such as the Wespe and Hummel.

The Germans also mobilized their anti-tank guns, using light, obsolete or captured tracked vehicles. Examples include the Marder I, using captured French Lorraine 37L tractors, the Marder II, using the Panzer II light tank chassis, and the Marder III, which was based on the Panzer 38(t) Czech chassis. These led to better-protected assault guns – &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; – with fully enclosed casemates, built on medium tank chassis. In the same way self-propelled anti-tank guns such as the Jagdpanzer IV and Jagdpanther were built. Some designs were based on existing chassis (such as the Brummbär), leftover chassis from cancelled programs (Elefant and Sturer Emil); others were converted from battle-damaged tanks (Sturmtiger). The single most-produced armored fighting vehicle design for Germany in WW II, the Sturmgeschütz III (StuG III) assault gun, in 1936–1937 pioneered the later casemate-style fully enclosed armor that would be used on almost all late-war German self-propelled artillery and &quot;Jagdpanzer&quot;-format tank destroyers.

The Soviets experimented with truck- and tank-based self-propelled weapons, producing a few Komsomolets tractor-mounted 57mm ZiS-2 guns early in the war. By 1943, the series of &quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka&quot; casemate-armored vehicles had started to appear at the front, starting with the SU-85, and by late 1944 the SU-100, which mounted powerful guns on modern chassis adopting the full-casemate enclosure of the crew compartment as the Germans had done with the StuG III. These had the advantage of being relatively cheap to build and mounting a larger gun compared to the conventional tank that they were derived from, but at the expense of flexibility.

Heavily armoured assault guns were designed to provide direct-fire support to infantry in the face of enemy defenses. Although often similar to tank destroyers, they carried larger-caliber guns with weaker anti-armor performance but capable of firing powerful HE projectiles. The German 105 mm howitzer-armed StuH 42 based on the StuG III, and the immense 152 mm howitzer-armed, Soviet ISU-152, both fully casemated in their design, are examples of this type of self-propelled artillery.
All major nations developed self-propelled artillery that would be able to provide indirect support while keeping pace with advancing armoured formations. These were usually lightly armoured vehicles with an open-topped hull; the American M7 Priest, the British Sexton (25 pdr) and the German Wespe and Hummel being typical examples. A different route was chosen by the Soviets, who did not develop a specialized indirect-fire vehicle, but following a tradition of dual-purpose towed artillery, built a series of versatile assault guns with indirect-fire capabilities (example ISU-152). A related and novel program was the development of the Soviet Katyusha self-propelled multiple rocket launchers, which were unarmored trucks with a simple rocket rack on the back, a cheap and crushingly effective weapon, provided area saturation was called for rather than accurate fire. The Axis powers had captured the Katyusha and made their own versions; Germany created the &quot;8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer&quot;, while Romania developed the Mareșal tank destroyer, an early prototype of which was armed with a Katyusha. It also had self-propelled howitzer versions.

After the end of World War II, the assault gun fell from use with a general trend towards a single heavy gun-equipped vehicle, the main battle tank, although some wheeled AFVs such as the South African Rooikat, the Maneuver Combat Vehicle of the JGSDF, and the US M1128 MGS, among others, are still developed with large-caliber, direct-fire weapons. Self-propelled indirect-fire artillery remains important and continues to develop alongside the general-purpose field gun.

==Mortars==
Many vehicles have used ancillary smoke mortars for local defense, which project one or more smoke grenades in a pattern that allows them to lay down a smoke screen some distance in order to conceal the vehicle from enemy observers. Mortar carriers are vehicles which carry a mortar as a primary weapon. Numerous vehicles have been used to mount mortars, from improvised civilian trucks used by insurgents, to modified infantry fighting vehicles, such as variants of the M3 half track and M113 APC, to vehicles specifically intended to carry a mortar, such as the 2S31 Vena. The Israeli Makmat is a mortar carrier based on the M4 Sherman tank chassis.

The Russian army uses a &quot;2S4 Tyulpan&quot; (Tulip) self-propelled 240 mm heavy mortar. Patria Hägglunds, a joint venture between Finnish Patria and Swedish BAE Systems Hägglunds, manufactures AMOS (Advanced Mortar System), which is a 120 mm automatic twin-barrelled, breech-loaded mortar turret. There are also numerous AFVs and even main battle tanks that can be equipped with a mortar, either outside or inside the cabin. The Israeli Merkava main battle tank carried a 60 mm mortar in the small troop compartment in the rear, which fired through an opening in the roof, allowing the crew to remain protected. This was useful for fighting nearby infantry, as a mortar is shorter-ranged and cheaper to shoot than the large main gun, as well as being better suited to wounding enemy infantry taking cover behind objects. However, since the mortar is only a secondary weapon in this case, the Merkava is not considered a mortar carrier.

==Howitzers and guns==

Self-propelled artillery remains important in the equipment of many modern armies. It saw a significant role throughout the Cold War era conflicts and in the 1991 Gulf War.

Modern SP artillery is highly computerized, with the ability to self-survey firing positions using systems such as GPS and inertial navigation systems. This, in conjunction with digital fire control/ballistic computers and digital communications, allows individual guns to disperse over a wide area and still deliver rounds on target simultaneously with the other guns in their battery.

These capabilities also increase survivability manyfold as modern SP artillery can displace and avoid counterbattery fire much more quickly and effectively and, if desired, more frequently than previously possible. In conjunction with modern logistic systems (where the SP gun&#x27;s systems can track and report on ammunition consumption and levels) with similar navigation systems and palletized load dropping/lifting capabilities mean that the rapid displacement can occur without significant disruption to actually firing missions as it is possible for the ammunition to keep up with the guns.

A modern battery of six guns, each firing 43 kg projectiles with a burst firing speed of four rounds per minute, can deliver over a tonne of ordnance per minute for up to four minutes. This is an immense weight of fire, which can be delivered with very high accuracy.

One example of the increased firepower provided by modern mobile howitzers is the latest version of the 155 mm G6 howitzer, the G6-52. It can fire up to six rounds in quick succession that will land nearly simultaneously. This is achieved by firing the shells at different trajectories so that the first round has the longest flight time and the last round the shortest. This is an improvement of the concept of multiple-round simultaneous impact (MRSI), itself an enhancement of the earlier TOT (time on target) concept. The necessary rapid reloading is made possible by an automated ammunition feed system.

==Rockets and missiles==
Rockets have greater ranges and carry much more complex &quot;shells&quot; than guns, since there is less restriction on size (calibre). A multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) can be used to saturate a large area with sub-munitions.

<text>The Sinatra Doctrine was a Soviet foreign policy under Mikhail Gorbachev for allowing member states of the Warsaw Pact to determine their own domestic affairs. The name humorously alluded to the song &quot;My Way&quot; popularized by Frank Sinatra—the Soviet Union was allowing these states to go their own way. Its implementation was part of Gorbachev&#x27;s doctrine of new political thinking.

==History==
The Sinatra Doctrine was a significant break from the earlier Brezhnev Doctrine, under which Moscow tightly controlled the internal affairs of satellite state. This had been used to justify the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, as well as the invasion of the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979. By the late 1980s, structural flaws within the Soviet system, growing economic problems, the rise of anti-communist sentiment, and the effects of the Soviet–Afghan War made it increasingly impractical for the Soviet Union to impose its will on its neighbors.

The phrase was coined on 25 October 1989 by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov. He was speaking to reporters in Helsinki about a speech made two days earlier by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. The latter had said that the Soviets recognized the freedom of choice of all countries, specifically including the other Warsaw Pact states. Gerasimov told the interviewer, &quot;We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine. He has a song, &quot;I Did It My Way.&quot; So every country decides on its own which road to take.&quot; When asked whether this would include Moscow accepting the rejection of communist parties in the Soviet bloc, he replied: &quot;That&#x27;s for sure … political structures must be decided by the people who live there.&quot;

The Sinatra Doctrine has been seen as Moscow permitting its allies to decide their futures. It was a retrospective policy, as Soviet allies had already acquired much greater freedom of action. A month before Gerasimov&#x27;s statement, Poland had elected its first non-communist government since the 1940s. The Hungarian government began dismantling the Iron Curtain on the border with Austria in the spring of 1989. From the Pan-European Picnic in August, it was clear to the media-informed Eastern European population that, on the one hand, the Soviet Union would not prevent the opening of the border. On the other hand, the Eastern European governments were divided. Since Hungary was one of the few countries East Germans could travel to, thousands then traveled there to flee to the West across the newly opened border. To the great annoyance of the East German government, the Hungarians refused to stop the exodus.

These developments greatly disturbed hardline communists such as the East German leader Erich Honecker, who condemned the end of the Soviet bloc&#x27;s traditional &quot;socialist unity&quot; and appealed to Moscow to rein in the Hungarians. Honecker faced a growing crisis at home, with massive anti-government demonstrations in Leipzig and other East German cities. Shevardnadze&#x27;s speech and Gerasimov&#x27;s memorable description of the new policy contradicted Honecker&#x27;s appeals.

The Sinatra Doctrine proclamation had dramatic effects across the Soviet bloc. The beleaguered East German government had hoped for a Soviet intervention to defend communism in East Germany and elsewhere. However, the Sinatra Doctrine announcement signaled that the Soviet Union would not aid the East German communists. In a few months, the communist governments of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania had all been overthrown, thus bringing the Cold War to an end.

<doc id="28569" wikidata="Q466769" url="?curid=28569" title="Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System">
<text>The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules.

The original SMILES specification was initiated in the 1980s. It has since been modified and extended. In 2007, an open standard called OpenSMILES was developed in the open source chemistry community.

==History==
The original SMILES specification was initiated by David Weininger at the USEPA Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory in Duluth in the 1980s. Acknowledged for their parts in the early development were &quot;Gilman Veith and Rose Russo (USEPA) and Albert Leo and Corwin Hansch (Pomona College) for supporting the work, and Arthur Weininger (Pomona; Daylight CIS) and Jeremy Scofield (Cedar River Software, Renton, WA) for assistance in programming the system.&quot; The Environmental Protection Agency funded the initial project to develop SMILES.

It has since been modified and extended by others, most notably by Daylight Chemical Information Systems. In 2007, an open standard called &quot;OpenSMILES&quot; was developed by the Blue Obelisk open-source chemistry community. Other &#x27;linear&#x27; notations include the Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN), ROSDAL and SLN (Tripos Inc).

In July 2006, the IUPAC introduced the InChI as a standard for formula representation. SMILES is generally considered to have the advantage of being more human-readable than InChI; it also has a wide base of software support with extensive theoretical backing (such as graph theory).

== Terminology ==
The term SMILES refers to a line notation for encoding molecular structures and specific instances should strictly be called SMILES strings. However, the term SMILES is also commonly used to refer to both a single SMILES string and a number of SMILES strings; the exact meaning is usually apparent from the context. The terms &quot;canonical&quot; and &quot;isomeric&quot; can lead to some confusion when applied to SMILES. The terms describe different attributes of SMILES strings and are not mutually exclusive.

Typically, a number of equally valid SMILES strings can be written for a molecule. For example, codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 all specify the structure of ethanol. Algorithms have been developed to generate the same SMILES string for a given molecule; of the many possible strings, these algorithms choose only one of them. This SMILES is unique for each structure, although dependent on the canonicalization algorithm used to generate it, and is termed the canonical SMILES. These algorithms first convert the SMILES to an internal representation of the molecular structure; an algorithm then examines that structure and produces a unique SMILES string. Various algorithms for generating canonical SMILES have been developed and include those by Daylight Chemical Information Systems, OpenEye Scientific Software, MEDIT, Chemical Computing Group, MolSoft LLC, and the Chemistry Development Kit. A common application of canonical SMILES is indexing and ensuring uniqueness of molecules in a database.

The original paper that described the CANGEN algorithm claimed to generate unique SMILES strings for graphs representing molecules, but the algorithm fails for a number of simple cases (e.g. cuneane, 1,2-dicyclopropylethane) and cannot be considered a correct method for representing a graph canonically. There is currently no systematic comparison across commercial software to test if such flaws exist in those packages.

SMILES notation allows the specification of configuration at tetrahedral centers, and double bond geometry. These are structural features that cannot be specified by connectivity alone, and therefore SMILES which encode this information are termed isomeric SMILES. A notable feature of these rules is that they allow rigorous partial specification of chirality. The term isomeric SMILES is also applied to SMILES in which isomers are specified.

== Graph-based definition ==
In terms of a graph-based computational procedure, SMILES is a string obtained by printing the symbol nodes encountered in a depth-first tree traversal of a chemical graph. The chemical graph is first trimmed to remove hydrogen atoms and cycles are broken to turn it into a spanning tree. Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree.

The resultant SMILES form depends on the choices:
* of the bonds chosen to break cycles,
* of the starting atom used for the depth-first traversal, and
* of the order in which branches are listed when encountered.

==SMILES definition as strings of a context-free language==

From the view point of a formal language theory, SMILES is a word. A SMILES is parsable with a context-free parser. The use of this representation has been in the prediction of biochemical properties (incl. toxicity and biodegradability) based on the main principle of chemoinformatics that similar molecules have similar properties. The predictive models implemented a syntactic pattern recognition approach (which involved defining a molecular distance) as well as a more robust scheme based on statistical pattern recognition.

== Description ==

=== Atoms ===
Atoms are represented by the standard abbreviation of the chemical elements, in square brackets, such as codice_4 for gold. Brackets may be omitted in the common case of atoms which:
# are in the &quot;organic subset&quot; of B, C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, or I, and
# have no formal charge, and
# have the number of hydrogens attached implied by the SMILES valence model (typically their normal valence, but for N and P it is 3 or 5, and for S it is 2, 4 or 6), and
# are the normal isotopes, and
# are not chiral centers.
All other elements must be enclosed in brackets, and have charges and hydrogens shown explicitly. For instance, the SMILES for water may be written as either codice_5 or codice_6. Hydrogen may also be written as a separate atom; water may also be written as codice_7.

When brackets are used, the symbol codice_8 is added if the atom in brackets is bonded to one or more hydrogen, followed by the number of hydrogen atoms if greater than 1, then by the sign codice_9 for a positive charge or by codice_10 for a negative charge. For example, codice_11 for ammonium (). If there is more than one charge, it is normally written as digit; however, it is also possible to repeat the sign as many times as the ion has charges: one may write either codice_12 or codice_13 for titanium(IV) Ti4+. Thus, the hydroxide anion () is represented by codice_14, the hydronium cation () is codice_15 and the cobalt(III) cation (Co3+) is either codice_16 or codice_17.

===Bonds===
A bond is represented using one of the symbols codice_18.

Bonds between aliphatic atoms are assumed to be single unless specified otherwise and are implied by adjacency in the SMILES string. Although single bonds may be written as codice_10, this is usually omitted. For example, the SMILES for ethanol may be written as codice_20, codice_21 or codice_22, but is usually written codice_1.

Double, triple, and quadruple bonds are represented by the symbols codice_24, codice_25, and codice_26 respectively as illustrated by the SMILES codice_27 (carbon dioxide ), codice_28 (hydrogen cyanide HCN) and codice_29 (gallium arsenide).

An additional type of bond is a &quot;non-bond&quot;, indicated with codice_30, to indicate that two parts are not bonded together. For example, aqueous sodium chloride may be written as codice_31 to show the dissociation.

An aromatic &quot;one and a half&quot; bond may be indicated with codice_32; see below.

Single bonds adjacent to double bonds may be represented using codice_33 or codice_34 to indicate stereochemical configuration; see below.

===Rings===
Ring structures are written by breaking each ring at an arbitrary point (although some choices will lead to a more legible SMILES than others) to make an acyclic structure and adding numerical ring closure labels to show connectivity between non-adjacent atoms.

For example, cyclohexane and dioxane may be written as codice_35 and codice_36 respectively. For a second ring, the label will be 2. For example, decalin (decahydronaphthalene) may be written as codice_37.

SMILES does not require that ring numbers be used in any particular order, and permits ring number zero, although this is rarely used. Also, it is permitted to reuse ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae harder to read. For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as codice_38, but it may also be written as codice_39.

Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is codice_40, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by codice_41, so codice_42 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.

Either or both of the digits may be preceded by a bond type to indicate the type of the ring-closing bond. For example, cyclopropene is usually written codice_43, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as codice_44, codice_45, or codice_46. (The first form is preferred.) codice_47 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond.

Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, codice_48 is not a valid alternative to codice_49 for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; codice_50 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written codice_51.

Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as codice_52; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.

=== Aromaticity ===
Aromatic rings such as benzene may be written in one of three forms:
# In Kekulé form with alternating single and double bonds, e.g. codice_53,
# Using the aromatic bond symbol codice_32, e.g. codice_55, or
# Most commonly, by writing the constituent B, C, N, O, P and S atoms in lower-case forms codice_56, codice_57, codice_58, codice_59, codice_60 and codice_61, respectively.

In the latter case, bonds between two aromatic atoms are assumed (if not explicitly shown) to be aromatic bonds. Thus, benzene, pyridine and furan can be represented respectively by the SMILES codice_62, codice_63 and codice_64.

Aromatic nitrogen bonded to hydrogen, as found in pyrrole must be represented as codice_65; thus imidazole is written in SMILES notation as codice_66.

When aromatic atoms are singly bonded to each other, such as in biphenyl, a single bond must be shown explicitly: codice_67. This is one of the few cases where the single bond symbol codice_10 is required. (In fact, most SMILES software can correctly infer that the bond between the two rings cannot be aromatic and so will accept the nonstandard form codice_69.)

The Daylight and OpenEye algorithms for generating canonical SMILES differ in their treatment of aromaticity.

=== Branching ===
Branches are described with parentheses, as in codice_70 for propionic acid and codice_71 for fluoroform. The first atom within the parentheses, and the first atom after the parenthesized group, are both bonded to the same branch point atom. The bond symbol must appear inside the parentheses; outside (e.g. codice_72) is invalid.

Substituted rings can be written with the branching point in the ring as illustrated by the SMILES codice_73 (see depiction) and codice_74 (see depiction) which encode the 3 and 4-cyanoanisole isomers. Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable.

Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as codice_75, codice_76, codice_77, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are:
* If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing.
* If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.

The one form of branch which does &quot;not&quot; require parentheses are ring-closing bonds: the SMILES fragment codice_78 is equivalent to codice_79, both denoting a bond between the codice_80 and the codice_81. Choosing ring-closing bonds adjacent to branch points can reduce the number of parentheses required. For example, toluene is normally written as codice_82 or codice_83, avoiding the parentheses required if written as codice_84 or codice_85.

=== Stereochemistry ===
SMILES permits, but does not require, specification of stereoisomers.

Configuration around double bonds is specified using the characters codice_33 and codice_34 to show directional single bonds adjacent to a double bond. For example, codice_88 (see depiction) is one representation of &quot;trans&quot;-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond (as shown in the figure), whereas codice_89 (see depiction) is one possible representation of &quot;cis&quot;-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorines are on the same side of the double bond.

Bond direction symbols always come in groups of at least two, of which the first is arbitrary. That is, codice_90 is the same as codice_88. When alternating single-double bonds are present, the groups are larger than two, with the middle directional symbols being adjacent to two double bonds. For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written codice_92.
As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written codice_93.

Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by codice_94 or codice_95. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with codice_95 and codice_94, respectively (because the codice_94 symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).
For example, consider the amino acid alanine. One of its SMILES forms is codice_99, more fully written as codice_100. -Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as codice_101 (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (codice_8), methyl (codice_80), and carboxylate (codice_104) groups appear clockwise. -Alanine can be written as codice_105 (see depiction).

While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as codice_106, then the configuration also reverses; -alanine is written as codice_107 (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include codice_108, codice_109 and codice_110.

Normally, the first of the four bonds appears to the left of the carbon atom, but if the SMILES is written beginning with the chiral carbon, such as codice_111, then all four are to the right, but the first to appear (the codice_112 bond in this case) is used as the reference to order the following three: -alanine may also be written codice_113.

The SMILES specification includes elaborations on the codice_94 symbol to indicate stereochemistry around more complex chiral centers, such as trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry.

===Isotopes===
Isotopes are specified with a number equal to the integer isotopic mass preceding the atomic symbol. Benzene in which one atom is carbon-14 is written as codice_115 and deuterochloroform is codice_116.

=== Examples ===

To illustrate a molecule with more than 9 rings, consider cephalostatin-1, a steroidic 13-ringed pyrazine with the empirical formula C54H74N2O10 isolated from the Indian Ocean hemichordate &quot;Cephalodiscus gilchristi&quot;:

Starting with the left-most methyl group in the figure:

:codice_117

codice_41 appears in front of the index of ring closure labels above 9; see above.

=== Other examples of SMILES ===

The SMILES notation is described extensively in the SMILES theory manual provided by Daylight Chemical Information Systems and a number of illustrative examples are presented. Daylight&#x27;s depict utility provides users with the means to check their own examples of SMILES and is a valuable educational tool.

== Extensions ==

SMARTS is a line notation for specification of substructural patterns in molecules. While it uses many of the same symbols as SMILES, it also allows specification of wildcard atoms and bonds, which can be used to define substructural queries for chemical database searching. One common misconception is that SMARTS-based substructural searching involves matching of SMILES and SMARTS strings. In fact, both SMILES and SMARTS strings are first converted to internal graph representations which are searched for subgraph isomorphism.

SMIRKS, a superset of &quot;reaction SMILES&quot; and a subset of &quot;reaction SMARTS&quot;, is a line notation for specifying reaction transforms. The general syntax for the reaction extensions is codice_119 (without spaces), where any of the fields can either be left blank or filled with multiple molecules delineated with a dot (codice_30), and other descriptions dependent on the base language. Atoms can additionally be identified with a number (e.g. codice_121) for mapping, for example in .

SMILES corresponds to discrete molecular structures. However many materials are macromolecules, which are too large (and often stochastic) to conveniently generate SMILES for. BigSMILES is an extension of SMILES that aims to provide an efficient representation system for macromolecules.

== Conversion ==
SMILES can be converted back to two-dimensional representations using structure diagram generation (SDG) algorithms. This conversion is sometimes ambiguous. Conversion to three-dimensional representation is achieved by energy-minimization approaches. There are many downloadable and web-based conversion utilities.

<text>Soweto () is a township of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng, South Africa, bordering the city&#x27;s mining belt in the south. Its name is an English syllabic abbreviation for &quot;South Western Townships&quot;. Formerly a separate municipality, it is now incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality and is one of the suburbs of Johannesburg.

==History==
George Harrison and George Walker are today credited as the men who discovered an outcrop of the Main Reef of gold on the farm Langlaagte in February 1886. The fledgling town of Johannesburg was laid out on a triangular wedge of &quot;uitvalgrond&quot; (area excluded when the farms were surveyed) named Randjeslaagte, situated between the farms Doornfontein to the east, Braamfontein to the west and Turffontein to the south.

Within a decade of the discovery of gold in Johannesburg, 100,000 people flocked to this part of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek in search of riches. They were of many races and nationalities. In October 1887, the government of the South African Republic (ZAR) bought the south-eastern portion of the farm Braamfontein. There were large quantities of clay, suitable for brickmaking, along the stream. The government decided that more money was to be made from issuing brick maker&#x27;s licences at five shillings per month. The result was that many landless Dutch-speaking burghers (citizens) of the ZAR settled on the property and started making bricks. They also erected their shacks there. Soon, the area was known either Brickfields or Veldschoendorp. Soon other working poor, Coloureds, Indians and Africans also settled there. The government, who sought to differentiate the white working class from the black, laid out new suburbs for the Burghers (Whites), Coolies (Indians), Malays (Coloureds) and Black Africans (Africans), but the whole area simply stayed multiracial.

Soweto was created in the 1930s, when the White government started separating Blacks from Whites, to create black &quot;townships&quot;. Blacks were moved away from Johannesburg, to an area separated from White suburbs by a so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; (or sanitary corridor) which was usually a river, railway track, industrial area or highway. This was carried out using the infamous Urban Areas Act of 1923.

William Carr, chair of non-European affairs, initiated the naming of Soweto in 1949. He called for a competition to give a collective name to townships dotted around the South-west of Johannesburg. People responded to this competition with great enthusiasm. Among the names suggested to the city council was KwaMpanza, meaning Mpanza&#x27;s place, invoking the name of Mpanza and his role in bringing the plight of Orlando sub tenants to the attention of the city council. The city council settled for the acronym SOWETO (South West Townships). The name Soweto was first used in 1963 and within a short period of time, following the 1976 uprising of students in the township, the name became internationally known.

Soweto became the largest Black city in South Africa, but until 1976, its population could have status only as temporary residents, serving as a workforce for Johannesburg. It experienced civil unrest during the Apartheid regime. There were serious riots in 1976, sparked by a ruling that Afrikaans be used in African schools there; the riots were violently suppressed, with 176 striking students killed and more than 1,000 injured. Reforms followed, but riots flared up again in 1985 and continued until the first non-racial elections were held in April 1994. In 2010, South Africa&#x27;s oldest township hosted the FIFA World Cup Final and the attention of more than a billion soccer spectators from all over the world was focused on Soweto.

===Kliptown and Pimville===

In April 1904, there was a bubonic plague scare in the shanty town area of Brickfields. The town council decided to condemn the area and burn it down. Beforehand, most of the Africans living there were moved far out of town to the farm Klipspruit (later called Pimville), south-west of Johannesburg, where the council had erected iron barracks and a few triangular hutments. The rest of them had to build their own shacks. The fire brigade then set the 1600 shacks and shops in Brickfields alight. Thereafter, the area was redeveloped as Newtown. Pimville was next to Kliptown, the oldest Black residential district of Johannesburg and first laid out in 1891, on land which formed part of Klipspruit farm. The future Soweto was to be laid out on Klipspruit and the adjoining farm called Diepkloof.

In the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and the subsequent Transvaal Colony, it was lawful for people of colour to own fixed property. Consequently, the township of Sophiatown was laid out in 1903 and Blacks were encouraged to buy property there. For the same reasons, Alexandra, Gauteng was planned for Black ownership in 1912. The subsequent Natives Land Act of 1913 did not change the situation because it did not apply to land situated within municipal boundaries.

===Orlando, Moroka and Jabavu===
In 1923, the Parliament of the Union of South Africa passed the Natives (Urban Areas) Act. The purpose of the Act was to provide for improved conditions of residence for natives in urban areas, to control their ingress into such areas and to restrict their access to intoxicating liquor. The Act required local authorities to provide accommodation for Natives (then the polite term for Africans or Blacks) lawfully employed and resident within the area of their jurisdiction. Pursuant to this Act, the Johannesburg town council formed a Municipal Native Affairs Department in 1927. It bought 1 300 morgen of land on the farm Klipspruit No. 8 and the first houses in what was to become Orlando Location were built there in the latter half of 1930. The township was named after the chairman of the Native Affairs committee, Mr. Edwin Orlando Leake. In the end, some 10,311 houses were built there by the municipality. In addition, it built 4,045 temporary single-room shelters.
In about 1934, James Sofasonke Mpanza moved to 957 Pheele Street, Orlando, and lived there for the rest of his life. A year after his arrival in Orlando, he formed his own political party, the Sofasonke Party. He also became very active in the affairs of the Advisory Board for Orlando. Towards the end of World War II, there was an acute shortage of housing for Blacks in Johannesburg. By the end of 1943, the Sofasonke Party advised its members to put up their own squatters&#x27; shacks on municipal property. On Saturday 25 March 1944, the squat began. Hundreds of homeless people from Orlando and elsewhere joined Mpanza in marching to a vacant lot in Orlando West and starting a squatters camp. The city council&#x27;s resistance crumbled. After feverish consultations with the relevant government department, it was agreed that an emergency camp, which could house 991 families, be erected. It was to be called Central Western Jabavu. The next wave of land invasions took place in September 1946. Some 30,000 squatters congregated west of Orlando. Early the next year, the city council proclaimed a new emergency camp. It was called Moroka. 10,000 sites were made available immediately. Moroka became Johannesburg&#x27;s worst slum area. Residents erected their shanties on plots measuring six metres by six metres. There were only communal bucket-system toilets and very few taps. The camps were meant to be used for a maximum of five years, but when they were eventually demolished in 1955, Moroka and Jabavu housed 89,000 people.

===Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital===
In 1941, the British Government built a military hospital next to the road between Johannesburg and Potchefstroom. The place was to be at the 8th milestone near the old Wayside Inn, owned by a Cornishman called John Albert Baragwanath. It was called The Imperial Military Hospital, Baragwanath. After the war, the Transvaal Provincial Administration bought the hospital for £1 million. On 1 April 1948, the Black section of Johannesburg Hospital (known as Non-European Hospital or NEH) was transferred to Baragwanath Hospital. In 1997, the facility was renamed Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital after former General Secretary of the South African Communist Party, Chris Hani.

===Apartheid===
The National Party won the general election of 1948 and formed a new government. The party&#x27;s policy was called apartheid, the Afrikaans word meaning separateness. They thought they could separate the various racial groups in South Africa. In those days, the Johannesburg City Council did not support the National Party. The city council and the central government competed to control the Black townships of Johannesburg.

====1948 to 1976====
Following the election of the new government, some 7,000 new houses were built in the first two or three years, but very little was done thereafter. In 1952, there was a breakthrough. Firstly, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research came up with a standard design for low-cost, four-roomed, forty-square-metre houses. In 1951, the Parliament passed the Building Workers Act, which permitted Blacks to be trained as artisans in the building trade. In 1952, it passed the Bantu Services Levy Act, which imposed a levy on employers of African workers and the levy was used to finance basic services in Black townships. In 1954, the City Council built 5,100 houses in Jabavu and 1,450 in Mofolo.

The city council&#x27;s pride and joy was its economic scheme known as Dube Village. It was intended &quot;primarily for the thoroughly urbanised and economically advanced Native&quot;. Stands, varying in size from fifty by hundred feet to forty by 70 feet, were made available on a thirty-year leasehold tenure. Tenants could erect their own dwellings in conformity with approved plans.

In June 1955, Kliptown was the home of an unprecedented Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter.

From the onset, the Apartheid government purposed Soweto to house the bulk of the labour force which was needed by Johannesburg (1998:58). Africans used to live in areas surrounding the city, so the authorities felt it would be more expedient to concentrate black workers in one district that could be easily controlled (1998:58).

The new sub-economic townships took off in 1956, when Tladi, Zondi, Dhlamini, Chiawelo and Senoane were laid out providing 28,888 people with accommodation. Jabulani, Phiri and Naledi followed the next year. Sir Ernest Oppenheimer arranged a loan of £3 million from the mining industry, which allowed an additional 14,000 houses to be built. It was decided to divide Soweto into various language groups. Naledi, Mapetla, Tladi, Moletsane and Phiri were for Sotho- and Tswana-speaking people. Chiawelo for Tsonga and Venda. Dlamini Senaoane, Zola, Zondi, Jabulani, Emdeni and White City were for Zulus and Xhosas.

The central government was busy with its own agenda. The presence of Blacks with freehold title to land among Johannesburg&#x27;s White suburbs irked them. In 1954, Parliament passed the Native Resettlement Act, which permitted the government to remove Blacks from suburbs like Sophiatown, Martindale, Newclare and Western Native Township. Between 1956 and 1960, they built 23,695 houses in Meadowlands and Diepkloof to accommodate the evicted persons. By 1960, the removals were more-or-less complete.

In 1959, the city council launched a competition to find a collective name for all the townships south-west of the city&#x27;s centre. It was only in 1963 that the city council decided to adopt the name Soweto as the collective name. The name Soweto was officially endorsed by the municipalities&#x27; authorities only in 1963 after a special committee had considered various names. The apartheid government&#x27;s intention was for Soweto to house black people who were working for Johannesburg. Other names considered included &quot;apartheid Townships&quot; and &quot;Verwoerdstad&quot; (Gorodnov 1998:58).

In 1971, Parliament passed the Black Affairs Administration Act, No. 45 of 1971. In terms of this Act, the central government appointed the West Rand Administration Board to take over the powers and obligations of the Johannesburg City Council in respect of Soweto. As chairman of the board it appointed Manie Mulder, a political appointment of a person who had no experience of the administration of native affairs.
Manie Mulder&#x27;s most famous quote was given to the Rand Daily Mail in May 1976: &quot;The broad masses of Soweto are perfectly content, perfectly happy. Black-White relationships at present are as healthy as can be. There is no danger whatever of a blow-up in Soweto.&quot;

====Soweto uprising====

Soweto came to the world&#x27;s attention on 16 June 1976 with the Soweto uprising, when mass protests erupted over the government&#x27;s policy to enforce education in Afrikaans rather than their native language. Police opened fire in Orlando West on 10,000 students marching from Naledi High School to Orlando Stadium. The rioting continued and 23 people died on the first day in Soweto, 21 of whom were black, including the minor Hector Pieterson, as well as two white people, including Melville Edelstein, a lifelong humanitarian.

The impact of the Soweto protests reverberated through the country and across the world. In their aftermath, economic and cultural sanctions were introduced from abroad. Political activists left the country to train for guerrilla resistance. Soweto and other townships became the stage for violent state repression. Since 1991, this date and the schoolchildren have been commemorated by the International Day of the African Child.

====Aftermath====

In response, the apartheid state started providing electricity to more Soweto homes, yet phased out financial support for building additional housing. Soweto became an independent municipality with elected black councilors in 1983, in line with the Black Local Authorities Act. Previously, the townships were governed by the Johannesburg council, but from the 1970s, the state took control.
Black African councilors were not provided by the apartheid state with the finances to address housing and infrastructural problems. Township residents opposed the black councilors as puppet collaborators who personally benefited financially from an oppressive regime. Resistance was spurred by the exclusion of blacks from the newly formed tricameral Parliament (which did include Whites, Indians and Coloreds). Municipal elections in black, coloured, and Indian areas were subsequently widely boycotted, returning extremely low voting figures for years. Popular resistance to state structures dates back to the Advisory Boards (1950) that co-opted black residents to advise whites who managed the townships.

===Further popular resistance: incorporation into the City===
In Soweto, popular resistance to apartheid emerged in various forms during the 1980s. Educational and economic boycotts were initiated, and student bodies were organized. Street committees were formed, and civic organizations were established as alternatives to state-imposed structures. One of the most well-known &quot;civics&quot; was Soweto&#x27;s Committee of Ten, started in 1978 in the offices of &quot;The Bantu World&quot; newspaper. Such actions were strengthened by the call issued by African National Congress&#x27;s 1985 Kabwe congress in Zambia to make South Africa ungovernable. As the state forbade public gatherings, church buildings like Regina Mundi were sometimes used for political gatherings.

In 1995, Soweto became part of the Southern Metropolitan Transitional Local Council, and in 2002, was incorporated into the City of Johannesburg. A series of bombings occurred in 2002. The right-wing extremist group, Boeremag claimed responsibility for the attacks that damaged buildings, railway lines, and killed one person. In 2022, 15 people were killed in a mass shooting at a bar.

==Demographics==

*Freedom Towers
*Mandela House
*Orlando Towers
*Regina Mundi, Rockville
* SAAF 1723, a decommissioned Avro Shackleton of the South African Air Force is on static display on the roof of Vic&#x27;s Viking Garage, a service station on the Golden Highway

*Walter Sisulu Square, Kliptown

==Climate==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as subtropical highland (Cwb).

==Transport==
The suburb was not historically allowed to create employment centres within the area, so almost all of its residents are commuters to other parts of the city.

===Rail===
Metrorail operates commuter trains between Soweto and central Johannesburg. Soweto train stations are at Naledi, Merafe, Inhlazane, Ikwezi, Dube, Phefeni, Phomolong, Mzimhlophe, New Canada, Mlamlankunzi, Orlando, Nancefield, Kliptown, Tshiawelo and Midway.

===Road===
The N1 highway skirts the eastern boundary of Soweto. There is efficient road access for many parts of the region along busy highways to Johannesburg and Roodepoort, but commuters are largely reliant on trains and taxis.

The N12 (named the Moroka Bypass) forms the southern border of Soweto, separating it from Lenasia.

A new section of the N17 has been built, connecting Soweto with Nasrec as a four-lane dual carriageway.

The M70, also known as the Soweto Highway, links Soweto with central Johannesburg via Nasrec and Booysens. This road is multi lane, passes next to Soccer City in Nasrec and has dedicated taxiway lanes from Soweto eastwards to Booysens and Johannesburg Central.

The M68, also known as the Old Potchefstroom Road, links Soweto with Johannesburg South.

A major thoroughfare through the south-eastern part of Soweto (Eldorado Park) is the R553 Golden Highway. It provides access to the N1, N12 and M1 highways.

Minibus taxis are a popular form of transport. In 2000 it was estimated that around 2000 minibus taxis operated from the Baragwanath taxi rank alone.

A Bus rapid transit system, &quot;Rea Vaya&quot;, provides transport for around 16 000 commuters daily.

PUTCO has for many years provided bus commuter services to Soweto residents.

==Housing==
The area is mostly composed of old &quot;matchbox&quot; houses, or four-room houses built by the government, that were built to provide cheap accommodation for black workers during apartheid. However, there are a few smaller areas where prosperous Sowetans have built houses that are similar in stature to those in more affluent suburbs. Many people who still live in matchbox houses have improved and expanded their homes, and the City Council has enabled the planting of more trees and the improving of parks and green spaces in the area.

Hostels are another prominent physical feature of Soweto. Originally built to house male migrant workers, many have been improved as dwellings for couples and families.

In 1996, the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality awarded tenders to Conrad Penny and his company Penny Brothers Brokers &amp; Valuers (Pty) Ltd. for the valuation of the whole of Soweto (which at the time consisted of over 325,000 properties) for rating and taxing purpose. This was the single largest valuation ever undertaken in Africa.

==Society and culture==
===Media===
Being part of the urban agglomerations of Gauteng, Soweto shares much of the same media as the rest of Gauteng province. There are however some media sources dedicated to Soweto itself:
* Soweto Online is a geographical-based information-sharing portal.
* Soweto Internet Radio is a digital media network company established in 2008.
* Soweto TV is a community television channel, available on DStv channel 251. The channel is free-to-air in Gauteng province and it also broadcast to South African subscribers on the DStv pay TV service on channel 251. The channel studios are situated on Vilakazi Street, known for being the only street in the world to have the historical residences of two Nobel Prize winners, namely Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Soweto TV programming is mostly Sowetan content as per ICASA&#x27;s regulations of over 60% local content.
* &quot;The Sowetan&quot; newspaper has a readership of around 1.6 million.
* &quot;Kasibiz Mahala&quot; is a free community magazine that promotes local small businesses established in 2012.

===Museums, monuments and memorials===
* Hector Pieterson Museum, Orlando West
* Nelson Mandela National Museum, Orlando West
* Regina Mundi church, Rockville
* Tsietsi Mashinini Memorial Arc Museum, Central Western Jabavu
* American rapper, Tupac Shakur&#x27;s ashes, final resting place.

===Music===

Soweto is credited as one of the founding places for Kwaito and Kasi rap, which is a style of hip hop specific to South Africa. This form of music, which combined many elements of house music, American hip-hop, and traditional African music, became a strong force amongst black South Africans.

Early Career

The experiences of other developing nations were examined at the Soweto entrepreneurship conference, which looked for ways to help turn the economic tide in townships. 
SOWETO&#x27;S entrepreneurs gathered at the University of Johannesburg Soweto Campus on 13 and 14 April to engage with experts from all over the globe about how to enhance skills and value-add in township economies.
The restrictions on economic activities were lifted in 1977, spurring the growth of the taxi industry as an alternative to Soweto&#x27;s inadequate bus and train transport systems. 
In 1994 Sowetans earned on average almost six and a half times less than their counterparts in wealthier areas of Johannesburg (1994 estimates). Sowetans contribute less than 2% to Johannesburg&#x27;s rates Some Sowetans remain impoverished, and others live in shanty towns with little or no services. About 85% of Kliptown comprises informal housing. The Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee argues that Soweto&#x27;s poor are unable to pay for electricity. The committee believes that the South African government&#x27;s privatization drives will worsen the situation. Research showed that 62% of residents in Orlando East and Pimville were unemployed or pensioners. 
There have been signs recently indicating economic improvement. The Johannesburg City Council began to provide more street lights and to pave roads. Private initiatives to tap Sowetans&#x27; combined spending power of R4.3 billion were also planned, including the construction of Protea Mall, Jabulani Mall, and the development of Maponya Mall, an upmarket hotel in Kliptown, and the Orlando Ekhaya entertainment center. Soweto has also become a Centre for nightlife and culture.

Well-known artists from Soweto, besides those mentioned above, include:

* The Soweto Gospel Choir. Songs and interview from NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; Soweto Gospel Choir: &#x27;Voices from Heaven&#x27;, 4 February 2005.
*Soweto String Quartet
*Soweto Melodic Voices, the youth choir selected to sing at the 2009 Confederations Cup. It has built its name in UK on Fringe festival in Edinburgh Scotland.

===Sport===
*Soweto is home to two football teams that play for the top South African football league: the Kaizer Chiefs and the Moroka Swallows. The Orlando Pirates originated from Soweto but moved to Houghton, however still play the Original Soweto Derby against the Swallows. The Chiefs and the Pirates feud in the rivalry known as the Soweto derby, widely recognised as one of the biggest in Africa.
*The Soweto Open tennis tournament, part of the Challenger Tour is annually hosted in Soweto.
* The annual Soweto marathon is run over a course through Soweto.
* The Soweto Panthers are the township&#x27;s representative in the Basketball National League.

===Festivals===

The Soweto Wine Festival was started in 2004. The three-night festival is hosted at the University of Johannesburg&#x27;s Soweto Campus on Chris Hani Road in the first weekend of September. Organised by the Cape Wine Academy, the festival attracts over 6000 wine enthusiasts, over 100 of South Africa&#x27;s finest wineries and well over 900 fine wines.

Soweto Pride, an annual pride parade, is held in Soweto every year, on the last Saturday of September. The inaugural Pride was in 2004. The parade aims to celebrate black lesbian, queer and trans women plus non-binary people, and offer them space to voice issues affecting them.

===Stadiums===
* FNB Stadium, South Africa&#x27;s largest stadium; home ground of both the national team and the Kaizer Chiefs
* Eldorado Park Stadium
* Dobsonville Stadium, home ground of Moroka Swallows
* Jabavu Stadium
* Noordgesig Stadium
* Orlando Stadium, home ground of Orlando Pirates
* Meadowlands Stadium

===Awards===
The Soweto Awards, which will become an annual event, honours those who have their roots in Soweto.
Former president Nelson Mandela received the Life Time Award from the first Soweto Awards in Johannesburg on 25 February 2001. The Legends Awards went to Gibson Kente, the &quot;godfather&quot; of township theatre, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, a talk show host, Aggrey Klaaste, editor of the Sowetan newspaper and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, MP and African National Congress Women&#x27;s League president.

==Suburbs==
By 2003, the Greater Soweto area consisted of 87 townships grouped together into Administrative Regions 6 and 10 of Johannesburg.

Estimates of how many residential areas make up Soweto itself vary widely. Some counts say that Soweto comprises 29 townships, whilst others find 34. The differences may be due to confusion arising from the merger of adjoining townships (such as Lenasia and Eldorado Park) with those of Soweto into Regions 6 and 10. The total number also depends on whether the various &quot;extensions&quot; and &quot;zones&quot; are counted separately, or as part of one main suburb. The 2003 Regional Spatial Development Framework arrived at 87 names by counting various extensions (e.g. Chiawelo&#x27;s 5) and zones (e.g. Pimville&#x27;s 7) separately. The City of Johannesburg&#x27;s website groups the zones and extensions together to arrive at 32, but omits Noordgesig and Mmesi Park.

The list below provides the dates when some of Soweto&#x27;s townships were established, along with the probable origins or meanings of their names, where available:
Other Soweto townships include Phomolong and Snake Park.

==Economy==

Many parts of Soweto rank among the poorest in Johannesburg, although individual townships tend to have a mix of wealthier and poorer residents. In general, households in the outlying areas to the northwest and southeast have lower incomes, while those in southwestern areas tend to have higher incomes.

The economic development of Soweto was severely curtailed by the apartheid state, which provided very limited infrastructure and prevented residents from creating their own businesses. Roads remained unpaved, and many residents had to share one tap between four houses, for example. Soweto was meant to exist only as a dormitory town for black Africans who worked in white houses, factories, and industries. The 1957 Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act and its predecessors restricted residents between 1923 and 1976 to seven self-employment categories in Soweto itself. Sowetans could operate general shops, butcheries, eating houses, sell milk or vegetables, or hawk goods. The overall number of such enterprises at any time were strictly controlled. As a result, informal trading developed outside the legally-recognized activities.

By 1976, Soweto had only two cinemas and two hotels, and 83% of houses had electricity. Up to 93% of residents had no running water. Using fire for cooking and heating resulted in respiratory problems that contributed to high infant mortality rates (54 per 1,000 compared to 18 for whites, 1976 figures.

The restrictions on economic activities were lifted in 1977, spurring the growth of the taxi industry as an alternative to Soweto&#x27;s inadequate bus and train transport systems.

In 1994, Sowetans earned on average almost six and a half times less than their counterparts in wealthier areas of Johannesburg (1994 estimates). Sowetans contribute less than 2% to Johannesburg&#x27;s rates. Some Sowetans remain impoverished, and others live in shanty towns with little or no services. About 85% of Kliptown comprises informal housing. The Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee argues that Soweto&#x27;s poor are unable to pay for electricity. The committee believes that the South African government&#x27;s privatization drives will worsen the situation. Research showed that 62% of residents in Orlando East and Pimville were unemployed or pensioners.

There have been signs recently indicating economic improvement. The Johannesburg City Council began to provide more street lights and to pave roads. Private initiatives to tap Sowetans&#x27; combined spending power of R4.3 billion were also planned, including the construction of Protea Mall, Jabulani Mall, the development of Maponya Mall, an upmarket hotel in Kliptown, and the Orlando Ekhaya entertainment centre. Soweto has also become a centre for nightlife and culture.

==In popular culture==
===Films===
The 1976 uprising is depicted in the film &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989), starring Donald Sutherland, Marlon Brando, and Susan Sarandon, who portray white South Africans pursuing justice for the deaths of black Soweto residents which followed the demonstrations.

The American film &quot;Stander&quot; (2003) portrays the story of Andre Stander, a rogue South African police Captain who rebelled against the corruption of South African under apartheid by becoming a bank robber. The Soweto uprising are depicted as Stander&#x27;s breaking point in the film.

Sara Blecher and Rimi Raphoto&#x27;s popular documentary, &quot;Surfing Soweto&quot; (2006), addresses the phenomenon of young kids &quot;surfing&quot; on the roofs of Soweto trains and the social problem this represents.

The film &quot;District 9&quot; (2009) was shot in Tshiawelo, Soweto. The plot involves a species of aliens who arrive on Earth in a starving and helpless condition, seeking aid. The originally benign attempts to aid them turn increasingly oppressive due to the overwhelming numbers of aliens and the cost of maintaining them, and to increasing xenophobia on the part of humans who treat the intelligent and sophisticated aliens like animals while taking advantage of them for personal and corporate gain. The aliens are housed in shacks in a slum-like concentration camp called &quot;District 9&quot;, which is in fact modern-day Soweto; an attempt to relocate the aliens to another camp leads to violence and a wholesale slaughter by South African mercenary security forces (a reference to historical events in &quot;District Six&quot;, Cape Town, a mostly Coloured neighborhood subjected to forced segregation during the apartheid years). The parallels to South Africa under apartheid are both deliberate and obvious, but are not explicitly remarked upon in the film.

Films that include Soweto scenes:

*&quot;Tau ya Soweto&quot; (2005)
*&quot;Sarafina&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Hijack Stories&quot; (2000)

===Literature===
The marches by students in Soweto are briefly mentioned in Linzi Glass&#x27; novel, &quot;Ruby Red&quot;, which was nominated for the Carnegie Medal in 2008.

Soweto is also mentioned in Sheila Gordon&#x27;s novel, &quot;Waiting for the Rain&quot; (1987).

The main protagonist from the Jonas Jonasson novel &quot;The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden&quot; (2013), Nombeko Mayeki was born in 1961 in Soweto.
In his first Anthology of Poems titled &quot;In Quiet Realm&quot; South African Soweto Born poet Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu dedicated a poem called &quot;Soweto My Everything&quot; to honour the place of his birth.

<doc id="28575" wikidata="Q180956" url="?curid=28575" title="Sampo">
<text>In Finnish mythology, the Sampo () is a magical device or object described in many different ways that was constructed by the blacksmith and inventor Ilmarinen and that brought riches and good fortune to its holder, akin to the horn of plenty (cornucopia) of Greek mythology. When the Sampo was stolen, Ilmarinen&#x27;s homeland fell upon hard times. He sent an expedition to retrieve it, but in the ensuing battle it was smashed and lost at sea.

== In the Kalevala ==
The Sampo is a pivotal element of the plot of the epic poem &quot;Kalevala&quot;, compiled in 1835 (and expanded in 1849) by Elias Lönnrot based on Finnish and Karelian oral tradition.

In the expanded second version of the poem, the Sampo is forged by Ilmarinen, a legendary blacksmith, to fulfill a task set by the witch queen of Pohjola, Louhi, in return for her daughter&#x27;s hand.

: &quot;Ilmarinen, worthy brother,&quot;
: &quot;Thou the only skilful blacksmith,&quot;
: &quot;Go and see her wondrous beauty,&quot;
: &quot;See her gold and silver garments,&quot;
: &quot;See her robed in finest raiment,&quot;
: &quot;See her sitting on the rainbow,&quot;
: &quot;Walking on the clouds of purple.&quot;
: &quot;Forge for her the magic Sampo,&quot;
: &quot;Forge the lid in many colors,&quot;
: &quot;Thy reward shall be the virgin,&quot;
: &quot;Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;&quot;
: &quot;Go and bring the lovely maiden&quot;
: &quot;To thy home in Kalevala.&quot;

Ilmarinen works for many days at a mighty forge until he finally succeeds in creating the Sampo:

: &quot;On one side the flour is grinding,&quot;
: &quot;On another salt is making,&quot;
: &quot;On a third is money forging,&quot;
: &quot;And the lid is many-colored.&quot;
: &quot;Well the Sampo grinds when finished,&quot;
: &quot;To and fro the lid in rocking,&quot;
: &quot;Grinds one measure at the day-break,&quot;
: &quot;Grinds a measure fit for eating,&quot;
: &quot;Grinds a second for the market,&quot;
: &quot;Grinds a third one for the store-house.&quot;

Later, Louhi steals the Sampo, and then Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen enter her stronghold in secret and retrieve it. Louhi pursues them and combats Väinämöinen. In the struggle, Louhi is vanquished but the Sampo is destroyed.

==Interpretation==
The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine coin die, a decorated Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, compiler Lönnrot interpreted it to be a quern or mill of some sort that made flour, salt, and gold out of thin air. The world pillar/tree hypothesis was argued for by figures such as theosophian Pekka Ervast, historian of religions Uno Harva and the linguist Eemil Nestor Setälä in the early 20th century.

According to the archaeologist Elena Kuz&#x27;mina the Sampo mill myth originates from the Indo-European &quot;skambhá&quot; (support, pillar, column), and was borrowed into Finno-Ugric. In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; the &#x27;skambhá&#x27; is a creature that supports the universe, analogous to the World Tree – the Sampo has been claimed to be the Finnish equivalent of the world tree.

== Similar devices ==

In the Aarne–Thompson classification systems of folktales, tale type 565 refers to a magic mill that continuously produces food or salt. Examples include &quot;Why the Sea is Salt&quot; (Norway, based on the poem &quot;Grottasöngr&quot;), &quot;Sweet porridge&quot; (Germanic), and &quot;The Water Mother&quot; (Chinese). Such devices have been included into modern tales such as &quot;Strega Nona&quot; (1975, children&#x27;s book). Variants on the theme with a cautionary tale and pupil-master relationship include &quot;The Master and his Pupil&quot; (English), and Goethe&#x27;s 1797 poem &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;.

The cornucopia of Greek mythology also produces endless goods, and some versions of the Grail myth emphasize how the Grail creates food and goods.

The Japanese folktale &quot;Shiofuki usu&quot; speaks of a grindstone that could be used to create anything. Like the Sampo, it too was lost to the sea, endlessly grinding salt.

The Sanskrit epic the &quot;Mahabharatha&quot; tells of the Akshaya Patra, a vessel or bowl capable of creating food that stops at the end of the day when the lady of the house has had her last meal. Similarly, in the Irish myth of the Cauldron of the Dagda (&quot;coire ansic&quot; or &quot;un-dry cauldron&quot;) is a magical vessel that satisfies any number of people.

<text>A sysop (; an abbreviation of system operator) is an administrator of a multi-user computer system, such as a bulletin board system (BBS) or an online service virtual community. The phrase may also be used to refer to administrators of other Internet-based network services. Sysops typically do not earn money, but donate their activity to the community.

Co-sysops are users who may be granted certain admin privileges on a BBS. Generally, they help validate users and monitor discussion forums. Some co-sysops serve as file clerks, reviewing, describing, and publishing newly uploaded files into appropriate download directories.

Historically, the term &quot;system operator&quot; applied to operators of any computer system, especially a mainframe computer. In general, a sysop is a person who oversees the operation of a server, typically in a large computer system. Usage of the term became popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, originally in reference to BBS operators. A person with equivalent functions on a network host or server is typically called a &quot;sysadmin&quot;, short for system administrator.

Because such duties were often shared with that of the sysadmin prior to the advent of the World Wide Web, the term &quot;sysop&quot; is often used more generally to refer to an administrator or moderator, such as a forum administrator. Hence, the term &quot;sysadmin&quot; is technically used to distinguish the professional position of a network operator.

<doc id="28577" wikidata="Q2327367" url="?curid=28577" title="Skuld (Oh My Goddess!)">
<text>is a fictional character in the anime/manga &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; and is the younger sister of Belldandy. Her character design shows influences from shoujo and Art Nouveau.

== Creation and conception ==

Skuld was one of a series of characters created by Kōsuke Fujishima, and is depicted as the younger sister of Belldandy, one of the two main protagonists of the series. Along with the characters of Belldandy, Urd and Keiichi Morisato, she is regarded as one of the four major characters in &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;. Skuld&#x27;s first appearance in the manga was in chapter 32, &quot;The Third Goddess&quot;, but she has also been depicted in a novel (&quot;Ah! My Goddess: First End&quot;), three anime series—&quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; (OVA), &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Mini-Goddess&quot;—and in &quot;Ah! My Goddess: The Movie&quot;.

===Norse origins===
As with her fictional sisters, Belldandy and Urd, Skuld has her origins in Norse mythology. Skuld is one of the three Norns and represents the future (while Belldandy represents the present and Urd the past), and this role continues into the series, although the three &quot;Oh My Goddess! &quot; characters otherwise bear no resemblance to their Norse namesakes. Her affinity is with water, and her magic usually involves manipulating water. Unlike the problems with transliteration that were encountered with Belldandy (resulting in Verdandi becoming &quot;Belldandy&quot; in the manga), &quot;Skuld&quot; presented no difficulties for translators.

==Biography==
Skuld is the younger sister of Belldandy (who she refers to as Onee-sama, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Big sis&quot; in the English anime) and is the third Goddess to appear to Keiichi Morisato. Skuld has a Goddess second class, type one, limited license, a category similar to her eldest sister Urd. Her true age is unknown, but her appearance (and actions) is that of a girl in her early teens.

Skuld is one of Yggdrasil&#x27;s system debuggers. She compensates for her lack of magic power with her innate talent for invention which is known throughout Heaven (though it is revealed much later that this is also a type of magical ability). Skuld recharges her energy by consuming ice cream and travels via warm or hot water. (She can&#x27;t swim.) She bears the emblem of the future.

Skuld is an engineering genius, capable of building just about anything out of the most mundane parts under most limited resources. Sample gadgets have included: explosives, a neutrino detector, glasses that allow user to see invisible &quot;computer bugs,&quot; and even a device for removing a miniature black hole from Keiichi&#x27;s body. Banpei-kun RX and the converted mannequin Sigel are &quot;living&quot; proof of her talent. She can compute equations and redesign even the most complex engineering blueprints in no time. All too frequently, though, she forgets to include &quot;instructions&quot; with her devices, which can create havoc if someone unsuspecting of their true power (such as Keiichi) interferes with them. Other times, she will concentrate too much on one aspect of a device (usually power) and forgets to compensate by boosting other aspects of the same device, making many of her inventions rather unstable. Though many of her contraptions tend to blow up, or self-destruct, she dislikes machines that have meaningless functions. In her battle with demonic puppet master, Mokkurkalfi she states that she dislikes machines whose prime directive is meaningless combat, and that a true mechanic must value the sanctity of his or her mecha&#x27;s life.

In the manga, she has been gradually developing the ability to do magic. For a long time one of her only magic skills was the ability to imprint words (usually insults) on the surface of her targets, a power she often used when expressing frustration with Urd and Keiichi. Upon meeting a young boy named Sentaro, who taught her how to ride a bike, Skuld became determined to never quit and began to practice with her powers more, learning how to levitate small objects. When Sentaro was in danger, Skuld created a huge wave which saved him, although Urd, who was nearby, stated that it would have caused a huge flood if she hadn&#x27;t been there to help contain it. Skuld&#x27;s spells sometimes get out of control (which usually results in large waves of water), which Urd constantly teases her for. However, Urd states that losing control of a low level spell is proof of the depths of her true power.

Skuld&#x27;s latent power is addressed once more in Chapter 256 of the manga in a one on one mecha battle with the demon Mokkurkalfi. Belldandy explains that Skuld uses a type of magic called Direct Manipulation, and has been able to unconsciously access this ability since the very beginning. This magic presents itself through Skuld&#x27;s hands, and it is because of this magic that Skuld is always able to build machines even out of mundane objects. It is explained that Skuld&#x27;s magical field is always active because of this, even if she&#x27;s unconsciously aware of this fact. However, because Skuld has a low capacity her powers are restricted to building machines. Belldandy states that if Skuld were to hone this power, she could potentially be the strongest of the three sisters in the future. Urd on the other hand pleas to Keiichi to keep this a secret because she does not want her sister to get a big ego.

She travels to Earth after Belldandy&#x27;s proximity to Keiichi started creating an increasing number of bugs in Heaven&#x27;s supercomputer Yggdrasil. At least that was her official excuse, as she believed Belldandy was living with Keiichi against her will. She tried to convince Belldandy to return to Heaven to resolve the bug problem and at the same time with the ulterior motive of alleviating her loneliness. After realizing that Belldandy&#x27;s relationship with Keiichi was not going to end any time soon, Skuld decides to stay on Earth and act as Belldandy&#x27;s unofficial chaperone.

Skuld regularly clashes with her sister Urd, particularly when it comes to Belldandy&#x27;s relationship with Keiichi. However, the two sisters do love each other and will work together to solve a problem or stave off a mutual threat.

In the manga, Skuld&#x27;s engineering skills made her a minor celebrity around the Nekomi Tech campus, especially when she engaged in a &quot;Robot Wars&quot; competition with Keiichi&#x27;s sister Megumi Morisato. Keiichi&#x27;s friends are aware of Skuld&#x27;s existence and of her living with Keiichi and Belldandy; however, they do not know of her &quot;goddess&quot; status.

Unlike Belldandy and Urd, Skuld did not possess an angel when she was first introduced. Later on in the manga she found an angel egg in Urd&#x27;s room and accidentally swallowed it (whilst in the process of performing the classic little kid rebellion of touching something that was specifically marked as &quot;hands off!&quot;, namely the egg.), leading to the birth of Noble Scarlet. Because of Skuld&#x27;s lack of magic power, Noble Scarlet lacked the full unequivocal obedience an angel must have for her goddess. After interfering with Skuld&#x27;s budding relationship with Sentaro, Noble Scarlet returned to her egg form as per Skuld&#x27;s instruction (&quot;If you do that again, you&#x27;ll have to go back to your egg.&quot;). Urd promised that they&#x27;d meet again when Skuld gained enough power. In the meanwhile, Skuld wore the angel egg mounted on a necklace. Some time later, Skuld threw together a device with the intent of boosting her powers to the point that she could control and regain Noble Scarlet. When said gadget went out of control, Urd used her angel to save Skuld, thus unlocking World Of Elegance, and also revealing the back story as to why Urd couldn&#x27;t initially call her and why she had Scarlet&#x27;s egg in the first place - Urd wanted to &quot;try again&quot; since she had believed that she had sealed her angel away forever at its own birth. Later on the promise is fulfilled when Skuld calls forth Noble Scarlet in the fight against the Angel Eater. At this time, Skuld had gained the necessary power to control the angel and the only thing lacking was the desire to truly be with her.

===Debugging mallet===
Skuld generally carries her debugging mallet, used against Yggdrasil bugs (eight-legged rabbit-looking entities), as a precaution wherever she goes. Yggdrasil bugs can cause adverse effects to the surrounding area such as making it snow on a single house and causing the holy steed Sleipnir to temporarily show up in the temple, and the only way to counter such effects is by debugging. One way to debug is through squishing the bugs with a mallet. Other ways include various gadgets Skuld has built, such as the Mr. Bug Zapper.

== Personality ==
Perper and Cornog described Skuld as being &quot;&quot;somewhat bratty&quot; - a view that is in keeping with her behavior throughout the series. Skuld started as very defensive of Belldandy and interpreted anyone having any kind of intimate relationship with her as an attempt to steal Belldandy from her. She and Banpei repeatedly placed restrictions to limit Belldandy&#x27;s and Keiichi&#x27;s relationship. For a brief while it was also implied that Skuld had a crush on Keiichi; the second special episode of the first TV series (where she&#x27;s grown up for a day) explored this angle by placing Skuld and Keiichi in situations where they appear as a couple. Over time ground rules have been worked out and there haven&#x27;t been any recent episodes of relationship restriction enforcement.

Skuld also doesn&#x27;t appear to get along with her oldest sister, Urd perhaps because Urd is somewhat the opposite of Belldandy. However, it is slowly revealed that Skuld and Urd share a complex love-hate relationship, and so even when they are gambling violently over rights to the television, it is obvious that they are &quot;the very best of friends.&quot;

Being the inventor that she is, Skuld loves anything technical, but hates inefficiencies, flawed creations, and useless mechanics. This is Urd&#x27;s favorite way of punishing Skuld whenever she touches or breaks any of Urd&#x27;s potions and such, by making her create gadgets that do absolutely nothing useful. She has a tendency to get carried away fixing or improving anything she sees inefficient. Even when her original intention is to destroy it, she always ends up with something much better (usually more destructive). Most of her inventions, more often than not, have extra functions that make situations more complicated, including a self-destruct device in almost everything (including her Robot Wars robot...).

Like Chihiro Fujimi, Skuld has a weakness for cute things, albeit a different kind of cute. She squeals at things like plushies, cute animals and cute stuff, but also mechanical equipment and tools.

<text>The springbok or springbuck (Antidorcas marsupialis) is an antelope found mainly in south and southwest Africa. The sole member of the genus &quot;Antidorcas&quot;, this bovid was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780. Three subspecies are identified. A slender, long-legged antelope, the springbok reaches at the shoulder and weighs between . Both sexes have a pair of black, long horns that curve backwards. The springbok is characterised by a white face, a dark stripe running from the eyes to the mouth, a light brown coat marked by a reddish-brown stripe that runs from the upper foreleg to the buttocks across the flanks like the Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, and a white rump flap.

Active mainly at dawn and dusk, springbok form harems (mixed-sex herds). In earlier times, springbok of the Kalahari Desert and Karoo migrated in large numbers across the countryside, a practice known as &quot;trekbokking&quot;. A feature, peculiar but not unique, to the springbok is pronking, in which the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air, up to above the ground, in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. Primarily a browser, the springbok feeds on shrubs and succulents; this antelope can live without drinking water for years, meeting its requirements through eating succulent vegetation. Breeding takes place year-round, and peaks in the rainy season, when forage is most abundant. A single calf is born after a five- to six-month-long pregnancy; weaning occurs at nearly six months of age, and the calf leaves its mother a few months later.

Springbok inhabit the dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the springbok as a least concern species. No major threats to the long-term survival of the species are known; the springbok, in fact, is one of the few antelope species considered to have an expanding population. They are popular game animals, and are valued for their meat and skin. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa.

== Etymology ==
The common name &quot;springbok&quot;, first recorded in 1775, comes from the Afrikaans words (&quot;jump&quot;) and (&quot;antelope&quot; or &quot;goat&quot;). The scientific name of the springbok is &quot;Antidorcas marsupialis&quot;. is Greek for &quot;opposite&quot;, and for &quot;gazelle&quot; – identifying the animal as not a gazelle. The specific epithet &quot;marsupialis&quot; comes from the Latin (&quot;pocket&quot;), and refers to a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the midline of the back from the tail, which distinguishes the springbok from true gazelles.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The springbok, in the family Bovidae, was first described by the German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780, who assigned the genus &quot;Antilope&quot; (blackbuck) to the springbok. In 1845, Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall placed the springbok as the sole living member of the genus &quot;Antidorcas&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies of &quot;Antidorcas marsupialis&quot; are recognised:
* &quot;A. m. angolensis&quot; – Occurs in Benguela and Moçâmedes (southwestern Angola).
* &quot;A. m. hofmeyri&quot; – Occurs in Berseba and Great Namaqualand (southwestern Africa). Its range lies north of the Orange River, stretching from Upington and Sandfontein through Botswana to Namibia.
* &quot;A. m. marsupialis&quot; – Its range lies south of the Orange River, extending from the northeastern Cape of Good Hope to the Free State and Kimberley.

===Evolution===
Fossil springbok are known from the Pliocene; the antelope appears to have evolved about three million years ago from a gazelle-like ancestor. Three fossil species of &quot;Antidorcas&quot; have been identified, in addition to the extant form, and appear to have been widespread across Africa. Two of these, &quot;A. bondi&quot; and &quot;A. australis&quot;, became extinct around 7,000 years ago (early Holocene). The third species, &quot;A. recki&quot;, probably gave rise to the extant form &quot;A. marsupialis&quot; during the Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. Fossils have been reported from Pliocene, Pleistocene, and Holocene sites in northern, southern, and eastern Africa. Fossils dating back to 80 and 100 thousand years ago have been excavated at Herolds Bay Cave (Western Cape Province, South Africa) and Florisbad (Free State), respectively.

== Description ==
The springbok is a slender antelope with long legs and neck. Both sexes reach at the shoulder with a head-and-body length typically between . The weights for both sexes range between . The tail, long, ends in a short, black tuft. Major differences in the size and weight of the subspecies are seen. A study tabulated average body measurements for the three subspecies. &quot;A. m. angolensis&quot; males stand tall at the shoulder, while females are tall. The males weigh around , while the females weigh . &quot;A. m. hofmeyri&quot; is the largest subspecies; males are nearly tall, and the notably shorter females are tall. The males, weighing , are heavier than females, that weigh . However, &quot;A. m. marsupialis&quot; is the smallest subspecies; males are tall and females tall. Average weight of males is , while for females it is . Another study showed a strong correlation between the availability of winter dietary protein and the body mass.

Dark stripes extend across the white face, from the corner of the eyes to the mouth. A dark patch marks the forehead. In juveniles, the stripes and the patch are light brown. The ears, narrow and pointed, measure . Typically light brown, the springbok has a dark reddish-brown band running horizontally from the upper foreleg to the edge of the buttocks, separating the dark back from the white underbelly. The tail (except the terminal black tuft), buttocks, the insides of the legs and the rump are all white. Two other varieties – pure black and pure white forms – are artificially selected in some South African ranches. Though born with a deep black sheen, adult black springbok are two shades of chocolate-brown and develop a white marking on the face as they mature. White springbok, as the name suggests, are predominantly white with a light tan stripe on the flanks.
The three subspecies also differ in their colour. &quot;A. m. angolensis&quot; has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. &quot;A. m. hofmeyri&quot; is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond the level of the eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. &quot;A. m. marsupialis&quot; is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks is deep brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.

The skin along the middle of the dorsal side is folded in, and covered with white hair erected by arrector pili muscles (located between hair follicles). This white hair is almost fully concealed by the surrounding brown hairs until the fold opens up, and this is a major feature distinguishing this antelope from gazelles. Springbok differ from gazelles in several other ways; for instance, springbok have two premolars on both sides of either jaw, rather than the three observed in gazelles. This gives a total of 28 teeth in the springbok, rather than 32 of gazelles. Other points of difference include a longer, broader, and rigid bridge to the nose and more muscular cheeks in springbok, and differences in the structure of the horns.

Both sexes have black horns, about long, that are straight at the base and then curve backward. In &quot;A. m. marsupialis&quot;, females have thinner horns than males; the horns of females are only 60 to 70% as long as those of males. Horns have a girth of at the base; this thins to towards the tip. In the other two subspecies, horns of both sexes are nearly similar. The spoor, narrow and sharp, is long.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

Springbok are mainly active around dawn and dusk. Activity is influenced by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest in the shade of trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler.

The social structure of the springbok is similar to that of Thomson&#x27;s gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.

A study of vigilance behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on the borders of herds tend to be more cautious, and vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they cannot be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.
During the rut, males establish territories, ranging from , which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight for access to females, which they do by twisting and levering at each other with their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.

In earlier times, when large populations of springbok roamed the Kalahari Desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long that could take several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as &quot;trekbokking&quot; in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. &quot;Trekbokking&quot; is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.

Springbok often go into bouts of repeated high leaps of up to into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans &quot;pronk&quot;, &quot;to show off&quot;) or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking is that it is a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display.

Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at . They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Cheetahs, lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, wild dogs, caracals, crocodiles and pythons are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, Verreaux&#x27;s Eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.

=== Parasites ===
A 2012 study on the effects of rainfall patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health toward the end of the rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (&quot;Haemonchus&quot;, &quot;Longistrongylus&quot; and &quot;Trichostrongylus&quot;), ixodid ticks (&quot;Rhipicephalus&quot; species), lice (&quot;Damalinia&quot; and &quot;Linognathus&quot; species). &quot;Eimeria&quot; species mainly affect juveniles.

=== Diet ===
Springbok are primarily browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as &quot;Lampranthus&quot; species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as &quot;Themeda triandra&quot;. Springbok can meet their water needs from the food they eat, and are able to survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.

=== Reproduction ===

Springbok mate year-round, though females are more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to conceive at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female&#x27;s perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.

Gestation lasts five to six months, after which a single calf (or rarely twins) is born. Most births take place in the spring (October to November), prior to the onset of the rainy season. The infant weighs . The female keeps her calf hidden in cover while she is away. Mother and calf rejoin the herd about three to four weeks after parturition; the young are weaned at five or six months. When the mother gives birth again, the previous offspring, now 6 to 12 months old, deserts her to join herds of adult springbok. Thus, a female can calve twice a year, and even thrice if one calf dies. Springbok live for up to 10 years in the wild.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Springbok inhabit the dry areas of south and southwestern Africa. Their range extends from northwestern South Africa through the Kalahari Desert into Namibia and Botswana. The Transvaal marks the eastern limit of the range, from where it extends westward to the Atlantic and northward to southern Angola and Botswana. In Botswana, they mostly occur in the Kalahari Desert in the southwestern and central parts of the country. They are widespread across Namibia and the vast grasslands of the Free State and the shrublands of Karoo in South Africa; however, they are confined to the Namib Desert in Angola.

The historic range of the springbok stretched across the dry grasslands, bushlands, and shrublands of south-western and southern Africa; springbok migrated sporadically in southern parts of the range. These migrations are rarely seen nowadays, but seasonal congregations can still be observed in preferred areas of short vegetation, such as the Kalahari Desert.

== Threats and conservation ==
The springbok has been classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List. No major threats to the long-term survival of the species are known. The springbok is one of the few antelope species with a positive population trend.

Springbok occur in several protected areas across their range: Makgadikgadi and Nxai National Park (Botswana); Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park between Botswana and South Africa; Etosha National Park and Namib-Naukluft Park (Namibia); Mokala and Karoo National Parks and a number of provincial reserves in South Africa. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the springbok population in South Africa at more than 670,000, noting that it might be an underestimate. However, estimates for Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Transvaal, Karoo, and the Free State (which gave a total population estimate of nearly 2,000,000 – 2,500,000 animals in southern Africa), were in complete disagreement with East&#x27;s estimate. Springbok are under active management in several private lands. Small populations have been introduced into private lands and provincial areas of KwaZulu-Natal.

== Relationship with humans ==

Springbok are hunted as game throughout Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa because of their attractive coats; they are common hunting targets due to their large numbers and the ease with which they can be supported on farmlands. The export of springbok skins, mainly from Namibia and South Africa, is a booming industry; these skins serve as taxidermy models. The meat is a prized fare, and is readily available in South African supermarkets. As of 2011, the springbok, the gemsbok, and the greater kudu collectively account for around two-thirds of the game meat production from Namibian farmlands; nearly of the springbok meat is exported as mechanically deboned meat to overseas markets.

The latissimus dorsi muscle of the springbok comprises 1.1–1.3% ash, 1.3–3.5% fat, 72–75% moisture and 18–22% protein. Stearic acid is the main fatty acid, accounting for 24–27% of the fatty acids. The cholesterol content varies from per of meat. The pH of the meat increases if the springbok is under stress or cropping is done improperly; consequently, the quality deteriorates and the colour darkens. The meat might be adversely affected if the animal is killed by shooting. The meat may be consumed raw or used in prepared dishes. Biltong can be prepared by preserving the raw meat with vinegar, spices, and table salt, without fermentation, followed by drying. Springbok meat may also be used in preparing salami; a study found that the flavour of this salami is better than mutton salami, and feels oilier than salami of beef, horse meat, or mutton.

The springbok has been a national symbol of South Africa since the white minority rule in the 20th century. It was adopted as a nickname or mascot by several South African sports teams, most famously by the national rugby union team. Also, the winged springbok served as the logo of South African Airways from 1934 to 1997. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa. Even after the decline of apartheid, Nelson Mandela intervened to keep the name of the animal for the reconciliation of rugby fans, the majority of whom were whites. The springbok is featured on the reverse of the South African Krugerrand coin.

The cap badge of The Royal Canadian Dragoons has featured a springbok since 1913, a reference to the unit&#x27;s involvement in the Second Boer War.

<doc id="28582" wikidata="Q51670" url="?curid=28582" title="Song of Songs">
<text>The Song of Songs (), also called the Canticle of Canticles or the Song of Solomon, is a biblical poem, one of the five (&quot;scrolls&quot;) in the (&#x27;writings&#x27;), the last section of the Tanakh. Unlike most books in the Hebrew Bible, it does not focus on laws, covenants, or divine worship, but instead is erotic poetry, in which lovers express passionate desire, exchange compliments, and invite one another to enjoy.

Modern scholarship tends to hold that the lovers in the Song are unmarried, which accords with its near ancient Near East context. The women of Jerusalem form a chorus to the lovers, functioning as an audience whose participation in the lovers&#x27; erotic encounters facilitates the participation of the reader.

Marvin H. Pope described the Song as a celebration of sexual love, influenced by ancient fertility rituals, linked to death and liberation, and &quot;suggestive of orgiastic revelry.” Its authorship, date, and origins remain uncertain, with scholars debating its unity, structure, and possible influences from Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Greek love poetry.

In modern Judaism, the Song is read on the Sabbath during the Passover, which marks both the beginning of the grain-harvest and the commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt. Jewish tradition interprets it as an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel. In Christianity, it is viewed as an allegory of Christ and his bride, the Church.

== Structure ==
There is widespread consensus that, although the book has no plot, it does have what can be called a framework, as indicated by the links between its beginning and end. Beyond this, however, there appears to be little agreement: attempts to find a chiastic structure have not found acceptance, and analyses dividing the book into units have employed various methods, yielding diverse conclusions. 

The following indicative schema is from Kugler and Hartin&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to The Bible&quot;:

* Introduction (1:1–6)
* Dialogue between the lovers (1:7–2:7)
* The woman recalls a visit from her lover (2:8–17)
* The woman addresses the daughters of Zion (3:1–5)
* Sighting a royal wedding procession (3:6–11)
* The man describes his lover&#x27;s beauty (4:1–5:1)
* The woman addresses the daughters of Jerusalem (5:2–6:4)
* The man describes his lover, who visits him (6:5–12)
* Observers describe the woman&#x27;s beauty (6:13–8:4)
* Appendix (8:5–14)

==Title==
The introduction calls the poem &quot;the song of songs&quot;, a phrase that follows an idiomatic construction commonly found in Scriptural Hebrew to indicate the object&#x27;s status as the greatest and most beautiful of its class (as in &quot;Holy of Holies&quot;). The work is also referred to as the &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, meaning the song &#x27;of&#x27;, &#x27;by&#x27;, &#x27;for&#x27;, or &#x27;[dedicated] to&#x27; Solomon.

== Summary ==
The poem proper begins with the woman&#x27;s expression of desire for her lover and her self-description to the &quot;daughters of Jerusalem&quot;: she insists on her sun-born blackness, likening it to the &quot;tents of Kedar&quot; (nomads) and the &quot;curtains of Solomon&quot;. A dialogue between the lovers follows: the woman asks the man to meet; he replies with a lightly teasing tone. The two compete in offering flattering compliments (&quot;my beloved is to me as a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En Gedi&quot;, &quot;an apple tree among the trees of the wood&quot;, &quot;a lily among brambles&quot;, while the bed they share is like a forest canopy). The section closes with the woman telling the daughters of Jerusalem not to stir up love such as hers until it is ready.

The woman recalls a visit from her lover in the springtime. She uses imagery from a shepherd&#x27;s life, and she says of her lover that &quot;he pastures his flock among the lilies&quot;.

The woman again addresses the daughters of Jerusalem, describing her fervent and ultimately successful search for her lover through the night-time streets of the city. When she finds him she takes him almost by force into the chamber in which she was conceived. She reveals that this is a dream, seen on her &quot;bed at night&quot;, and ends by again warning the daughters of Jerusalem &quot;not to stir up love until it is ready&quot;.

The next section reports a royal wedding procession. Solomon is mentioned by name, and the daughters of Jerusalem are invited to come out and see the spectacle.
The man describes his beloved: Her eyes are like doves, her hair is like a flock of goats, her teeth like shorn ewes, and so on from face to breasts. Place-names feature heavily: her neck is like the Tower of David, her smell like the scent of Lebanon. He hastens to summon his beloved, saying that he is ravished by even a single glance. The section becomes a &quot;garden poem&quot;, in which he describes her as a &quot;locked garden&quot; (usually taken to mean that she is chaste). The woman invites the man to enter the garden and taste the fruits. The man accepts the invitation, and a third party tells them to eat, drink, &quot;and be drunk with love&quot;.

The woman tells the daughters of Jerusalem of another dream. She was in her chamber when her lover knocked. She was slow to open, and when she did, he was gone. She searched through the streets again, but this time she failed to find him and the watchmen, who had helped her before, now beat her. She asks the daughters of Jerusalem to help her find him, and describes his physical good looks. Eventually, she admits her lover is in his garden, safe from harm, and committed to her as she is to him.

The man describes his beloved; the woman describes a rendezvous they have shared. (The last part is unclear and possibly corrupted.)

The people praise the beauty of the woman. The images are the same as those used elsewhere in the poem, but with an unusually dense use of place-names, e.g., pools of Hebron, gate of Bath-rabbim, tower of Damascus, etc. The man states his intention to enjoy the fruits of the woman&#x27;s garden. The woman invites him to a tryst in the fields. She once more warns the daughters of Jerusalem against waking love until it is ready.

The woman compares love to death and Sheol: love is as relentless and jealous as these two, and cannot be quenched by any force. She summons her lover, using the language used before: he should come &quot;like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountain of spices&quot;.

== Composition ==
The poem seems to be rooted in festive performance, and connections have been proposed with the &quot;sacred marriage&quot; of Ishtar and Tammuz. It offers no clue to its author or to the date, place, or circumstances of its composition. The superscription states that it is &quot;Solomon&#x27;s&quot;, but even if this is meant to identify the author, it cannot be read as strictly as a similar modern statement. The most reliable evidence for its date is its language: Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew after the end of the Babylonian exile in the late 6th century BCE, and the evidence of vocabulary, morphology, idiom and syntax clearly point to a late date, centuries after King Solomon to whom it is traditionally attributed. It has parallels with Mesopotamian and Egyptian love poetry from the first half of the 1st millennium, and with the pastoral idylls of Theocritus, a Greek poet who wrote in the first half of the 3rd century BCE; as a result of these conflicting signs, speculation ranges from the 10th to the 2nd centuries BCE, with the language supporting a date around the 3rd century. Other scholars are more skeptical about the idea that the language demands a post-exilic date.

Debate continues on the unity or disunity of the book. Those who see it as an anthology or collection point to the abrupt shifts of scene, speaker, subject matter and mood, and the lack of obvious structure or narrative. Those who hold it to be a single poem point out that it has no internal signs of composite origins, and view the repetitions and similarities among its parts as evidence of unity. Some claim to find a conscious artistic design underlying it, but there is no agreement among them on what this might be. The question, therefore, remains unresolved.

== Genre ==

The consensus among contemporary scholars of the Bible is that the Song of Songs is an erotic poem, and not an elaborate metaphor.

In his commentary for the Anchor Bible Series, Marvin H. Pope quotes scholars who believe that the Song described a fertility cult liturgy, rooted in the fertility cults of the ancient Near Eastern cultures of Mesopotamia and Canaan, as well as their sacred marriage rites and funeral feasts.

J. Cheryl Exum wrote: &quot;The erotic desire of its protagonists, everywhere evident in the Song, leads me, in conclusion, to the Song&#x27;s unique contribution to the conceptualization of love in the Bible: its romantic vision of love&quot;.

The historian and rabbi Shaye J. D. Cohen summarises:

Several scholars have also argued that, alongside its condition as love poetry, the Song of Songs also shares a number of features with Wisdom literature. For instance, Jennifer L. Andruska argues that the Song employs a number of literary conventions typical of this didactic literature and that it combines features of both ancient Near Eastern love song and wisdom genres to produce a wisdom literature about romantic love, instructing readers to pursue what she describes as a particular type of &#x27;wise love&#x27; relationship, modelled by the lovers of the poem. Likewise, Katharine J. Dell notes a number of Wisdom motifs in the Song such as parallels between the lovers and the advices and conduct of Woman Wisdom and the Loose Woman of Proverbs, among others.

== Canonisation and interpretation ==

=== Judaism ===

The Song was accepted into the Jewish canon of scripture in the 2nd century CE, after a period of controversy in the 1st century. This period of controversy was a result of many rabbis seeing this text as merely &quot;secular love poetry, a collection of love songs gathered around a single theme&quot;, and thus not worthy of canonization. In fact, &quot;there is a tradition that even this book was considered as one to be excluded.&quot; It was accepted as canonical because of its supposed authorship by Solomon and based on an allegorical reading where the subject matter was taken to be not sexual desire but God&#x27;s love for Israel. For instance, the famed first and second century Rabbi Akiva forbade the use of the Song of Songs in popular celebrations. He reportedly said, &quot;He who sings the Song of Songs in wine taverns, treating it as if it were a vulgar song, forfeits his share in the world to come&quot;. However, Rabbi Akiva famously defended the canonicity of the Song of Songs, reportedly saying when the question came up of whether it should be considered a defiling work, &quot;God forbid! [...] For all of eternity in its entirety is not as worthy as the day on which Song of Songs was given to Israel, for all the Writings are holy, but Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies.&quot;

Other rabbinic scholars who have employed allegorical exegesis in explaining the meaning of Song of Songs are Tobiah ben Eliezer, author of &quot;Lekach Tov&quot;, and Zechariah ha-Rofé, author of &quot;Midrash ha-Hefez&quot;. The French rabbi Rashi did not believe the Song of Songs to be an erotic poem. 

Song of Songs is one of the overtly mystical Biblical texts for the Kabbalah, which gave an esoteric interpretation on all the Hebrew Bible. Following the dissemination of the Zohar in the 13th century, Jewish mysticism took on a metaphorically anthropomorphic erotic element, and Song of Songs is an example of this. In Zoharic Kabbalah, God is represented by a system of ten sephirot emanations, each symbolizing a different attribute of God, comprising both male and female. The Shechina (indwelling Divine presence) was identified with the feminine sephira Malchut, the vessel of Kingship. This symbolizes the Jewish people, and in the body, the female form, identified with the woman in Song of Songs. Her beloved was identified with the male sephira Tiferet, the &quot;Holy One Blessed be He&quot;, a central principle in the beneficent heavenly flow of divine emotion. In the body, this represents the male torso, uniting through the sephira Yesod of the male sign of the covenant organ of procreation.

Through beneficent deeds and Jewish observance, the Jewish people restore cosmic harmony in the divine realm, healing the exile of the Shechina with God&#x27;s transcendence, revealing the essential unity of God. This elevation of the world is aroused from above on the Sabbath, a foretaste of the redeemed purpose of Creation. The text thus became a description, depending on the aspect, of the creation of the world, the passage of &quot;Shabbat&quot;, the covenant with Israel, and the coming of the Messianic age. &quot;Lecha Dodi&quot;, a 16th-century liturgical song with strong Kabbalistic symbolism, contains many passages, including its opening two words, taken directly from Song of Songs.

In modern Judaism, certain verses from the Song are read on Shabbat eve or at Passover, which marks the beginning of the grain harvest as well as commemorating the Exodus from Egypt, to symbolize the love between the Jewish people and their God. Jewish tradition reads it as an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel. The entire Song of Songs in its original Hebrew is read in synagogues during the intermediate days of Passover. It is often read from a scroll similar to a Torah scroll in style. It is also read in its entirety by some at the end of the Passover Seder and is usually printed in most Hagadahs. Some Jews have the custom to recite the entire book prior to the onset of the Jewish Sabbath.

=== Christianity ===
The literal subject of the Song of Songs is love and sexual longing between a man and a woman, and it has little (or nothing) to say about the relationship of God and man; in order to find such a meaning it was necessary to turn to allegory, treating the love that the Song celebrates as an analogy for the love between God and Church. The Christian church&#x27;s interpretation of the Song as evidence of God&#x27;s love for his people, both collectively and individually, began with Origen. Saint Gregory of Nyssa wrote fifteen &quot;Homilies on the Song of Songs&quot;, which are considered the pinnacle of his biblical exegesis. In them, he compares the bride to the soul and the invisible groom to God: the finite soul is incessantly reaching out towards the infinite God and remains continually disappointed in this life due to the failure to achieve ecstatic union with the beloved, a vision which enraptures and can be achieved fully and perfectly only in life after death. Similarly, following the allegoric interpretation of Ambrose of Milan, Saint Augustine of Hippo stated that the Song of Songs represents the wedding between Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church, pure and virgin, within an ascetic context.

Over the centuries the emphases of interpretation shifted, first reading the Song as a depiction of the love between Christ and Church, the 11th century adding a moral element, and the 12th century understanding of the Bride as the Virgin Mary, with each new reading absorbing rather than simply replacing earlier ones, so that the commentary became ever more complex. These theological themes are not found explicitly in the poem, but they come from a theological reading. Nevertheless, what is notable about this approach is the way it leads to conclusions not found in the overtly theological books of the Bible. Those books reveal an abiding imbalance in the relationship between God and man, ranging from slight to enormous; but reading Songs as a theological metaphor produces quite a different outcome, one in which the two partners are equals, bound in a committed relationship.

In modern times the poem has attracted the attention of feminist biblical critics, with Phyllis Trible&#x27;s foundational &quot;Depatriarchalizing in Biblical Interpretation&quot; treating it as an exemplary text, and the Feminist Companion to the Bible series edited by Athalya Brenner and Carole Fontaine devoting two volumes to it.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints specifically rejects the Song of Solomon as inspired scripture.

=== Islam ===
Several Islamic apologists contend that the word in Song of Songs 5:16 mentions Muhammad. Whereas most translators will render the first words of that verse in terms such as &quot;His mouth is most sweet, he is altogether lovely (&quot;mahamaddim&quot;).&quot; In his book &quot;Demystifying Islam&quot;, Muslim apologist Harris Zafar argues that the last word (), with the plural suffix &quot;-im&quot; (which is occasionally used to indicate intensity, and is normally understood to do so for both of the adjectives in this verse), expressing respect and greatness (as the plural form seems to do in the common Hebrew appellation of God, &quot;Elohim&quot; (&quot;pl. maiestatus&quot;)), should be translated &quot;Muhammad&quot;, for the translation &quot;His mouth is most sweet; he is Muhammad&quot;. Some Christian apologists, however, have countered this claim.

<text>Joseph Thomas Sheridan Le Fanu (; 28 August 1814 – 7 February 1873) was an Irish writer of Gothic tales, mystery novels, and horror fiction. He was a leading ghost story writer of his time, central to the development of the genre in the Victorian era. M. R. James described Le Fanu as, &quot;absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories&quot;. Three of his best-known works are the locked-room mystery &quot;Uncle Silas&quot;, the 1872 Gothic vampire novella &quot;Carmilla&quot;, and the historical novel &quot;The House by the Churchyard&quot;.

==Early life==
Sheridan Le Fanu was born at 45 Lower Dominick Street, Dublin, into a literary family of Huguenot, Irish and English descent. He had an elder sister, Catherine Frances, and a younger brother, William Richard. His parents were Thomas Philip Le Fanu and Emma Lucretia Dobbin. 
Both his grandmother Alicia Sheridan Le Fanu and his great-uncle Richard Brinsley Sheridan were playwrights (his niece Rhoda Broughton would become a successful novelist), and his mother was also a writer, producing a biography of Charles Orpen. Within a year of his birth, his family moved to the Royal Hibernian Military School in the Phoenix Park, where his father, a Church of Ireland clergyman, was appointed to the chaplaincy of the establishment. The Phoenix Park and the adjacent village and parish church of Chapelizod would appear in Le Fanu&#x27;s later stories.
In 1826 the family moved to Abington, County Limerick, where Le Fanu&#x27;s father Thomas took up his second rectorship in Ireland. Although he had a tutor, who, according to his brother William, taught them nothing and was finally dismissed in disgrace, Le Fanu used his father&#x27;s library to educate himself. By the age of fifteen, Joseph was writing poetry which he shared with his mother and siblings but never with his father. His father was a stern Protestant churchman and raised his family in an almost Calvinist tradition.

In 1832 the disorders of the Tithe War (1831–36) affected the region. There were about six thousand Catholics in the parish of Abington and only a few dozen members of the Church of Ireland. (In bad weather the Dean cancelled Sunday services because so few parishioners would attend.) However, the government compelled all farmers, including Catholics, to pay tithes for the upkeep of the Protestant church. The following year the family moved back temporarily to Dublin, to Williamstown Avenue in the southern suburb of Blackrock, where Thomas was to work on a Government commission.

== Later life ==
Although Thomas Le Fanu tried to live as though he were well-off, the family was in constant financial difficulty. Thomas took the rectorships in the south of Ireland for the money, as they provided a decent living through tithes. However, from 1830, as the result of agitation against the tithes, this income began to fall, and it ceased entirely two years later. In 1838 the government instituted a scheme of paying rectors a fixed sum, but in the interim, the Dean had little besides rent on some small properties he had inherited. In 1833 Thomas had to borrow £100 from his cousin Captain Dobbins (who himself ended up in the debtors&#x27; prison a few years later) to visit his dying sister in Bath, who was also deeply in debt over her medical bills. At his death, Thomas had almost nothing to leave to his sons, and the family had to sell his library to pay off some of his debts. His widow went to stay with the younger son, William.

Sheridan Le Fanu studied law at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected Auditor of the College Historical Society. Under a system peculiar to Ireland he did not have to live in Dublin to attend lectures, but could study at home and take examinations at the university when necessary. He was called to the bar in 1839, but he never practised and soon abandoned law for journalism. In 1838 he began contributing stories to the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, including his first ghost story, entitled &quot;The Ghost and the Bone-Setter&quot; (1838). He became the owner of several newspapers from 1840, including the &quot;Dublin Evening Mail&quot; and the &quot;Warder&quot;.

On 18 December 1844, Le Fanu married Susanna Bennett, the daughter of a leading Dublin barrister, George Bennett, and granddaughter of John Bennett, a justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. Future Home Rule League MP Isaac Butt was a witness. The couple then travelled to his parents&#x27; home in Abington for Christmas. They took a house in Warrington Place near the Grand Canal in Dublin. Their first child, Eleanor, was born in 1845, followed by Emma in 1846, Thomas in 1847 and George in 1854.

In 1847 Le Fanu supported John Mitchel and Thomas Francis Meagher in their campaign against the indifference of the government to the Irish Famine. Others involved in the campaign included Samuel Ferguson and Isaac Butt. Butt wrote a forty-page analysis of the national disaster for the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; in 1847. His support cost him the nomination as Tory MP for County Carlow in 1852.

In 1856 the family moved from Warrington Place to the house of Susanna&#x27;s parents at 18 Merrion Square (later number 70, the office of the Irish Arts Council). Her parents retired to live in England. Le Fanu never owned the house, but rented it from his brother-in-law for £22 per annum, equivalent in 2023 to about £2,000 (which he failed to pay in full).

His personal life also became difficult at this time, as his wife suffered from increasing neurotic symptoms. She had a crisis of faith and attended religious services at the nearby St. Stephen&#x27;s Church. She also discussed religion with William, Le Fanu&#x27;s younger brother, as Le Fanu had apparently stopped attending services. She suffered from anxiety after the deaths of several close relatives, including her father two years before, which may have led to marital problems.

In April 1858 she suffered an &quot;hysterical attack&quot; and died the following day in unclear circumstances. She was buried in the Bennett family vault in Mount Jerome Cemetery beside her father and brothers. The anguish of Le Fanu&#x27;s diaries suggests that he felt guilt as well as loss. From then on he did not write any fiction until the death of his mother in 1861. He turned to his cousin Lady Gifford for advice and encouragement, and she remained a close correspondent until her death at the end of the decade.

In 1861 he became the editor and proprietor of the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, and he began to take advantage of double publication, first serialising in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, then revising for the English market. He published both &quot;The House by the Churchyard&quot; and &quot;Wylder&#x27;s Hand&quot; in this way. After lukewarm reviews of the former novel, set in the Phoenix Park area of Dublin, Le Fanu signed a contract with Richard Bentley, his London publisher, which specified that future novels be stories &quot;of an English subject and of modern times&quot;, a step Bentley thought necessary for Le Fanu to satisfy the English audience. Le Fanu succeeded in this aim in 1864, with the publication of &quot;Uncle Silas&quot;, which he set in Derbyshire. In his last short stories, however, Le Fanu returned to Irish folklore as an inspiration and encouraged his friend Patrick Kennedy to contribute folklore to the &quot;D.U.M.&quot;

Le Fanu died of a heart attack in his native Dublin on 7 February 1873, at the age of 58. According to Russell Kirk, in his essay &quot;A Cautionary Note on the Ghostly Tale&quot; in &quot;The Surly Sullen Bell&quot;, Le Fanu &quot;is believed to have literally died of fright&quot;; but Kirk does not give the circumstances. Today there is a road and a park in Ballyfermot, near his childhood home in southwest Dublin, named after him.

==Work==

Le Fanu worked in many genres but remains best known for his horror fiction. He was a meticulous craftsman and frequently reworked plots and ideas from his earlier writing in subsequent pieces. Many of his novels, for example, are expansions and refinements of earlier short stories. He specialised in tone and effect rather than &quot;shock horror&quot; and liked to leave important details unexplained and mysterious. He avoided overt supernatural effects: in most of his major works, the supernatural is strongly implied but a &quot;natural&quot; explanation is also possible. The demonic monkey in &quot;Green Tea&quot; could be a delusion of the story&#x27;s protagonist, who is the only person to see it; in &quot;The Familiar&quot;, Captain Barton&#x27;s death seems to be supernatural but is not actually witnessed, and the ghostly owl may be a real bird. This technique influenced later horror artists, both in print and on film (see, for example, the film producer Val Lewton&#x27;s principle of &quot;indirect horror&quot;). Though other writers have since chosen less subtle techniques, Le Fanu&#x27;s finest tales, such as the vampire novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; and the short story &quot;Schalken the Painter&quot;, remain some of the most powerful in the genre. He had an enormous influence on one of the 20th century&#x27;s most important ghost story writers, M. R. James, and although his work fell out of favour in the early part of the 20th century, towards the end of the century interest in his work increased and remains comparatively strong.

===&quot;The Purcell Papers&quot;===
His earliest twelve short stories, written between 1838 and 1840, purport to be the literary remains of an 18th-century Catholic priest called Father Purcell. They were published in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; and were later collected as &quot;The Purcell Papers&quot; (1880). They are mostly set in Ireland and include some classic stories of Gothic horror, with gloomy castles, supernatural visitations from beyond the grave, madness, and suicide. Also apparent are nostalgia and sadness for the dispossessed Catholic aristocracy of Ireland, whose ruined castles stand as a mute witness to this history. Some of the stories still often appear in anthologies:
# &quot;The Ghost and the Bonesetter&quot; (January 1838), his first-published, jocular story
# &quot;The Fortunes of Sir Robert Ardagh&quot; (March 1838), an enigmatic story which partially involves a Faustian pact and is set in the Gothic of a castle in rural Ireland
# &quot;The Last Heir of Castle Connor&quot; (June 1838), a non-supernatural tale, exploring the decline and expropriation of the ancient Catholic gentry of Ireland under the Protestant Ascendancy
# &quot;The Drunkard&#x27;s Dream&quot; (August 1838), a haunting vision of Hell
# &quot;Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess&quot; (November 1838), an early version of his later novel &quot;Uncle Silas&quot;
# &quot;The Bridal of Carrigvarah&quot; (April 1839)
# &quot;Strange Event in the Life of Schalken the Painter&quot; (May 1839), a disturbing version of the demon lover motif. This tale was inspired by the atmospheric candlelit scenes of the 17th-century Dutch painter Godfried Schalcken, who is the model for the story&#x27;s protagonist. M. R. James stated that &quot;Schalken&#x27; conforms more strictly to my own ideals. It is indeed one of the best of Le Fanu&#x27;s good things.&quot; It was adapted and broadcast for television as &quot;Schalcken the Painter&quot; by the BBC for Christmas 1979, starring Jeremy Clyde and John Justin.
# &quot;Scraps of Hibernian Ballads&quot; (June 1839)
# &quot;Jim Sulivan&#x27;s Adventures in the Great Snow&quot; (July 1839)
# &quot;A Chapter in the History of a Tyrone Family&quot; (October 1839), which may have influenced Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. This story was later reworked and expanded by Le Fanu as &quot;The Wyvern Mystery&quot; (1869).
# &quot;An Adventure of Hardress Fitzgerald, a Royalist Captain&quot; (February 1840)
# &quot;The Quare Gander&quot; (October 1840)

Revised versions of &quot;Irish Countess&quot; (as &quot;The Murdered Cousin&quot;) and &quot;Schalken&quot; were reprinted in Le Fanu&#x27;s first collection of short stories, the very rare &quot;Ghost Stories and Tales of Mystery&quot; (1851).

===&quot;Spalatro&quot;===
An anonymous novella &quot;Spalatro: From the Notes of Fra Giacomo&quot;, published in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; in 1843, was added to the Le Fanu canon as late as 1980, being recognised as Le Fanu&#x27;s work by W. J. McCormack in his biography of that year. &quot;Spalatro&quot; has a typically Gothic Italian setting, featuring a bandit as the hero, as in Ann Radcliffe (whose 1797 novel &quot;The Italian&quot; includes a repentant minor villain of the same name). More disturbing, however, is the hero Spalatro&#x27;s necrophiliac passion for an undead blood-drinking beauty, who seems to be a predecessor of Le Fanu&#x27;s later female vampire Carmilla. Like Carmilla, this undead femme fatale is not portrayed in an entirely negative way and attempts, but fails, to save the hero Spalatro from the eternal damnation that seems to be his destiny.

Le Fanu wrote this story after the death of his elder sister Catherine in March 1841. She had been ailing for about ten years, but her death came as a great shock to him.

===Historical fiction===
Le Fanu&#x27;s first novels were historical, &quot;à la&quot; Sir Walter Scott, though with an Irish setting. Like Scott, Le Fanu was sympathetic to the old Jacobite cause:
* &quot;The Cock and Anchor&quot; (1845), a story of old Dublin. It was reissued with slight alterations as &quot;Morley Court&quot; in 1873.
* &quot;The Fortunes of Colonel Torlogh O&#x27;Brien&quot; (1847)
* &quot;The House by the Churchyard&quot; (1863), the last of Le Fanu&#x27;s novels to be set in the past and, as mentioned above, the last with an Irish setting. It is noteworthy that here Le Fanu&#x27;s historical style is blended with his later Gothic style, influenced by his reading of the classic writers of that genre, such as Ann Radcliffe. This novel, later cited by James Joyce in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, is set in Chapelizod, where Le Fanu lived in his youth.

===Sensation novels===
Le Fanu published many novels in the contemporary sensation fiction style of Wilkie Collins and others:
* &quot;Wylder&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1864)
* &quot;Guy Deverell&quot; (1865)
* &quot;All in the Dark&quot; (1866), satirising spiritualism
* &quot;The Tenants of Malory&quot; (1867) 
* &quot;A Lost Name&quot; (1868), an adaptation of &quot;The Evil Guest&quot;
* &quot;Haunted Lives&quot; (1868)
* &quot;The Wyvern Mystery&quot; (1869)
* &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1871)
* &quot;The Rose and the Key&quot; (1871), which describes the horrors of the private lunatic asylum, a classic Gothic theme
* &quot;Willing to Die&quot; (1872)

===Major works===
His best-known works, still widely read today, are:
* &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; (1864), a macabre mystery novel and classic of gothic horror. It is a much-extended adaptation of his earlier short story &quot;Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess&quot;, with the setting changed from Ireland to England. A film version under the same name was made by Gainsborough Studios in 1947, and a remake entitled &quot;The Dark Angel&quot;, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole as the title character, was made in 1989.
* &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot; (1872), a collection of five short stories in the horror and mystery genres, presented as the posthumous papers of the occult detective Dr Hesselius:
:*&quot;Green Tea&quot;, a haunting narrative of a man plagued by a demonic monkey 
:*&quot;The Familiar&quot;, a slightly revised version of Le Fanu&#x27;s 1847 tale &quot;The Watcher&quot;. M. R. James considered this to be the best ghost story ever written.
:*&quot;Mr Justice Harbottle&quot;, another panorama of Hell and much loved by M. R. James
:*&quot;The Room in the Dragon Volant&quot;, not a ghost story but a notable mystery story that includes the theme of premature burial
:*&quot;Carmilla&quot;, a compelling tale of a female vampire, set in central Europe. It has inspired several films, including Hammer&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; (1970), Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; (1960), and Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1932). Scholars like A. Asbjørn Jøn have also noted the important place that &quot;Carmilla&quot; holds in shifting the portrayal of vampires in modern fiction.

===Other short-story collections===
* &quot;Chronicles of Golden Friars&quot; (1871), a collection of three novellas set in the imaginary English village of Golden Friars:
:* &quot;A Strange Adventure in the Life of Miss Laura Mildmay&quot;, incorporating the story &quot;Madam Crowl&#x27;s Ghost&quot;
:* &quot;The Haunted Baronet&quot;
:* &quot;The Bird of Passage&quot;
* &quot;The Watcher and Other Weird Stories&quot; (1894), another collection of short stories, published posthumously
* &quot;Madam Crowl&#x27;s Ghost and Other Tales of Mystery&quot; (1923), uncollected short stories gathered from their original magazine publications and edited by M. R. James:

:*&quot;Ghost Stories of Chapelizod&quot;, from the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, January 1851
:*&quot;Wicked Captain Walshawe, of Wauling&quot;, from the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, April 1864

:*&quot;The Vision of Tom Chuff&quot;, from &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, October 1870
:*&quot;Stories of Lough Guir&quot;, from &quot;All the Year Round&quot;, April 1870

:The publication of this book, which has often been reprinted, led to the revival in interest in Le Fanu, which has continued to this day.

==Legacy and influence==
In addition to M. R. James, several other writers have expressed strong admiration for Le Fanu&#x27;s fiction. E. F. Benson stated that Le Fanu&#x27;s stories &quot;Green Tea&quot;, &quot;The Familiar&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Justice Harbottle&quot; &quot;are instinct with an awfulness which custom cannot stale, and this quality is due, as in &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; [by Henry James], to Le Fanu&#x27;s admirably artistic methods in setting and narration&quot;. Benson added, &quot;[Le Fanu&#x27;s] best work is of the first rank, while as a &#x27;flesh-creeper&#x27; he is unrivalled. No one else has so sure a touch in mixing the mysterious atmosphere in which horror darkly breeds&quot;. Jack Sullivan has asserted that Le Fanu is &quot;one of the most important and innovative figures in the development of the ghost story&quot; and that Le Fanu&#x27;s work has had &quot;an incredible influence on the genre; [he is] regarded by M. R. James, E. F. Bleiler, and others as the most skilful writer of supernatural fiction in English.&quot;

Le Fanu&#x27;s work influenced several later writers. Most famously, &quot;Carmilla&quot; influenced Bram Stoker in the writing of &quot;Dracula&quot;. M. R. James&#x27; ghost fiction was influenced by Le Fanu&#x27;s work in the genre. Oliver Onions&#x27;s supernatural novel &quot;The Hand of Kornelius Voyt&quot; (1939) was inspired by Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Silas&quot;.

There is an extensive critical analysis of Le Fanu&#x27;s supernatural stories (particularly &quot;Green Tea&quot;, &quot;Schalken the Painter&quot;, and &quot;Carmilla&quot;) in Jack Sullivan&#x27;s book &quot;Elegant Nightmares: The English Ghost Story from Le Fanu to Blackwood&quot; (1978). Other books on Le Fanu include &quot;Wilkie Collins, Le Fanu and Others&quot; (1931) by S. M. Ellis, &quot;Sheridan Le Fanu&quot; (1951) by Nelson Browne, &quot;Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu&quot; (1971) by Michael H. Begnal, &quot;Sheridan Le Fanu&quot; (third edition, 1997) by W. J. McCormack, &quot;Le Fanu&#x27;s Gothic: The Rhetoric of Darkness&quot; (2004) by Victor Sage and &quot;Vision and Vacancy: The Fictions of J. S. Le Fanu&quot; (2007) by James Walton.

Le Fanu, his works, and his family background are explored in Gavin Selerie&#x27;s mixed prose/verse text &quot;Le Fanu&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (2006). Gary William Crawford&#x27;s &quot;J. Sheridan Le Fanu: A Bio-Bibliography&quot; (1995) is the first full bibliography. Crawford and Brian J. Showers&#x27;s &quot;Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu: A Concise Bibliography&quot; (2011) is a supplement to Crawford&#x27;s out-of-print 1995 bibliography. With Jim Rockhill and Brian J. Showers, Crawford has edited &quot;Reflections in a Glass Darkly: Essays on J. Sheridan Le Fanu&quot;. Jim Rockhill&#x27;s introductions to the three volumes of the Ash-Tree Press edition of Le Fanu&#x27;s short supernatural fiction (&quot;Schalken the Painter and Others&quot; [2002], &quot;The Haunted Baronet and Others&quot; [2003], &quot;Mr Justice Harbottle and Others&quot; [2005]) provide a perceptive account of Le Fanu&#x27;s life and work.

Julian Moynahan&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Irish: The Literary Imagination in a Hyphenated Culture&quot; (Princeton University Press, 1995) includes a study of Le Fanu&#x27;s mystery writing.

<doc id="28587" wikidata="Q7329062" url="?curid=28587" title="Star Chamber">
<text>The court of Star Chamber () was an English court that sat at the royal Palace of Westminster, from the late to the mid-17th century (), and was composed of privy counsellors and common-law judges, to supplement the judicial activities of the common-law and equity courts in civil and criminal matters. 

It was originally established to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against socially and politically prominent people sufficiently powerful that ordinary courts might hesitate to convict them of their crimes. It was mainly a court of appeal and could impose any penalty, except the death penalty, in its own right. At various times it had sub-courts for particular areas, notably for appeals of &quot;poor man&#x27;s causes&quot;.

The Chamber building itself was also sometimes used for other councils, courts, and committee meetings, which may cause confusion as to the role of the court of Star Chamber.

In modern times, legal or administrative bodies with strict, arbitrary rulings, no due process rights to those accused, and secretive proceedings are sometimes metaphorically called &quot;star chambers&quot;. However, the arbitrariness is considered mythological by at least one academic.

== Origin of the name ==
The first reference to the &quot;star chamber&quot; is in 1398, as the &quot;Sterred chambre&quot;; the more common form of the name appears in 1422 as &quot;le Sterne-chamere&quot;. Both forms recur throughout the fifteenth century, with &quot;Sterred Chambre&quot; last attested as appearing in the Supremacy of the Crown Act 1534 (establishing the English monarch as head of the Church in England). It was housed in a three-storied building with at least three rooms and kitchen. The origin of the name has usually been explained as first recorded by John Stow, writing in his &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598), who noted &quot;this place is called the Star Chamber, at the first all the roofe thereof was decked with images of starres gilted&quot;. Gold stars on a blue background were a common medieval decoration for ceilings in richly decorated rooms: the Star Chamber ceiling itself is still to be seen at Leasowe Castle, Wirral, and similar examples are in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua and elsewhere.

Alternatively, William Blackstone, a notable English jurist writing in 1769, speculated that the name had been derived from the legal word &quot;starr&quot; meaning the contract or obligation to a Jew (from the Hebrew שטר (&quot;shtar&quot;) meaning &quot;document&quot;). This term was in use until 1290, when Edward I had all Jews expelled from England. Blackstone thought the &quot;Starr Chamber&quot; might originally have been used for the deposition and storage of such contracts. However, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives this etymology &quot;no claim to consideration.&quot;

Other etymological speculations mentioned by Blackstone include the derivation from Old English &quot;steoran&quot; (steer) meaning &quot;to govern&quot;; as a court used to punish (in Latin: &quot;crimen stellionatus&quot;); or that the chamber was full of windows.

== History ==
===Plantagenets and Tudors===

The Court evolved from meetings of the King&#x27;s Council, with its roots going back to the medieval period. The so-called &quot;Star Chamber Act&quot; of King Henry VII&#x27;s second Parliament (1487) did not actually empower the Star Chamber, but rather created a separate tribunal distinct from the King&#x27;s general Council.

Initially well-regarded because of its speed and flexibility, the Star Chamber was regarded as one of the most just and efficient courts of the Tudor era. Sir Edward Coke described the Star Chamber as &quot;The most honourable court (Our Parliament excepted) that is in the Christian world. Both in respect of the judges in the court and its honourable proceeding.&quot;

The Star Chamber was made up of Privy Counsellors, as well as common-law judges, and it supplemented the activities of the common-law and equity courts in both civil and criminal matters. In a sense, the court was a court of appeal, a supervisory body, overseeing the operation of the lower courts, although it could hear cases by direct appeal as well. The court was set up to ensure the fair enforcement of laws against the English upper class, those so powerful that ordinary courts could never convict them of their crimes. Despite its subsequent reputation, it followed elaborate procedures and innovated in allowing defendants the right to counsel and to call witnesses.

Another function of the Court of Star Chamber was to act like a court of equity, which could impose punishment for actions that were deemed to be morally reprehensible, but were not in violation of the letter of the law. This gave the Star Chamber great flexibility, as it could punish defendants for any action that the court felt should be unlawful, even though it was technically lawful.

However, this meant that the justice meted out by the Star Chamber could be very arbitrary and subjective, and it enabled the court to be used later on in its history as an instrument of oppression rather than for the purpose of justice for which it was intended. Many crimes that are now commonly prosecuted, such as attempt, conspiracy, criminal libel, and perjury, were originally developed by the Court of Star Chamber, along with its more common role of dealing with misdemeanours, and, later, riots and sedition. Capital felonies and capital treason were not in its jurisdiction, it was not authorized to torture, and it could not impose the death sentence. 

The cases decided in those sessions enabled both the very powerful and those without power to seek redress. Thus, King Henry VII used the power of the Star Chamber to break the power of the landed gentry, which had been such a cause of problems in the Wars of the Roses. Yet, when local courts were often clogged or mismanaged, the Court of Star Chamber also became a means of appeal for the common people against the excesses of the nobility.

In the time of Henry VII, the privy counsellors not attending the King at the time might sit in the star chamber. 

In the reign of King Henry VIII, the court was under the successive leaderships of Cardinal Wolsey (the Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor), perhaps the King himself and Thomas Cranmer (the Archbishop of Canterbury). From this time forward, the Court of Star Chamber became a political weapon for bringing actions against those who opposed the policies of King Henry VIII, his ministers and his parliament.

Although it was initially a court of appeal, King Henry, Wolsey and Cranmer encouraged plaintiffs to bring their cases directly to the Star Chamber, bypassing the lower courts entirely.

The Court was used extensively to control Wales, after the Laws in Wales Acts (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Acts of Union&quot;). The Tudor-era gentry in Wales turned to the Chamber to evict Welsh landowners, to protect themselves, and in general, to protect the advantages given to them by the Laws in Wales Acts.

One of the weapons of the Star Chamber was the &quot;ex officio&quot; oath where, because of their positions, individuals were forced to swear to answer truthfully all questions that might be asked. Faced with hostile questioning, this then gave them the &quot;cruel trilemma&quot; of having to incriminate themselves, face charges of perjury if they gave unsatisfactory answers to their accusers, or be held in contempt of court if they gave no answer.

===Stuarts===
The power of the Court of Star Chamber grew considerably under the House of Stuart, and by the time of King Charles I, it had become synonymous with misuse and abuse of power by the King and his circle. and his son Charles used the court to examine cases of sedition, which meant that the court could be used to suppress opposition to royal policies. It came to be used to try nobles too powerful to be brought to trial in the lower courts.

King Charles I used the Court of Star Chamber as a Parliamentary substitute during the eleven years of Personal Rule, when he ruled without a Parliament. King Charles made extensive use of the Court of Star Chamber to prosecute dissenters, including the Puritans who fled to New England. This was one of the causes of the English Civil War.

On 17 October 1632, the Court of Star Chamber banned all &quot;news books&quot; because of complaints from Spanish and Austrian diplomats that coverage of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in England was unfair. As a result, newsbooks pertaining to this matter were often printed in Amsterdam and then smuggled into the country, until control of the press collapsed with the developing ideological conflict of 1640–41.

The Star Chamber became notorious for judgments favourable to the king, for example when Archbishop Laud had William Prynne branded on both cheeks through its agency in 1637 for seditious libel.

In 1571, Elizabeth I set up an equivalent Court in Ireland, the Court of Castle Chamber, to deal with cases of riot and offences against public order. Although it was initially popular with private litigants, under the Stuarts it developed the same reputation for harsh and arbitrary proceedings as its parent court, and during the political confusion of the 1640s, it disappeared.

In the early 1900s, Edgar Lee Masters commented:

===Abolition and aftermath===
In 1641, the Long Parliament, led by John Pym and inflamed by the severe treatment of John Lilburne, as well as that of other religious dissenters such as William Prynne, Alexander Leighton, John Bastwick and Henry Burton, abolished the Star Chamber with the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.

The gruesome punishments that the Star Chamber had imposed were not forgotten, and were revived by King James II, prompting an article in the Bill of Rights of 1688 &quot;That excessive Baile ought not to be required nor excessive Fines imposed nor cruell and unusuall Punishments inflicted&quot;.
The Chamber itself stood until its demolition in 1806 (or 1834 or early in 1836), when its materials were salvaged. The door was reused in the nearby Westminster School until it was destroyed in the Blitz, and the historic Star Chamber ceiling, with its bright gold stars, was brought to Leasowe Castle on the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire from the Court of Westminster, along with four tapestries depicting the four seasons.

==Recent history==
In the late 20th century, the expression was revived in reference to ways of resolving internal high-level questions within the government, usually relating to budget appropriations. The press and some civil servants under the premiership of Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) revived the term for private ministerial meetings at which disputes between the Treasury and high-spending departments were resolved. Neil Kinnock made reference to this style of Thatcher&#x27;s government during his first outing at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in 1983.

In 2010, the press employed the term for a committee established by the Cameron ministry to plan spending cuts to reduce public debt.

In March 2019, the European Research Group formed its own &quot;Star Chamber&quot; to pass judgement on Theresa May&#x27;s then proposed Brexit deal, recommending that MPs should not back it. On 29 December 2020, the ERG&#x27;s Star Chamber gave a similar verdict on Boris Johnson&#x27;s recently agreed EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, but on this occasion recommended that their members vote for it because the deal was &quot;consistent with the restoration of UK sovereignty&quot;. In December 2023 the ERG&#x27;s Star Chamber rejected Rishi Sunak&#x27;s proposed legislation to allow the Rwanda plan to go ahead.

==Influence on the US Constitution==
The historical abuses of the Star Chamber are considered to be some of the reasons, along with English common law precedent, behind the protections against compelled self-incrimination embodied in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The meaning of &quot;compelled testimony&quot; under the Fifth Amendment – i.e., the conditions under which a defendant is allowed to &quot;plead the Fifth&quot; to avoid self-incrimination – is thus often interpreted via reference to the inquisitorial methods of the Star Chamber.

As the US Supreme Court described it, &quot;the Star Chamber has, for centuries, symbolized disregard of basic individual rights. The Star Chamber not merely allowed, but required, defendants to have counsel. The defendant&#x27;s answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel. When counsel refused to sign the answer, for whatever reason, the defendant was considered to have confessed.&quot;

In addition, the &quot;excessive bail&quot; article of the Bill of Rights 1689 was reproduced near-verbatim as the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forms part of the US&#x27; own Bill of Rights.

<doc id="28588" wikidata="Q203330" url="?curid=28588" title="Coat of arms of South Africa">
<text>The coat of arms of South Africa is the main heraldic insignia of South Africa. The present coat of arms was introduced on Freedom Day, 27 April 2000, and was designed by Iaan Bekker. It replaced the earlier national arms, which had been in use since 1910. The motto is written in the extinct ǀXam, member of the Khoisan languages, and translates literally to &quot;diverse people unite&quot;. The previous motto, in Latin, was &quot;&quot;, translated as &quot;From unity, strength&quot;.

==History==
Following the end of apartheid, the new constitution of South Africa initially retained the coat of arms granted to South Africa in 1910. However, they had been viewed as outdated due to being designed by the British and Afrikaner minorities and not being representative of the black majority. The design process for a new coat of arms was initiated in 1999, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology requested ideas for the new coat of arms from the public. A brief was then prepared based on the ideas received, along with input from the Cabinet. The Government Communication and Information System then approached Design South Africa to brief ten of the top designers. Three designers were chosen to present their concepts to the Cabinet, and Iaan Bekker&#x27;s design was chosen.

The new arms were introduced on Freedom Day, 27 April 2000. The change reflected the government&#x27;s aim to highlight the democratic change in South Africa and a new sense of patriotism.

The coat of arms is a series of elements organised in distinct symmetric egg-like or oval shapes placed on top of one another. The completed structure of the coat of arms combines the lower and higher oval shape in a symbol of infinity. The path that connects the lower edge of the scroll, through the lines of the tusks, with the horizon above and the sun rising at the top, forms the shape of the cosmic egg from which the secretary bird rises. In the symbolic sense, this is the implied rebirth of the spirit of the great and heroic nation of South Africa.

The coat of arms is also a central part of the Seal of the Republic, traditionally considered to be the highest emblem of the state. Absolute authority is given to every document with an impression of the Seal of the Republic on it, as this means that it has been approved by the president of South Africa. Since 1997, however, the use of the Seal of the Republic has not actually been required by the Constitution, but it continues to be used.

=== Boer Republics ===
=== Colonies ===
=== Bantustans ===
==Blazon==
The official blazon of the arms is:

===The oval shape of foundation===

The first element is the motto, in a green semicircle. Completing the semicircle are two symmetrically placed pairs of elephant tusks pointing upwards. Within the oval shape formed by the tusks are two symmetrical ears of wheat, that in turn frame a centrally placed gold shield.

The shape of the shield makes reference to the drum, and contains two human figures derived from Khoisan rock art &quot;Linton Stone&quot;, which is housed and displayed in the South African Museum in Cape Town. The figures are depicted facing one another in greeting and in unity.

Above the shield are a spear and a knobkierie, crossed in a single unit. These elements are arranged harmoniously to give focus to the shield and complete the lower oval shape of foundation.

*The motto
:The motto is: ǃke e꞉ ǀxarra ǁke, written in the Khoisan language of the ǀXam people, literally meaning &quot;diverse people unite&quot;. It addresses each individual effort to harness the unity between thought and action. On a collective scale it calls for the nation to unite in a common sense of belonging and national pride – unity in diversity.

*The ears of wheat
:An emblem of fertility, it also symbolises the idea of germination, growth and the feasible development of any potential. It relates to the nourishment of the people and signifies the agricultural aspects of the Earth.

*Elephant tusks
:Elephants symbolise wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity.

*The shield
:It has a dual function as a vehicle for the display of identity and of spiritual defence. It contains the primary symbol of our nation.

*The human figures
:The figures are depicted in an attitude of greeting, symbolising unity. This also represents the beginning of the individual&#x27;s transformation into the greater sense of belonging to the nation and by extension, collective humanity.

*The spear and knobkierie
: A dual symbol of defence and authority, they in turn represent the powerful legs of the secretary bird. The spear and knobkierie are lying down, symbolising peace.

===The oval shape of ascendance===

Immediately above the oval shape of foundation, is the visual centre of the coat of arms, a protea. The petals of the protea are rendered in a triangular pattern reminiscent of the crafts of Africa.

The secretary bird is placed above the protea and the flower forms the chest of the bird. The secretary bird stands with its wings uplifted in a regal and uprising gesture. The distinctive head feathers of the secretary bird crown a strong and vigilant head.
The rising sun above the horizon is placed between the wings of the secretary bird and completes the oval shape of ascendance.

The combination of the upper and lower oval shapes intersect to form an unbroken infinite course, and the great harmony between the basic elements result in a dynamic, elegant and thoroughly distinctive design. Yet it clearly retains the stability, gravity and immediacy that a coat of arms demands.
*The King protea
:The protea is an emblem of the beauty of our land and the flowering of our potential as a nation in pursuit of the African Renaissance. The protea symbolises the holistic integration of forces that grow from the Earth and are nurtured from above. The most popular colours of Africa have been assigned to the protea – green, gold, red and black.
*The secretary bird
:The secretary bird is characterised in flight, the natural consequence of growth and speed. It is the equivalent of the lion on Earth. A powerful bird whose legs – depicted as the spear and knobkierie – serve it well in its hunt for snakes, symbolising protection of the nation against its enemies. It is a messenger of the heavens and conducts its grace upon the Earth. In this sense it is a symbol of divine majesty. Its uplifted wings are an emblem of the ascendance of our nation, while simultaneously offering us its protection. It is depicted in gold, which clearly symbolises its association with the sun and the highest power.
*The rising sun
:An emblem of brightness, splendour and the supreme principle of the nature of energy. It symbolises the promise of rebirth, the active faculties of reflection, knowledge, good judgement and willpower. It is the symbol of the source of life, of light and the ultimate wholeness of humanity.

==1910 arms==

The first coat of arms was granted by King George V by royal warrant on 17 September 1910. This was a few months after the formation of the Union of South Africa.

It was a combination of symbols representing the four provinces (formerly colonies) that made up the Union. 
*The first quarter is the figure of Hope, representing the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope.
*The two wildebeests of the second quarter represent the Colony of Natal.
*The orange tree in the third quarter was used as the symbol of the Orange Free State Republic.
*The wagon in the fourth quarter represented the Transvaal.
*The supporters are taken from the arms of the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony.
*The lion holds four rods, bound together, symbolising the unification of the four former colonies.

The motto, &quot;&quot; was officially translated as &quot;Union is Strength&quot; until 1961, and thereafter as &quot;Unity is Strength&quot;.

===Evolution===

Three official renditions of the arms were used. The original rendition (1910) was the only version used until 1930, and it continued to be used as the rank badge of warrant officers in the South African Defence Force and South African National Defence Force until 2002. The second version, painted in 1930 and known as the &quot;ordinary coat of arms&quot;, and the third version, painted in 1932 and known as the &quot;embellished coat of arms&quot;, were both used until 2000. The former was also used on the insignia of the South African Police until the 1990s.

==Provincial arms==
===1910–1994===
Between 1910 and 1994, South Africa was divided into four provinces, Cape Province, Natal, Orange Free State and Transvaal. These provinces had their own coat of arms.

=== 1994–present ===
In April 1994, South Africa was divided into nine provinces. Each province was granted a coat of arms, in most cases designed by State Herald Frederick Brownell.

<doc id="28591" wikidata="Q123808" url="?curid=28591" title="Second Epistle to the Corinthians">
<text>The Second Epistle to the Corinthians is a Pauline epistle of the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The epistle is attributed to Paul the Apostle and a co-author named Timothy, and is addressed to the church in Corinth and Christians in the surrounding province of Achaea, in modern-day Greece. According to Jerome, Titus was the amanuensis of this epistle.

==Composition==
While there is little doubt among scholars that Paul is the author, there is discussion over whether the Epistle was originally one letter or composed from two or more of Paul&#x27;s letters.

Although the New Testament contains only two letters to the Corinthian church, the evidence from the letters themselves is that he wrote at least four and the church replied at least once:
# 1 Corinthians 5:9 (&quot;I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators&quot;, KJV) refers to an early letter, sometimes called the &quot;warning letter&quot; or the &quot;previous letter.&quot;
# 1 Corinthians
# The Severe Letter: Paul refers to an earlier &quot;letter of tears&quot; in 2 Corinthians 2:3–4 and 7:8. 1 Corinthians does not match that description, so this &quot;letter of tears&quot; may have been written between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians.
# 2 Corinthians

 states that Paul was replying to certain questions written and sent to him by the church in Corinth.

The abrupt change of tone from being previously harmonious to bitterly reproachful in 2 Corinthians 10–13 has led many to infer that chapters 10–13 form part of the &quot;letter of tears&quot; which were in some way appended to Paul&#x27;s main letter. Those who disagree with this assessment usually say that the &quot;letter of tears&quot; is no longer extant. Others argue that although the letter of tears is no longer extant, chapters 10–13 come from a later letter.

The seemingly sudden change of subject from chapter 7 to chapters 8–9 leads some scholars to conclude that chapters 8–9 were originally a separate letter, and some even consider the two chapters to have originally been distinct themselves. Other scholars dispute this claim, however.

Some scholars also find fragments of the &quot;warning letter&quot;, or of other letters, in chapters 1–9, for instance that part of the &quot;warning letter&quot; is preserved in 2 Cor 6:14–7:1, but these hypotheses are less popular.

===Date===
There is evidence that Paul wrote 2 Corinthians from Macedonia in 55 or 56 AD, roughly a year after writing 1 Corinthians and a year before he wrote his letter to the Romans from Corinth.

==Structure==

The book is usually divided as follows:
* 1:1–11 – Greeting
* 1:12 – 7:16 – Paul defends his actions and apostleship, affirming his affection for the Corinthians.
* 8:1 – 9:15 – Instructions for the collection for the poor in the Jerusalem church.
* 10:1 – 13:10 – A polemic defense of his apostleship
* 13:11–13 – Closing greetings

==Background==
Paul&#x27;s contacts with the Corinthian church can be reconstructed as follows:

# Paul visits Corinth for the first time, spending about 18 months there (Acts 18:11). He then leaves Corinth and spends about 3 years in Ephesus (Acts 19:8, 19:10, 20:31). (Roughly from AD 53 to 57, see 1 Corinthians article).
# Paul writes the &quot;warning letter&quot; in his first year from Ephesus (1 Corinthians 5:9).
# Paul writes 1 Corinthians from his second year at Ephesus.
# Paul visits the Corinthian church a second time, as he indicated he would in 1 Corinthians 16:6. Probably during his last year in Ephesus. 2 Corinthians 2:1 calls this a &quot;painful visit&quot;.
# Paul writes the &quot;letter of tears&quot;.
# Paul writes 2 Corinthians, indicating his desire to visit the Corinthian church a third time (2 Cor 12:14, 2 Cor 13:1). The letter does not indicate where he is writing from, but it is usually dated after Paul left Ephesus for Macedonia (Acts 20), from either Philippi or Thessalonica in Macedonia.
# Paul presumably made the third visit after writing 2 Corinthians, because Acts 20:2–3 indicates he spent 3 months in Greece. In his letter to Rome, written at this time, he sent salutations from some of the principal members of the church to the Romans.

==Content==
In Paul&#x27;s second letter to the Corinthians, he again refers to himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and reassures the people of Corinth that they will not have another painful visit, but what he has to say is not to cause pain but to reassure them of the love he has for them. It is shorter in length in comparison to the first and can be confusing if the reader is unaware of the social, religious, and economic situation of the community. Paul felt the situation in Corinth was still complicated and felt attacked.

Some challenged his authority as an apostle, and he compares the level of difficulty to other cities he has visited who had embraced it, like the Galatians. He is criticized for the way he speaks and writes and finds it just to defend himself with some of his important teachings. He states the importance of forgiving others, and God&#x27;s new agreement that comes from the Spirit of the living God (2 Cor. 3:3), and the importance of being a person of Christ and giving generously to God&#x27;s people in Jerusalem, and ends with his own experience of how God changed his life (Sandmel, 1979).

==Uniqueness==
According to &quot;Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot;,
This epistle, it has been well said, shows the individuality of the apostle more than any other. &quot;Human weakness, spiritual strength, the deepest tenderness of affection, wounded feeling, sternness, irony, rebuke, impassioned self-vindication, humility, a just self-respect, zeal for the welfare of the weak and suffering, as well as for the progress of the church of Christ and for the spiritual advancement of its members, are all displayed in turn in the course of his appeal.&quot; —Lias, Second Corinthians.
