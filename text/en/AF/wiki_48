<text>An RNA virus is a virus characterized by a ribonucleic acid (RNA) based genome. The genome can be single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or double-stranded (dsRNA). Notable human diseases caused by RNA viruses include influenza, SARS, MERS, COVID-19, Dengue virus, hepatitis C, hepatitis E, West Nile fever, Ebola virus disease, rabies, polio, mumps, and measles.

All known RNA viruses, that is viruses that use a homologous RNA-dependent polymerase for replication, are categorized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) into the realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;. This includes RNA viruses belonging to &quot;Group III&quot;, &quot;Group IV&quot; or &quot;Group V&quot; of the Baltimore classification system as well as &quot;Group VI. Group VI&quot; viruses are retroviruses, viruses with RNA genetic material that use DNA intermediates in their life cycle including HIV-1 and HIV-2 which cause AIDS.

The majority of such RNA viruses fall into the kingdom &quot;Orthornavirae&quot; and the rest have a positioning not yet defined. The realm does not contain all RNA viruses: &quot;Deltavirus&quot;, &quot;Avsunviroidae&quot;, and &quot;Pospiviroidae&quot; are taxa of RNA viruses that were mistakenly included in 2019, but corrected in 2020.

==Characteristics==

===Single-stranded RNA viruses and RNA Sense===
RNA viruses can be further classified according to the sense or polarity of their RNA into negative-sense and positive-sense, or ambisense RNA viruses. Positive-sense viral RNA is similar to mRNA and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. Purified RNA of a positive-sense virus can directly cause infection though it may be less infectious than the whole virus particle. In contrast, purified RNA of a negative-sense virus is not infectious by itself as it needs to be transcribed into positive-sense RNA; each virion can be transcribed to several positive-sense RNAs. Ambisense RNA viruses resemble negative-sense RNA viruses, except they translate genes from their negative and positive strands.

===Double-stranded RNA viruses===
The double-stranded (ds)RNA viruses represent a diverse group of viruses that vary widely in host range (humans, animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria), genome segment number (one to twelve), and virion organization (Triangulation number, capsid layers, spikes, turrets, etc.). Members of this group include the rotaviruses, which are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in young children, and picobirnaviruses, which are the most common virus in fecal samples of both humans and animals with or without signs of diarrhea. Bluetongue virus is an economically important pathogen that infects cattle and sheep. In recent years, progress has been made in determining atomic and subnanometer resolution structures of a number of key viral proteins and virion capsids of several dsRNA viruses, highlighting the significant parallels in the structure and replicative processes of many of these viruses.

===Mutation rates===
RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses, because viral RNA polymerases lack the proofreading ability of DNA polymerases. The genetic diversity of RNA viruses is one reason why it is difficult to make effective vaccines against them. Retroviruses also have a high mutation rate even though their DNA intermediate integrates into the host genome (and is thus subject to host DNA proofreading once integrated), because errors during reverse transcription are embedded into both strands of DNA before integration. Some genes of RNA virus are important to the viral replication cycles and mutations are not tolerated. For example, the region of the hepatitis C virus genome that encodes the core protein is highly conserved, because it contains an RNA structure involved in an internal ribosome entry site.

===Sequence complexity===
On average, dsRNA viruses show a lower sequence redundancy relative to ssRNA viruses. Contrarily, dsDNA viruses contain the most redundant genome sequences while ssDNA viruses have the least. The sequence complexity of viruses has been shown to be a key characteristic for accurate reference-free viral classification.

==Replication==
There are three distinct groups of RNA viruses depending on their genome and mode of replication:
* Double-stranded RNA viruses (Group III) contain from one to a dozen different RNA molecules, each coding for one or more viral proteins.
* Positive-sense ssRNA viruses (Group IV) have their genome directly utilized as mRNA, with host ribosomes translating it into a single protein that is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication. One of these includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA replicase), which copies the viral RNA to form a double-stranded replicative form. In turn, this dsRNA directs the formation of new viral RNA.
* Negative-sense ssRNA viruses (Group V) must have their genome copied by an RNA replicase to form positive-sense RNA. This means that the virus must bring along with it the enzyme RNA replicase. The positive-sense RNA molecule then acts as viral mRNA, which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes.

Retroviruses (Group VI) have a single-stranded RNA genome but, in general, are not considered RNA viruses because they use DNA intermediates to replicate. Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double-stranded molecule of viral DNA. After this DNA is integrated into the host genome using the viral enzyme integrase, expression of the encoded genes may lead to the formation of new virions.

==Recombination==

Numerous RNA viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Very rarely viral RNA can recombine with host RNA. RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genome architecture and the course of viral evolution among &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA), e.g. poliovirus. In the &quot;Retroviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA), e.g. HIV, damage in the RNA genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcription by strand switching, a form of recombination. Recombination also occurs in the &quot;Reoviridae&quot; (dsRNA), e.g. reovirus; &quot;Orthomyxoviridae&quot; ((-)ssRNA), e.g. influenza virus; and &quot;Coronaviridae&quot; ((+)ssRNA), e.g. SARS. Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage. Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages. The resulting recombinant viruses may sometimes cause an outbreak of infection in humans.

==Classification==

Classification is based principally on the type of genome (double-stranded, negative- or positive-single-strand) and gene number and organization. Currently, there are 5 orders and 47 families of RNA viruses recognized. There are also many unassigned species and genera.

Related to but distinct from the RNA viruses are the viroids and the RNA satellite viruses. These are not currently classified as RNA viruses and are described on their own pages.

A study of several thousand RNA viruses has shown the presence of at least five main taxa: a levivirus and relatives group; a picornavirus supergroup; an alphavirus supergroup plus a flavivirus supergroup; the dsRNA viruses; and the -ve strand viruses. The lentivirus group appears to be basal to all the remaining RNA viruses. The next major division lies between the picornasupragroup and the remaining viruses. The dsRNA viruses appear to have evolved from a +ve RNA ancestor and the -ve RNA viruses from within the dsRNA viruses. The closest relation to the -ve stranded RNA viruses is the Reoviridae.

===Positive-strand RNA viruses===

This is the single largest group of RNA viruses and has been organized by the ICTV into the phyla &quot;Kitrinoviricota&quot;, &quot;Lenarviricota&quot;, and &quot;Pisuviricota&quot; in the kingdom &quot;Orthornavirae&quot; and realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;. 

Positive-strand RNA viruses can also be classified based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Three groups have been recognised:

# Bymoviruses, comoviruses, nepoviruses, nodaviruses, picornaviruses, potyviruses, sobemoviruses and a subset of luteoviruses (beet western yellows virus and potato leafroll virus)—the picorna like group (Picornavirata).
# Carmoviruses, dianthoviruses, flaviviruses, pestiviruses, statoviruses, tombusviruses, single-stranded RNA bacteriophages, hepatitis C virus and a subset of luteoviruses (barley yellow dwarf virus)—the flavi like group (Flavivirata).
# Alphaviruses, carlaviruses, furoviruses, hordeiviruses, potexviruses, rubiviruses, tobraviruses, tricornaviruses, tymoviruses, apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, beet yellows virus and hepatitis E virus—the alpha like group (Rubivirata).

A division of the alpha-like (Sindbis-like) supergroup on the basis of a novel domain located near the N termini of the proteins involved in viral replication has been proposed. The two groups proposed are: the &#x27;altovirus&#x27; group (alphaviruses, furoviruses, hepatitis E virus, hordeiviruses, tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, tricornaviruses and probably rubiviruses); and the &#x27;typovirus&#x27; group (apple chlorotic leaf spot virus, carlaviruses, potexviruses and tymoviruses).

The alpha like supergroup can be further divided into three clades: the rubi-like, tobamo-like, and tymo-like viruses.

Additional work has identified five groups of positive-stranded RNA viruses containing four, three, three, three, and one order(s), respectively. These fourteen orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant viruses) and 48 genera (including 30 genera of plant viruses). This analysis suggests that alphaviruses and flaviviruses can be separated into two families—the Togaviridae and Flaviridae, respectively—but suggests that other taxonomic assignments, such as the pestiviruses, hepatitis C virus, rubiviruses, hepatitis E virus, and arteriviruses, may be incorrect. The coronaviruses and toroviruses appear to be distinct families in distinct orders and not distinct genera of the same family as currently classified. The luteoviruses appear to be two families rather than one, and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus appears not to be a closterovirus but a new genus of the Potexviridae.

==== Evolution ====

The evolution of the picornaviruses based on an analysis of their RNA polymerases and helicases appears to date to the divergence of eukaryotes. Their putative ancestors include the bacterial group II retroelements, the family of HtrA proteases and DNA bacteriophages.

Partitiviruses are related to and may have evolved from a totivirus ancestor.

Hypoviruses and barnaviruses appear to share an ancestry with the potyvirus and sobemovirus lineages respectively.

===Double-stranded RNA viruses===

This analysis also suggests that the dsRNA viruses are not closely related to each other but instead belong to four additional classes—Birnaviridae, Cystoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Reoviridae—and one additional order (Totiviridae) of one of the classes of positive ssRNA viruses in the same subphylum as the positive-strand RNA viruses.

One study has suggested that there are two large clades: One includes the families &quot;Caliciviridae&quot;, &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;, and &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; and a second that includes the families &quot;Alphatetraviridae&quot;, &quot;Birnaviridae&quot;, &quot;Cystoviridae&quot;, &quot;Nodaviridae&quot;, and &quot;Permutotretraviridae&quot;.

===Negative strand RNA viruses===

These viruses have multiple types of genome ranging from a single RNA molecule up to eight segments. Despite their diversity it appears that they may have originated in arthropods and to have diversified from there.

===Satellite viruses===

A number of satellite viruses—viruses that require the assistance of another virus to complete their life cycle—are also known. Their taxonomy has yet to be settled. The following four genera have been proposed for positive sense single stranded RNA satellite viruses that infect plants—Albetovirus, Aumaivirus, Papanivirus and Virtovirus. A family—Sarthroviridae which includes the genus Macronovirus—has been proposed for the positive sense single stranded RNA satellite viruses that infect arthropods.

<doc id="26197" wikidata="Q173412" url="?curid=26197" title="Radiocarbon dating">
<text>Radiocarbon dating (also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating) is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon, a radioactive isotope of carbon.

The method was developed in the late 1940s at the University of Chicago by Willard Libby. It is based on the fact that radiocarbon () is constantly being created in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and thereafter the amount of it contains begins to decrease as the undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the amount of in a sample from a dead plant or animal, such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone, provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less there is to be detected, and because the half-life of (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to approximately 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally make an accurate analysis of older samples possible. Libby received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in 1960. 

Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of in the atmosphere has been over the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, in the form of a calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample&#x27;s calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects). Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no . As a result, beginning in the late 19th century, there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of as the carbon dioxide generated from burning fossil fuels began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of in the atmosphere, which reached a maximum in about 1965 of almost double the amount present in the atmosphere prior to nuclear testing.

Measurement of radiocarbon was originally done by beta-counting devices, which counted the amount of beta radiation emitted by decaying atoms in a sample. More recently, accelerator mass spectrometry has become the method of choice; it counts all the atoms in the sample and not just the few that happen to decay during the measurements; it can therefore be used with much smaller samples (as small as individual plant seeds), and gives results much more quickly. The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeology. In addition to permitting more accurate dating within archaeological sites than previous methods, it allows comparison of dates of events across great distances. Histories of archaeology often refer to its impact as the &quot;radiocarbon revolution&quot;. Radiocarbon dating has allowed key transitions in prehistory to be dated, such as the end of the last ice age, and the beginning of the Neolithic and Bronze Age in different regions.

==Background==
===History===
In 1939, Martin Kamen and Samuel Ruben of the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley began experiments to determine if any of the elements common in organic matter had isotopes with half-lives long enough to be of value in biomedical research. They synthesized using the laboratory&#x27;s cyclotron accelerator and soon discovered that the atom&#x27;s half-life was far longer than had been previously thought. This was followed by a prediction by Serge A. Korff, then employed at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, that the interaction of with in the upper atmosphere would create . It had previously been thought that would be more likely to be created by deuterons interacting with . At some time during World War II, Willard Libby, who was then at Berkeley, learned of Korff&#x27;s research and conceived the idea that it might be possible to use radiocarbon for dating.

In 1945, Libby moved to the University of Chicago, where he began his work on radiocarbon dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include as well as non-radioactive carbon. Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after isotopically enriching their samples they were able to demonstrate that they contained . By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in &quot;Science&quot; in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.

Libby and James Arnold proceeded to test the radiocarbon dating theory by analyzing samples with known ages. For example, two samples taken from the tombs of two Egyptian kings, Zoser and Sneferu, independently dated to 2625 BC ± 75 years, were dated by radiocarbon measurement to an average of 2800 BC ± 250 years. These results were published in &quot;Science&quot; in December 1949. Within 11 years of their announcement, more than 20 radiocarbon dating laboratories had been set up worldwide. In 1960, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.

===Physical and chemical details===

In nature, carbon exists as three isotopes. Two are stable and not radioactive: carbon-12 (), and carbon-13 (); and carbon-14 (), also known as &quot;radiocarbon&quot;, which is radioactive. The half-life of (the time it takes for half of a given amount of to decay) is about 5,730 years, so its concentration in the atmosphere might be expected to decrease over thousands of years, but is constantly being produced in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, primarily by galactic cosmic rays, and to a lesser degree by solar cosmic rays. These cosmic rays generate neutrons as they travel through the atmosphere which can strike nitrogen-14 () atoms and turn them into . The following nuclear reaction is the main pathway by which is created:
: n + → + p
where n represents a neutron and p represents a proton.

Once produced, the quickly combines with the oxygen (O) in the atmosphere to form first carbon monoxide (), and ultimately carbon dioxide ().
: + → + O

: + OH → + H
Carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via photosynthesis. Animals eat the plants, and ultimately the radiocarbon is distributed throughout the biosphere. The ratio of to is approximately 1.25 parts of to 1012 parts of . In addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope .

The equation for the radioactive decay of is:
By emitting a beta particle (an electron, e−) and an electron antineutrino (), one of the neutrons in the nucleus changes to a proton and the nucleus reverts to the stable (non-radioactive) isotope .

===Principles===
During its life, a plant or animal is in equilibrium with its surroundings by exchanging carbon either with the atmosphere or through its diet. It will, therefore, have the same proportion of as the atmosphere, or in the case of marine animals or plants, with the ocean. Once it dies, it ceases to acquire , but the within its biological material at that time will continue to decay, and so the ratio of to in its remains will gradually decrease. Because decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon – the older the sample, the less will be left.

The equation governing the decay of a radioactive isotope is:
: formula_1
where &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of atoms of the isotope in the original sample (at time &quot;t&quot; = 0, when the organism from which the sample was taken died), and &quot;N&quot; is the number of atoms left after time &quot;t&quot;. &quot;λ&quot; is a constant that depends on the particular isotope; for a given isotope it is equal to the reciprocal of the mean-life – i.e. the average or expected time a given atom will survive before undergoing radioactive decay. The mean-life, denoted by &quot;τ&quot;, of is 8,267 years, so the equation above can be rewritten as:
: formula_2
The sample is assumed to have originally had the same / ratio as the ratio in the atmosphere, and since the size of the sample is known, the total number of atoms in the sample can be calculated, yielding &quot;N&quot;0, the number of atoms in the original sample. Measurement of &quot;N&quot;, the number of atoms currently in the sample, allows the calculation of &quot;t&quot;, the age of the sample, using the equation above.

The half-life of a radioactive isotope (usually denoted by t1/2) is a more familiar concept than the mean-life, so although the equations above are expressed in terms of the mean-life, it is more usual to quote the value of &#x27;s half-life than its mean-life. The currently accepted value for the half-life of is 5,700 ± 30 years. This means that after 5,700 years, only half of the initial will remain; a quarter will remain after 11,400 years; an eighth after 17,100 years; and so on.

The above calculations make several assumptions, such as that the level of in the atmosphere has remained constant over time. In fact, the level of in the atmosphere has varied significantly and as a result, the values provided by the equation above have to be corrected by using data from other sources. This is done by calibration curves (discussed below), which convert a measurement of in a sample into an estimated calendar age. The calculations involve several steps and include an intermediate value called the &quot;radiocarbon age&quot;, which is the age in &quot;radiocarbon years&quot; of the sample: an age quoted in radiocarbon years means that no calibration curve has been used − the calculations for radiocarbon years assume that the atmospheric / ratio has not changed over time.

Calculating radiocarbon ages also requires the value of the half-life for . In Libby&#x27;s 1949 paper he used a value of 5720 ± 47 years, based on research by Engelkemeir et al. This was remarkably close to the modern value, but shortly afterwards the accepted value was revised to 5568 ± 30 years, and this value was in use for more than a decade. It was revised again in the early 1960s to 5,730 ± 40 years, which meant that many calculated dates in papers published prior to this were incorrect (the error in the half-life is about 3%). For consistency with these early papers, it was agreed at the 1962 Radiocarbon Conference in Cambridge (UK) to use the &quot;Libby half-life&quot; of 5568 years. Radiocarbon ages are still calculated using this half-life, and are known as &quot;Conventional Radiocarbon Age&quot;. Since the calibration curve (IntCal) also reports past atmospheric concentration using this conventional age, any conventional ages calibrated against the IntCal curve will produce a correct calibrated age. When a date is quoted, the reader should be aware that if it is an uncalibrated date (a term used for dates given in radiocarbon years) it may differ substantially from the best estimate of the actual calendar date, both because it uses the wrong value for the half-life of , and because no correction (calibration) has been applied for the historical variation of in the atmosphere over time.

===Carbon exchange reservoir===
Carbon is distributed throughout the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the oceans; these are referred to collectively as the carbon exchange reservoir, and each component is also referred to individually as a carbon exchange reservoir. The different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them. This affects the ratio of to in the different reservoirs, and hence the radiocarbon ages of samples that originated in each reservoir. The atmosphere, which is where is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the it contains mixes in less than seven years. The ratio of to in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of to , it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that either some of the has decayed, or the reservoir is receiving carbon that is not at the atmospheric baseline. The ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere. The time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years, but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir. Water in the deep ocean takes about 1,000 years to circulate back through surface waters, and so the surface waters contain a combination of older water, with depleted , and water recently at the surface, with in equilibrium with the atmosphere.

Creatures living at the ocean surface have the same ratios as the water they live in, and as a result of the reduced / ratio, the radiocarbon age of marine life is typically about 400 years. Organisms on land are in closer equilibrium with the atmosphere and have the same / ratio as the atmosphere. These organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown in the diagram. Accumulated dead organic matter, of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a / ratio lower than that of the biosphere.

==Dating considerations==

The variation in the / ratio in different parts of the carbon exchange reservoir means that a straightforward calculation of the age of a sample based on the amount of it contains will often give an incorrect result. There are several other possible sources of error that need to be considered. The errors are of four general types:
* variations in the / ratio in the atmosphere, both geographically and over time;
* isotopic fractionation;
* variations in the / ratio in different parts of the reservoir;
* contamination.

===Atmospheric variation===
In the early years of using the technique, it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric / ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the / ratio had changed over time. The question was resolved by the study of tree rings: comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years. (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.) In the 1960s, Hans Suess was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists. This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don&#x27;t get their replenished and instead start losing through decay. Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in. Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of &quot;N&quot; (the number of atoms of remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of &quot;N&quot;0 – the number of atoms of in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time. Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the / ratio. These curves are described in more detail below.

Coal and oil began to be burned in large quantities during the 19th century. Both are sufficiently old that they contain little or no detectable and, as a result, the released substantially diluted the atmospheric / ratio. Dating an object from the early 20th century hence gives an apparent date older than the true date. For the same reason, concentrations in the neighbourhood of large cities are lower than the atmospheric average. This fossil fuel effect (also known as the Suess effect, after Hans Suess, who first reported it in 1955) would only amount to a reduction of 0.2% in activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir, but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean, the actual effect is a 3% reduction.

A much larger effect comes from above-ground nuclear testing, which released large numbers of neutrons into the atmosphere, resulting in the creation of . From about 1950 until 1963, when atmospheric nuclear testing was banned, it is estimated that several tonnes of were created. If all this extra had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir, it would have led to an increase in the / ratio of only a few per cent, but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of in the atmosphere, with the peak level occurring in 1964 for the northern hemisphere, and in 1966 for the southern hemisphere. The level has since dropped, as this bomb pulse or &quot;bomb carbon&quot; (as it is sometimes called) percolates into the rest of the reservoir.

===Isotopic fractionation===
Photosynthesis is the primary process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into living things. In photosynthetic pathways is absorbed slightly more easily than , which in turn is more easily absorbed than . The differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to / and / ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere. This effect is known as isotopic fractionation.

To determine the degree of fractionation that takes place in a given plant, the amounts of both and isotopes are measured, and the resulting / ratio is then compared to a standard ratio known as PDB. The / ratio is used instead of / because the former is much easier to measure, and the latter can be easily derived: the depletion of relative to is proportional to the difference in the atomic masses of the two isotopes, so the depletion for is twice the depletion of . The fractionation of , known as , is calculated as follows:

:formula_3 ‰

where the ‰ sign indicates parts per thousand. Because the PDB standard contains an unusually high proportion of , most measured values are negative.

For marine organisms, the details of the photosynthesis reactions are less well understood, and the values for marine photosynthetic organisms are dependent on temperature. At higher temperatures, has poor solubility in water, which means there is less available for the photosynthetic reactions. Under these conditions, fractionation is reduced, and at temperatures above 14 °C the values are correspondingly higher, while at lower temperatures, becomes more soluble and hence more available to marine organisms. The value for animals depends on their diet. An animal that eats food with high values will have a higher than one that eats food with lower values. The animal&#x27;s own biochemical processes can also impact the results: for example, both bone minerals and bone collagen typically have a higher concentration of than is found in the animal&#x27;s diet, though for different biochemical reasons. The enrichment of bone also implies that excreted material is depleted in relative to the diet.

Since makes up about 1% of the carbon in a sample, the / ratio can be accurately measured by mass spectrometry. Typical values of have been found by experiment for many plants, as well as for different parts of animals such as bone collagen, but when dating a given sample it is better to determine the value for that sample directly than to rely on the published values.

The carbon exchange between atmospheric and carbonate at the ocean surface is also subject to fractionation, with in the atmosphere more likely than to dissolve in the ocean. The result is an overall increase in the / ratio in the ocean of 1.5%, relative to the / ratio in the atmosphere. This increase in concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water (containing old, and hence -depleted, carbon) from the deep ocean, so that direct measurements of radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere. Correcting for isotopic fractionation, as is done for all radiocarbon dates to allow comparison between results from different parts of the biosphere, gives an apparent age of about 400 years for ocean surface water.

===Reservoir effects===
Libby&#x27;s original exchange reservoir hypothesis assumed that the / ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the world, but it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.

====Marine effect====
The in the atmosphere transfers to the ocean by dissolving in the surface water as carbonate and bicarbonate ions; at the same time the carbonate ions in the water are returning to the air as . This exchange process brings from the atmosphere into the surface waters of the ocean, but the thus introduced takes a long time to percolate through the entire volume of the ocean. The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this &quot;old&quot; water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation). This effect is not uniform – the average effect is about 400 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other. These deviations can be accounted for in calibration, and users of software such as CALIB can provide as an input the appropriate correction for the location of their samples. The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to be hundreds of years old.

====Hemisphere effect====
The northern and southern hemispheres have atmospheric circulation systems that are sufficiently independent of each other that there is a noticeable time lag in mixing between the two. The atmospheric / ratio is lower in the southern hemisphere, with an apparent additional age of about 40 years for radiocarbon results from the south as compared to the north. This is because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north. Since the surface ocean is depleted in because of the marine effect, is removed from the southern atmosphere more quickly than in the north. The effect is strengthened by strong upwelling around Antarctica.

====Other effects====
If the carbon in freshwater is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then the result will be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over limestone, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it. This is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results, and can also reduce the apparent age if they are of more recent origin than the sample. The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the radiocarbon age of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.

Volcanic eruptions eject large amounts of carbon into the air. The carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio near the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants in the neighbourhood of the Furnas caldera in the Azores were found to have apparent ages that ranged from 250 years to 3320 years.

===Contamination===
Any addition of carbon to a sample of a different age will cause the measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old, the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining , causes an error in the other direction independent of age – a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it truly is, regardless of the date of the sample.

==Samples==

Samples for dating need to be converted into a form suitable for measuring the content; this can mean conversion to gaseous, liquid, or solid form, depending on the measurement technique to be used. Before this can be done, the sample must be treated to remove any contamination and any unwanted constituents. This includes removing visible contaminants, such as rootlets that may have penetrated the sample since its burial. Alkali and acid washes can be used to remove humic acid and carbonate contamination, but care has to be taken to avoid removing the part of the sample that contains the carbon to be tested.

===Material considerations===
* It is common to reduce a wood sample to just the cellulose component before testing, but since this can reduce the volume of the sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.
* Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date it using collagen, the protein fraction that remains after washing away the bone&#x27;s structural material. Hydroxyproline, one of the constituent amino acids in bone, was once thought to be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.
* For burnt bone, testability depends on the conditions under which the bone was burnt. If the bone was heated under reducing conditions, it (and associated organic matter) may have been carbonized. In this case, the sample is often usable.
* Shells from both marine and land organisms consist almost entirely of calcium carbonate, either as aragonite or as calcite, or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample&#x27;s environment, which may be of geological origin. If testing recrystallized shell is unavoidable, it is sometimes possible to identify the original shell material from a sequence of tests. It is also possible to test conchiolin, an organic protein found in shell, but it constitutes only 1–2% of shell material.
* The three major components of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give the most reliable date as they are insoluble in alkali and less likely to contain contaminants from the sample&#x27;s environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.
* Soil contains organic material, but because of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, it is very difficult to get satisfactory radiocarbon dates. It is preferable to sieve the soil for fragments of organic origin, and date the fragments with methods that are tolerant of small sample sizes.
* Other materials that have been successfully dated include ivory, paper, textiles, individual seeds and grains, straw from within mud bricks, and charred food remains found in pottery.

===Preparation and size===
Particularly for older samples, it may be useful to enrich the amount of in the sample before testing. This can be done with a thermal diffusion column. The process takes about a month and requires a sample about ten times as large as would be needed otherwise, but it allows more precise measurement of the / ratio in old material and extends the maximum age that can be reliably reported.

Once contamination has been removed, samples must be converted to a form suitable for the measuring technology to be used. Where gas is required, is widely used. For samples to be used in liquid scintillation counters, the carbon must be in liquid form; the sample is typically converted to benzene. For accelerator mass spectrometry, solid graphite targets are the most common, although gaseous can also be used.

The quantity of material needed for testing depends on the sample type and the technology being used. There are two types of testing technology: detectors that record radioactivity, known as beta counters, and accelerator mass spectrometers. For beta counters, a sample weighing at least is typically required. Accelerator mass spectrometry is much more sensitive, and samples containing as little as 0.5 milligrams of carbon can be used.

==Measurement and results==
For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments, the only way to measure the in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms. In this approach, what is measured is the activity, in number of decay events per unit mass per time period, of the sample. This method is also known as &quot;beta counting&quot;, because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying atoms that are detected. In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available: directly counting the number of and atoms in a given sample, via accelerator mass spectrometry, usually referred to as AMS. AMS counts the / ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and / ratio can be converted into each other exactly. For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but AMS is now more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements. In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting, and it is much faster – an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.

===Beta counting===
Libby&#x27;s first detector was a Geiger counter of his own design. He converted the carbon in his sample to lamp black (soot) and coated the inner surface of a cylinder with it. This cylinder was inserted into the counter in such a way that the counting wire was inside the sample cylinder, in order that there should be no material between the sample and the wire. Any interposing material would have interfered with the detection of radioactivity, since the beta particles emitted by decaying are so weak that half are stopped by a 0.01 mm thickness of aluminium.

Libby&#x27;s method was soon superseded by gas proportional counters, which were less affected by bomb carbon (the additional created by nuclear weapons testing). These counters record bursts of ionization caused by the beta particles emitted by the decaying atoms; the bursts are proportional to the energy of the particle, so other sources of ionization, such as background radiation, can be identified and ignored. The counters are surrounded by lead or steel shielding, to eliminate background radiation and to reduce the incidence of cosmic rays. In addition, anticoincidence detectors are used; these record events outside the counter and any event recorded simultaneously both inside and outside the counter is regarded as an extraneous event and ignored.

The other common technology used for measuring activity is liquid scintillation counting, which was invented in 1950, but which had to wait until the early 1960s, when efficient methods of benzene synthesis were developed, to become competitive with gas counting; after 1970 liquid counters became the more common technology choice for newly constructed dating laboratories. The counters work by detecting flashes of light caused by the beta particles emitted by as they interact with a fluorescing agent added to the benzene. Like gas counters, liquid scintillation counters require shielding and anticoincidence counters.

For both the gas proportional counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured is the number of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample – a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample&#x27;s . In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.

===Accelerator mass spectrometry===

AMS counts the atoms of and in a given sample, determining the / ratio directly. The sample, often in the form of graphite, is made to emit C− ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an accelerator. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The ions, which may have from 1 to 4 positive charges (C+ to C4+), depending on the accelerator design, are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the stream, but since the volume of (and , needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a Faraday cup. The large positive charge induced by the stripper forces molecules such as , which has a weight close enough to to interfere with the measurements, to dissociate, so they are not detected. Most AMS machines also measure the sample&#x27;s , for use in calculating the sample&#x27;s radiocarbon age. The use of AMS, as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry, is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass, such as and . As with beta counting, both blank samples and standard samples are used. Two different kinds of blank may be measured: a sample of dead carbon that has undergone no chemical processing, to detect any machine background, and a sample known as a process blank made from dead carbon that is processed into target material in exactly the same way as the sample which is being dated. Any signal from the machine background blank is likely to be caused either by beams of ions that have not followed the expected path inside the detector or by carbon hydrides such as or . A signal from the process blank measures the amount of contamination introduced during the preparation of the sample. These measurements are used in the subsequent calculation of the age of the sample.

===Calculations===

The calculations to be performed on the measurements taken depend on the technology used, since beta counters measure the sample&#x27;s radioactivity whereas AMS determines the ratio of the three different carbon isotopes in the sample.

To determine the age of a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to the activity of the standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000 lb of which was prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1977 from French beet harvests.

The results from AMS testing are in the form of ratios of , , and , which are used to calculate Fm, the &quot;fraction modern&quot;. This is defined as the ratio between the / ratio in the sample and the / ratio in modern carbon, which is in turn defined as the / ratio that would have been measured in 1950 had there been no fossil fuel effect.

Both beta counting and AMS results have to be corrected for fractionation. This is necessary because different materials of the same age, which because of fractionation have naturally different / ratios, will appear to be of different ages because the / ratio is taken as the indicator of age. To avoid this, all radiocarbon measurements are converted to the measurement that would have been seen had the sample been made of wood, which has a known δ value of −25‰.

Once the corrected / ratio is known, a &quot;radiocarbon age&quot; is calculated using:

:formula_4

The calculation uses 8,033 years, the mean-life derived from Libby&#x27;s half-life of 5,568 years, not 8,267 years, the mean-life derived from the more accurate modern value of 5,730 years. Libby&#x27;s value for the half-life is used to maintain consistency with early radiocarbon testing results; calibration curves include a correction for this, so the accuracy of final reported calendar ages is assured.

===Errors and reliability===
The reliability of the results can be improved by lengthening the testing time. For example, if counting beta decays for 250 minutes is enough to give an error of ± 80 years, with 68% confidence, then doubling the counting time to 500 minutes will allow a sample with only half as much to be measured with the same error term of 80 years.

Radiocarbon dating is generally limited to dating samples no more than 50,000 years old, as samples older than that have insufficient to be measurable. Older dates have been obtained by using special sample preparation techniques, large samples, and very long measurement times. These techniques can allow measurement of dates up to 60,000 and in some cases up to 75,000 years before the present.

Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only a 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4,250 to about 4,390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4,520 to about 4,690.

Errors in procedure can also lead to errors in the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.

===Calibration===
The calculations given above produce dates in radiocarbon years: i.e. dates that represent the age the sample would be if the / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction would need to be applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.

To produce a curve that can be used to relate calendar years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their radiocarbon age. The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by Wesley Ferguson. Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter-term variation, often referred to as &quot;wiggles&quot;, with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by &quot;cosmic &quot;schwung&quot;&quot;, by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after Hessel de Vries.

A calibration curve is used by taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse of the way the curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting radiocarbon age gives a data point for the graph.

Over the next thirty years many calibration curves were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches. These were superseded by the IntCal series of curves, beginning with IntCal98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, 2013, and 2020. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, varves, coral, plant macrofossils, speleothems, and foraminifera. There are separate curves for the northern hemisphere (IntCal20) and southern hemisphere (SHCal20), as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect. The continuous sequence of tree-ring dates for the northern hemisphere goes back to 13,910 BP as of 2020, and this provides close to annual dating for IntCal20 much of the period, reduced where there are calibration plateaus, and increased when short term C spikes due to Miyake events provide additional correlation. Radiocarbon dating earlier than the continuous tree ring sequence relies on correlation with more approximate records. SHCal20 is based on independent data where possible and derived from the northern curve by adding the average offset for the southern hemisphere where no direct data was available. There is also a separate marine calibration curve, MARINE20. For a set of samples forming a sequence with a known separation in time, these samples form a subset of the calibration curve. The sequence can be compared to the calibration curve and the best match to the sequence established. This &quot;wiggle-matching&quot; technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce. The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified tephra sequence in New Zealand, believed to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314 AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching. The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the radiocarbon age intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the radiocarbon age intercepted.

Bayesian statistical techniques can be applied when there are several radiocarbon dates to be calibrated. For example, if a series of radiocarbon dates is taken from different levels in a stratigraphic sequence, Bayesian analysis can be used to evaluate dates which are outliers and can calculate improved probability distributions, based on the prior information that the sequence should be ordered in time. When Bayesian analysis was introduced, its use was limited by the need to use mainframe computers to perform the calculations, but the technique has since been implemented on programs available for personal computers, such as OxCal.

===Reporting dates===
Several formats for citing radiocarbon results have been used since the first samples were dated. As of 2019, the standard format required by the journal &quot;Radiocarbon&quot; is as follows.

Uncalibrated dates should be reported as &quot;: ± BP&quot;, where:
* identifies the laboratory that tested the sample, and the sample ID
* is the laboratory&#x27;s determination of the age of the sample, in radiocarbon years
* is the laboratory&#x27;s estimate of the error in the age, at 1σ confidence.
* &#x27;BP&#x27; stands for &quot;before present&quot;, referring to a reference date of 1950, so that &quot;500 BP&quot; means the year AD 1450.

For example, the uncalibrated date &quot;UtC-2020: 3510 ± 60 BP&quot; indicates that the sample was tested by the Utrecht van der Graaff Laboratorium (&quot;UtC&quot;), where it has a sample number of &quot;2020&quot;, and that the uncalibrated age is 3510 years before present, ± 60 years. Related forms are sometimes used: for example, &quot;2.3 ka BP&quot; means 2,300 radiocarbon years before present (i.e. 350 BC), and &quot; yr BP&quot; might be used to distinguish the uncalibrated date from a date derived from another dating method such as thermoluminescence.

Calibrated dates are frequently reported as &quot;cal BP&quot;, &quot;cal BC&quot;, or &quot;cal AD&quot;, again with &#x27;BP&#x27; referring to the year 1950 as the zero date. &quot;Radiocarbon&quot; gives two options for reporting calibrated dates. A common format is &quot;cal &quot;, where:
* is the range of dates corresponding to the given confidence level
* indicates the confidence level for the given date range.

For example, &quot;cal 1220–1281 AD (1σ)&quot; means a calibrated date for which the true date lies between AD 1220 and AD 1281, with a confidence level of &#x27;1 sigma&#x27;, or approximately 68%. Calibrated dates can also be expressed as &quot;BP&quot; instead of using &quot;BC&quot; and &quot;AD&quot;. The curve used to calibrate the results should be the latest available IntCal curve. Calibrated dates should also identify any programs, such as OxCal, used to perform the calibration. In addition, an article in &quot;Radiocarbon&quot; in 2014 about radiocarbon date reporting conventions recommends that information should be provided about sample treatment, including the sample material, pretreatment methods, and quality control measurements; that the citation to the software used for calibration should specify the version number and any options or models used; and that the calibrated date should be given with the associated probabilities for each range.

==Use in archaeology==
===Interpretation===
A key concept in interpreting radiocarbon dates is archaeological association: what is the true relationship between two or more objects at an archaeological site? It frequently happens that a sample for radiocarbon dating can be taken directly from the object of interest, but there are also many cases where this is not possible. Metal grave goods, for example, cannot be radiocarbon dated, but they may be found in a grave with a coffin, charcoal, or other material which can be assumed to have been deposited at the same time. In these cases, a date for the coffin or charcoal is indicative of the date of deposition of the grave goods, because of the direct functional relationship between the two. There are also cases where there is no functional relationship, but the association is reasonably strong: for example, a layer of charcoal in a rubbish pit provides a date which has a relationship to the rubbish pit.

Contamination is of particular concern when dating very old material obtained from archaeological excavations and great care is needed in the specimen selection and preparation. In 2014, Thomas Higham and co-workers suggested that many of the dates published for Neanderthal artifacts are too recent because of contamination by &quot;young carbon&quot;.

As a tree grows, only the outermost tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample depends on where the sample is taken from. This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. In addition, if a piece of wood is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found. This is often referred to as the &quot;old wood&quot; problem. One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. It is not always possible to recognize re-use. Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen&#x27;s radiocarbon age will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition. For example, a wooden object that remains in use for a lengthy period will have an apparent age greater than the actual age of the context in which it is deposited.

===Use outside archaeology===
Archaeology is not the only field that uses radiocarbon dating. Radiocarbon dates can also be used in geology, sedimentology, and lake studies, for example. The ability to date minute samples using AMS has meant that palaeobotanists and palaeoclimatologists can use radiocarbon dating directly on pollen purified from sediment sequences, or on small quantities of plant material or charcoal. Dates on organic material recovered from strata of interest can be used to correlate strata in different locations that appear to be similar on geological grounds. Dating material from one location gives date information about the other location, and the dates are also used to place strata in the overall geological timeline.

Radiocarbon is also used to date carbon released from ecosystems, particularly to monitor the release of old carbon that was previously stored in soils as a result of human disturbance or climate change. Recent advances in field collection techniques also allow the radiocarbon dating of methane and carbon dioxide, which are important greenhouse gases.

===Notable applications===
====Pleistocene/Holocene boundary in Two Creeks Fossil Forest====
The Pleistocene is a geological epoch that began about 2.6 million years ago. The Holocene, the current geological epoch, begins about 11,700 years ago when the Pleistocene ends. Establishing the date of this boundary − which is defined by sharp climatic warming − as accurately as possible has been a goal of geologists for much of the 20th century. At Two Creeks, in Wisconsin, a fossil forest was discovered (Two Creeks Buried Forest State Natural Area), and subsequent research determined that the destruction of the forest was caused by the Valders ice readvance, the last southward movement of ice before the end of the Pleistocene in that area. Before the advent of radiocarbon dating, the fossilized trees had been dated by correlating sequences of annually deposited layers of sediment at Two Creeks with sequences in Scandinavia. This led to estimates that the trees were between 24,000 and 19,000 years old, and hence this was taken to be the date of the last advance of the Wisconsin glaciation before its final retreat marked the end of the Pleistocene in North America. In 1952 Libby published radiocarbon dates for several samples from the Two Creeks site and two similar sites nearby; the dates were averaged to 11,404 BP with a standard error of 350 years. This result was uncalibrated, as the need for calibration of radiocarbon ages was not yet understood. Further results over the next decade supported an average date of 11,350 BP, with the results thought to be the most accurate averaging 11,600 BP. There was initial resistance to these results on the part of Ernst Antevs, the palaeobotanist who had worked on the Scandinavian varve series, but his objections were eventually discounted by other geologists. In the 1990s samples were tested with AMS, yielding (uncalibrated) dates ranging from 11,640 BP to 11,800 BP, both with a standard error of 160 years. Subsequently, a sample from the fossil forest was used in an interlaboratory test, with results provided by over 70 laboratories. These tests produced a median age of 11,788 ± 8 BP (2σ confidence) which when calibrated gives a date range of 13,730 to 13,550 cal BP. The Two Creeks radiocarbon dates are now regarded as a key result in developing the modern understanding of North American glaciation at the end of the Pleistocene.

====Dead Sea Scrolls====

In 1947, scrolls were discovered in caves near the Dead Sea that proved to contain writing in Hebrew and Aramaic, most of which are thought to have been produced by the Essenes, a small Jewish sect. These scrolls are of great significance in the study of Biblical texts because many of them contain the earliest known version of books of the Hebrew bible. A sample of the linen wrapping from one of these scrolls, the Great Isaiah Scroll, was included in a 1955 analysis by Libby, with an estimated age of 1,917 ± 200 years. Based on an analysis of the writing style, palaeographic estimates were made of the age of 21 of the scrolls, and samples from most of these, along with other scrolls which had not been palaeographically dated, were tested by two AMS laboratories in the 1990s. The results ranged in age from the early 4th century BC to the mid 4th century AD. In all but two cases the scrolls were determined to be within 100 years of the palaeographically determined age. The Isaiah scroll was included in the testing and was found to have two possible date ranges at a 2σ confidence level, because of the shape of the calibration curve at that point: there is a 15% chance that it dates from 355 to 295 BC, and an 84% chance that it dates from 210 to 45 BC. Subsequently, these dates were criticized on the grounds that before the scrolls were tested, they had been treated with modern castor oil in order to make the writing easier to read; it was argued that failure to remove the castor oil sufficiently would have caused the dates to be too young. Multiple papers have been published both supporting and opposing the criticism.

===Impact===
Soon after the publication of Libby&#x27;s 1949 paper in &quot;Science&quot;, universities around the world began establishing radiocarbon-dating laboratories, and by the end of the 1950s there were more than 20 active research laboratories. It quickly became apparent that the principles of radiocarbon dating were valid, despite certain discrepancies, the causes of which then remained unknown.

The development of radiocarbon dating has had a profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the &quot;radiocarbon revolution&quot;. In the words of anthropologist R. E. Taylor, &quot; data made a &quot;world&quot; prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries&quot;. It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology since better data recording leads to a firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.

The dating framework provided by radiocarbon led to a change in the prevailing view of how innovations spread through prehistoric Europe. Researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent, or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them. As radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances, it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally. This has been described as a &quot;second radiocarbon revolution&quot;. More broadly, the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data. Taylor has also described the impact of AMS, and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples, as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution.

Occasionally, radiocarbon dating techniques date an object of popular interest, for example, the Shroud of Turin, a piece of linen cloth thought by some to bear an image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. Three separate laboratories dated samples of linen from the Shroud in 1988; the results pointed to 14th-century origins, raising doubts about the shroud&#x27;s authenticity as an alleged 1st-century relic.

Researchers have studied other isotopes created by cosmic rays to determine if they could also be used to assist in dating objects of archaeological interest; such isotopes include , , , , and . With the development of AMS in the 1980s it became possible to measure these isotopes precisely enough for them to be the basis of useful dating techniques, which have been primarily applied to dating rocks. Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes can also form the basis of dating methods, as with potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating, and uranium series dating. Other dating techniques of interest to archaeologists include thermoluminescence, optically stimulated luminescence, electron spin resonance, and fission track dating, as well as techniques that depend on annual bands or layers, such as dendrochronology, tephrochronology, and varve chronology.

<text>Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen (, ; ; 16 July 1872 – ) was a Norwegian explorer of polar regions. He was a key figure of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.

Born in Borge, Østfold, Norway, Amundsen began his career as a polar explorer as first mate on Adrien de Gerlache&#x27;s Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897–1899. From 1903 to 1906, he led the first expedition to successfully traverse the Northwest Passage on the sloop &quot;Gjøa&quot;. In 1909, Amundsen began planning for a South Pole expedition. He left Norway in June 1910 on the ship &quot;Fram&quot; and reached Antarctica in January 1911. His party established a camp at the Bay of Whales and a series of supply depots on the Barrier (now known as the Ross Ice Shelf) before setting out for the pole in October. The party of five, led by Amundsen, became the first to reach the South Pole on 14 December 1911.

Following a failed attempt in 1918 to reach the North Pole by traversing the Northeast Passage on the ship &quot;Maud&quot;, Amundsen began planning for an aerial expedition instead. On 12 May 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men in the airship &quot;Norge&quot; became the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen disappeared in June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission for the airship in the Arctic. The search for his remains, which have not been found, was called off that September.

== Early life ==

Amundsen was born into a family of Norwegian shipowners and captains in Borge, between the towns Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg. His parents were Jens Amundsen and Hanna Sahlqvist. Roald was the fourth son in the family. His mother wanted him to avoid the family maritime trade and encouraged him to become a doctor, a promise that Amundsen kept until his mother died when he was aged 21. He promptly quit university for a life at sea.

Amundsen was in the Uranienborg neighbourhood an occasional childhood playmate of the pioneering Antarctica explorer Carsten Borchgrevink.

When he was fifteen years old, Amundsen was enthralled by reading Sir John Franklin&#x27;s narratives of his overland Arctic expeditions. Amundsen wrote &quot;I read them with a fervid fascination which has shaped the whole course of my life&quot;.

Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as first mate at the age of 25 in 1897. This expedition, led by Adrien de Gerlache using the ship the RV &quot;Belgica&quot;, became the first expedition to overwinter in Antarctica. The &quot;Belgica&quot;, whether by mistake or design, became locked in the sea ice at 70°30′S off Alexander Island, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The crew endured a winter for which they were poorly prepared.

By Amundsen&#x27;s own estimation, the doctor for the expedition, the American Frederick Cook, probably saved the crew from scurvy by hunting for animals and feeding the crew fresh meat. In cases where citrus fruits are lacking, raw meat – particularly offal – from animals often contains enough vitamin C to prevent scurvy.

=== The Northwest Passage ===

In 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to traverse Canada&#x27;s Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He planned a small expedition of six men in a fishing vessel, , to have flexibility. His ship had relatively shallow draft. His technique was to use a small ship and hug the coast. Amundsen had the ship outfitted with a small 13 horsepower single-screw paraffin (diesel) engine.

They travelled via Baffin Bay, the Parry Channel and then south through Peel Sound, James Ross Strait, Simpson Strait and Rae Strait. They spent two winters at King William Island, in the harbor of what is today Gjoa Haven. During this time, Amundsen and the crew learned from the local Netsilik Inuit about Arctic survival skills, which he found invaluable in his later expedition to the South Pole. For example, he learned to use sled dogs for the transport of goods and to wear animal skins in lieu of heavy, woolen parkas, which could not keep out the cold when wet.

Leaving Gjoa Haven, he sailed west and passed Cambridge Bay, which had been reached from the west by Richard Collinson in 1852. Continuing to the south of Victoria Island, the ship cleared the Canadian Arctic Archipelago on . It had to stop for the winter before going on to Nome on Alaska&#x27;s Pacific coast. The nearest telegraph station was away in Eagle. Amundsen travelled there overland to wire a success message on 5 December, then returned to Nome in 1906. Later that year he was elected to the American Antiquarian Society.

Amundsen learned of the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, and that he had a new king. The explorer sent the new king, Haakon VII, news that his traversing the Northwest Passage &quot;was a great achievement for Norway&quot;. He said he hoped to do more and signed it &quot;Your loyal subject, Roald Amundsen&quot;. The crew returned to Oslo in November 1906, after almost three and a half years abroad. &quot;Gjøa&quot; was returned to Norway in 1972. After a trip from San Francisco on a bulk carrier, she was placed on land outside the Fram Museum in Oslo, where she is now situated inside her own building at the museum.

=== South Pole Expedition ===

Amundsen next planned to take an expedition to the North Pole and explore the Arctic Basin. Finding it difficult to raise funds, when he heard in 1909 that the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had claimed to reach the North Pole as a result of two different expeditions, he decided to reroute to Antarctica. He was not clear about his intentions, and Robert F. Scott and the Norwegian supporters felt misled. Scott was planning his own expedition to the South Pole that year. Using the ship , earlier used by Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen left Oslo for the south on 3 June 1910. At Madeira, Amundsen alerted his men that they would be heading to Antarctica, and sent a telegram to Scott: &quot;Beg to inform you &quot;Fram&quot; proceeding Antarctic – Amundsen.&quot;

Nearly six months later, the expedition arrived at the eastern edge of the Ross Ice Shelf (then known as &quot;the Great Ice Barrier&quot;), at a large inlet called the Bay of Whales, on 14 January 1911. Amundsen established his base camp there, calling it . Amundsen eschewed the heavy wool clothing worn on earlier Antarctic attempts in favour of adopting Inuit-style furred skins.

Using skis and dog sleds for transportation, Amundsen and his men created supply depots at 80°, 81° and 82° South on the Barrier, along a line directly south to the Pole. Amundsen also planned to kill most of his dogs on the way and use them as a source for fresh meat. As he went he butchered some of the dogs and fed them to the remaining dogs, as well as eating some himself. A small group, including Hjalmar Johansen, Kristian Prestrud and Jørgen Stubberud, set out on 8 September, but had to abandon their trek due to extreme temperatures. The painful retreat caused a quarrel within the group, and Amundsen sent Johansen and the other two men to explore King Edward VII Land.

A second attempt, with a team of five made up of Olav Bjaaland, Helmer Hanssen, Sverre Hassel, Oscar Wisting and Amundsen, departed base camp on 19 October. They took four sledges and 52 dogs. Using a route along the previously unknown Axel Heiberg Glacier, they arrived at the edge of the Polar Plateau on 21 November after a four-day climb. The team and 16 dogs arrived at the pole on 14 December, a month before Scott&#x27;s group. Amundsen named their South Pole camp Polheim. Amundsen renamed the Antarctic Plateau as King Haakon VII&#x27;s Plateau. They left a small tent and letter stating their accomplishment, in case they did not return safely to Framheim.

The team arrived at Framheim on 25 January 1912, with 11 surviving dogs. They made their way off the continent and to Hobart, Australia, where Amundsen publicly announced his success on 7 March 1912. He telegraphed news to backers.

Amundsen&#x27;s expedition benefited from his careful preparation, good equipment, appropriate clothing, a simple primary task, an understanding of dogs and their handling, and the effective use of skis. In contrast to the misfortunes of Scott&#x27;s team, Amundsen&#x27;s trek proved relatively smooth and uneventful.

== North Polar Expeditions and the Northeast Passage ==

=== The Northeast Passage ===

In 1918, an expedition Amundsen began with a new ship, , lasted until 1925. &quot;Maud&quot; was carefully navigated through the ice west to east through the Northeast Passage. With him on this expedition were Oscar Wisting and Helmer Hanssen, both of whom had been part of the team to reach the South Pole. In addition, Henrik Lindstrøm was included as a cook. He suffered a stroke and was so physically reduced that he could not participate.

The goal of the expedition was to explore the unknown areas of the Arctic Ocean, strongly inspired by Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s earlier expedition with &quot;Fram&quot;. The plan was to sail along the coast of Siberia and go into the ice farther to the north and east than Nansen had. In contrast to Amundsen&#x27;s earlier expeditions, this was expected to yield more material for academic research, and he carried the geophysicist Harald Sverdrup on board.

The voyage was to the northeasterly direction over the Kara Sea. Amundsen planned to freeze the &quot;Maud&quot; into the polar ice cap and drift towards the North Poleas Nansen had done with the &quot;Fram&quot;and he did so off Cape Chelyuskin. But, the ice became so thick that the ship was unable to break free, although it was designed for such a journey in heavy ice. In September 1919, the crew got the ship loose from the ice, but it froze again after eleven days somewhere between the New Siberian Islands and Wrangel Island.

During this time, Amundsen suffered a broken arm and was attacked by a polar bear. As a result, he participated little in the work outdoors, such as sleigh rides and hunting. He, Hanssen, and Wisting, along with two other men, embarked on an expedition by dog sled to Nome, Alaska, more than away. But they found that the ice was not frozen solid in the Bering Strait, and it could not be crossed. They sent a telegram from Anadyr to signal their location.

After two winters frozen in the ice, without having achieved the goal of drifting over the North Pole, Amundsen decided to go to Nome to repair the ship and buy provisions. Several of the crew ashore there, including Hanssen, did not return on time to the ship. Amundsen considered Hanssen to be in breach of contract, and dismissed him from the crew.

During the third winter, &quot;Maud&quot; was frozen in the western Bering Strait. She finally became free and the expedition sailed south, reaching Seattle, in the American Pacific Northwest in 1921 for repairs. Amundsen returned to Norway, needing to put his finances in order. He took with him two young indigenous girls, a four-year-old he adopted, Kakonita, and her companion Camilla. When Amundsen went bankrupt two years later, however, he sent the girls to be cared for by Camilla&#x27;s father, who lived in eastern Russia.

In June 1922, Amundsen returned to &quot;Maud&quot;, which had been sailed to Nome. He decided to shift from the planned naval expedition to aerial ones, and arranged to charter a plane. He divided the expedition team in two: one part, led by him, was to winter over and prepare for an attempt to fly over the pole in 1923. The second team on &quot;Maud&quot;, under the command of Wisting, was to resume the original plan to drift over the North Pole in the ice. The ship drifted in the ice for three years east of the New Siberian Islands, never reaching the North Pole. It was finally seized by Amundsen&#x27;s creditors as collateral for his mounting debt.

Although they were unable to reach the North Pole, the scientific results of the expedition, mainly the work of Sverdrup, have proven to be of considerable value. Much of the carefully collected scientific data was lost during the ill-fated journey of Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, two crew members sent on a mission by Amundsen. The scientific materials were later retrieved in 1922 by Russian scientist Nikolay Urvantsev from where they had been abandoned on the shores of the Kara Sea.

=== Aerial expeditions to the North Pole ===
The 1923 attempt to fly over the Pole failed. Amundsen and Oskar Omdal, of the Royal Norwegian Navy, tried to fly from Wainwright, Alaska, to Spitsbergen across the North Pole. When their aircraft was damaged, they abandoned the journey. To raise additional funds, Amundsen travelled around the United States in 1924 on a lecture tour.

In 1925, accompanied by Lincoln Ellsworth, pilot Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, flight mechanic Karl Feucht and two other team members (pilot Leif Dietrichson and mechanic Oskar Omdal), Amundsen took two Dornier Do J flying boats, the N-24 and N-25, to 87° 44′ north. It was the northernmost latitude reached by plane up to that time. The aircraft landed a few miles apart without radio contact, yet the crews managed to reunite. The N-24 was damaged. Amundsen and his crew worked for more than three weeks to clean up an airstrip to take off from ice. They shovelled 600 tons of ice while consuming only of daily food rations. In the end, the six crew members were packed into the N-25. In a remarkable feat, Riiser-Larsen took off, the flying boat barely becoming airborne over the cracking ice. They returned triumphant when everyone thought they had been lost forever.

In 1926, Amundsen and 15 other men (including Ellsworth, Riiser-Larsen, Oscar Wisting, and the Italian air crew led by aeronautical engineer Umberto Nobile) made the first crossing of the Arctic in the airship &quot;Norge,&quot; designed by Nobile. They left Spitsbergen on 11 May 1926, flew over the North Pole on 12 May, and landed in Alaska the following day.

===Controversy over Polar Priority===
The three previous claims to have arrived at the North Pole, by the Americans Frederick Cook in 1908; Robert Peary in 1909; and Richard E. Byrd in 1926 (just a few days before the &quot;Norge&quot;) are disputed by some, as being either of dubious accuracy or outright fraudulent. If these other claims are false, the crew of the &quot;Norge&quot; would be the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole, when they floated over it in the &quot;Norge&quot; in 1926. If the &quot;Norge&quot; expedition was the first to the North Pole, Amundsen and Oscar Wisting were the first men to have reached both geographical poles, by ground or by air.

== Disappearance and death ==

Amundsen disappeared on 18 June 1928 while flying on a rescue mission in the Arctic. His team included Norwegian pilot Leif Dietrichson, French pilot René Guilbaud, and three more Frenchmen. They were seeking missing members of Nobile&#x27;s crew, whose new airship had crashed while returning from the North Pole. Amundsen&#x27;s French Latham 47 flying boat never returned.

Later, a wing-float and bottom gasoline tank from the plane, which had been adapted as a replacement wing-float, were found near the Tromsø coast. It is assumed that the plane crashed in the Barents Sea, and that Amundsen and his crew were killed in the wreck, or died shortly afterward. The search for Amundsen and team was called off in September 1928 by the Norwegian government, and the bodies were never found.

In 2004 and in late August 2009, the Royal Norwegian Navy used the unmanned submarine &quot;Hugin 1000&quot; to search for the wreckage of Amundsen&#x27;s plane. The searches focused on a area of the sea floor, and were documented by the German production company ContextTV. They found nothing from the Amundsen flight.

==Personal life==
Amundsen was a lifelong bachelor, but he had a long-time relationship with the Norwegian-born Kristine Elisabeth (&#x27;Kiss&#x27;) Bennett, the wife of an Englishman, Charles Peto Bennett. He met her in London in 1907 and they remained close for many years; Amundsen kept the relationship a secret from everyone outside his intimate circle. Later, he became engaged to Bess Magids, an American divorcée whom he had met in Alaska. Though there is little evidence, it was said that Amundsen had a brief affair with his landlady in Antwerp—until he came home and found her dead after an apparent suicide. His biographer Tor Bomann-Larsen also suggests a romantic relationship between Amundsen and Sigrid Castberg, wife of the lawyer Leif Castberg from Gjøvik, in the years before the South Pole expedition, a relationship Amundsen broke off after that expedition in favour of Kiss Bennett.

Author Julian Sancton noted that in his younger years, Amundsen was said to have ignored romantic relationships in pursuit of his goals. He &quot;found little use in activities that didn&#x27;t help him fulfill his polar ambitions&quot;.

==Orders and decorations==
==Legacy==

Owing to Amundsen&#x27;s numerous significant accomplishments in polar exploration, many places in both the Arctic and Antarctic are named after him. The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, operated by the United States Antarctic Program, was jointly named in honour of Amundsen and his British rival Robert Falcon Scott. The Amundsen crater on the Moon was named after him; the rim of the crater is being considered by NASA as a potential landing location for their Artemis III lunar lander.

Built in 1929 and opened in 1930, Amundsen High School opened its doors in Chicago&#x27;s Ravenswood neighborhood.

Joachim Calmeyer portrayed Amundsen in the 1968 film &quot;Bare et liv – historien om Fridtjof Nansen&quot;, which covers events from the life of Fridtjof Nansen.

The 1969 film &quot;The Red Tent&quot; tells the story of the Nobile expedition and Amundsen&#x27;s disappearance. Sean Connery plays Amundsen.

A book &quot;Scott and Amundsen&quot;, by Roland Huntford, was adapted into the TV serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;. It aired in 1985 and features Sverre Anker Ousdal as Amundsen.

On 15 February 2019, a biographic Norwegian film titled &quot;Amundsen&quot;, directed by Espen Sandberg, was released.

==European-Inuit descendant claims==
At least two Inuit in Gjøa Haven with European ancestry have claimed to be descendants of Amundsen, from the period of their extended winter stay on King William Island from 1903 to 1905. Accounts by members of the expedition told of their relations with Inuit women, and historians have speculated that Amundsen might also have taken a partner, although he wrote a warning against this.

Specifically, half-brothers Bob Konona and Paul Ikuallaq say that their father Luke Ikuallaq told them on his deathbed that he was the son of Amundsen. Konona said that their father Ikuallaq was left out on the ice to die after his birth, as his European ancestry made him illegitimate to the Inuit, threatening their community. His Inuit grandparents saved him.

In 2012, Y-DNA analysis, with the families&#x27; permission, showed that Ikuallaq was not a match to the direct male line of Amundsen. Not all descendants claiming European ancestry have been tested for a match to Amundsen, nor has there been a comparison of Ikuallaq&#x27;s DNA to that of other European members of Amundsen&#x27;s crew.

<text>Richard Lovelace (, homophone of &quot;loveless&quot;; 9 December 1617 – 1657) was an English poet in the seventeenth century. He was a cavalier poet who fought on behalf of Charles I during the English Civil War. His best known works are &quot;To Althea, from Prison&quot;, and &quot;To Lucasta, Going to the Warres&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Richard Lovelace was born on 9 December 1617. His exact birthplace is unknown, and may have been Woolwich, Kent, or Holland. He was the oldest son of Sir William Lovelace and Anne Barne Lovelace. He had four brothers and three sisters. His father was from a distinguished military and legal family; the Lovelace family owned a considerable amount of property in Kent.

His father, Sir William Lovelace, was a member of the Virginia Company and an incorporator in the second Virginia Company in 1609. He was a soldier and died during the war with Spain and the Dutch Republic in the Siege of Groenlo (1627) a few days before the town fell. Richard was nine years old when his father died.

Lovelace&#x27;s father was the son of Sir William Lovelace and Elizabeth Aucher, who was the daughter of Mabel Wroths and Edward Aucher, who inherited, under his father&#x27;s will, the manors of Bishopsbourne and Hautsborne. Elizabeth&#x27;s nephew was Sir Anthony Aucher (1614 – 31 May 1692) an English politician and Cavalier during the English Civil War. He was the son of her brother Sir Anthony Aucher and his wife Hester Collett.

Lovelace&#x27;s mother, Anne Barne (1587–1633), was the daughter of Sir William Barne and the granddaughter of Sir George Barne III (1532–1593), the Lord Mayor of London and a prominent merchant and public official from London during the reign of Elizabeth I and Anne Gerrard, daughter of Sir William Garrard, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1555.

Lovelace&#x27;s maternal grandmother was Anne Sandys. His great-grandmother was Cicely Wilford and his great-grandfather Most Reverend Dr Edwin Sandys, an Anglican church leader who successively held the posts of Bishop of Worcester (1559–1570), Bishop of London (1570–1576), and Archbishop of York (1576–1588) and was one of the translators of the Bishops&#x27; Bible.

His mother, Anne Barne Lovelace, married as her second husband, on 20 January 1630, at Greenwich, England, the Very Rev Dr Jonathan Browne. They were the parents of one child, Anne Browne, Richard&#x27;s half-sister, who married Herbert Croft, later Bishop of Hereford, and was the mother of Sir Herbert Croft, 1st Baronet see Croft baronets.

Lovelace&#x27;s brother, Francis Lovelace (1621–1675), was the second governor of the New York Colony appointed by the Duke of York, later King James II of England. They were also great nephews of both George Sandys (2 March 1577 – March 1644), an English traveller, colonist and poet; and of Sir Edwin Sandys (9 December 1561 – October 1629), an English statesman and one of the founders of the London Company.

In 1629, when Lovelace was eleven, he went to Sutton&#x27;s Foundation at Charterhouse School, then in London. There is no clear record that Lovelace actually attended; it is believed that he studied as a &quot;boarder&quot; because he did not need financial assistance like the &quot;scholars&quot;. He spent five years at Charterhouse, three of which were spent with Richard Crashaw, who also became a poet. On 5 May 1631, Lovelace was sworn in as a Gentleman Wayter Extraordinary to King Charles I, an honorary position for which one paid a fee. He went on to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1634.
==Collegiate career==
Lovelace attended the University of Oxford and was praised by his contemporary Anthony Wood as &quot;the most amiable and beautiful person that ever eye beheld; a person also of innate modesty, virtue and courtly deportment, which made him then, but especially after, when he retired to the great city, much admired and adored by the female sex&quot;.

While at college, he tried to portray himself more as a social connoisseur than as a scholar, continuing his image of being a Cavalier. Being a Cavalier poet, Lovelace wrote to praise a friend or fellow poet, to give advice in grief or love, to define a relationship, to articulate the precise amount of attention a man owes a woman, to celebrate beauty, and to persuade to love. Lovelace wrote a comedy, &quot;The Scholars&quot;, while at Oxford. He then left for the University of Cambridge for a few months, where he met Lord Goring, who led him into political trouble.

At the age of eighteen he was granted the degree of Master of Arts at Oxford University.

==Politics and prison==
Lovelace&#x27;s poetry was often influenced by his experiences with politics and association with important figures of his time. At the age of nineteen he contributed a verse to a volume of elegies commemorating Princess Katharine. In 1639 Lovelace joined the regiment of Lord Goring, serving first as a senior ensign and later as a captain in the Bishops&#x27; Wars. This experience inspired &quot;Sonnet. To Generall Goring&quot;, the poem &quot;To Lucasta, Going to the Warres&quot; and the tragedy &quot;The Soldier&quot;. On his return to his home in Kent in 1640, Lovelace served as a country gentleman and a justice of the peace, encountering civil turmoil over religion and politics.

In 1641, Lovelace led a group of men to seize and destroy a petition for the abolition of Episcopal rule, which had been signed by 15,000 people. The following year he presented the House of Commons with Dering&#x27;s pro-Royalist petition which was supposed to have been burned. These actions resulted in Lovelace&#x27;s first imprisonment. He was shortly released on bail, with the stipulation that he avoid communication with the House of Commons without permission. This prevented Lovelace, who had done everything to prove himself during the Bishops&#x27; Wars, from participating in the first phase of the English Civil War. This first experience of imprisonment brought him to write one of his best known lyrics, &quot;To Althea, from Prison&quot;, in which he illustrates his noble and paradoxical nature. Lovelace did everything he could to remain in the king&#x27;s favour despite his inability to participate in the war.

During the political chaos of 1648 he was again imprisoned, this time for nearly a year. When he was released in April 1649, the king had been executed and Lovelace&#x27;s cause seemed lost. As in his previous incarceration, this experience led to creative production—this time in the cause of spiritual freedom, as reflected in the release of his first volume of poetry, &quot;Lucasta&quot;. &quot;Lucasta&quot; was Lovelace&#x27;s Muse, thought to be Lucy Sacheverell.

Lovelace died in 1657 and was buried in St Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street in the City of London.

==Literature==
From the time Richard Lovelace started writing while he was a student at Oxford he wrote almost 200 poems. His first work was a drama, &quot;The Scholars&quot;, never published but performed at college and then in London. In 1640, he wrote a tragedy, &quot;The Soldier&quot; based on his military experience. When serving in the Bishops&#x27; Wars, he wrote the sonnet &quot;To Generall Goring&quot;, a poem of Bacchanalian celebration rather than a glorification of military action. &quot;To Lucasta, Going to the Warres&quot;, written in 1640, concerned his first political action. &quot;To Althea, From Prison&quot; was written during his first imprisonment in 1642. Later that year, during his travels to Holland with General Goring, he wrote &quot;The Rose&quot;, followed by &quot;The Scrutiny&quot;. On 14 May 1649, &quot;Lucasta&quot; was published. He also wrote poems on animal life: &quot;The Ant&quot;, &quot;The Grasse-hopper&quot;, &quot;The Snayl&quot;, &quot;The Falcon&quot;, &quot;The Toad and Spyder&quot;. In 1660, after Lovelace died, &quot;Lucasta: Postume Poems&quot; was published; it contains &quot;A Mock-Song&quot;, which has a darker tone than his previous works.

William Winstanley thought highly of Lovelace&#x27;s work and compared him to an idol: &quot;I can compare no Man so like this Colonel Lovelace as Sir Philip Sidney&quot; of which it is in an Epitaph made of him;
:Nor is it fit that more I should 
: Lest Men adore in one
: A Scholar, , Lover, and a Saint

His most quoted excerpts are from the beginning of the last stanza of &quot;To Althea, From Prison&quot;:

:Stone walls do not a prison make,
:Nor iron bars a cage;
:Minds innocent and quiet take
:That for an hermitage

and the end of &quot;To Lucasta. Going to the Warres&quot;:

:I could not love thee, dear, so much,
:Lov&#x27;d I not Honour more.

<text>In electronics and computer science, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is a computer architecture designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the computer to accomplish tasks. Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task because the individual instructions are written in simpler code. The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline, which may be simpler to achieve given simpler instructions.

The key operational concept of the RISC computer is that each instruction performs only one function (e.g. copy a value from memory to a register). The RISC computer usually has many (16 or 32) high-speed, general-purpose registers with a load–store architecture in which the code for the register-register instructions (for performing arithmetic and tests) are separate from the instructions that access the main memory of the computer. The design of the CPU allows RISC computers few simple addressing modes and predictable instruction times that simplify design of the system as a whole.

The conceptual developments of the RISC computer architecture began with the IBM 801 project in the late 1970s, but these were not immediately put into use. Designers in California picked up the 801 concepts in two seminal projects, Stanford MIPS and Berkeley RISC. These were commercialized in the 1980s as the MIPS and SPARC systems. IBM eventually produced RISC designs based on further work on the 801 concept, the IBM POWER architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As the projects matured, many similar designs, produced in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, such as ARM, PA-RISC, and Alpha, created central processing units that increased the commercial utility of the Unix workstation and of embedded processors in the laser printer, the router, and similar products.

In the minicomputer market, companies that included Celerity Computing, Pyramid Technology, and Ridge Computers began offering systems designed according to RISC or RISC-like principles in the early 1980s. Few of these designs began by using RISC microprocessors.

The varieties of RISC processor design include the ARC processor, the DEC Alpha, the AMD Am29000, the ARM architecture, the Atmel AVR, Blackfin, Intel i860, Intel i960, LoongArch, Motorola 88000, the MIPS architecture, PA-RISC, Power ISA, RISC-V, SuperH, and SPARC. RISC processors are used in supercomputers, such as the Fugaku.

==History and development==
A number of systems, going back to the 1960s, have been credited as the first RISC architecture, partly based on their use of the load–store approach. The term RISC was coined by David Patterson of the Berkeley RISC project, although somewhat similar concepts had appeared before.

The CDC 6600 designed by Seymour Cray in 1964 used a load–store architecture with only two addressing modes (register+register, and register+immediate constant) and 74 operation codes, with the basic clock cycle being 10 times faster than the memory access time. Partly due to the optimized load–store architecture of the CDC 6600, Jack Dongarra says that it can be considered a forerunner of modern RISC systems, although a number of other technical barriers needed to be overcome for the development of a modern RISC system.

===IBM 801===
Michael J. Flynn views the first RISC system as the IBM 801 design, begun in 1975 by John Cocke and completed in 1980. The 801 developed out of an effort to build a 24-bit high-speed processor to use as the basis for a digital telephone switch. To reach their goal of switching 1 million calls per hour (300 per second) they calculated that the CPU required performance on the order of 12 million instructions per second (MIPS), compared to their fastest mainframe machine of the time, the 370/168, which performed at 3.5 MIPS.

The design was based on a study of IBM&#x27;s extensive collection of statistics gathered from their customers. This demonstrated that code in high-performance settings made extensive use of processor registers, and that they often ran out of them. This suggested that additional registers would improve performance. Additionally, they noticed that compilers generally ignored the vast majority of the available instructions, especially orthogonal addressing modes. Instead, they selected the fastest version of any given instruction and then constructed small routines using it. This suggested that the majority of instructions could be removed without affecting the resulting code. These two conclusions worked in concert; removing instructions would allow the instruction opcodes to be shorter, freeing up bits in the instruction word which could then be used to select among a larger set of registers.

The telephone switch program was canceled in 1975, but by then the team had demonstrated that the same design would offer significant performance gains running just about any code. In simulations, they showed that a compiler tuned to use registers wherever possible would run code about three times as fast as traditional designs. Somewhat surprisingly, the same code would run about 50% faster even on existing machines due to the improved register use. In practice, their experimental PL/8 compiler, a slightly cut-down version of PL/I, consistently produced code that ran much faster on their existing mainframes.

A 32-bit version of the 801 was eventually produced in a single-chip form as the IBM ROMP in 1981, which stood for &#x27;Research OPD [Office Products Division] Micro Processor&#x27;. This CPU was designed for &quot;mini&quot; tasks, and found use in peripheral interfaces and channel controllers on later IBM computers. It was also used as the CPU in the IBM RT PC in 1986, which turned out to be a commercial failure. Although the 801 did not see widespread use in its original form, it inspired many research projects, including ones at IBM that would eventually lead to the IBM POWER architecture.

===Berkeley RISC and Stanford MIPS===
By the late 1970s, the 801 had become well-known in the industry. This coincided with new fabrication techniques that were allowing more complex chips to come to market. The Zilog Z80 of 1976 had 8,000 transistors, whereas the 1979 Motorola 68000 (68k) had 68,000. These newer designs generally used their newfound complexity to expand the instruction set to make it more orthogonal. Most, like the 68k, used microcode to do this, reading instructions and re-implementing them as a sequence of simpler internal instructions. In the 68k, a full of the transistors were used for this microcoding.

In 1979, David Patterson was sent on a sabbatical from the University of California, Berkeley to help DEC&#x27;s west-coast team improve the VAX microcode. Patterson was struck by the complexity of the coding process and concluded it was untenable. He first wrote a paper on ways to improve microcoding, but later changed his mind and decided microcode itself was the problem. With funding from the DARPA VLSI Program, Patterson started the Berkeley RISC effort. The Program, practically unknown today, led to a huge number of advances in chip design, fabrication, and even computer graphics. Considering a variety of programs from their BSD Unix variant, the Berkeley team found, as had IBM, that most programs made no use of the large variety of instructions in the 68k.

Patterson&#x27;s early work pointed out an important problem with the traditional &quot;more is better&quot; approach; even those instructions that were critical to overall performance were being delayed by their trip through the microcode. If the microcode was removed, the programs would run faster. And since the microcode ultimately took a complex instruction and broke it into steps, there was no reason the compiler could not do this instead. These studies suggested that, even with no other changes, one could make a chip with fewer transistors that would run faster. In the original RISC-I paper they noted:

Skipping this extra level of interpretation appears to enhance performance while reducing chip size.

It was also discovered that, on microcoded implementations of certain architectures, complex operations tended to be &quot;slower&quot; than a sequence of simpler operations doing the same thing. This was in part an effect of the fact that many designs were rushed, with little time to optimize or tune every instruction; only those used most often were optimized, and a sequence of those instructions could be faster than a less-tuned instruction performing an equivalent operation as that sequence. One infamous example was the VAX&#x27;s codice_1 instruction.

The Berkeley work also turned up a number of additional points. Among these was the fact that programs spent a significant amount of time performing subroutine calls and returns, and it seemed there was the potential to improve overall performance by speeding these calls. This led the Berkeley design to select a method known as register windows which can significantly improve subroutine performance although at the cost of some complexity. They also noticed that the majority of mathematical instructions were simple assignments; only of them actually performed an operation like addition or subtraction. But when those operations did occur, they tended to be slow. This led to far more emphasis on the underlying arithmetic data unit, as opposed to previous designs where the majority of the chip was dedicated to control and microcode.

The resulting Berkeley RISC was based on gaining performance through the use of pipelining and aggressive use of register windowing. In a traditional CPU, one has a small number of registers, and a program can use any register at any time. In a CPU with register windows, there are a huge number of registers, e.g., 128, but programs can only use a small number of them, e.g., eight, at any one time. A program that limits itself to eight registers per procedure can make very fast procedure calls: The call simply moves the window &quot;down&quot; by eight, to the set of eight registers used by that procedure, and the return moves the window back. The Berkeley RISC project delivered the RISC-I processor in 1982. Consisting of only 44,420 transistors (compared with averages of about 100,000 in newer CISC designs of the era), RISC-I had only 32 instructions, and yet completely outperformed any other single-chip design, with estimated performance being higher than the VAX. They followed this up with the 40,760-transistor, 39-instruction RISC-II in 1983, which ran over three times as fast as RISC-I.

As the RISC project began to become known in Silicon Valley, a similar project began at Stanford University in 1981. This MIPS project grew out of a graduate course by John L. Hennessy, produced a functioning system in 1983, and could run simple programs by 1984. The MIPS approach emphasized an aggressive clock cycle and the use of the pipeline, making sure it could be run as &quot;full&quot; as possible. The MIPS system was followed by the MIPS-X and in 1984 Hennessy and his colleagues formed MIPS Computer Systems to produce the design commercially. The venture resulted in a new architecture that was also called MIPS and the R2000 microprocessor in 1985.

The overall philosophy of the RISC concept was widely understood by the second half of the 1980s, and led the designers of the MIPS-X to put it this way in 1987:

Competition between RISC and conventional CISC approaches was also the subject of theoretical analysis in the early 1980s, leading, for example, to the iron law of processor performance.
Since 2010, a new open standard instruction set architecture (ISA), Berkeley RISC-V, has been under development at the University of California, Berkeley, for research purposes and as a free alternative to proprietary ISAs. As of 2014, version 2 of the user space ISA is fixed. The ISA is designed to be extensible from a barebones core sufficient for a small embedded processor to supercomputer and cloud computing use with standard and chip designer–defined extensions and coprocessors. It has been tested in silicon design with the ROCKET SoC, which is also available as an open-source processor generator in the CHISEL language.

===Commercial breakout===
In the early 1980s, significant uncertainties surrounded the RISC concept. One concern involved the use of memory; a single instruction from a traditional processor like the Motorola 68k may be written out as perhaps a half dozen of the simpler RISC instructions. In theory, this could slow the system down as it spent more time fetching instructions from memory. But by the mid-1980s, the concepts had matured enough to be seen as commercially viable.

Commercial RISC designs began to emerge in the mid-1980s. The Acorn ARM1 appeared in April 1985, MIPS R2000 appeared in January 1986, followed shortly thereafter by Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PA-RISC in some of their computers. In the meantime, the Berkeley effort had become so well known that it eventually became the name for the entire concept. In 1987 Sun Microsystems began shipping systems with the SPARC processor, directly based on the Berkeley RISC-II system. The US government Committee on Innovations in Computing and Communications credits the acceptance of the viability of the RISC concept to the success of the SPARC system. By 1989 many RISC CPUs were available; competition lowered their price to $10 per MIPS in large quantities, much less expensive than the sole sourced Intel 80386. The performance of IBM&#x27;s RISC CPU—only available in the RT PC—was less competitive than others, but the success of SPARC renewed interest within IBM, which released new RISC systems by 1990 and by 1995 RISC processors were the foundation of a $15 billion server industry.

By the later 1980s, the new RISC designs were easily outperforming all traditional designs by a wide margin. At that point, all of the other vendors began RISC efforts of their own. Among these were the DEC Alpha, AMD Am29000, Intel i860 and i960, Motorola 88000, IBM POWER, and, slightly later, the IBM/Apple/Motorola PowerPC. Many of these have since disappeared due to them often offering no competitive advantage over others of the same era. Those that remain are often used only in niche markets or as parts of other systems; of the designs from these traditional vendors, only SPARC and POWER have any significant remaining market.

The ARM architecture has been the most widely adopted RISC ISA, initially intended to deliver higher-performance desktop computing, at low cost, and in a restricted thermal package, such as in the Acorn Archimedes, while featuring in the Super Computer League tables, its initial, relatively, lower power and cooling implementation was soon adapted to embedded applications, such as laser printer raster image processing. Acorn, in partnership with Apple Inc, and VLSI, creating ARM Ltd, in 1990, to share R&amp;D costs and find new markets for the ISA, who in partnership with TI, GEC, Sharp, Nokia, Oracle and Digital would develop low-power and embedded RISC designs, and target those market segments, which at the time were niche. With the rise in mobile, automotive, streaming, smart device computing, ARM became the most widely used ISA, the company estimating almost half of all CPUs shipped in history have been ARM.

==Characteristics and design philosophy==

Confusion around the definition of RISC deriving from the formulation of the term, along with the tendency to opportunistically categorize processor architectures with relatively few instructions (or groups of instructions) as RISC architectures, led to attempts to define RISC as a design philosophy. One attempt to do so was expressed as the following:

===Instruction set philosophy===
A common misunderstanding of the phrase &quot;reduced instruction set computer&quot; is that instructions are simply eliminated, resulting in a smaller set of instructions.
In fact, over the years, RISC instruction sets have grown in size, and today many of them have a larger set of instructions than many CISC CPUs. Some RISC processors such as the PowerPC have instruction sets as large as the CISC IBM System/370, for example; conversely, the DEC PDP-8—clearly a CISC CPU because many of its instructions involve multiple memory accesses—has only 8 basic instructions and a few extended instructions.
The term &quot;reduced&quot; in that phrase was intended to describe the fact that the amount of work any single instruction accomplishes is reduced—at most a single data memory cycle—compared to the &quot;complex instructions&quot; of CISC CPUs that may require dozens of data memory cycles in order to execute a single instruction.

The term &quot;load–store architecture&quot; is sometimes preferred.

Another way of looking at the RISC/CISC debate is to consider what is exposed to the compiler. In a CISC processor, the hardware may internally use registers and flag bit in order to implement a single complex instruction such as , but hide those details from the compiler.
The internal operations of a RISC processor are &quot;exposed to the compiler&quot;, leading to the backronym &#x27;Relegate Interesting Stuff to the Compiler&#x27;.

===Instruction format===
Most RISC architectures have fixed-length instructions and a simple encoding, which simplifies fetch, decode, and issue logic considerably. This is among the main goals of the RISC approach.

Some of this is possible only due to the contemporary move to 32-bit formats. For instance, in a typical program, over 30% of all the numeric constants are either 0 or 1, 95% will fit in one byte, and 99% in a 16-bit value. When computers were based on 8- or 16-bit words, it would be difficult to have an immediate combined with the opcode in a single memory word, although certain instructions like increment and decrement did this implicitly by using a different opcode. In contrast, a 32-bit machine has ample room to encode an immediate value, and doing so avoids the need to do a second memory read to pick up the value. This is why many RISC processors allow a 12- or 13-bit constant to be encoded directly into the instruction word.

Assuming a 13-bit constant area, as is the case in the MIPS and RISC designs, another 19 bits are available for the instruction encoding. This leaves ample room to indicate both the opcode and one or two registers. Register-to-register operations, mostly math and logic, require enough bits to encode the two or three registers being used. Most processors use the three-operand format, of the form , in which case three registers numbers are needed. If the processor has 32 registers, each one requires a 5-bit number, for 15 bits. If one of these registers is replaced by an immediate, there is still lots of room to encode the two remaining registers and the opcode. Common instructions found in multi-word systems, like and , which reduce the number of words that have to be read before performing the instruction, are unnecessary in RISC as they can be accomplished with a single register and the immediate value 1.

The original RISC-I format remains a canonical example of the concept. It uses 7 bits for the opcode and a 1-bit flag for conditional codes, the following 5 bits for the destination register, and the next five for the first operand. This leaves 14 bits, the first of which indicates whether the following 13 contain an immediate value or uses only five of them to indicate a register for the second operand. A more complex example is the MIPS encoding, which used only 6 bits for the opcode, followed by two 5-bit registers. The remaining 16 bits could be used in two ways, one as a 16-bit immediate value, or as a 5-bit shift value (used only in shift operations, otherwise zero) and the remaining 6 bits as an extension on the opcode. In the case of register-to-register arithmetic operations, the opcode was 0 and the last 6 bits contained the actual code; those that used an immediate value used the normal opcode field at the front.

One drawback of 32-bit instructions is reduced code density, which is more adverse a characteristic in embedded computing than it is in the workstation and server markets RISC architectures were originally designed to serve. To address this problem, several architectures, such as SuperH (1992), ARM thumb (1994), MIPS16e (2004), Power Variable Length Encoding ISA (2006), RISC-V, and the Adapteva Epiphany, have an optional short, feature-reduced compressed instruction set. Generally, these instructions expose a smaller number of registers and fewer bits for immediate values, and often use a two-operand format to eliminate one register number from instructions. A two-operand format in a system with 16 registers requires 8 bits for register numbers, leaving another 8 for an opcode or other uses. The SH5 also follows this pattern, albeit having evolved in the opposite direction, having added longer 32-bit instructions to an original 16-bit encoding.

===Hardware utilization===
The most characteristic aspect of RISC is executing at least one instruction per cycle. Single-cycle operation is described as &quot;the rapid execution of simple functions that dominate a computer&#x27;s instruction stream&quot;, thus seeking to deliver an average throughput approaching one instruction per cycle for any single instruction stream.

Other features of RISC architectures include:

* Far fewer transistors dedicated to the core logic, which originally allowed designers to increase the size of the register set and increase internal parallelism.
* Uniform instruction format, using single word with the opcode in the same bit positions for simpler decoding
* All general-purpose registers can be used equally as source/destination in all instructions, simplifying compiler design (floating-point registers are often kept separate)
* Simple addressing modes with complex addressing performed by instruction sequences
* Few data types in hardware (no byte string or binary-coded decimal [BCD], for example)

RISC designs are also more likely to feature a Harvard memory model, where the instruction stream and the data stream are conceptually separated; this means that modifying the memory where code is held might not have any effect on the instructions executed by the processor (because the CPU has a separate instruction and data cache), at least until a special synchronization instruction is issued; CISC processors that have separate instruction and data caches generally keep them synchronized automatically, for backwards compatibility with older processors.

Many early RISC designs also shared the characteristic of having a branch delay slot, an instruction space immediately following a jump or branch. The instruction in this space is executed, whether or not the branch is taken (in other words the effect of the branch is delayed). This instruction keeps the ALU of the CPU busy for the extra time normally needed to perform a branch. Nowadays the branch delay slot is considered an unfortunate side effect of a particular strategy for implementing some RISC designs, and modern RISC designs generally do away with it (such as PowerPC and more recent versions of SPARC and MIPS).

Some aspects attributed to the first RISC-&quot;labeled&quot; designs around 1975 include the observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable to take advantage of features intended to facilitate &quot;manual&quot; assembly coding, and that complex addressing modes take many cycles to perform due to the required additional memory accesses. It was argued that such functions would be better performed by sequences of simpler instructions if this could yield implementations small enough to leave room for many registers, reducing the number of slow memory accesses. In these simple designs, most instructions are of uniform length and similar structure, arithmetic operations are restricted to CPU registers and only separate &quot;load&quot; and &quot;store&quot; instructions access memory. These properties enable a better balancing of pipeline stages than before, making RISC pipelines significantly more efficient and allowing higher clock frequencies.

Yet another impetus of both RISC and other designs came from practical measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% of all the constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, to reduce the number of memory accesses, a fixed length machine could store constants in unused bits of the instruction word itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU needs them (much like immediate addressing in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to leave room for a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit instruction word.

Since many real-world programs spend most of their time executing simple operations, some researchers decided to focus on making those operations as fast as possible. The clock rate of a CPU is limited by the time it takes to execute the slowest &quot;sub-operation&quot; of any instruction; decreasing that cycle-time often accelerates the execution of other instructions. The focus on &quot;reduced instructions&quot; led to the resulting machine being called a &quot;reduced instruction set computer&quot; (RISC). The goal was to make instructions so simple that they could &quot;easily&quot; be pipelined, in order to achieve a &quot;single clock&quot; throughput at &quot;high frequencies&quot;. This contrasted with CISC designs whose &quot;crucial arithmetic operations and register transfers&quot; were considered difficult to pipeline.

Later, it was noted that one of the most significant characteristics of RISC processors was that external memory was only accessible by a &quot;load&quot; or &quot;store&quot; instruction. All other instructions were limited to internal registers. This simplified many aspects of processor design: allowing instructions to be fixed-length, simplifying pipelines, and isolating the logic for dealing with the delay in completing a memory access (cache miss, etc.) to only two instructions. This led to RISC designs being referred to as &quot;load–store&quot; architectures.

==Comparison to other architectures==
Some CPUs have been specifically designed to have a very small set of instructions—but these designs are very different from classic RISC designs, so they have been given other names such as minimal instruction set computer (MISC) or transport triggered architecture (TTA).

RISC architectures have traditionally had few successes in the desktop PC and commodity server markets, where the x86-based platforms remain the dominant processor architecture. However, this may change, as ARM-based processors are being developed for higher performance systems. Manufacturers including Cavium, AMD, and Qualcomm have released server processors based on the ARM architecture. ARM further partnered with Cray in 2017 to produce an ARM-based supercomputer. On the desktop, Microsoft announced that it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon-based devices in 2017 as part of its partnership with Qualcomm. These devices will support Windows applications compiled for 32-bit x86 via an x86 processor emulator that translates 32-bit x86 code to ARM64 code. Apple announced they will transition their Mac desktop and laptop computers from Intel processors to internally developed ARM64-based SoCs called Apple silicon; the first such computers, using the Apple M1 processor, were released in November 2020. Macs with Apple silicon can run x86-64 binaries with Rosetta 2, an x86-64 to ARM64 translator.

Outside of the desktop arena, however, the ARM RISC architecture is in widespread use in smartphones, tablets and many forms of embedded devices. While early RISC designs differed significantly from contemporary CISC designs, by 2000 the highest-performing CPUs in the RISC line were almost indistinguishable from the highest-performing CPUs in the CISC line.

==Use of RISC architectures==
RISC architectures are now used across a range of platforms, from smartphones and tablet computers to some of the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputers such as Fugaku, the fastest on the TOP500 list , and Summit, Sierra, and Sunway TaihuLight, the next three on that list.

===Low-end and mobile systems===
By the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of low-end and mobile systems relied on RISC architectures. Examples include:
* The ARM architecture dominates the market for low-power and low-cost embedded systems (typically 200–1800 MHz in 2014). It is used in a number of systems such as most Android-based systems, the Apple iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, Palm, Microsoft Windows Phone (former Windows Mobile / Windows CE), RIM devices, Nintendo Game Boy Advance, DS, 3DS and Switch, Raspberry Pi, etc.
* IBM&#x27;s PowerPC was used in the GameCube, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U gaming consoles.
* The MIPS line (at one point used in many SGI computers) was used in the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable game consoles, and residential gateways like Linksys WRT54G series.
* Hitachi&#x27;s SuperH, originally in wide use in the Sega Super 32X, Saturn and Dreamcast, now developed and sold by Renesas as the SH4.
* Atmel AVR, used in a variety of products ranging from Xbox handheld controllers and the Arduino open-source microcontroller platform to BMW cars.
* RISC-V, the current iteration of Berkeley&#x27;s open standard RISC ISA, with 32- or 64-bit address spaces, a small core integer instruction set, and an experimental &quot;Compressed&quot; ISA for code density and designed for standard and special-purpose extensions.

===Desktop and laptop computers===
* IBM&#x27;s PowerPC architecture was used in Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computers from 1994, when they began a switch from Motorola 68000 family processors, to 2005, when they transitioned to Intel x86 processors.
* Some chromebooks use ARM-based platforms since 2012. 
* Apple uses inhouse-designed processors based on the ARM architecture for its lineup of desktop and laptop computers since its transition from Intel processors, and the first such computers were released in November 2020.
* Microsoft uses Qualcomm ARM-based processors for its Surface line. HP Inc and Lenovo have released Windows PCs with an ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon.

===Workstations, servers, and supercomputers===
* MIPS, by Silicon Graphics (ceased making MIPS-based systems in 2006).
* SPARC, by Oracle (previously Sun Microsystems), and Fujitsu.
* IBM&#x27;s IBM POWER architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA were and are used in many of IBM&#x27;s supercomputers, mid-range servers and workstations.
* Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PA-RISC, also known as HP-PA (discontinued at the end of 2008).
* Alpha, used in single-board computers, workstations, servers and supercomputers from Digital Equipment Corporation, then Compaq and finally Hewlett-Packard (HP)(discontinued as of 2007).
* RISC-V, the fifth Berkeley RISC ISA, with 64- or 128-bit address spaces, and the integer core extended with floating point, atomics and vector processing, and designed to be extended with instructions for networking, I/O, and data processing. A specification for a 64-bit superscalar design, &quot;Rocket&quot;, is available for download. It is implemented in the European Processor Initiative processor.
* The ARM architecture currently in use by cloud providers for servers. One example is the AWS Graviton series processor used for various services on the AWS platform. ARM was also used in the Fujitsu A64FX chip to create Fugaku, the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer in 2020.

===Open source, standard, or use===
RISC architectures have become popular in open source processors and soft microprocessors since they are relatively simple to implement, which makes them suitable for FPGA implementations and prototyping, for instance. Examples include:

* OpenRISC, an open instruction set and micro-architecture first introduced in 2000.
* Open MIPS architecture, for part of 2019 the specifications were free to use, royalty free, for registered MIPS developers.
* OpenSPARC, in 2005, Sun released its Ultra Sparc documentation and specifications, under the GPLv2.
** LEON, an open source, radiation-tolerant implementation of the SPARC V8 instruction set (targeting space applications).
* Libre-SOC, an open source SoC based on the Power ISA with extensions for video and 3D graphics.
* RISC-V, in 2010, the Berkeley RISC version 5, specification, tool chain, and brand, were made available, free of charge, for non-commercial purposes.
* SuperH - J Core, in 2015, a project to offer clean room implementations of the, patent expired, Hitachi SuperH RISC ISA was started.
* ARM DesignStart, in 2018 ARM, in partnership with FPGA supplier Xilinx, started to offer free access to some of ARM&#x27;s IP, including FPGA specification for some older CPU cores.

==Awards==
In 2022 Steve Furber, John L. Hennessy, David A. Patterson and Sophie M. Wilson were awarded the Charles Stark Draper Prize by the United States National Academy of Engineering for their contributions to the invention, development, and implementation of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chips.

<doc id="26202" wikidata="Q48226" url="?curid=26202" title="Ralph Waldo Emerson">
<text>Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803April 27, 1882), who went by his middle name Waldo, was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher, minister, abolitionist, and poet who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and critical thinking, as well as a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society and conformity. Friedrich Nietzsche thought he was &quot;the most gifted of the Americans,&quot; and Walt Whitman called Emerson his &quot;master&quot;.

Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, &quot;Nature&quot;. Following this work, he gave a speech entitled &quot;The American Scholar,&quot; in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America&#x27;s &quot;intellectual Declaration of Independence&quot;.

Emerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures, first, and then, revised them for print. His first two collections of essays, &quot;&quot; (1841) and &quot;&quot; (1844), represent the core of his thinking. They include the well-known essays &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;, &quot;The Over-Soul,&quot; &quot;Circles,&quot; &quot;The Poet,&quot; and &quot;Experience&quot;. Together, with &quot;Nature&quot;, these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson&#x27;s most fertile period. Emerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical , but rather, by developing certain ideas, such as individuality, freedom, the ability for mankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson&#x27;s &quot;nature&quot; was more philosophical than naturalistic: &quot;Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.&quot; Emerson is one of several figures who &quot;took a more pantheist or pandeist approach, by rejecting views of God as separate from the world&quot;.

He remains among the linchpins of the American romantic movement, and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers, and poets that followed him. &quot;In all my lectures,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I have taught one doctrine, namely, the infinitude of the private man.&quot; Emerson is also well-known as a mentor and friend of Henry David Thoreau, a fellow Transcendentalist.

==Early life, family, and education==
Emerson was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 25, 1803, to Ruth Haskins and the Rev. William Emerson, a Unitarian minister. He was named after his mother&#x27;s brother Ralph and his father&#x27;s great-grandmother Rebecca Waldo. Ralph Waldo was the second of five sons who survived into adulthood; the others were William, Edward, Robert Bulkeley, and Charles. Three other children—Phoebe, John Clarke, and Mary Caroline—died in childhood. Emerson was of English ancestry, and his family had been in New England since the early colonial period, with Emerson being a seventh-generation descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyagers John Howland and Elizabeth Tilley through their daughter Hope.

Emerson&#x27;s father died from stomach cancer on May 12, 1811, less than two weeks before Emerson&#x27;s eighth birthday. Emerson was raised by his mother, with the help of the other women in the family; his aunt Mary Moody Emerson in particular had a profound effect on him. She lived with the family off and on and maintained a constant correspondence with Emerson until her death in 1863.

Emerson&#x27;s formal schooling began at the Boston Latin School in 1812, when he was nine. In October 1817, at age 14, Emerson went to Harvard College and was appointed freshman messenger for the president, requiring Emerson to fetch delinquent students and send messages to faculty. Midway through his junior year, Emerson began keeping a list of books he had read and started a journal in a series of notebooks that would be called &quot;Wide World&quot;. He took outside jobs to cover his school expenses, including as a waiter for the Junior Commons and as an occasional teacher working with his uncle Samuel and aunt Sarah Ripley in Waltham, Massachusetts. By his senior year, Emerson decided to go by his middle name, Waldo. Emerson served as Class Poet; as was custom, he presented an original poem on Harvard&#x27;s Class Day, a month before his official graduation on August 29, 1821, when he was 18. He did not stand out as a student and graduated in the exact middle of his class of 59 people. In the early 1820s, Emerson was a teacher at the School for Young Ladies (which was run by his brother William). He next spent two years living in a cabin in the Canterbury section of Roxbury, Massachusetts, where he wrote and studied nature. In his honor, this area is now called Schoolmaster Hill in Boston&#x27;s Franklin Park.

In 1826, faced with poor health, Emerson went to seek a warmer climate. He first went to Charleston, South Carolina, but found the weather was still too cold. He then went farther south to St. Augustine, Florida, where he took long walks on the beach and began writing poetry. While in St. Augustine he made the acquaintance of Achille Murat, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte. Murat was two years his senior; they became good friends and enjoyed each other&#x27;s company. The two engaged in enlightening discussions of religion, society, philosophy, and government. Emerson considered Murat an important figure in his intellectual education.

While in St. Augustine, Emerson had his first encounter with slavery. At one point, he attended a meeting of the Bible Society while a slave auction was taking place in the yard outside. He wrote, &quot;One ear therefore heard the glad tidings of great joy, whilst the other was regaled with &#x27;Going, gentlemen, going!

==Early career==
After Harvard, Emerson assisted his brother William in a school for young women established in their mother&#x27;s house, after he had established his own school in Chelmsford, Massachusetts; when his brother William went to Göttingen to study law in mid-1824, Ralph Waldo closed the school but continued to teach in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until early 1825. Emerson was accepted into the Harvard Divinity School in late 1824, and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa in 1828. Emerson&#x27;s brother Edward, two years younger than he, entered the office of the lawyer Daniel Webster, after graduating from Harvard first in his class. Edward&#x27;s physical health began to deteriorate, and he soon suffered a mental collapse as well; he was taken to McLean Asylum in June 1828 at age 25. Although he recovered his mental equilibrium, he died in 1834, apparently from long-standing tuberculosis. Another of Emerson&#x27;s bright and promising younger brothers, Charles, born in 1808, died in 1836, also of tuberculosis, making him the third young person in Emerson&#x27;s innermost circle to die in a period of a few years.

Emerson met his first wife, Ellen Louisa Tucker, in Concord, New Hampshire, on Christmas Day, 1827, and married her when she was 18 two years later. The couple moved to Boston, with Emerson&#x27;s mother, Ruth, moving with them to help take care of Ellen, who was already ill with tuberculosis. Less than two years after that, on February 8, 1831, Ellen died, at age 20, after uttering her last words, &quot;I have not forgotten the peace and joy.&quot; Emerson was strongly affected by her death and visited her grave in Roxbury daily. In a journal entry dated March 29, 1832, he wrote, &quot;I visited Ellen&#x27;s tomb &amp; opened the coffin.&quot;

Boston&#x27;s Second Church invited Emerson to serve as its junior pastor, and he was ordained on January 11, 1829. His initial salary was $1,200 per year (), increasing to $1,400 in July, but with his church role he took on other responsibilities: he was the chaplain of the Massachusetts Legislature and a member of the Boston School Committee. His church activities kept him busy, though during this period, and facing the imminent death of his wife, he began to doubt his own beliefs.

After his wife&#x27;s death, he began to disagree with the church&#x27;s methods, writing in his journal in June 1832, &quot;I have sometimes thought that, in order to be a good minister, it was necessary to leave the ministry. The profession is antiquated. In an altered age, we worship in the dead forms of our forefathers.&quot; His disagreements with church officials over the administration of the Communion service and misgivings about public prayer eventually led to his resignation in 1832. As he wrote, &quot;This mode of commemorating Christ is not suitable to me. That is reason enough why I should abandon it.&quot; As one Emerson scholar has pointed out, &quot;Doffing the decent black of the pastor, he was free to choose the gown of the lecturer and teacher, of the thinker not confined within the limits of an institution or a tradition.&quot;
Emerson toured Europe in 1833 and later wrote of his travels in &quot;English Traits&quot; (1856). He left aboard the brig &quot;Jasper&quot; on Christmas Day, 1832, sailing first to Malta. During his European trip, he spent several months in Italy, visiting Rome, Florence and Venice, among other cities. When in Rome, he met with John Stuart Mill, who gave him a letter of recommendation to meet Thomas Carlyle. He went to Switzerland and had to be dragged by fellow passengers to visit Voltaire&#x27;s home in Ferney, &quot;protesting all the way upon the unworthiness of his memory&quot;. He then went on to Paris, a &quot;loud modern New York of a place&quot;, where he visited the Jardin des Plantes. He was greatly moved by the organization of plants according to Jussieu&#x27;s system of classification, and the way all such objects were related and connected. As Robert D. Richardson says, &quot;Emerson&#x27;s moment of insight into the interconnectedness of things in the Jardin des Plantes was a moment of almost visionary intensity that pointed him away from theology and toward science.&quot;

Moving north to England, Emerson met William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle in particular was a strong influence on him; Emerson would later serve as an unofficial literary agent in the United States for Carlyle, and in March 1835, he tried to persuade Carlyle to come to America to lecture. The two maintained a correspondence until Carlyle&#x27;s death in 1881.
Emerson returned to the United States on October 9, 1833, and lived with his mother in Newton, Massachusetts. In October 1834, he moved to Concord, Massachusetts, to live with his step-grandfather, Dr. Ezra Ripley, at what was later named The Old Manse. Given the budding Lyceum movement, which provided lectures on all sorts of topics, Emerson saw a possible career as a lecturer. On November 5, 1833, he made the first of what would eventually be some 1,500 lectures, &quot;The Uses of Natural History&quot;, in Boston. This was an expanded account of his experience in Paris. In this lecture, he set out some of his important beliefs and the ideas he would later develop in his first published essay, &quot;Nature&quot;:

On January 24, 1835, Emerson wrote a letter to Lydia Jackson proposing marriage. Her acceptance reached him by mail on the 28th. In July 1835, he bought a house on the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike in Concord, Massachusetts, which he named Bush; it is now open to the public as the Ralph Waldo Emerson House. Emerson quickly became one of the leading citizens in the town. He gave a lecture to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the town of Concord on September 12, 1835. Two days later, he married Jackson in her hometown of Plymouth, Massachusetts, and moved to the new home in Concord together with Emerson&#x27;s mother on September 15.

Emerson quickly changed his wife&#x27;s name to Lidian, and would call her Queenie, and sometimes Asia, and she called him Mr. Emerson. Their children were Waldo, Ellen, Edith, and Edward Waldo Emerson. Edward Waldo Emerson was the father of Raymond Emerson. Ellen was named for his first wife, at Lidian&#x27;s suggestion. He hired Sophia Foord to educate his children.

Emerson was poor when he was at Harvard, but was later able to support his family for much of his life. He inherited a fair amount of money after his first wife&#x27;s death, though he had to file a lawsuit against the Tucker family in 1836 to get it. He received $11,600 in May 1834 (), and a further $11,674.49 in July 1837 (). In 1834, he considered that he had an income of $1,200 a year from the initial payment of the estate, equivalent to what he had earned as a pastor.

==Literary career and Transcendentalism==

On September 8, 1836, the day before the publication of &quot;Nature&quot;, Emerson met with Frederic Henry Hedge, George Putnam, and George Ripley to plan periodic gatherings of other like-minded intellectuals. This was the beginning of the Transcendental Club, which served as a center for the movement. Its first official meeting was held on September 19, 1836. On September 1, 1837, women attended a meeting of the Transcendental Club for the first time. Emerson invited Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Hoar, and Sarah Ripley for dinner at his home before the meeting to ensure that they would be present for the evening get-together. Fuller would prove to be an important figure in Transcendentalism. 
Emerson anonymously sent his first essay, &quot;Nature&quot;, to James Munroe and Company to be published on September 9, 1836. A year later, on August 31, 1837, he delivered his now-famous Phi Beta Kappa address, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, then entitled &quot;An Oration, Delivered before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge&quot;; it was renamed for a collection of essays (which included the first general publication of &quot;Nature&quot;) in 1849. Friends urged him to publish the talk, and he did so at his own expense, in an edition of 500 copies, which sold out in a month. In the speech, Emerson declared literary independence in the United States and urged Americans to create a writing style all their own, free from Europe. James Russell Lowell, who was a student at Harvard at the time, called it &quot;an event without former parallel on our literary annals&quot;. Another member of the audience, Reverend John Pierce, called it &quot;an apparently incoherent and unintelligible address&quot;.

In 1837, Emerson befriended Henry David Thoreau. Though they had likely met as early as 1835, in the fall of 1837, Emerson asked Thoreau, &quot;Do you keep a journal?&quot; The question went on to be a lifelong inspiration for Thoreau. Emerson&#x27;s own journal was published in 16 large volumes, in the definitive Harvard University Press edition issued between 1960 and 1982. Some scholars consider the journal to be Emerson&#x27;s key literary work.

In March 1837, Emerson gave a series of lectures on the philosophy of history at the Masonic Temple in Boston. This was the first time he managed a lecture series on his own, and it was the beginning of his career as a lecturer. The profits from this series of lectures were much larger than when he was paid by an organization to talk, and he continued to manage his own lectures often throughout his lifetime. He eventually gave as many as 80 lectures a year, traveling across the northern United States as far as St. Louis, Des Moines, Minneapolis, and California.

On July 15, 1838, Emerson was invited to Divinity Hall, Harvard Divinity School, to deliver the school&#x27;s graduation address, which came to be known as the &quot;Divinity School Address&quot;. Emerson discounted biblical miracles and proclaimed that, while Jesus was a great man, he was not God: historical Christianity, he said, had turned Jesus into a &quot;demigod, as the Orientals or the Greeks would describe Osiris or Apollo&quot;. His comments outraged the establishment and the general Protestant community. He was denounced as an atheist and a poisoner of young men&#x27;s minds. Despite the roar of critics, he made no reply, leaving others to put forward a defense. He was not invited back to speak at Harvard for another thirty years.

The Transcendental group began to publish its flagship journal, &quot;The Dial&quot;, in July 1840. They planned the journal as early as October 1839, but did not begin work on it until the first week of 1840. Unitarian minister George Ripley was the managing editor. Margaret Fuller was the first editor, having been approached by Emerson after several others had declined the role. Fuller stayed on for about two years, when Emerson took over, using the journal to promote talented young writers including Ellery Channing and Thoreau.

In 1841, Emerson published &quot;Essays&quot;, his second book, which included the famous essay &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;. His aunt called it a &quot;strange medley of atheism and false independence&quot;, but it gained favorable reviews in London and Paris. This book, and its popular reception, more than any of Emerson&#x27;s contributions to date laid the groundwork for his international fame.

In January 1842, Emerson&#x27;s first son, Waldo, died of scarlet fever. Emerson wrote of his grief in the poem &quot;Threnody&quot; (&quot;For this losing is true dying&quot;), and the essay &quot;Experience&quot;. In the same month, William James was born, and Emerson agreed to be his godfather.

Bronson Alcott announced his plans in November 1842 to find &quot;a farm of a hundred acres in excellent condition with good buildings, a good orchard and grounds&quot;. Charles Lane purchased a farm in Harvard, Massachusetts, in May 1843 for what would become Fruitlands, a community based on Utopian ideals inspired in part by Transcendentalism. The farm would run based on a communal effort, using no animals for labor; its participants would eat no meat and use no wool or leather. Emerson said he felt &quot;sad at heart&quot; for not engaging in the experiment himself. Even so, he did not feel Fruitlands would be a success. &quot;Their whole doctrine is spiritual&quot;, he wrote, &quot;but they always end with saying, Give us much land and money&quot;. Even Alcott admitted he was not prepared for the difficulty in operating Fruitlands. &quot;None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart&quot;, he wrote. After its failure, Emerson helped buy a farm for Alcott&#x27;s family in Concord which Alcott named &quot;Hillside&quot;.

&quot;The Dial&quot; ceased publication in April 1844; Horace Greeley reported it as an end to the &quot;most original and thoughtful periodical ever published in this country&quot;.

In 1844, Emerson published his second collection of essays, &quot;Essays: Second Series&quot;. This collection included &quot;The Poet&quot;, &quot;Experience&quot;, &quot;Gifts&quot;, and an essay entitled &quot;Nature&quot;, a different work from the 1836 essay of the same name.

Emerson made a living as a popular lecturer in New England and much of the rest of the country. He had begun lecturing in 1833; by the 1850s he was giving as many as 80 lectures per year. He addressed the Boston Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and the Gloucester Lyceum, among others. Emerson spoke on a wide variety of subjects, and many of his essays grew out of his lectures. He charged between $10 and $50 for each appearance, bringing him as much as $2,000 in a typical winter lecture season. This was more than his earnings from other sources. In some years, he earned as much as $900 for a series of six lectures, and in another, for a winter series of talks in Boston, he netted $1,600. He eventually gave some 1,500 lectures in his lifetime. His earnings allowed him to expand his property, buying of land by Walden Pond and a few more acres in a neighboring pine grove. He wrote that he was &quot;landlord and water lord of 14 acres, more or less&quot;.

Emerson was introduced to Indian philosophy through the works of the French philosopher Victor Cousin. In 1845, Emerson&#x27;s journals show he was reading the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and Henry Thomas Colebrooke&#x27;s &quot;Essays on the Vedas&quot;. He was strongly influenced by Vedanta, and much of his writing has strong shades of nondualism. One of the clearest examples of this can be found in his essay &quot;The Over-soul&quot;:
The central message Emerson drew from his Asian studies was that &quot;the purpose of life was spiritual transformation and direct experience of divine power, here and now on earth.&quot;

In 1847–48, he toured the British Isles. He also visited Paris between the French Revolution of 1848 and the bloody June Days. When he arrived, he saw the stumps of trees that had been cut down to form barricades in the February riots. On May 21, he stood on the Champ de Mars in the midst of mass celebrations for concord, peace and labor. He wrote in his journal, &quot;At the end of the year we shall take account, &amp; see if the Revolution was worth the trees.&quot; The trip left an important imprint on Emerson&#x27;s later work. His 1856 book &quot;English Traits&quot; is based largely on observations recorded in his travel journals and notebooks. Emerson later came to see the American Civil War as a &quot;revolution&quot; that shared common ground with the European revolutions of 1848.

In a speech in Concord, Massachusetts, on May 3, 1851, Emerson denounced the Fugitive Slave Act:
That summer, he wrote in his diary:
In February 1852, Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, and William Henry Channing edited an edition of the works and letters of Margaret Fuller, who had died in 1850. Within a week of her death, her New York editor, Horace Greeley, suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller, to be called &quot;Margaret and Her Friends&quot;, be prepared quickly &quot;before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away&quot;. Published under the title &quot;The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli&quot;, Fuller&#x27;s words were heavily censored or rewritten. The three editors were not concerned about accuracy; they believed public interest in Fuller was temporary and that she would not survive as a historical figure. Even so, it was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century.

Walt Whitman published the innovative poetry collection &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; in 1855 and sent a copy to Emerson for his opinion. Emerson responded positively, sending Whitman a flattering five-page letter in response. Emerson&#x27;s approval helped the first edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; stir up significant interest and convinced Whitman to issue a second edition shortly thereafter. This edition quoted a phrase from Emerson&#x27;s letter, printed in gold leaf on the cover: &quot;I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career&quot;. Emerson took offense that this letter was made public and later was more critical of the work.

==Philosophers Camp==

In summer 1858, Emerson camped at Follensbee Pond in the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York with nine others: Louis Agassiz, James Russell Lowell, John Holmes, Horatio Woodman, Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar, Jeffries Wyman, Estes Howe, Amos Binney, and William James Stillman. Invited, but unable to make the trip, were Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Charles Eliot Norton, all members of the Saturday Club (Boston, Massachusetts).

This social club was mostly a literary membership that met the last Saturday of the month at the Boston Parker House Hotel (Omni Parker House). William James Stillman was a painter and founding editor of an art journal called the Crayon. Stillman was born and grew up in Schenectady which was just south of the Adirondack mountains. He later traveled there to paint the wilderness landscape and to fish and hunt. He shared his experiences in this wilderness to the members of the Saturday Club, raising their interest in this unknown region.

James Russell Lowell and William Stillman led the effort to organize a trip to the Adirondacks. They began their journey on August 2, 1858, traveling by train, steamboat, stagecoach, and canoe guide boats. News that these cultured men were living like &quot;Sacs and Sioux&quot; in the wilderness appeared in newspapers across the nation. This became known as the &quot;Philosophers Camp&quot;.

This event was a landmark in the nineteenth-century intellectual movement, linking nature with art and literature.

Although much has been written over many years by scholars and biographers of Emerson&#x27;s life, little has been written of what has become known as the &quot;Philosophers Camp&quot; at Follensbee Pond. Yet, his epic poem &quot;Adirondac&quot; reads like a journal of his day-to-day detailed description of adventures in the wilderness with his fellow members of the Saturday Club. This two-week camping excursion (1858 in the Adirondacks) brought him face to face with a true wilderness, something he spoke of in his essay &quot;Nature&quot;, published in 1836. He said, &quot;in the wilderness I find something more dear and connate than in streets or villages&quot;.

==Civil War years==
Emerson was staunchly opposed to slavery, but he did not appreciate being in the public limelight and was hesitant about lecturing on the subject. In the years leading up to the Civil War, he did give a number of lectures, however, beginning as early as November 1837. A number of his friends and family members were more active abolitionists than he, at first, but from 1844 on he more actively opposed slavery. He gave a number of speeches and lectures, and welcomed John Brown to his home during Brown&#x27;s visits to Concord. He voted for Abraham Lincoln in 1860, but was disappointed that Lincoln was more concerned about preserving the Union than eliminating slavery outright. Once the American Civil War broke out, Emerson made it clear that he believed in immediate emancipation of the slaves.

Around this time, in 1860, Emerson published &quot;The Conduct of Life&quot;, his seventh collection of essays. It &quot;grappled with some of the thorniest issues of the moment,&quot; and &quot;his experience in the abolition ranks is a telling influence in his conclusions.&quot; In these essays Emerson strongly embraced the idea of war as a means of national rebirth: &quot;Civil war, national bankruptcy, or revolution, [are] more rich in the central tones than languid years of prosperity.&quot;

Emerson visited Washington, D.C., at the end of January 1862. He gave a public lecture at the Smithsonian on January 31, 1862, and declared, &quot;The South calls slavery an institution ... I call it destitution ... Emancipation is the demand of civilization&quot;. The next day, February 1, his friend Charles Sumner took him to meet Lincoln at the White House. Lincoln was familiar with Emerson&#x27;s work, having previously seen him lecture. Emerson&#x27;s misgivings about Lincoln began to soften after this meeting. In 1865, he spoke at a memorial service held for Lincoln in Concord: &quot;Old as history is, and manifold as are its tragedies, I doubt if any death has caused so much pain as this has caused, or will have caused, on its announcement.&quot; Emerson also met a number of high-ranking government officials, including Salmon P. Chase, the secretary of the treasury; Edward Bates, the attorney general; Edwin M. Stanton, the secretary of war; Gideon Welles, the secretary of the navy; and William Seward, the secretary of state.

On May 6, 1862, Emerson&#x27;s protégé Henry David Thoreau died of tuberculosis at the age of 44. Emerson delivered his eulogy. He often referred to Thoreau as his best friend, despite a falling-out that began in 1849 after Thoreau published &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;. Another friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, died two years after Thoreau, in 1864. Emerson served as a pallbearer when Hawthorne was buried in Concord, as Emerson wrote, &quot;in a pomp of sunshine and verdure&quot;.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864. In 1867, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

==Final years and death==

Starting in 1867, Emerson&#x27;s health began declining; he wrote much less in his journals. Beginning as early as the summer of 1871 or in the spring of 1872, he started experiencing memory problems and suffered from aphasia. By the end of the decade, he forgot his own name at times and, if asked how he felt, would respond &quot;Quite well; I have lost my mental faculties, but am perfectly well&quot;.

In the spring of 1871, Emerson took a trip on the transcontinental railroad, barely two years after its completion. Along the way and in California he met a number of dignitaries, including Brigham Young during a stopover in Salt Lake City. Part of his California visit included a trip to Yosemite, and while there he met a young and unknown John Muir, a signature event in Muir&#x27;s career.

Emerson&#x27;s Concord home caught fire on July 24, 1872. He called for help from neighbors and, giving up on putting out the flames, all tried to save as many objects as possible. The fire was put out by Ephraim Bull Jr., the one-armed son of Ephraim Wales Bull. Donations were collected by friends to help the Emersons rebuild, including $5,000 gathered by Francis Cabot Lowell, another $10,000 collected by LeBaron Russell Briggs, and a personal donation of $1,000 from George Bancroft. Support for shelter was offered as well; though the Emersons ended up staying with family at the Old Manse, invitations came from Anne Lynch Botta, James Elliot Cabot, James T. Fields and Annie Adams Fields. The fire marked an end to Emerson&#x27;s serious lecturing career; from then on, he would lecture only on special occasions and only in front of familiar audiences.

While the house was being rebuilt, Emerson took a trip to England, continental Europe, and Egypt. He left on October 23, 1872, along with his daughter Ellen, while his wife Lidian spent time at the Old Manse and with friends. Emerson and his daughter Ellen returned to the United States on the ship &quot;Olympus&quot; along with friend Charles Eliot Norton on April 15, 1873. Emerson&#x27;s return to Concord was celebrated by the town, and school was canceled that day.

In late 1874, Emerson published an anthology of poetry entitled &quot;Parnassus&quot;, which included poems by Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Julia Caroline Dorr, Jean Ingelow, Lucy Larcom, Jones Very, as well as Thoreau and several others. Originally, the anthology had been prepared as early as the fall of 1871, but it was delayed when the publishers asked for revisions.

The problems with his memory had become embarrassing to Emerson and he ceased his public appearances by 1879. In reply to an invitation to a retirement celebration for Octavius B. Frothingham, he wrote, &quot;I am not in condition to make visits, or take any part in conversation. Old age has rushed on me in the last year, and tied my tongue, and hid my memory, and thus made it a duty to stay at home.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; quoted his reply and noted that his regrets were read aloud at the celebration. Holmes wrote of the problem saying, &quot;Emerson is afraid to trust himself in society much, on account of the failure of his memory and the great difficulty he finds in getting the words he wants. It is painful to witness his embarrassment at times&quot;.

On April 21, 1882, Emerson was found to be suffering from pneumonia. He died six days later. Emerson is buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Massachusetts. He was placed in his coffin wearing a white robe given by the American sculptor Daniel Chester French.

==Lifestyle and beliefs==

Emerson&#x27;s religious views were often considered radical at the time. He believed that all things are connected to God and, therefore, all things are divine. Critics believed that Emerson was removing the central God figure; as Henry Ware Jr. said, Emerson was in danger of taking away &quot;the Father of the Universe&quot; and leaving &quot;but a company of children in an orphan asylum&quot;. Emerson was partly influenced by German philosophy and Biblical criticism. His views, the basis of Transcendentalism, suggested that God does not have to reveal the truth, but that the truth could be intuitively experienced directly from nature. When asked his religious belief, Emerson stated, &quot;I am more of a Quaker than anything else. I believe in the &#x27;still, small voice&#x27;, and that voice is Christ within us.&quot;

Emerson was a supporter of the spread of community libraries in the 19th century, having this to say of them: &quot;Consider what you have in the smallest chosen library. A company of the wisest and wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil countries, in a thousand years, have set in best order the results of their learning and wisdom.&quot;

Emerson had romantic interest in various women throughout his life, including Anna Barker and Caroline Sturgis.

=== Race and slavery ===
Emerson did not become an ardent abolitionist until 1844, though his journals show he was concerned with slavery beginning in his youth, even dreaming about helping to free slaves. In June 1856, shortly after Charles Sumner, a United States Senator, was beaten for his staunch abolitionist views, Emerson lamented that he himself was not as committed to the cause. He wrote, &quot;There are men who as soon as they are born take a bee-line to the axe of the inquisitor. ... Wonderful the way in which we are saved by this unfailing supply of the moral element&quot;. After Sumner&#x27;s attack, Emerson began to speak out about slavery. &quot;I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom&quot;, he said at a meeting at Concord that summer. Emerson used slavery as an example of a human injustice, especially in his role as a minister. In early 1838, provoked by the murder of an abolitionist publisher from Alton, Illinois, named Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Emerson gave his first public antislavery address. As he said, &quot;It is but the other day that the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live&quot;. John Quincy Adams said the mob-murder of Lovejoy &quot;sent a shock as of any earthquake throughout this continent&quot;. However, Emerson maintained that reform would be achieved through moral agreement rather than by militant action. By August 1, 1844, at a lecture in Concord, he stated more clearly his support for the abolitionist movement: &quot;We are indebted mainly to this movement, and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics&quot;.

Emerson is often known as one of the most liberal democratic thinkers of his time who believed that through the democratic process, slavery should be abolished. While being an avid abolitionist who was known for his criticism of the legality of slavery, Emerson struggled with the implications of race. His usual liberal leanings did not clearly translate when it came to believing that all races had equal capability or function, which was a common conception for the period in which he lived. Many critics believe that it was his views on race that inhibited him from becoming an abolitionist earlier in his life and also inhibited him from being more active in the antislavery movement. Much of his early life, he was silent on the topic of race and slavery. Not until he was well into his 30s did Emerson begin to publish writings on race and slavery, and not until he was in his late 40s and 50s did he become known as an antislavery activist.

During his early life, Emerson seemed to develop a hierarchy of races based on faculty to reason or rather, whether African slaves were distinguishably equal to white men based on their ability to reason. In a journal entry written in 1822, Emerson wrote about a personal observation: &quot;It can hardly be true that the difference lies in the attribute of reason. I saw ten, twenty, a hundred large lipped, lowbrowed black men in the streets who, except in the mere matter of language, did not exceed the sagacity of the elephant. Now is it true that these were created superior to this wise animal, and designed to control it? And in comparison with the highest orders of men, the Africans will stand so low as to make the difference which subsists between themselves &amp; the sagacious beasts inconsiderable.&quot;

As with many supporters of slavery, during his early years, Emerson seems to have thought that the faculties of African slaves were not equal to those of white slave-owners. But this belief in racial inferiorities did not make Emerson a supporter of slavery. Emerson wrote later that year that &quot;No ingenious sophistry can ever reconcile the unperverted mind to the pardon of Slavery; nothing but tremendous familiarity, and the bias of private interest&quot;. Emerson saw the removal of people from their homeland, the treatment of slaves, and the self-seeking benefactors of slaves as gross injustices. For Emerson, slavery was a moral issue, while superiority of the races was an issue he tried to analyze from a scientific perspective based on what he believed to be inherited traits.

Emerson saw himself as a man of &quot;Saxon descent&quot;. In a speech given in 1835 titled &quot;Permanent Traits of the English National Genius&quot;, he said, &quot;The inhabitants of the United States, especially of the Northern portion, are descended from the people of England and have inherited the traits of their national character&quot;. He saw direct ties between race based on national identity and the inherent nature of the human being. White Americans who were native-born in the United States and of English ancestry were categorized by him as a separate &quot;race&quot;, which he thought had a position of being superior to other nations. His idea of race was based on a shared culture, environment, and history. He believed that native-born Americans of English descent were superior to European immigrants, including the Irish, French, and Germans, and also as being superior to English people from England, whom he considered a close second and the only really comparable group.

Later in his life, Emerson&#x27;s ideas on race changed when he became more involved in the abolitionist movement while at the same time, he began to more thoroughly analyze the philosophical implications of race and racial hierarchies. His beliefs shifted focus to the potential outcomes of racial conflicts. Emerson&#x27;s racial views were closely related to his views on nationalism and national superiority, which was a common view in the United States at that time. Emerson used contemporary theories of race and natural science to support a theory of race development. He believed that the current political battle and the current enslavement of other races was an inevitable racial struggle, one that would result in the inevitable union of the United States. Such conflicts were necessary for the dialectic of change that would eventually allow the progress of the nation. In much of his later work, Emerson seems to allow the notion that different European races will eventually mix in America. This hybridization process would lead to a superior race that would be to the advantage of the superiority of the United States.

==Legacy==
As a lecturer and orator, Emerson—nicknamed the Sage of Concord—became the leading voice of intellectual culture in the United States. James Russell Lowell, editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and the &quot;North American Review&quot;, commented in his book &quot;My Study Windows&quot; (1871), that Emerson was not only the &quot;most steadily attractive lecturer in America,&quot; but also &quot;one of the pioneers of the lecturing system.&quot; Herman Melville, who had met Emerson in 1849, originally thought he had &quot;a defect in the region of the heart&quot; and a &quot;self-conceit so intensely intellectual that at first one hesitates to call it by its right name&quot;, though he later admitted Emerson was &quot;a great man&quot;. Theodore Parker, a minister and Transcendentalist, noted Emerson&#x27;s ability to influence and inspire others: &quot;the brilliant genius of Emerson rose in the winter nights, and hung over Boston, drawing the eyes of ingenuous young people to look up to that great new star, a beauty and a mystery, which charmed for the moment, while it gave also perennial inspiration, as it led them forward along new paths, and towards new hopes&quot;.

Emerson&#x27;s work not only influenced his contemporaries, such as Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau, but would continue to influence thinkers and writers in the United States and around the world down to the present. Notable thinkers who recognize Emerson&#x27;s influence include Nietzsche and William James, Emerson&#x27;s godson. There is little disagreement that Emerson was the most influential writer of 19th-century America, though these days he is largely the concern of scholars. Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau and William James were all positive Emersonians, while Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry James were Emersonians in denial—while they set themselves in opposition to the sage, there was no escaping his influence. To T. S. Eliot, Emerson&#x27;s essays were an &quot;encumbrance&quot;. Waldo the Sage was eclipsed from 1914 until 1965, when he returned to shine, after surviving in the work of major American poets like Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane.

In his book &quot;The American Religion&quot;, Harold Bloom repeatedly refers to Emerson as &quot;The prophet of the American Religion&quot;, which in the context of the book refers to indigenously American religions such as Mormonism and Christian Science, which arose largely in Emerson&#x27;s lifetime, but also to mainline Protestant churches that Bloom says have become in the United States more gnostic than their European counterparts. In &quot;The Western Canon&quot;, Bloom compares Emerson to Michel de Montaigne: &quot;The only equivalent reading experience that I know is to reread endlessly in the notebooks and journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American version of Montaigne.&quot; Several of Emerson&#x27;s poems were included in Bloom&#x27;s &quot;The Best Poems of the English Language&quot;, although he wrote that none of the poems are as outstanding as the best of Emerson&#x27;s essays, which Bloom listed as &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Experience&quot;, and &quot;nearly all of &quot;Conduct of Life&quot;&quot;. In his belief that line lengths, rhythms, and phrases are determined by breath, Emerson&#x27;s poetry foreshadowed the theories of Charles Olson.

<doc id="26204" wikidata="Q4220428" url="?curid=26204" title="Women in Judaism">
<text>Women in Judaism have affected the course of Judaism over millennia. Their role is reflected in the Hebrew Bible, the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by cultural factors. Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature present various female role models, religious law treats women in specific ways. According to a 2017 study by the Pew Research Center, women account for 52% of the worldwide Jewish population.

Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Rabbinic Judaism, Jewish affiliation is passed down through the mother, although the father&#x27;s name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah and in traditional Hebrew names, e. g., &quot;Dinah, daughter of Jacob&quot;.

A growing movement advocates for increased inclusion of women in positions such as rabbis, cantors, and communal leaders. This challenges historic practices. Perspectives on women&#x27;s roles evolved over time due to discussion and reinterpretation of religious texts.

Levi status (patrilineal descent from the tribe of Levi) is given only to a Jewish male descended patrilineally from Levi; likewise a Kohen descends from Aharon, the first Kohen. Bat-Kohens and Bat-Levis inherit that status from their Jewish father with the corresponding title HaKohen/HaLevi.

==Biblical times==

Compared to men, relatively few women are mentioned in the Bible by name and role. Those mentioned include the Matriarchs Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah; Miriam the prophetess; Rahab who assisted Joshua; Achsah, daughter of Caleb; Deborah the Judge; Naomi; Ruth great-grandmother of King David Huldah the prophetess; Abigail (who married David); Rahab; and Persian Jewish queen Esther. Ruth and Esther are the only women with books that bear their name.

Women are portrayed subverting male-dominated power structures. Many Jewish women are considered foundational by feminists because they provide insights into life during those times. They are notable for breaking the male dominance of historical documentation. This is notable given the poor documentation of most women&#x27;s lives at the time.

According to Jewish tradition, a covenant was formed between the Israelites and the God of Abraham at Mount Sinai. The Torah relates that Israelite men and women were present at Sinai; however, the covenant bound men to act upon its requirements and to ensure that household members (wives, children, and slaves) also met these requirements. In this sense, the covenant bound women, though indirectly.

Marriage and family law in biblical times gave men powers that it did not give to women. For example, a husband could choose to divorce a wife, but a wife could not divorce a husband without his consent. The practice of levirate marriage applied to widows of childless husbands, but not to widowers of childless wives; though, if either did not consent to the marriage, a ceremony called &quot;chalitza&quot; was done instead. The widow removes her brother-in-law&#x27;s shoe, spits in front of him, and proclaims, &quot;This is what happens to someone who will not build his brother&#x27;s house!&quot;

Laws concerning the loss of female virginity have no male equivalent. Many of these laws, such as levirate marriage, are no longer practiced (&quot;chalitzah&quot; is practiced instead of levirate marriage). These and other gender differences found in the Torah suggest that biblical society viewed continuity, property, and family unity as paramount; however, they also suggest that women were to be subordinate to men. Men were required to perform specific duties for their wives, but these often reinforced gendered roles. These included the provision of clothing, food, and sexual service to their wives.

Women participated in ritual life. Women were required to make pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem once a year (men should on each of the three main festivals if possible) and offer the Passover sacrifice. They would also do so on special occasions in their lives such as giving a &quot;todah&quot; (&quot;thanksgiving&quot;) offering after childbirth. Hence, they participated in many of the major public religious roles that non-Levitical men could, albeit less often and on a somewhat smaller and more discreet scale.

According to Jewish tradition, Michal, the daughter of Saul and David&#x27;s first wife, accepted the commandments of &quot;tefillin&quot; and &quot;tzitzit&quot;. However, these requirements applied only to men. Many of the &quot;mitzvot&quot; applied to both men and women; however, women were usually exempt from requirements to perform a duty at a specific time, as opposed to doing so at a convenient time or requirements to abstain from an act). Two prominent theories attempt to explain this: pragmatism (because women&#x27;s duties consume their time) and spirituality (because &quot;women have superior inherent spiritual wisdom&quot;, known as bina, that makes them less dependent than men on religious practices to retain a strong spiritual connection to God).

Women depended on men economically. Women generally did not own property except in the rare case of inheriting land from a father who did not bear sons. Even in such cases, &quot;women would be required to remarry within the tribe so as not to reduce its land holdings&quot;.

==Talmudic times==
Women were required by &quot;halacha&quot; to carry out all negative &quot;mitzvot&quot; (i. e., commandments that prohibit activities such as &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;), but were excused from doing most time-bound, positive &quot;mitzvot&quot; (i. e., commandments that prescribe ritual action that must be done at certain times such as hearing a shofar on Rosh Hashanah). A woman was not, however, prohibited from doing a &quot;mitzvah&quot; from which she was excused. &quot;Halacha&quot; also provided women with some material and emotional protections related to marriage, and divorce that most non-Jewish women did not enjoy during the first millennium of the Common Era. Penal and civil law treated men and women equally.

Evidence suggests that, at least among the elite, women were educated in the Bible and in &quot;halacha&quot;. The daughter of a scholar was considered a good prospect for marriage in part because of her education. Stories in the Talmud present women whose husbands died or were exiled and yet were able to educate their children because of their own education.

The Talmud states:
* Greater is the reward to be given by the All-Mighty to the (righteous) women than to (righteous) men.
* Ten measures of speech descended to the world; women took nine.
* Women are &quot;light on raw knowledge&quot; – i. e., they possess more intuition.
* A man without a wife lives without joy, blessing, and good; a man should love his wife as himself and respect her more than himself.
*When Rav Yosef b. Hiyya heard his mother&#x27;s footsteps he would say: &quot;Let me arise before the approach of the divine presence.&quot;
* Israel was redeemed from Egypt by virtue of its (Israel&#x27;s) righteous women.
* A man must be careful never to speak slightingly to his wife, because women are prone to tears and sensitive to wrong.
* Women have greater faith than men.
* Women have greater powers of discernment.
* Women are especially tenderhearted.

While few women are mentioned by name, and none are known to have authored a rabbinic work, those who are mentioned are portrayed as having a strong influence on their husbands. Occasionally they have a public persona. Examples are Bruriah, the wife of the Tanna Rabbi Meir; Rachel, wife of Rabbi Akiva; Yalta, the wife of Rabbi Nachman; and Ima Shalom, the wife of Eliezer ben Hurcanus. When Eleazar ben Azariah was asked to assume the role of &quot;Nasi&quot; (&quot;Prince&quot; or President of the Sanhedrin), he replied that he must first take counsel with his wife, which he did.

== Middle Ages ==
Since Jews were seen as second-class citizens in Christian and Muslim societies (legally known in the Muslim world as dhimmi), it was harder for Jewish women to establish their own status. Grossman claimed that three factors affected how Jewish women were perceived by society: &quot;the biblical and Talmudic heritage; the situation in the non-Jewish society within which the Jews lived and functioned; and the economic status of the Jews, including the woman&#x27;s role in supporting the family.&quot; Grossman used these factors to argue that women&#x27;s status overall during this period rose.

During the Middle Ages, a conflict emerged between Judaism&#x27;s expectations of women and the reality in which they lived; this was similar to the lives of Christian women of the period. This prompted the kabbalistic work &quot;Sefer Hakanah&quot; to demand that women fulfill the &quot;mitzvot&quot; in a way equal to men. In some communities of Ashkenaz in the fifteenth century, the wife of the rabbi wore &quot;tzitzit&quot; like her husband.

=== Religious life ===
Prohibitions against teaching women Torah eased, and women started to form prayer groups. Women participated in Jewish practices publicly at the synagogue. Women probably learned how to read the liturgy in Hebrew.

Bowker stated that traditionally, &quot;men and women pray separately. This goes back to ancient times when women could go only as far as the second court of the Temple.&quot; In most synagogues, women were given an area named Ezrat Nashim, most likely a balcony; some synagogues had a separate building.

Separation from the men was created by the Rabbis in the &quot;Mishnah&quot; and the &quot;Talmud&quot;. The reasoning was that a woman and her body would distract men and give them impure thoughts during prayer. Due to this rabbinical interpretation, scholars viewed the women&#x27;s role in the synagogue as limited and sometimes non-existent. Later research reported that women had a significant role in the synagogue and the community at large. Women usually attended synagogue, for example, on the Shabbat and the holidays.

Depending on the location, women either attended the same service as the men or conducted their own. In larger synagogues, a designated woman who was able to follow the cantor would repeat the prayers for the women. Women had always attended services on Shabbat and holidays, but beginning in the eleventh century, women became more involved in the synagogue and its rituals. Separate seating for women became a norm around the beginning of the thirteenth century. Women, however, did much more than pray. One of their main jobs was to beautify the building. Women sewed Torah ark curtains and Torah covers; some survive. The synagogue was a communal place for both men and women where worship, learning and community activities occurred.

The rise of Kabbalah, which emphasized the &quot;shechinah&quot; and female aspects of the divine presence and human-divine relationship, and which saw marriage as a holy covenant between partners rather than just a civil contract, had great influence. Kabbalists explained the phenomenon of menstruation as expressions of the demonic or sinful character of the menstruant. These changes were accompanied by increased pietistic strictures, including greater requirements for modest dress, and greater strictures while menstruating. Philosophical and &quot;midrashic&quot; interpretations depicted women in a negative light, emphasizing a duality between matter and spirit in which femininity was associated, with negative connotations, with earth and matter. Gentile society was seen as a negative influence on the Jewish community. For example, it seems that Jews would analyze the modesty of their Gentile neighbors before officially moving into a new community, because they knew that their children would be influenced by their surroundings.
After the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, women became virtually the only source of Jewish ritual and tradition in the Catholic world in a phenomenon known as crypto-Judaism. Crypto-Jewish women slaughtered their own animals, and followed as many of the Jewish dietary laws (&quot;Kashrut&quot; or &quot;kosher&quot;) and life cycle rituals as possible without raising suspicion. Occasionally, these women were prosecuted by Inquisition officials for suspicious behavior such as lighting candles to honor the Sabbath or refusing to eat pork. The Inquisition targeted crypto-Jewish women at least as much as it targeted crypto-Jewish men, because women were accused of perpetuating Jewish tradition while men were merely permitting their wives and daughters to organize the household.

=== Domestic life ===

Marriage, domestic violence and divorce were discussed by Jewish sages of the Medieval world. Marriage is an important institution in Judaism. The wife/mother is called &quot;akeret habayit&quot; in Hebrew, which in English means &quot;mainstay of the house&quot;. In traditional and Orthodox Judaism the &quot;akeret habayit&quot; tends to the family and household duties.

Rabbeinu Gershom instituted a rabbinic decree (t&quot;akkanah&quot;) prohibiting polygyny among Ashkenazic Jews. At the time, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews did not accept this ban.

The rabbis instituted legal methods to enable women to petition a rabbinical court to compel a divorce. Maimonides ruled that a woman who found her husband &quot;repugnant&quot; could ask a court to compel a divorce by flogging the recalcitrant husband &quot;because she is not like a captive, to be subjected to intercourse with one who is hateful to her&quot;. Furthermore, Maimonides ruled that a woman may &quot;consider herself as divorced and remarry&quot; if her husband remained absent for three years. This was to prevent women married to traveling merchants from becoming an &quot;agunah&quot; if the husband never returned.

The rabbis instituted and tightened prohibitions on domestic violence. Rabbi Peretz ben Elijah ruled, &quot;The cry of the daughters of our people has been heard concerning the sons of Israel who raise their hands to strike their wives. Yet who has given a husband the authority to beat his wife?&quot; Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg ruled that, &quot;For it is the way of the Gentiles to behave thus, but Heaven forbid that any Jew should do so. And one who beats his wife is to be excommunicated and banned and beaten.&quot; He also ruled that a battered wife could petition a rabbinical court to compel a husband to grant a divorce, with a monetary fine owed to her on top of the regular &quot;ketubah&quot; money. These rulings occurred in the midst of societies where wife-beating was legally sanctioned and routine.

=== Education ===
Jewish women had a limited education. They were taught to read, write, run a household. They were given some education in religious law that was essential to their daily lives, such as keeping kosher. Both Christian and Jewish girls were educated in the home. Although Christian girls might have either a male or female tutor, most Jewish girls had a female tutor. Higher learning was uncommon for women. More sources of education were available for Jewish women in Muslim-controlled lands. Middle Eastern Jewry had an abundance of female literates.

Many women had enough education to help their husbands in business or even run their own. Jewish women seem to have lent money to Christian women throughout Europe. Women also worked as copyists, midwives, spinners, and weavers.

==Debates in Jewish law==
===Education of women===
From certain contexts of the &quot;Mishnah&quot; and &quot;Talmud&quot;, it can be derived that women should not study &quot;Mishnah&quot;. Female Tannaitic Torah jurists included Rabbi Meir&#x27;s wife, Rabbi Meir&#x27;s daughter, and the daughter of Haninah ben Teradion. Haninah&#x27;s daughter is mentioned as a sage in the non-Talmudic third-century text &quot;Tractate Semahot&quot; 12:13. Rabbi Meir&#x27;s wife is credited with teaching him how to understand some verses from Isaiah. The &quot;Mishnah&quot; references certain women teaching men the Torah from behind a curtain so that no man would be offended.

However, a &quot;yeshiva&quot;, or school for Talmudic studies, is an &quot;exclusively masculine environment&quot;.

Maimonides tended to elevate the status of women above the then norm. For example, he permitted women to study &quot;Torah&quot; even though other legal opinions did not. Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai wrote that women should study the &quot;Mishnah&quot; only if they wanted to. According to the &quot;Hida&quot;, the prohibition of teaching women does not apply to a motivated woman or girl. Maimonides&#x27; response to detractors was the prohibition against teaching Mishnah to any student—male or female—unless they were properly prepared and motivated.

One of the most important Ashkenazi rabbanim of the past century, Yisrael Meir Kagan, known popularly as the &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;, favored &quot;Torah&quot; education for girls to counteract the French &quot;finishing schools&quot; prevalent in his day for the daughters of the bourgeoisie. 

;Joseph Soloveitchik
Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik taught that all religious Ashkenazi Jews, except hardline Hasidim, must teach their girls &quot;Gemarah&quot; like the boys: &quot;The halakha prohibiting Torah study for women is not indiscriminate or all-encompassing. ... &#x27;If ever circumstances dictate that study of Torah sh-Ba&#x27;al Peh is necessary to provide a firm foundation for faith, such study becomes obligatory and obviously lies beyond the pale of any prohibition.&#x27; Undoubtedly, the Rav&#x27;s prescription was more far-reaching than that of the Hafets Hayim and others. But the difference in magnitude should not obscure their fundamental agreement [on changing the attitudes Halachically].&quot;

==Present day==


===Orthodox Judaism===
Orthodox Judaism is complementarian. Opinions vary among Orthodox Jews concerning these principles. Most claim that men and women have different roles and bear different obligations. For example, women are not burdened with time-bound &quot;mitzvot&quot;. Others believe that such differences have cultural, social, and historical causes. Women were historically exempted from religious study beyond understanding the practical aspects of &quot;Torah&quot; and the practices necessary for running a devout household—both of which they were obligated to learn. Until the twentieth century, women were often discouraged from learning Talmud and other advanced Jewish texts. In the past 100 years, Orthodox Jewish education for women has expanded. This is most visible in the development of the Bais Yaakov system.

Orthodox women have been working to expand women&#x27;s learning and scholarship, promoting women&#x27;s ritual inclusion in worship and promoting women&#x27;s communal and religious leadership. Some rabbinic leaders oppose such changes, claiming that women are motivated by sociological reasons rather than religion. For example, Orthodox, Haredi, and Hasidic rabbis discourage women from wearing a &quot;kippah&quot;, &quot;tallit&quot;, or &quot;tefillin&quot;.

In many Orthodox synagogues, women are not entitled to deliver &quot;divrei Torah&quot;—brief discourses on the weekly Torah portion—after or between services; &quot;shiurim&quot; are typically limited to men. Orthodox synagogues have physical barriers (&quot;mechitzot&quot;) dividing the left and right sides of the synagogue, with the women on one side and the men on the other. Historically, many Orthodox synagogues restricted women to balcony seating while men sat on the main floor. Formally, a &quot;mechitzah&quot; of over four feet or so (ten handbreadths) suffices, even if the men can see the women, though such a small separation is not ideal. A typical &quot;mechitzah&quot; consists of wheeled wooden panels, often topped with one-way glass to allow women to view the Torah reading.

====Rules of modesty====

Although Judaism prescribes modesty for both men and women, the importance of modesty in dress and conduct is particularly stressed among women and girls. Orthodox women wear skirts and avoid trousers, and most married Orthodox women cover their hair with a scarf (&quot;tichel&quot;), snood, hat, beret, or wig.

====&quot;Halakhic&quot; advisor====

Under Jewish Law, Orthodox Jewish women refrain from bodily contact with their husbands while they are menstruating and for 7 days afterwards, and after the birth of a child. The Israeli Rabbinate allows women to act as &quot;yoatzot&quot;, &quot;halakhic&quot; advisers on matters considered sensitive and personal such as niddah.

====Modern Orthodox ====
Orthodox leader Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik discouraged women from serving as presidents of synagogues or other official leadership positions, from performing other &quot;mitzvot&quot; traditionally performed by males exclusively, such as wearing a &quot;tallit&quot; or &quot;tefillin&quot;. One reason is that tefillin are believed to help men avoid thoughts considered impure, while women are believed not to have such thoughts. Soloveitchik wrote that while women do not lack the capability to perform such acts, there is no &quot;mesorah&quot; (Jewish tradition) that permits it. In making his decision, he relied upon Jewish oral law, including a &quot;mishnah&quot; in Chulin 2a and a &quot;Beit Yoseph&quot; in the &quot;Tur Yoreh Deah&quot; stating that a woman can perform a specific official communal service for her own needs, but not those of others.

Women&#x27;s issues garnered more interest with the advent of feminism. Many Modern Orthodox Jewish women and Modern Orthodox rabbis sought to provide more Jewish education for women. Modern Orthodox communities promote women&#x27;s secular education. A few Modern Orthodox Synagogues have women serving as clergy, including Gilah Kletenik at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun.

In 2010, Sara Hurwitz became the first woman to be ordained as a &quot;Rabba&quot;, or female equivalent of a rabbi, when she started serving as an Open Orthodox spiritual leader.

In 2013, Yeshivat Maharat, located in the United States, became the first Orthodox institution to consecrate female clergy. The graduates of Yeshivat Maharat were called &quot;maharat&quot; rather than rabbi. However, in 2015, Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba there. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi there, their first graduate to take the title.

In 2013, Malka Schaps became the first female Haredi dean at an Israeli university when she was appointed dean of Bar Ilan University&#x27;s Faculty of Exact Sciences. Also in 2013, the first class of female &quot;halachic&quot; advisers in the US graduated from the North American branch of Nishmat&#x27;s &quot;yoetzet halacha&quot; program. SAR High School began allowing girls to wrap &quot;tefillin&quot; during &quot;Shacharit&quot;-morning prayer in an all-female prayer group, the first Modern Orthodox high school in the U.S. to do so.

In 2014, the first-ever book of &quot;halachic&quot; decisions was written by women who were ordained to serve as &quot;poskot&quot; (Idit Bartov and Anat Novoselsky) was published. They were ordained by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, after completing Midreshet Lindenbaum women&#x27;s college&#x27;s course, as well as passing examinations equivalent to the rabbinate&#x27;s requirement for men.

On June 10, 2015, Dr. Meesh Hammer-Kossoy and Rahel Berkovits became the first women ordained as Modern Orthodox Jewish rabbas in Israel.

In June 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained by Yeshivat Maharat and given the freedom to choose her own title, she chose &quot;Rabbi&quot;. She became the first female Modern Orthodox rabbi in the US in January 2016.

In the fall, the Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and declared Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, and Open Orthodoxy as having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. The Rabbinical Council of America passed a resolution which stated, &quot;RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution.&quot;

Jennie Rosenfeld became the first female Orthodox spiritual advisor in Israel.

In 2016 Ephraim Mirvis created the job of &quot;ma&#x27;ayan&quot; by which women would be advisers on Jewish law in the area of family purity and as adult educators in Orthodox synagogues. This required a part-time training course for 18 months, the first such course in the United Kingdom. On August 23, 2016, Karmit Feintuch became the first woman in Jerusalem to be hired as a Modern Orthodox &quot;rabbanit&quot; and serve as a spiritual leader.

In 2017, the Orthodox Union adopted a policy banning women from serving as clergy, from holding titles such as &quot;rabbi&quot;, and from performing common clergy functions even without a title, in its US congregations.

====Women&#x27;s prayer groups====
In Germany, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, women&#x27;s prayer groups were led by female cantors. Rabbi Eliezer of Worms, in his elegy for his wife Dulca, praised her for teaching the other women how to pray and embellishing the prayer with music. The gravestone of Urania of Worms, who died in 1275, contains the inscription &quot;who sang &quot;piyyutim&quot; for the women with musical voice&quot;. In the Nurnberg Memorial Book, one Richenza was inscribed with the title &quot;prayer leader of the women&quot;.

Orthodox women more recently began holding organized women&#x27;s &quot;tefila&quot; (prayer) groups beginning in the 1970s. While Orthodox legal authorities agree that women are prohibited from forming a &quot;minyan&quot; (prayer quorum) for the purpose of regular services, women in these groups have read the prayers and study Torah. A number of leaders from all segments of Orthodox Judaism have commented on this issue, but it has had a little, although growing, impact on Haredi and Sephardi Judaism. However, the emergence of this phenomenon has enmeshed Modern Orthodox Judaism in a debate which still continues today. There are three schools of thought on this issue:

* The most restrictive view, held by a few rabbis, rules that all women&#x27;s prayer groups are absolutely forbidden by &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law).
* A more liberal, permissive view maintains that women&#x27;s prayer groups can be compatible with halakha, but only if they do not carry out a full prayer service (i. e., do not include certain parts of the service known as &quot;devarim shebikedusha&quot; that require a minyan; for example the recital of Kaddish or reading from the Torah), and only if services are spiritually and sincerely motivated, as is usually the case; they cannot be sanctioned if they are inspired by a desire to rebel against &quot;halakha&quot;. People in this group include Rabbi Avraham Elkana Shapiro, former British Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, and Rabbi Avi Weiss. This is the generally followed view.
* A third view argues in favor of the acceptability of calling women to the Torah in mixed services, and leading certain parts of the service which do not require a minyan, under certain conditions.

In 2013, the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the Kaddish prayer in memory of their deceased parents.

====Women as witnesses====
Traditionally, women are not generally permitted to serve as witnesses in an Orthodox Beit Din (rabbinical court), although they have recently been permitted to serve as &quot;toanot&quot; (advocates) in those courts. Women are also permitted to provide evidence under oath, and their statements are considered to be fully credible in ritual matters. The exclusion of women as witnesses has exceptions which have required exploration under rabbinic law, as the role of women in society and the obligations of religious groups under external civil law have been subject to increasing recent scrutiny.

The recent case of Rabbi Mordecai Tendler, the first rabbi to be expelled from the Rabbinical Council of America following allegations of sexual harassment, illustrated the importance of clarification of Orthodox halakha in this area. Rabbi Tendler claimed that the tradition of exclusion of women&#x27;s testimony should compel the RCA to disregard the allegations. He argued that since the testimony of a woman could not be admitted in Rabbinical court, there were no valid witnesses against him, and hence, the case for his expulsion had to be thrown out for lack of evidence. In a ruling of importance for Orthodox women&#x27;s capacity for legal self-protection under Jewish law, Haredi Rabbi Benzion Wosner, writing on behalf of the &quot;Shevet Levi&quot; Beit Din (Rabbinical court) of Monsey, New York, identified sexual harassment cases as coming under a class of exceptions to the traditional exclusion, under which &quot;even children or women&quot; have not only a right, but an obligation, to testify, and can be relied upon by a rabbinical court as valid witnesses:

:The Ramah in Choshen Mishpat (Siman 35, 14) rules that in a case where only women congregate, or in a case where only women could possibly testify (in this case, the alleged harassment occurred behind closed doors), they can, and should, certainly testify. (Terumas Hadeshen Siman 353 and Agudah Perek 10, Yochasin)

:This is also the ruling of the Maharik, Radvaz, and the Mahar&quot;i of Minz. Even those Poskim that would normally not rely on women witnesses, they would certainly agree that in our case ... where there is ample evidence that this Rabbi violated Torah precepts, then even children or women can certainly be kosher as witnesses, as the Chasam Sofer pointed out in his &quot;sefer&quot; (monograph) (Orach Chaim T&#x27;shuvah 11)

The Rabbinical Council of America, while initially relying on its own investigation, chose to rely on the Halakhic ruling of the Haredi Rabbinical body as authoritative in the situation.

====Orthodox approaches to change====
Leaders of the Haredi community have opposed many changes to the role of women. Many have argued that religious and social constraints on women are timeless, and are not subject to change. Many have argued that giving traditionally male roles to women would detract from both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s ability to lead fulfilling lives. Haredim have perceived arguments for liberalization as stemming from antagonism to Jewish law and beliefs.

More liberal variants of Modern Orthodox Judaism tend to view proposed changes in the role of women on a case-by-case basis, focusing on arguments regarding the religious and legal role of specific prayers, rituals and activities individually. Such arguments focus on cases where the Talmud and other traditional sources express multiple or more liberal viewpoints, particularly where the role of women in the past was arguably broader than in later times. Feminist advocates within Orthodoxy generally stay within the traditional legal process of argumentation, seeking a gradualist approach. Nevertheless, a growing Orthodox feminist movement seeks to address gender inequalities.

===Agunot===
&quot;Agunot&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;chained women&quot;) are women whose husbands refuse to give them a divorce contract (a &quot;get&quot;). The word can also refer to a woman whose husband has disappeared. In Orthodox Judaism, only a man is able to serve a &quot;get&quot;. In order to prevent a husband from such a refusal, many couples sign a prenuptial agreement that forces the husband to serve a get or else be reported to the Jewish court.

===Conservative Judaism===

Although the position of Conservative Judaism toward women originally differed little from the Orthodox position, it later minimized legal and ritual differences between men and women. The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly issued decisions and responsa on this topic. These provide for women&#x27;s active participation in areas such as:

*Publicly reading the &quot;Torah&quot; (&quot;ba&#x27;al kriah&quot;)
*Being counted as part of a &quot;minyan&quot;
*Being called for an &quot;aliyah&quot; to read the Torah
*Serving as a cantor (&quot;shaliach tzibbur&quot;)
*Serving as rabbi and halakhic decisor (&quot;posek&quot; - an arbiter in matters of religious law)
*Wearing a &quot;tallit&quot; and &quot;tefillin&quot;

A rabbi may decide which particular rulings to adopt for the congregation; thus, some Conservative congregations became more or less egalitarian than others.

Areas where legal differences remain between men and women include:
*Matrilineal descent. The child of a Jewish mother is born Jewish; the child of a Jewish father is born Jewish if and only if the mother is Jewish.
*&quot;Pidyon Ha-Bat&quot;, a proposed ceremony based on the biblical redemption of the eldest newborn son (&quot;Pidyon Ha-Ben&quot;). CJLS stated that this ceremony should not be performed for women. Other ceremonies, such as a &quot;Simchat Bat&quot; (welcoming a newborn daughter), should instead be used.

A Conservative Jewish &quot;ketuba&quot; includes a clause that puts a husband and wife on more equal footing when it comes to marriage and divorce law within &quot;halacha&quot;.

CJLS reaffirmed in 2006 the obligation of Conservative women to observe &quot;niddah&quot; (sexual abstinence during and after menstruation) and &quot;mikvah&quot; (ritual immersion) following menstruation, although liberalizing certain details. Such practices, while requirements of Conservative Judaism, are not widely observed among Conservative laity.

==== Changes ====

Conservative Judaism traditionally held traditional views of women&#x27;s role. However, in 1946, the new Silverman siddur changed the traditional words of thanking God for &quot;not making me a woman&quot;, instead thanking God for &quot;making me a free person.&quot; In 1955, the CJLS of the Rabbinical Assembly allowed women to have an &quot;aliyah&quot; at &quot;Torah&quot;-readings services.

In 1973, the CJLS of the Rabbinical Assembly voted, without issuing an opinion, that women could count in a &quot;minyan&quot;.

A commission appointed by the Conservative movement to study the issue of ordaining women as rabbis, met between 1977 and 1978. It consisted of eleven men and three women: attorney Marian Siner Gordon, Assyriologist Rivkah Harris, and author Francine Klagsbrun. In 1983, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) faculty voted, also without accompanying opinion, to ordain women as rabbis and as cantors. Paula Hyman, among others, voted as a member of the JTSA faculty.

In 2002, the CJLS adapted a responsum by Rabbi David Fine, &quot;Women and the Minyan&quot;, which provided a religious-law foundation for women counting in a &quot;minyan&quot; and explained the Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer. It holds that although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this undertaking, Fine&#x27;s responsum claimed that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others. The responsum also held that traditionally-minded communities and individual women could opt out without sinning. By adopting this responsum, the CJLS allowed itself to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its practices, without having to rely on &quot;ad hoc&quot; arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the &quot;halakhic&quot; tradition, or label women as sinners who followed traditional practices.

In 2006, the CJLS adopted three responsa on the subject of &quot;niddah&quot;, which reaffirmed the obligation of Conservative women to abstain from sexual relations during and following menstruation and to immerse in a &quot;mikvah&quot; prior to resumption, while liberalizing observance requirements including shortening the length of the &quot;niddah&quot;, lifting restrictions on non-sexual contact during &quot;niddah&quot;, and reducing the circumstances under which spotting and similar conditions would mandate abstinence.

Continuing the Orthodox approach remained acceptable. Individual Conservative rabbis and synagogues were not required to change, and a small number did not.

====Conservative approaches to change====
Between 1973 and 2002, the Conservative movement adopted changes through its official organizations, but without issuing explanatory opinions. Since 2002, the Conservative movement coalesced around a unified approach to the role of women.

In 1973, 1983, and 1993, individual rabbis and professors issued six major opinions that influenced the Conservative approach, the first and second Sigal, Blumenthal, Rabinowitz, and Roth responsa, and the Hauptman article. These opinions sought to launch a wholesale shift in women&#x27;s public roles through a comprehensive legal justification. Most such opinions proposed that Jewish women always were, or had become, legally obligated to perform many of the same &quot;&quot; as men and, when performing , to do so in the same manner.

The first Sigal and the Blumenthal responsa were considered by CJLS as part of its decision on prayer roles in 1973. They argued that women had always had the same obligations as men. The first Sigal responsum used the &quot;Talmud&quot;&#x27;s general prayer obligation and examples of cases in which women were traditionally obligated to say specific prayers. They inferred from them a public prayer obligation identical to that of men. The Blumenthal responsum extrapolated from a minority authority that a &quot;minyan&quot; could be formed with nine men and one woman in an emergency. CJLS declined to adopt either responsum. Rabbi Sigal reported to the Rabbinical Assembly membership that many on the CJLS, while agreeing with the result, found the arguments unconvincing.

The Rabinowitz, Roth, and second Sigal responsa were considered by JTSA faculty as part of its decision to ordain women as rabbis in 1983. The Rabbinowitz responsum sidestepped the issue of obligation, arguing that a community representative was no longer needed in prayer and hence the question of whether a woman can perform &quot;halakhic&quot; was moot. CJLS stated that an argument potentially undermining the value of community and clergy was unconvincing: &quot;We should not be afraid to recognize that the function of clergy is to help our people connect with the holy.&quot; The Roth and second Sigal responsa accepted that time-bound &quot;mitzvot&quot; were traditionally optional for women, but argued that women in modern times could change their traditional roles. The Roth responsum argued that women could voluntarily assume the same obligations as men, and that women who do so (e. g., pray three times a day regularly) could count in a &quot;minyan&quot; and serve as agents. JTSA accordingly required female rabbinical students wishing to train as rabbis to personally obligate themselves. Synagogue rabbis, unwilling to inquire into individual religiosity, found this impractical. The second Sigal responsum called for a &quot;takkanah&quot;, or rabbinical edict, &quot;that would serve as a &quot;halakhic&quot; ERA&quot;, overruling all non-egalitarian provisions in law or, in the alternative, adopet an approach to &quot;halakhic&quot; interpretation independent of legal precedents. CJLS, unwilling to take either an intrusive approach or repudiate the traditional legal process, did not adopt either and let the JTS faculty vote stand unexplained.

In 1993, Professor Judith Hauptman of JTSA issued an influential paper arguing that women had historically always been obligated in prayer, using more detailed arguments than the Blumenthal and first Sigal responsa. The paper suggested that women who followed traditional practices were failing to meet their obligations. Rabbi Roth argued that Conservative Judaism should reconsider before adopting a stance that labeled its most traditional members as sinners. The issue was again dropped.

In 2002, the CJLS returned to the issue and adopted a single authoritative approach, the Fine responsum, as the definitive Conservative &quot;halakha&quot; on role-of-women issues. This responsum held that although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have collectively and voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this, the Fine responsum held that Conservative women were eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others. The Responsum also held that traditionally minded communities and individuals could continue traditional practice without sinning. By adopting this Responsum, CJLS was able to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the &quot;halakhic&quot; tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.

===Reform Judaism===

Reform Judaism believes in the equality of men and women. It rejects the idea that &quot;halakha&quot; is the sole legitimate form of Jewish decisionmaking, and holds that Jews must consider their conscience and ethical principles inherent in the Jewish tradition when deciding upon a right course of action. Consensus is widespread among Reform Jews that traditional distinctions between the role of men and women violate the deeper ethical principles of Judaism. This has enabled Reform communities to allow women to perform many rituals traditionally reserved for men, such as:
*Publicly reading the &quot;Torah&quot; w(&quot;ba&#x27;al kriah&quot;)
*Being part of the &quot;minyan&quot;
*Being called for an &quot;aliyah&quot; to read the Torah
*Serving as a cantor (&quot;shalich tzibbur&quot;)
*Serving as rabbi and halakhic decisor (&quot;posek&quot;)
*Wearing a &quot;tallit&quot; and &quot;tefillin&quot;

Concerns about intermarriage influenced the Reform Jewish position on gender. In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. The 1983 resolution had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone whose mother is not Jewish. A joint&quot;Bet Din&quot; composed of Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative, and Reform rabbis, established in Denver, Colorado to promote uniform conversion standards, dissolved in 1983 due to that resolution.. In 2015, the majority of Britain&#x27;s Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing &quot;that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process&quot;. Britain&#x27;s Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis &quot;would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the Beit Din – confirming Jewish status&quot;.

Reform prayerbooks tend to avoid male-specific words and pronouns, making all references to God in translations in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement&#x27;s &quot;Siddur Lev Chadash&quot; (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement&#x27;s &quot;Forms of Prayer&quot; (2008). In Mishkan T&#x27;filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as &quot;He&quot; have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) In 2015 the Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book &quot;Mishkan HaNefesh&quot; was released as a companion to &quot;Mishkan T&#x27;filah&quot;. It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both &quot;Loving Father&quot; and &quot;Compassionate Mother&quot;. Other notable changes replaced a line from the Reform movement&#x27;s earlier prayerbook, &quot;Gates of Repentance&quot;, that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line &quot;rejoicing with couples under the &quot;chuppah&quot;&quot; (wedding canpopy), and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the &quot;Torah&quot;, offering &quot;mibeit&quot; (from the house of), in addition to the traditional &quot;son of&quot; or &quot;daughter of&quot;.

In 2008, Stacy Offner became the first female vice president of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 2015, Daryl Messinger became the first female Union chair.

====Reform approaches to change====
Reform Judaism generally holds that the various differences between the roles of men and women in traditional Jewish law are not relevant to modern conditions and no longer applicable. Accordingly, legal arguments were not needed.

=== Reconstructionist Judaism ===
The equality of women and men is a central tenet and hallmark of Reconstructionist Judaism. From the beginning, Reconstructionist Jewish ritual allowed men and women to pray together. It was on this basis that Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan called for the full equality of women and men, despite the obvious difficulties reconciling this stance with traditional Jewish practice. The Reconstructionist Movement always allowed women to be ordained. In 1968, women were accepted into the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, under Ira Eisenstein&#x27;s leadership. The first ordained female Reconstructionist rabbi, Sandy Eisenberg Sasso, served as rabbi of the Manhattan Reconstructionist Congregation in 1976, and gained a pulpit in 1977 at Beth El Zedeck congregation in Indianapolis. Sandy Eisenberg Sasso was accepted without debate or subsequent controversy. In 2005, 24 of the movement&#x27;s 106 synagogues in the US had women as senior or assistant rabbis. In 2013 Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the President of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. She was the first woman and first lesbian to officially to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.

The Reconstructionist Community began including women in the &quot;minyan&quot; and allowing them to come up to the Torah for &quot;aliyot&quot;. They also continued the practice of &quot;bat mitzvah&quot;. Reconstructionist Judaism allowed women to perform other traditionally male tasks, such as serving as witnesses, leading services, public &quot;Torah&quot; reading, and wearing ritual prayer garments like &quot;kippot&quot; and &quot;tallitot&quot;. Female Reconstructionist rabbis were instrumental in the creation of rituals, stories, and music that give women a voice in Judaism. Most of the focus has been on rituals for life-cycle events. New ceremonies have been created for births, weddings, divorces, conversions, weaning, and the onset of menarche and menopause. The Reconstructionist movement committed to creating liturgy that supports gender equality and the celebration of women&#x27;s lives. Another major step: The Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations developed educational programs that teach the full acceptance of lesbians, as well as rituals that affirm lesbian relationships. Reconstructionist rabbis officiate at same-sex weddings. Reconstructionist Judaism allows openly LGBT people to be ordained as rabbis and cantors.

Prominent members of the Reconstructionist community focused on issues such as domestic violence. Others devoted energy to helping women gain the right of divorce in traditional Jewish communities. Many have spoken out for the right of Jewish women to pray aloud and read from the &quot;Torah&quot; at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, particularly members of the Women of the Wall group.

When the roles of women in religion change, men&#x27;s roles may also change. With their acceptance of patrilineal descent in 1979, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association supported the principle that a man can pass Judaism on to the next generation as well as a woman.

=== Jewish Renewal ===
Jewish Renewal describes itself as &quot;a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism&#x27;s prophetic and mystical traditions&quot;. The Jewish Renewal movement ordains women and men as rabbis and cantors. Lynn Gottlieb became the first female rabbi in Jewish Renewal in 1981, and Avitall Gerstetter became the first female cantor in Jewish Renewal (and the first female cantor in Germany) in 2002. In 2009 and 2012 respectively, OHALAH (Association of Rabbis for Jewish Renewal) issued a board statement and a resolution supporting Women of the Wall. OHALAH&#x27;s Statement of Principles states, &quot;Our local communities will embody egalitarian and inclusive values, manifested in a variety of leadership and decision-making structures, ensuring that women and men are full and equal partners in every aspect of our communal Jewish life.&quot; In 2014 OHALAH issued a board resolution stating, &quot;Therefore, be it resolved that: OHALAH supports the observance of Women&#x27;s History Month, International Women&#x27;s Day, and Women&#x27;s Equality Day; OHALAH condemns all types of sexism; OHALAH is committed to gender equality, now and in all generations to come; and OHALAH supports equal rights regardless of gender.&quot; Also in 2014, ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal issued a statement stating, &quot;ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal supports the observance of Women&#x27;s History Month, International Women&#x27;s Day, and Women&#x27;s Equality Day, condemns all types of sexism, is committed to gender equality, now and in all generations to come, and supports equal rights regardless of gender, in recognition and allegiance to the view that we are all equally created in the Divine Image.&quot;

=== Humanistic Judaism ===
Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis; its first rabbi was a woman, Tamara Kolton, who was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, ordained in 2001; Humanistic Judaism later stopped ordaining cantors. The Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a statement in 1996 stating, &quot;We affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications.&quot; In 2012, they opposed conscience clauses that allowed religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from requirements mandating the provision of reproductive healthcare services. In 2013 stated, &quot;Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of Women&#x27;s Equality Day on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow.&quot;

=== Sofrot (scribe) ===
Sofrot is the feminine plural of Sofer. A Sopher, Sopher, Sofer STaM, or Sofer ST&quot;M (Heb: &quot;scribe&quot;, סופר סת״ם) is a Jewish scribe who is able and entitled to transcribe &quot;Torah&quot; scrolls, &quot;tefillin&quot; and &quot;mezuzot&quot;, and other religious writings. (ST&quot;M, סת״ם, is an abbreviation for Sefer Torahs, Tefillin, and Mezuzot. The masculine plural of sofer is &quot;sofrim&quot; סופרים).

Forming the basis for the discussion of women becoming sofrot, Talmud Gittin 45b states: &quot;Sifrei Torah, tefillin, and mezuzot written by a heretic, a star-worshipper, a slave, a woman, a minor, a Cuthean, or an apostate Jew, are unfit for ritual use.&quot;. As Arba&#x27;ah Turim does not include women in its list of those ineligible to write Sifrei Torah, some see this as proof that women are permitted to write a &quot;Torah&quot; scroll. However, virtually all Orthodox (both Modern and Ultra) authorities reject the idea that a woman is permitted to write a Sefer Torah. Yet women are permitted to inscribe Ketubot (marriage contracts), STaM not intended for ritual use, and other writings of Sofrut beyond simple STaM. In 2003, Canadian Aviel Barclay became the world&#x27;s first public, traditionally-trained, female sofer. In 2007 Jen Taylor Friedman, a British woman, became the first female sofer to scribe a Sefer Torah. In 2010 the first Sefer Torah scribed by a group of women (six female sofers, from Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the United States) was completed; this was known as the Women&#x27;s Torah Project.

From October 2010 until spring 2011, Julie Seltzer, one of the female sofers from the Women&#x27;s Torah Project, scribed a Sefer Torah as part of an exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. This makes her the first American female sofer to scribe a Sefer Torah. Seltzer is non-denominationally Jewish. From spring 2011 until August 2012 she scribed another Sefer Torah, this time for the Reform congregation Beth Israel in San Diego. On September 22, 2013, Congregation Beth Elohim of New York dedicated a new Torah, which members of Beth Elohim said was the first Torah in New York City to be completed by a woman. The &quot;Torah&quot; was scribed by Linda Coppleson. As of 2014, there were an estimated 50 female sofers.

<text>The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act is a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization.

RICO was enacted by Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (), and is codified at as .

This article primarily covers the federal criminal statute, but since 1972, 33 U.S. states and territories have adopted state RICO laws, which although similar, cover additional state crimes and may differ from the federal law and each other in several respects.

== History ==
G. Robert Blakey, an adviser to the United States Senate Government Operations Committee, drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee&#x27;s chairman, Senator John L. McClellan.

It was signed into law by US President Richard Nixon. Prosecutors in the 1970s used it to prosecute the Mafia as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime. In later years, prosecutors have applied the law more broadly.

== Summary ==

Under RICO, a person who has committed &quot;at least two acts of racketeering activity&quot; drawn from a list of 35 crimes (27 federal crimes and eight state crimes) within a 10-year period can be charged with racketeering if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an &quot;enterprise.&quot;

Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count.

In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of &quot;racketeering activity.&quot;

A US Attorney who indicts someone under RICO has the option of seeking a pre-trial restraining order or an injunction to temporarily seize a defendant&#x27;s assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property as well as to require the defendant to put up a performance bond. An injunction or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict.

This provision prevented the owners of Mafia-related shell corporations from absconding with assets. In many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense attorney.

Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court because it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.

=== Enterprise defined ===
There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise. Either the defendant(s):
* invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or
* acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or
* conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise &quot;through&quot; the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or
* conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)).

The US Supreme Court noted that a commentator had used the terms &quot;prize&quot;, &quot;instrument&quot;, &quot;victim&quot;, or &quot;perpetrator&quot; for these four relationships.

=== Civil suits ===
RICO also permits a private individual &quot;damaged in his business or property&quot; by a &quot;racketeer&quot; to file a civil suit. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an &quot;enterprise.&quot; The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same.

A civil RICO action can be filed in state or federal court.

Both the criminal and the civil components allow the recovery of treble damages (triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages).

=== Organized crime ===
Although its primary intent was to deal with organized crime, Blakey said that Congress never intended it merely to apply to the Mob. He once told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;We don&#x27;t want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have Ivy League diplomas.&quot;

On December 1, 1977, the federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Louisiana indicted thirteen defendants, Robert J. L&#x27;Hoste &amp; Company, Inc. for conspiracy and racketeering activity. After the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment for overbreadth and vagueness, the grand jury returned a superseding indictment on February 27, 1978, charging the same offenses and naming eleven defendants, including the appellants. The district court denied a motion to dismiss the superseding indictment, and the first RICO trial commenced on March 13, 1978. The jury convicted the four appellants and another corporation on both the conspiracy and racketeering counts.

In May 1979, prosecutor Mark L. Webb, Northern District of California, conducted RICO trial, &quot;United States v. Sam Bailey Gang&quot;. The successful prosecution used the RICO statute to allege that a gang of postal burglars and a Nevada fence collaborated criminally in an organized crime fashion. The case did not involve a Mafia crime family.

Subsequently, the US Attorney&#x27;s office for the Eastern District of Arkansas used the RICO Act on October 2, 1978, to indict officers of Local 1292 of the Laborers International Union of North America. Special Assistant United States Attorney, Samuel A. Perroni, prosecuted the first labor union official trial that began on June 5, 1979. Perroni&#x27;s successful prosecution used RICO to convict the defendants of conspiracy, murder for hire, perjury and embezzlement of union property in &quot;United States v. Allison, et al.&quot;

The US Attorney&#x27;s Office in the Southern District of New York employed the RICO Act on September 18, 1979, in &quot;United States v. Scotto&quot;. Scotto, who was convicted on charges of racketeering, accepting unlawful labor payments, and income tax evasion, headed the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association.

During the 1980s and the 1990s, federal prosecutors used the law to bring charges against several Mafia figures. In 1985, United States Attorney Rudy Giuliani (who would be indicted under Georgia RICO laws in August 2023) indicted 11 organized crime figures in &quot;United States v. Anthony Salerno, et al&quot;, also known as Mafia Commission Trial. Using the RICO Act, Giuliani charged the heads of New York&#x27;s so-called &quot;Five Families&quot; with extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire.

Three Assistant United States Attorneys assisted in the trial: Michael Chertoff, the eventual second United States Secretary of Homeland Security and co-author of the Patriot Act; John Savarese, later a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz; and Gil Childers, a later deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York and later managing director in the legal department at Goldman Sachs.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called the &quot;Case of Cases&quot; possibly &quot;the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943&quot; and quoted Giuliani&#x27;s stated intention: &quot;Our approach is to wipe out the five families.&quot;

Three heads of the Five Families were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987. The Genovese and Colombo leaders, Tony Salerno and Carmine Persico received additional sentences in separate trials, with 70-year and 39-year sentences to run consecutively. The Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano and his underboss, Thomas Bilotti, were murdered on the streets of Midtown Manhattan on December 16, 1985.

== State laws ==
As of 2014, 33 states as well as Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands had adopted state RICO laws to cover state offenses under a similar scheme.

==RICO predicate offenses==

Under the law, the meaning of racketeering activity is set out at . As currently amended it includes:

*Any violation of state statutes against gambling, murder, kidnapping, extortion, arson, robbery, bribery, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the Controlled Substances Act);
*Any act of bribery, counterfeiting, theft, embezzlement, fraud, dealing in obscene matter, obstruction of justice, slavery, racketeering, gambling, money laundering, commission of murder-for-hire, and many other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code (Title 18);
*Embezzlement of union funds;
*Bankruptcy fraud or securities fraud;
*Drug trafficking; long-term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute;
*Criminal copyright infringement;
*Money laundering and related offenses;
*Bringing in, aiding or assisting aliens in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain);
*Acts of terrorism.

Pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The US Supreme Court has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. The illegal acts forming a pattern are called &quot;predicate&quot; offenses. Predicate acts are related if they &quot;have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.&quot; Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.

==Famous cases==
The Lucchese crime family was one of the &quot;Five Families&quot; that dominated organized crime activities in New York City. Prosecuting attorneys Gregory O&#x27;Connell and Charles Rose used RICO charges to break up the family over an 18-month period.

Several members of the Latin Kings have been convicted of RICO offenses.

===1978, The Cowboy Mafia===

RICO was instrumental in indicting members of The Cowboy Mafia from Texas, Tennessee and Florida. During 1977 and 1978, this group imported over 106 tons of marijuana. Using the shrimp boats &quot;Agnes Pauline&quot;, &quot;Monkey&quot;, &quot;Jubilee&quot;, and &quot;Bayou Blues&quot;, the group made six trips from Colombia to Texas. The group was arrested in 1978 after the federal government seized the &quot;Agnes Pauline&quot; when they were unloading their cargo in Port Arthur, Texas. In 1979, twenty-six members of the smuggling ring were convicted. Charles &quot;Muscles&quot; Foster, a ranch foreman and the head of the operation, pleaded innocent by reason of insanity and was acquitted in 1980. In August 1981, Rex Cauble was indicted by a grand jury, as the government believed he was the financial backer of the smugglers. Foster was the foreman for his ranches, and the drugs were transported to Cauble&#x27;s ranches throughout Texas. Cauble was a multi-millionaire, the former chairman of the Texas Aeronautics Commission, and an honorary Texas Ranger. He was also the owner of Cutter Bill, a famous cutting horse. Cauble was convicted in January 1982 on ten counts: two counts of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act statute (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO, three violations of the Interstate Commerce Travel Act, and four counts of misapplication of bank funds. He was sentenced to ten concurrent terms of five years. He completed his prison term, was released in September 1987, and died in 2003.

Three books about the group were published: &quot;The Cowboy Mafia&quot; (2003) by Cauble&#x27;s personal jet pilot Roy Graham; &quot;Catching the Katy&quot; (2017) by Barker Milford; and &quot;A Conspiracy Revealed&quot; by DEA agent Daniel Wedeman Sr.

As a result of the RICO conviction, Cauble forfeited his 31% interest in Cauble Enterprises, including two Cutter Bill Western World stores, three Texas banks (Western State Bank in Denton, Dallas International Bank and South Main Bank of Houston), six ranches, a welding supply company, and oil and gas holdings. The company&#x27;s worth was estimated at $80 million. However, the government sold their interest back to the other partners (Cauble&#x27;s wife and son) for an estimated $12 million.

===1979, Hells Angels Motorcycle Club===
In 1979, the United States Federal Government went after Sonny Barger and several members and associates of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels using RICO. In &quot;United States vs. Barger&quot;, the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a hung jury on the predicate acts: &quot;There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns.&quot;

===1980, Gil Dozier===
In 1980, Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier was charged with violating both Hobbs and RICO laws. The Baton Rouge-based United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana accused Dozier of compelling companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. On September 23, 1980, a jury convicted Dozier of five counts of extortion and racketeering.

The judge sentenced Dozier to 10 years imprisonment which was later upgraded to 18 years when other offenses were determined. A $25,000 fine was suspended pending appeal, and Dozier remained free on bail. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans upheld Dozier&#x27;s conviction. He eventually served nearly four years until a presidential commutation freed him in 1986.

===1984, Key West Police Department===
Around June 1984, the Key West Police Department located in Monroe County, Florida, was declared a criminal enterprise under the federal RICO statutes after a lengthy United States Department of Justice investigation. Several high-ranking officers of the department, including Deputy Police Chief Raymond Cassamayor, were arrested on federal charges of running a protection racket for illegal cocaine smugglers. At trial, a witness testified he routinely delivered bags of cocaine to the Deputy Chief&#x27;s office at City Hall.

===1984, The Order===
The Order was an American far-right terrorist group active from September 1983 to December 1984. Their intention was to precipitate the collapse of the federal Government or Zionist Occupation Government (ZOG) which they perceived as illegitimate. Their intention was to do so via a campaign of bombings and assassinations. However, in order to fund their actions they turned to armoured car robbery and a counterfeiting and laundering operation. The FBI began to investigate the group using RICO following the assassination of Jewish radio host Alan Berg on June 18, 1984, and the arrest of member Tom Martinez, for using counterfeit bills to buy liquor. Martinez informed on The Order and RICO was used by the FBI to bring 10 members of The Order to trial and achieved conviction of racketeering and conspiracy charges. Over the course of The Order&#x27;s activities they had distributed millions of dollars to the wider far-right movement and Operation Clean Sweep used RICO to bring 14 leading members of the far-right to trial on charges of seditious conspiracy at Fort Smith, alleging their receipt of The Order&#x27;s funds as connection to their attempt to overthrow the federal government.

===1986, Iran-Contra===
In 1986, the Christic Institute filed a civil RICO case naming 30 defendants who were also implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal that they were also part of a conspiracy behind the La Penca bombing. The suit, titled Avirgan v Hull named several Central Intelligence Agency figures and accused them of participating in illegal political assassinations, as well as arms and drug trafficking. The suit was eventually dismissed in 1989, and lead attorney Daniel Sheehan alleged members of the Iran-Contra enterprise were behind the assassination of judge Robert Vance who was expected to reverse the dismissal. G. Robert Blakey stated it was the best-charged RICO case he had seen, and the litigation spawned a national fundraising effort. In 1990, Bruce Springsteen and Bonnie Raitt held a benefit concert to support the litigation. A 500-page affadaivit filed in December 1986 was also published as &quot;The Shadow Government.&quot;

===1989, Michael Milken===
On March 29, 1989, American financier Michael Milken was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud relating to an investigation into an allegation of insider trading and other offenses. Milken was accused of using a wide-ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices. It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime. Milken pleaded guilty to six lesser felonies of securities fraud and tax evasion, rather than risk spending the rest of his life in prison and ended up serving 22 months in prison. Milken was also ordered banned for life from the securities industry.

On September 7, 1988, Milken&#x27;s employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, was threatened with RICO charges under &quot;respondeat superior&quot;, the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees&#x27; crimes. Drexel avoided RICO charges by entering an Alford plea to lesser felonies of stock parking and stock manipulation. In a carefully worded plea, Drexel said it was &quot;not in a position to dispute the allegations&quot; made by the Government. If Drexel had been indicted under RICO statutes, it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen. That would have taken precedence over all of the firm&#x27;s other obligations, including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital base. If the bond ever had to be paid, its shareholders would have been practically wiped out. Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO, an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business. By at least one estimate, a RICO indictment would have destroyed the firm within a month. Years later, Drexel President and CEO Fred Joseph said that Drexel had no choice but to plead guilty because &quot;a financial institution cannot survive a RICO indictment.&quot;

===1992, Gambino crime family===
John Gotti and Frank Locascio were convicted on April 2, 1992, under the RICO Act and later sentenced to life in prison.

===1998, Embassy Bombings and Al Qaeda===
After the 1998 simultaneous bombings of the US Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, the US Department of Justice sued Osama bin Laden &quot;in absentia&quot; under the RICO statute. A 2004 documentary by BBC filmmaker Adam Curtis called The Power of Nightmares argued controversially that in order to prosecute bin Laden in absentia, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organization responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organization called &quot;al-Qaeda,&quot; which satisfied the requirements of the RICO statute, but that in actuality, a formal terrorist organization named &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; did not exist.

===2000, Los Angeles Police Department===
In 1999 the Rampart scandal broke in the Los Angeles Police Department exposing widespread criminal activity within the department&#x27;s anti-gang unit called CRASH. 70 officers were initially implicated in planting evidence, dealing drugs, bank robbery, and unlawful killings and beatings. In 2000, Federal District judge William Rea ruled the RICO statute could be used to name the entire LAPD as a criminal enterprise for individuals suing it over police brutality and misconduct. Over 140 civil RICO lawsuits were filed against the department. In July 2001, US District Judge Gary A. Feess said that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO, because they were alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage.

===2002, Major League Baseball===
In 2001, Major League Baseball team owners voted to eliminate two teams, presumably the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. In 2002, the former minority owners of the Expos filed charges under the RICO Act against MLB commissioner Bud Selig and former Expos owner Jeffrey Loria, claiming that Selig and Loria deliberately conspired to devalue the team for personal benefit in preparation for a move. If found liable, Major League Baseball could have been responsible for up to $300 million in punitive damages. The case lasted two years, successfully stalling the Expos&#x27; move to Washington or contraction during that time. It was eventually sent to arbitration, where the arbiters ruled in favor of Major League Baseball, permitting the move to Washington to take place.

===2004, Bonanno crime family ===
Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Massino&#x27;s trial began on May 24, 2004, with judge Nicholas Garaufis presiding and Greg D. Andres and Robert Henoch heading the prosecution. Massino faced 11 RICO counts for seven murders (due to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the murder of Bonanno caporegime Gerlando Sciascia, that case severed to be tried separately), arson, extortion, loansharking, illegal gambling, and money laundering. After deliberating for five days, the jury found Massino guilty of all 11 counts on July 30, 2004. His sentencing was initially scheduled for October 12, and he was expected to receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. The jury also approved the prosecutors&#x27; recommended $10 million forfeiture of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss on the day of the verdict.

Immediately after his July 30 conviction, as court was adjourned, Massino requested a meeting with Judge Garaufis, where he made his first offer to cooperate. He did so in hopes of sparing his life; he was facing the death penalty if found guilty of Sciascia&#x27;s murder. Indeed, one of John Ashcroft&#x27;s final acts as Attorney General was to order federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Massino. Massino thus stood to be the first Mafia boss to be executed for his crimes, and the first mob boss to face the death penalty since Lepke Buchalter was executed in 1944. Massino was the first sitting boss of a New York crime family to turn state&#x27;s evidence, and the second in the history of the American Mafia to do so (Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale had flipped in 1999 when facing drug charges).

===2005, Chicago Outfit ===
In 2005, the US Department of Justice&#x27;s Operation Family Secrets indicted 14 Chicago Outfit (also known as the Outfit, the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mob, or the Organization) members and associates under RICO predicates. Five defendants were convicted of RICO violations and other crimes. Six pleaded guilty, two died before trial, and one was too sick to be tried.

===2005, Connecticut Senator Len Fasano===
In 2005, a federal jury ordered Fasano to pay $500,000 under RICO for illegally helping a client hide their assets in a bankruptcy case.

=== 2005, Mohawk Industries ===
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in &quot;Williams v. Mohawk Industries, Inc.&quot; that a corporation could be held liable for &quot;unlawfully conducting the affairs of an association-in-fact enterprise the corporation and its agents.&quot; Mohawk Industries had allegedly hired illegal aliens, in violation of RICO. On appeal, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether Mohawk Industries, along with recruiting agencies, constituted an &quot;enterprise&quot; that could be prosecuted under RICO. The Court vacated the Eleventh Circuit decision that had permitted RICO liability.

===2006, Gambino crime family===
In Tampa, on October 16, 2006, four members of the Gambino crime family (Capo Ronald Trucchio, Terry Scaglione, Steven Catallono, and Anthony Mucciarone and associate Kevin McMahon) were tried under RICO statutes, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison.

===2009, Scott W. Rothstein ===
Scott W. Rothstein is a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and chief executive officer of the now-defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm. He was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a massive 1.2 billion dollar Ponzi scheme. On December 1, 2009, Rothstein turned himself in to federal authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to RICO. Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010. Bond was denied by US Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents, he was considered a flight risk. On June 9, 2010, Rothstein received a 50-year prison sentence after a hearing in federal court in Fort Lauderdale.

===2011, Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella===
A federal grand jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania handed down a 48-count indictment against former Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas Judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella. The judges were charged with RICO after allegedly committing acts of mail and wire fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and honest services fraud. The judges were accused of taking kickbacks for housing juveniles, that the judges convicted of mostly petty crimes, at a private detention center. The incident was dubbed by many local and national newspapers as the &quot;kids for cash scandal&quot;. On February 18, 2011, a federal jury found Mark Ciavarella guilty of racketeering because of his involvement in accepting illegal payments from Robert Mericle, the developer of PA Child Care, and Attorney Robert Powell, a co-owner of the facility. Ciavarella is facing 38 other counts in federal court.

===2012, AccessHealthSource===
Eleven defendants were indicted on RICO charges for allegedly assisting AccessHealthSource, a local health care provider, in obtaining and maintaining lucrative contracts with local and state government entities in the city of El Paso, Texas, &quot;through bribery of and kickbacks to elected officials or himself and others, extortion under color of authority, fraudulent schemes and artifices, false pretenses, promises and representations and deprivation of the right of citizens to the honest services of their elected local officials&quot; (see indictment).

===2013, Trump University===
&quot;Art Cohen vs. Donald J. Trump&quot; was a civil RICO class action suit filed October 18, 2013, accusing Donald Trump of misrepresenting Trump University &quot;to make tens of millions of dollars&quot; but delivering &quot;neither Donald Trump nor a university&quot;. The case was being heard in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, No. 3:2013cv02519, by Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. It was scheduled for argument beginning November 28, 2016. However, on November 18 and shortly after Trump won the presidential election, this case and two others were settled for a total of $25 million to be paid to the plaintiffs, but without any admission of wrongdoing by Trump.

===2015, Drummond Company===
In 2015, the Drummond Company sued attorneys Terrence P. Collingsworth and William R. Scherer, the advocacy group International Rights Advocates (IRAdvocates), and Dutch businessman Albert van Bilderbeek, one of the owners of Llanos Oil, accusing them of violating RICO by alleging that Drummond had worked alongside Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia to murder labor union leaders within proximity of their Colombian coal mines, which Drummond denies.

===2015, FIFA===

Fourteen defendants affiliated with FIFA were indicted under the RICO act on 47 counts for &quot;racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies, among other offenses, in connection with the defendants&#x27; participation in a 24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer&quot;. The defendants include many current and former high-ranking officers of FIFA and its affiliate CONCACAF. The defendants had allegedly used the enterprise as a front to collect millions of dollars in bribes, which may have influenced Russia and Qatar&#x27;s winning bids to host the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022, respectively.

===2022, YSL Records===
In May 2022, rapper Young Thug was arrested in a RICO indictment filed against him and his YSL Records label. The indictment, filed by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, consisted of 56 counts against 28 affiliates of the label, with Thug himself facing 8 charges. The indictment alleged that YSL was not only a record label, but a street gang that was partaking in violent activity in Georgia. The case, originally presided over by Judge Ural D. Glanville, has been mired in controversy; including allegations from Thug&#x27;s lawyer Brian Steel that Glanville had participated in a secret &quot;ex-parte&quot; meeting with the prosecution. The allegations of this meeting resulted in Steel being held in contempt of court and taken into custody, as he refused to disclose the source of his information; he was sentenced to 10 weekends in jail, but this was overturned on appeal. Shortly thereafter, Glanville was recused from the case. The case is currently being presided over by Judge Paige Reese Whitaker.

This case is notable as it included the longest jury selection process in Georgia&#x27;s history (10 months), and it has been the longest trial in Georgia&#x27;s history.

===2023, Donald Trump===

In August 2023, the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, Fani Willis, filed charges under the Georgia state RICO act against Donald Trump and parties involved, including Rudy Giuliani. The Georgia law contains a list of 40 state crimes or acts that together can be classified as &quot;racketeering schemes&quot;. It is broader than the federal law in that attempting, soliciting, coercing, and intimidating another person to commit any of the offenses can also be considered organized crime.

==Application of RICO laws==

Although some of the RICO predicate acts are extortion and blackmail, one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict and or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies.

Violations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges. In these instances, charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement. Further, charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant.

Anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged abuses of the legal system by individuals or corporations who use the courts as a weapon to retaliate against whistle blowers or victims or to silence another&#x27;s speech. RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts.

Although the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion, blackmail, and racketeering, large-scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute, also known as the &quot;Kingpin Statute&quot;. The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate conspiracies, whereas the RICO law covers a variety of organized criminal behaviors.

===Civil provisions===
The RICO statute contains a provision that allows for the commencement of a civil action by a private party to recover damages sustained as a result of the commission of a RICO predicate offense.

<doc id="26213" wikidata="Q860923" url="?curid=26213" title="Rhombicuboctahedron">
<text>In geometry, the rhombicuboctahedron is an Archimedean solid with 26 faces, consisting of 8 equilateral triangles and 18 squares. It was named by Johannes Kepler in his 1618 Harmonices Mundi, being short for &quot;truncated cuboctahedral rhombus&quot;, with cuboctahedral rhombus being his name for a rhombic dodecahedron.

The rhombicuboctahedron is an Archimedean solid, and its dual is a Catalan solid, the deltoidal icositetrahedron. The elongated square gyrobicupola is a polyhedron that is similar to a rhombicuboctahedron, but it is not an Archimedean solid because it is not vertex-transitive. The rhombicuboctahedron is found in diverse cultures in architecture, toys, the arts, and elsewhere.

== Construction ==
The rhombicuboctahedron may be constructed from a cube by drawing a smaller one in the middle of each face, parallel to the cube&#x27;s edges. After removing the edges of a cube, the squares may be joined by adding more squares adjacent between them, and the corners may be filled by the equilateral triangles. Another way to construct the rhombicuboctahedron is by attaching two regular square cupolas into the bases of a regular octagonal prism.
A rhombicuboctahedron may also be known as an &quot;expanded octahedron&quot; or &quot;expanded cube&quot;. This is because the rhombicuboctahedron may also be constructed by separating and pushing away the faces of a cube or a regular octahedron from their centroid (in blue or red, respectively, in the animation), and filling between them with the squares and equilateral triangles. This construction process is known as expansion. By using all of these methods above, the rhombicuboctahedron has 8 equilateral triangles and 16 squares as its faces. Relatedly, the rhombicuboctahedron may also be constructed by cutting all edges and vertices of either cube or a regular octahedron, a process known as rectification.

Cartesian coordinates of a rhombicuboctahedron with an edge length 2 are the permutations of formula_1. 

== Properties ==
=== Measurement and metric properties ===
The surface area of a rhombicuboctahedron formula_2 can be determined by adding the area of all faces: 8 equilateral triangles and 18 squares. The volume of a rhombicuboctahedron formula_3 can be determined by slicing it into two square cupolas and one octagonal prism. Given that the edge length formula_4, its surface area and volume is:
formula_5

The optimal packing fraction of rhombicuboctahedra is given by
formula_6
It was noticed that this optimal value is obtained in a Bravais lattice by . Since the rhombicuboctahedron is contained in a rhombic dodecahedron whose inscribed sphere is identical to its inscribed sphere, the value of the optimal packing fraction is a corollary of the Kepler conjecture: it can be achieved by putting a rhombicuboctahedron in each cell of the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, and it cannot be surpassed, since otherwise the optimal packing density of spheres could be surpassed by putting a sphere in each rhombicuboctahedron of the hypothetical packing which surpasses it.

The dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron can be determined by adding the dihedral angle of a square cupola and an octagonal prism:
* the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron between two adjacent squares on both the top and bottom is that of a square cupola 135°. The dihedral angle of an octagonal prism between two adjacent squares is the internal angle of a regular octagon 135°. The dihedral angle between two adjacent squares on the edge where a square cupola is attached to an octagonal prism is the sum of the dihedral angle of a square cupola square-to-octagon and the dihedral angle of an octagonal prism square-to-octagon 45° + 90° = 135°. Therefore, the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron for every two adjacent squares is 135°.
* the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron square-to-triangle is that of a square cupola between those 144.7°. The dihedral angle between square-to-triangle, on the edge where a square cupola is attached to an octagonal prism is the sum of the dihedral angle of a square cupola triangle-to-octagon and the dihedral angle of an octagonal prism square-to-octagon 54.7° + 90° = 144.7°. Therefore, the dihedral angle of a rhombicuboctahedron for every square-to-triangle is 144.7°.

A rhombicuboctahedron has the Rupert property, meaning there is a polyhedron with the same or larger size that can pass through its hole.

=== Symmetry and its classification family ===

The rhombicuboctahedron has the same symmetry as a cube and regular octahedron, the octahedral symmetry formula_7. However, the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set of distortions with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces, which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather pyritohedral symmetry formula_8, so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections. It is centrosymmetric, meaning its symmetric is interchangeable by the appearance of inversion center. It is also non-chiral; that is, it is congruent to its own mirror image.

The rhombicuboctahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are one equilateral triangle and three squares, and the vertex figure is denoted as formula_9. Its dual is deltoidal icositetrahedron, a Catalan solid, shares the same symmetry as the rhombicuboctahedron.

The elongated square gyrobicupola is the only polyhedron resembling the rhombicuboctahedron. The difference is that the elongated square gyrobicupola is constructed by twisting one of its cupolae. It was once considered as the 14th Archimedean solid, until it was discovered that it is not vertex-transitive, categorizing it as the Johnson solid instead.

== Graph ==

The skeleton of a rhombicuboctahedron can be described as a polyhedral graph, meaning a graph that is planar and 3-vertex-connected. In other words, the edges of a graph are not crossed while being drawn, and removing any two of its vertices leaves a connected subgraph.

The rhombicuboctahedral graph has 24 vertices and 48 edges. It is quartic, meaning each of its vertices is connected to four others. This graph is classified as Archimedean graph, because it resembles the graph of Archimedean solid.

== Appearances ==

The rhombicuboctahedron sometimes appears in architecture, with an example being the building of the National Library located at Minsk. The Wilson House by Bruce Goff is another example of a rhombicuboctahedral building, although its module was depicted as a truncated cube in which the edges are all cut off. It was built during the Second World War and Operation Breakthrough in the 1960s.

The rhombicuboctahedron may also be found in toys. For example, if the lines along which a Rubik&#x27;s Cube can be turned are projected onto a sphere, they are topologically identical to a rhombicuboctahedron&#x27;s edges. Variants using the Rubik&#x27;s Cube mechanism have been produced, which closely resemble the rhombicuboctahedron. During the Rubik&#x27;s Cube craze of the 1980s, at least two twisty puzzles sold had the form of a rhombicuboctahedron (the mechanism was similar to that of a Rubik&#x27;s Cube) Another example may be found in dice from Corfe Castle, each of whose square faces have marks of pairs of letters and pips.

The rhombicuboctahedron may also appear in art. An example is the 1495 &quot;Portrait of Luca Pacioli&quot;, traditionally attributed to Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari, which includes a glass rhombicuboctahedron half-filled with water, which may have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
The first printed version of the rhombicuboctahedron was by Leonardo da Vinci and appeared in Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot; (1509).

<text>A reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme used to convert RNA genome to DNA, a process termed reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptases are used by viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B to replicate their genomes, by retrotransposon mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, and by eukaryotic cells to extend the telomeres at the ends of their linear chromosomes. Contrary to a widely held belief, the process does not violate the flows of genetic information as described by the classical central dogma, as transfers of information from RNA to DNA are explicitly held possible.

Retroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, ribonuclease H (RNase H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell transcription. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in molecular cloning, RNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or genome analysis.

== History ==
Reverse transcriptases were discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in &quot;Rous sarcoma&quot; virions and independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses: murine leukemia virus and again Rous sarcoma virus. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).

Well-studied reverse transcriptases include:
* HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 () has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDas.
* M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is a single 75 kDa monomer.
* AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.
* Telomerase reverse transcriptase that maintains the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes.

== Function in viruses ==

The enzymes are encoded and used by viruses that use reverse transcription as a step in the process of replication. Reverse-transcribing RNA viruses, such as retroviruses, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing DNA viruses, such as the hepadnaviruses, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.

===Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription===
Reverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.

In virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by a similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.

The process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause drug resistance.

==== Retroviral reverse transcription ====

Retroviruses, also referred to as class VI ssRNA-RT viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a 5&#x27; cap and 3&#x27; polyadenylated tail. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the cytosol as a series of these steps:
# Lysyl tRNA acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.
# Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3&#x27; end of the primer, synthesizing DNA complementary to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.
# A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called RNAse H degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5&#x27; end of the RNA.
# The tRNA primer then &quot;jumps&quot; to the 3&#x27; end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.
# The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.
# The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.
# Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.
# The tRNA primer leaves and a &quot;jump&quot; happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.
# Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host&#x27;s genome by the enzyme integrase.

Creation of double-stranded DNA also involves &quot;strand transfer&quot;, in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.

Retroviral RNA is arranged in 5&#x27; terminus to 3&#x27; terminus. The site where the primer is annealed to viral RNA is called the primer-binding site (PBS). The RNA 5&#x27;end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3&#x27; end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 nucleotides and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5&#x27; terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3&#x27; end of the primer in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3&#x27; end of viral RNA. In order to accomplish this reposition, multiple steps and various enzymes including DNA polymerase, ribonuclease H(RNase H) and polynucleotide unwinding are needed.

The HIV reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that copies the sense cDNA strand into an &quot;antisense&quot; DNA to form a double-stranded viral DNA intermediate (vDNA). The HIV viral RNA structural elements regulate the progression of reverse transcription.

== In cellular life ==

Self-replicating stretches of eukaryotic genomes known as retrotransposons utilize reverse transcriptase to move from one position in the genome to another via an RNA intermediate. They are found abundantly in the genomes of plants and animals. Telomerase is another reverse transcriptase found in many eukaryotes, including humans, which carries its own RNA template; this RNA is used as a template for DNA replication.

Initial reports of reverse transcriptase in prokaryotes came as far back as 1971 in France (Beljanski et al., 1971a, 1972) and a few years later in the USSR (Romashchenko 1977). These have since been broadly described as part of bacterial Retrons, distinct sequences that code for reverse transcriptase, and are used in the synthesis of msDNA. In order to initiate synthesis of DNA, a primer is needed. In bacteria, the primer is synthesized during replication.

Valerian Dolja of Oregon State argues that viruses, due to their diversity, have played an evolutionary role in the development of cellular life, with reverse transcriptase playing a central role.

== Structure ==

The reverse transcriptase employs a &quot;right hand&quot; structure similar to that found in other viral nucleic acid polymerases. In addition to the transcription function, retroviral reverse transcriptases have a domain belonging to the RNase H family, which is vital to their replication. By degrading the RNA template, it allows the other strand of DNA to be synthesized. Some fragments from the digestion also serve as the primer for the DNA polymerase (either the same enzyme or a host protein), responsible for making the other (plus) strand.

== Replication fidelity ==

There are three different replication systems during the life cycle of a retrovirus. The first process is the reverse transcriptase synthesis of viral DNA from viral RNA, which then forms newly made complementary DNA strands. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.

Reverse transcriptase has a high error rate when transcribing RNA into DNA since, unlike most other DNA polymerases, it has no proofreading ability. This high error rate allows mutations to accumulate at an accelerated rate relative to proofread forms of replication. The commercially available reverse transcriptases produced by Promega are quoted by their manuals as having error rates in the range of 1 in 17,000 bases for AMV and 1 in 30,000 bases for M-MLV.

Other than creating single-nucleotide polymorphisms, reverse transcriptases have also been shown to be involved in processes such as transcript fusions, exon shuffling and creating artificial antisense transcripts. It has been speculated that this &quot;template switching&quot; activity of reverse transcriptase, which can be demonstrated completely &quot;in vivo&quot;, may have been one of the causes for finding several thousand unannotated transcripts in the genomes of model organisms.

===Template switching===

Two RNA genomes are packaged into each retrovirus particle, but, after an infection, each virus generates only one provirus. After infection, reverse transcription is accompanied by template switching between the two genome copies (copy choice recombination). There are two models that suggest why RNA transcriptase switches templates. The first, the forced copy-choice model, proposes that reverse transcriptase changes the RNA template when it encounters a nick, implying that recombination is obligatory to maintaining virus genome integrity. The second, the dynamic choice model, suggests that reverse transcriptase changes templates when the RNAse function and the polymerase function are not in sync rate-wise, implying that recombination occurs at random and is not in response to genomic damage. A study by Rawson et al. supported both models of recombination. From 5 to 14 recombination events per genome occur at each replication cycle. Template switching (recombination) appears to be necessary for maintaining genome integrity and as a repair mechanism for salvaging damaged genomes.

==Applications==
=== Antiviral drugs ===

As HIV uses reverse transcriptase to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs have been designed to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).

=== Molecular biology ===

Reverse transcriptase is commonly used in research to apply the polymerase chain reaction technique to RNA in a technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The classical PCR technique can be applied only to DNA strands, but, with the help of reverse transcriptase, RNA can be transcribed into DNA, thus making PCR analysis of RNA molecules possible. Reverse transcriptase is used also to create cDNA libraries from mRNA. The commercial availability of reverse transcriptase greatly improved knowledge in the area of molecular biology, as, along with other enzymes, it allowed scientists to clone, sequence, and characterise RNA.

<doc id="26215" wikidata="Q927051" url="?curid=26215" title="Riemann mapping theorem">
<text>In complex analysis, the Riemann mapping theorem states that if formula_1 is a non-empty simply connected open subset of the complex number plane formula_2 which is not all of formula_2, then there exists a biholomorphic mapping formula_4 (i.e. a bijective holomorphic mapping whose inverse is also holomorphic) from formula_1 onto the open unit disk 
:formula_6

This mapping is known as a Riemann mapping.

Intuitively, the condition that formula_1 be simply connected means that formula_1 does not contain any “holes”. The fact that formula_4 is biholomorphic implies that it is a conformal map and therefore angle-preserving. Such a map may be interpreted as preserving the shape of any sufficiently small figure, while possibly rotating and scaling (but not reflecting) it.

Henri Poincaré proved that the map formula_4 is unique up to rotation and recentering: if formula_11 is an element of formula_1 and formula_13 is an arbitrary angle, then there exists precisely one &quot;f&quot; as above such that formula_14 and such that the argument of the derivative of formula_4 at the point formula_11 is equal to formula_13. This is an easy consequence of the Schwarz lemma.

As a corollary of the theorem, any two simply connected open subsets of the Riemann sphere which both lack at least two points of the sphere can be conformally mapped into each other.

==History==
The theorem was stated (under the assumption that the boundary of formula_1 is piecewise smooth) by Bernhard Riemann in 1851 in his PhD thesis. Lars Ahlfors wrote once, concerning the original formulation of the theorem, that it was “ultimately formulated in terms which would defy any attempt of proof, even with modern methods”. Riemann&#x27;s flawed proof depended on the Dirichlet principle (which was named by Riemann himself), which was considered sound at the time. However, Karl Weierstrass found that this principle was not universally valid. Later, David Hilbert was able to prove that, to a large extent, the Dirichlet principle is valid under the hypothesis that Riemann was working with. However, in order to be valid, the Dirichlet principle needs certain hypotheses concerning the boundary of formula_1 (namely, that it is a Jordan curve) which are not valid for simply connected domains in general.

The first rigorous proof of the theorem was given by William Fogg Osgood in 1900. He proved the existence of Green&#x27;s function on arbitrary simply connected domains other than formula_2 itself; this established the Riemann mapping theorem.

Constantin Carathéodory gave another proof of the theorem in 1912, which was the first to rely purely on the methods of function theory rather than potential theory. His proof used Montel&#x27;s concept of normal families, which became the standard method of proof in textbooks. Carathéodory continued in 1913 by resolving the additional question of whether the Riemann mapping between the domains can be extended to a homeomorphism of the boundaries (see Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem).

Carathéodory&#x27;s proof used Riemann surfaces and it was simplified by Paul Koebe two years later in a way that did not require them. Another proof, due to Lipót Fejér and to Frigyes Riesz, was published in 1922 and it was rather shorter than the previous ones. In this proof, like in Riemann&#x27;s proof, the desired mapping was obtained as the solution of an extremal problem. The Fejér–Riesz proof was further simplified by Alexander Ostrowski and by Carathéodory.

==Importance==
The following points detail the uniqueness and power of the Riemann mapping theorem:

* Even relatively simple Riemann mappings (for example a map from the interior of a circle to the interior of a square) have no explicit formula using only elementary functions.
* Simply connected open sets in the plane can be highly complicated, for instance, the boundary can be a nowhere-differentiable fractal curve of infinite length, even if the set itself is bounded. One such example is the Koch curve. The fact that such a set can be mapped in an &quot;angle-preserving&quot; manner to the nice and regular unit disc seems counter-intuitive.
* The analog of the Riemann mapping theorem for more complicated domains is not true. The next simplest case is of doubly connected domains (domains with a single hole). Any doubly connected domain except for the punctured disk and the punctured plane is conformally equivalent to some annulus formula_21 with formula_22, however there are no conformal maps between annuli except inversion and multiplication by constants so the annulus formula_23 is not conformally equivalent to the annulus formula_24 (as can be proven using extremal length).
* The analogue of the Riemann mapping theorem in three or more real dimensions is not true. The family of conformal maps in three dimensions is very poor, and essentially contains only Möbius transformations (see Liouville&#x27;s theorem).
* Even if arbitrary homeomorphisms in higher dimensions are permitted, contractible manifolds can be found that are not homeomorphic to the ball (e.g., the Whitehead continuum).
* The analogue of the Riemann mapping theorem in several complex variables is also not true. In formula_25 (formula_26), the ball and polydisk are both simply connected, but there is no biholomorphic map between them.

== Proof via normal families ==
=== Simple connectivity ===

Theorem. For an open domain formula_27 the following conditions are equivalent:

# formula_28 is simply connected;
# the integral of every holomorphic function formula_4 around a closed piecewise smooth curve in formula_28 vanishes;
# every holomorphic function in formula_28 is the derivative of a holomorphic function; 
# every nowhere-vanishing holomorphic function formula_4 on formula_28 has a holomorphic logarithm;
# every nowhere-vanishing holomorphic function formula_34 on formula_28 has a holomorphic square root;
# for any formula_36, the winding number of formula_37 for any piecewise smooth closed curve in formula_28 is formula_39;
# the complement of formula_28 in the extended complex plane formula_41 is connected.

(1) ⇒ (2) because any continuous closed curve, with base point formula_42, can be continuously deformed to the constant curve formula_43. So the line integral of formula_44 over the curve is formula_39.

(2) ⇒ (3) because the integral over any piecewise smooth path formula_46 from formula_43 to formula_48 can be used to define a primitive.

(3) ⇒ (4) by integrating formula_49 along formula_46 from formula_43 to formula_52 to give a branch of the logarithm.

(4) ⇒ (5) by taking the square root as formula_53 where formula_4 is a holomorphic choice of logarithm.

(5) ⇒ (6) because if formula_46 is a piecewise closed curve and formula_56 are successive square roots of formula_57 for formula_37 outside formula_28, then the winding number of formula_60 about formula_37 is formula_62 times the winding number of formula_46 about formula_39. Hence the winding number of formula_46 about formula_37 must be divisible by formula_62 for all formula_68, so it must equal formula_39.

(6) ⇒ (7) for otherwise the extended plane formula_70 can be written as the disjoint union of two open and closed sets formula_71 and formula_72 with formula_73 and formula_71 bounded. Let formula_75 be the shortest Euclidean distance between formula_71 and formula_72 and build a square grid on formula_2 with length formula_79 with a point formula_43 of formula_71 at the centre of a square. Let formula_82 be the compact set of the union of all squares with distance formula_83 from formula_71. Then formula_85 and formula_86 does not meet formula_71 or formula_72: it consists of finitely many horizontal and vertical segments in formula_28 forming a finite number of closed rectangular paths formula_90. Taking formula_91 to be all the squares covering formula_71, then formula_93 equals the sum of the winding numbers of formula_91 
over formula_43, thus giving formula_96. On the other hand the sum of the winding numbers of formula_97 about formula_43 equals formula_96. Hence the winding number of at least one of the formula_97 about formula_43 is non-zero.

(7) ⇒ (1) This is a purely topological argument. Let formula_46 be a piecewise smooth closed curve based at formula_103. By approximation γ is in the same homotopy class as a rectangular path on the square grid of length formula_75 based at formula_11; such a rectangular path is determined by a succession of formula_106 consecutive directed vertical and horizontal sides. By induction on formula_106, such a path can be deformed to a constant path at a corner of the grid. If the path intersects at a point formula_108, then it breaks up into two rectangular paths of length formula_109, and thus can be deformed to the constant path at formula_108 by the induction hypothesis and elementary properties of the fundamental group. The reasoning follows a &quot;northeast argument&quot;: in the non self-intersecting path there will be a corner formula_11 with largest real part (easterly) and then amongst those one with largest imaginary part (northerly). Reversing direction if need be, the path go from formula_112 to formula_11 and then to formula_114 for formula_115 and then goes leftwards to formula_116. Let formula_117 be the open rectangle with these vertices. The winding number of the path is formula_39 for points to the right of the vertical segment from formula_11 to formula_120 and formula_121 for points to the right; and hence inside formula_117. Since the winding number is formula_39 off formula_28, formula_117 lies in formula_28. If formula_48 is a point of the path, it must lie in formula_28; if formula_48 is on formula_130 but not on the path, by continuity the winding number of the path about formula_48 is formula_121, so formula_48 must also lie in formula_28. Hence formula_135. But in this case the path can be deformed by replacing the three sides of the rectangle by the fourth, resulting in two less sides (with self-intersections permitted).

=== Riemann mapping theorem ===

*Weierstrass&#x27; convergence theorem. The uniform limit on compacta of a sequence of holomorphic functions is holomorphic; similarly for derivatives.
::This is an immediate consequence of Morera&#x27;s theorem for the first statement. Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula gives a formula for the derivatives which can be used to check that the derivatives also converge uniformly on compacta.

*Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem. If a sequence of nowhere-vanishing holomorphic functions on an open domain has a uniform limit on compacta, then either the limit is identically zero or the limit is nowhere-vanishing. If a sequence of univalent holomorphic functions on an open domain has a uniform limit on compacta, then either the limit is constant or the limit is univalent.
::If the limit function is non-zero, then its zeros have to be isolated. Zeros with multiplicities can be counted by the winding number formula_136 for a holomorphic function formula_34. Hence winding numbers are continuous under uniform limits, so that if each function in the sequence has no zeros nor can the limit. For the second statement suppose that formula_138 and set formula_139. These are nowhere-vanishing on a disk but formula_140 vanishes at formula_141, so formula_34 must vanish identically.

Definitions. A family formula_143 of holomorphic functions on an open domain is said to be &quot;normal&quot; if any sequence of functions in formula_143 has a subsequence that converges to a holomorphic function uniformly on compacta. 
A family formula_143 is &quot;compact&quot; if whenever a sequence formula_56 lies in formula_143 and converges uniformly to formula_4 on compacta, then formula_4 also lies in formula_143. A family formula_143 is said to be &quot;locally bounded&quot; if their functions are uniformly bounded on each compact disk. Differentiating the Cauchy integral formula, it follows that the derivatives of a locally bounded family are also locally bounded.

*Montel&#x27;s theorem. Every locally bounded family of holomorphic functions in a domain formula_28 is normal. 
::Let formula_56 be a totally bounded sequence and chose a countable dense subset formula_154 of formula_28. By locally boundedness and a &quot;diagonal argument&quot;, a subsequence can be chosen so that formula_156 is convergent at each point formula_154. It must be verified that this sequence of holomorphic functions converges on formula_28 uniformly on each compactum formula_159. Take formula_160 open with formula_161 such that the closure of formula_160 is compact and contains formula_28. Since the sequence formula_164 is locally bounded, formula_165 on formula_160. By compactness, if formula_75 is taken small enough, finitely many open disks formula_168 of radius formula_75 are required to cover formula_159 while remaining in formula_160. Since 
:::formula_172,
::we have that formula_173. Now for each formula_174 choose some formula_175 in formula_168 where formula_177 converges, take formula_68 and formula_179 so large to be within formula_180 of its limit. Then for formula_181,
:::formula_182
::Hence the sequence formula_183 forms a Cauchy sequence in the uniform norm on formula_159 as required.

*Riemann mapping theorem. If formula_185 is a simply connected domain and formula_42, there is a unique conformal mapping formula_4 of formula_28 onto the unit disk formula_189 normalized such that formula_190 and formula_191.
::Uniqueness follows because if formula_4 and formula_34 satisfied the same conditions, formula_194 would be a univalent holomorphic map of the unit disk with formula_195 and formula_196. But by the Schwarz lemma, the univalent holomorphic maps of the unit disk onto itself are given by the Möbius transformations
:::formula_197
::with formula_198. So formula_199 must be the identity map and formula_200.
::To prove existence, take formula_143 to be the family of holomorphic univalent mappings formula_4 of formula_28 into the open unit disk formula_189 with formula_190 and formula_191. It is a normal family by Montel&#x27;s theorem. By the characterization of simple-connectivity, for formula_207 there is a holomorphic branch of the square root formula_208 in formula_28. It is univalent and formula_210 for formula_211. Since formula_212 must contain a closed disk formula_213 with centre formula_214 and radius formula_215, no points of formula_216 can lie in formula_212. Let formula_218 be the unique Möbius transformation taking formula_219 onto formula_189 with the normalization formula_221 and formula_222. By construction formula_223 is in formula_143, so that formula_143 is &quot;non-empty&quot;. The method of Koebe is to use an &quot;extremal function&quot; to produce a conformal mapping solving the problem: in this situation it is often called the &quot;Ahlfors function&quot; of , after Ahlfors. Let formula_226 be the supremum of formula_227 for formula_228. Pick formula_229 with formula_230 tending to formula_231. By Montel&#x27;s theorem, passing to a subsequence if necessary, formula_56 tends to a holomorphic function formula_4 uniformly on compacta. By Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem, formula_4 is either univalent or constant. But formula_4 has formula_190 and formula_191. So formula_231 is finite, equal to formula_191 and formula_240. It remains to check that the conformal mapping formula_4 takes formula_28 &quot;onto&quot; formula_189. If not, take formula_244 in formula_245 and let formula_246 be a holomorphic square root of formula_247 on formula_28. The function formula_246 is univalent and maps formula_28 into formula_189. Let
:::formula_252
::where formula_253. Then formula_254 and a routine computation shows that
:::formula_255
::This contradicts the maximality of formula_231, so that formula_4 must take all values in formula_189.

Remark. As a consequence of the Riemann mapping theorem, every simply connected domain in the plane is homeomorphic to the unit disk. If points are omitted, this follows from the theorem. For the whole plane, the homeomorphism formula_259 gives a homeomorphism of formula_2 onto formula_189.

=== Parallel slit mappings ===
Koebe&#x27;s uniformization theorem for normal families also generalizes to yield uniformizers formula_4 for multiply-connected domains to finite parallel slit domains, where the slits have angle formula_263 to the -axis. Thus if formula_28 is a domain in formula_41 containing formula_266 and bounded by finitely many Jordan contours, there is a unique univalent function formula_4 on formula_28 with
:formula_269
near formula_266, maximizing formula_271 and having image formula_272 a parallel slit domain with angle formula_263 to the -axis.

The first proof that parallel slit domains were canonical domains for in the multiply connected case was given by David Hilbert in 1909. , on his book on univalent functions and conformal mappings, gave a treatment based on the work of Herbert Grötzsch and René de Possel from the early 1930s; it was the precursor of quasiconformal mappings and quadratic differentials, later developed as the technique of extremal metric due to Oswald Teichmüller. Menahem Schiffer gave a treatment based on very general variational principles, summarised in addresses he gave to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950 and 1958. In a theorem on &quot;boundary variation&quot; (to distinguish it from &quot;interior variation&quot;), he derived a differential equation and inequality, that relied on a measure-theoretic characterisation of straight-line segments due to Ughtred Shuttleworth Haslam-Jones from 1936. Haslam-Jones&#x27; proof was regarded as difficult and was only given a satisfactory proof in the mid-1970s by Schober and Campbell–Lamoureux.

 gave a proof of uniformization for parallel slit domains which was similar to the Riemann mapping theorem. To simplify notation, horizontal slits will be taken. Firstly, by Bieberbach&#x27;s inequality, any univalent function
:formula_274
with formula_48 in the open unit disk must satisfy formula_276. As a consequence, if
:formula_277
is univalent in formula_278, then formula_279. To see this, take formula_280 and set
:formula_281
for formula_48 in the unit disk, choosing formula_141 so the denominator is nowhere-vanishing, and apply the Schwarz lemma. Next the function formula_284 is characterized by an &quot;extremal condition&quot; as the unique univalent function in formula_285 of the form formula_286 that maximises formula_287: this is an immediate consequence of Grönwall&#x27;s area theorem, applied to the family of univalent functions formula_288 in formula_289.

To prove now that the multiply connected domain formula_290 can be uniformized by a horizontal parallel slit conformal mapping
:formula_291,
take formula_117 large enough that formula_293 lies in the open disk formula_294. For formula_280, univalency and the estimate formula_296 imply that, if formula_48 lies in formula_28 with formula_299, then formula_300. Since the family of univalent formula_4 are locally bounded in formula_302, by Montel&#x27;s theorem they form a normal family. Furthermore if formula_56 is in the family and tends to formula_4 uniformly on compacta, then formula_4 is also in the family and each coefficient of the Laurent expansion at formula_266 of the formula_56 tends to the corresponding coefficient of formula_4. This applies in particular to the coefficient: so by compactness there is a univalent formula_4 which maximizes formula_287. To check that
:formula_311
is the required parallel slit transformation, suppose &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; that formula_312 has a compact and connected component formula_159 of its boundary which is not a horizontal slit. Then the complement formula_314 of formula_159 in formula_41 is simply connected with formula_317. By the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping
:formula_318
such that formula_319 is formula_2 with a horizontal slit removed. So we have that
:formula_321
and thus formula_322 by the extremality of formula_4. Therefore, formula_324. On the other hand by the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping
:formula_325
mapping from formula_326 onto formula_314. Then
:formula_328
By the strict maximality for the slit mapping in the previous paragraph, we can see that formula_329, so that formula_330. The two inequalities for formula_331 are contradictory.

The proof of the uniqueness of the conformal parallel slit transformation is given in and . Applying the inverse of the Joukowsky transform formula_199 to the horizontal slit domain, it can be assumed that formula_28 is a domain bounded by the unit circle formula_334 and contains analytic arcs formula_91 and isolated points (the images of other the inverse of the Joukowsky transform under the other parallel horizontal slits). Thus, taking a fixed formula_42, there is a univalent mapping
:formula_337
with its image a horizontal slit domain. Suppose that formula_338 is another uniformizer with
:formula_339
The images under formula_340 or formula_341 of each formula_91 have a fixed -coordinate so are horizontal segments. On the other hand, formula_343 is holomorphic in formula_28. If it is constant, then it must be identically zero since formula_345. Suppose formula_346 is non-constant, then by assumption formula_347 are all horizontal lines. If formula_348 is not in one of these lines, Cauchy&#x27;s argument principle shows that the number of solutions of formula_349 in formula_28 is zero (any formula_348 will eventually be encircled by contours in formula_28 close to the formula_91&#x27;s). This contradicts the fact that the non-constant holomorphic function formula_346 is an open mapping.

== Sketch proof via Dirichlet problem ==
Given formula_1 and a point formula_356, we want to construct a function formula_4 which maps formula_1 to the unit disk and formula_11 to formula_39. For this sketch, we will assume that &quot;U&quot; is bounded and its boundary is smooth, much like Riemann did. Write
:formula_361
where formula_362 is some (to be determined) holomorphic function with real part formula_363 and imaginary part formula_364. It is then clear that formula_11 is the only zero of formula_4. We require formula_367 for formula_368, so we need 
:formula_369
on the boundary. Since formula_363 is the real part of a holomorphic function, we know that formula_363 is necessarily a harmonic function; i.e., it satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation.

The question then becomes: does a real-valued harmonic function formula_363 exist that is defined on all of formula_1 and has the given boundary condition? The positive answer is provided by the Dirichlet principle. Once the existence of formula_363 has been established, the Cauchy–Riemann equations for the holomorphic function formula_34 allow us to find formula_364 (this argument depends on the assumption that formula_1 be simply connected). Once formula_363 and formula_364 have been constructed, one has to check that the resulting function formula_4 does indeed have all the required properties.

==Uniformization theorem==
The Riemann mapping theorem can be generalized to the context of Riemann surfaces: If formula_1 is a non-empty simply-connected open subset of a Riemann surface, then formula_1 is biholomorphic to one of the following: the Riemann sphere, the complex plane formula_2, or the unit disk formula_189. This is known as the uniformization theorem.

==Smooth Riemann mapping theorem==
In the case of a simply connected bounded domain with smooth boundary, the Riemann mapping function and all its derivatives extend by continuity to the closure of the domain. This can be proved using regularity properties of solutions of the Dirichlet boundary value problem, which follow either from the theory of Sobolev spaces for planar domains or from classical potential theory. Other methods for proving the smooth Riemann mapping theorem include the theory of kernel functions or the Beltrami equation.

== Algorithms ==
Computational conformal mapping is prominently featured in problems of applied analysis and mathematical physics, as well as in engineering disciplines, such as image processing.

In the early 1980s an elementary algorithm for computing conformal maps was discovered. Given points formula_385 in the plane, the algorithm computes an explicit conformal map of the unit disk onto a region bounded by a Jordan curve formula_46 with formula_387 This algorithm converges for Jordan regions in the sense of uniformly close boundaries. There are corresponding uniform estimates on the closed region and the closed disc for the mapping functions and their inverses. Improved estimates are obtained if the data points lie on a formula_388 curve or a -quasicircle. The algorithm was discovered as an approximate method for conformal welding; however, it can also be viewed as a discretization of the Loewner differential equation.

The following is known about numerically approximating the conformal mapping between two planar domains.

Positive results:

* There is an algorithm A that computes the uniformizing map in the following sense. Let formula_389 be a bounded simply-connected domain, and formula_390. formula_391 is provided to A by an oracle representing it in a pixelated sense (i.e., if the screen is divided to formula_392 pixels, the oracle can say whether each pixel belongs to the boundary or not). Then A computes the absolute values of the uniformizing map formula_393 with precision formula_394 in space bounded by formula_395 and time formula_396, where formula_82 depends only on the diameter of formula_389 and formula_399 Furthermore, the algorithm computes the value of formula_400 with precision formula_394 as long as formula_402 Moreover, A queries formula_391 with precision of at most formula_404 In particular, if formula_391 is polynomial space computable in space formula_406 for some constant formula_407 and time formula_408 then A can be used to compute the uniformizing map in space formula_409 and time formula_410

* There is an algorithm A′ that computes the uniformizing map in the following sense. Let formula_389 be a bounded simply-connected domain, and formula_412 Suppose that for some formula_413 formula_391 is given to A′ with precision formula_415 by formula_416 pixels. Then A′ computes the absolute values of the uniformizing map formula_393 within an error of formula_418 in randomized space bounded by formula_419 and time polynomial in formula_420 (that is, by a BPL()-machine). Furthermore, the algorithm computes the value of formula_400 with precision formula_415 as long as formula_423

Negative results:

* Suppose there is an algorithm A that given a simply-connected domain formula_389 with a linear-time computable boundary and an inner radius formula_425 and a number formula_68 computes the first formula_427 digits of the conformal radius formula_428 then we can use one call to A to solve any instance of a #SAT() with a linear time overhead. In other words, #P is poly-time reducible to computing the conformal radius of a set.

* Consider the problem of computing the conformal radius of a simply-connected domain formula_429 where the boundary of formula_389 is given with precision formula_431 by an explicit collection of formula_416 pixels. Denote the problem of computing the conformal radius with precision formula_433 by formula_434 Then, formula_435 is AC0 reducible to formula_436 for any formula_437

<text>Rhodesia ( , ; ), officially the Republic of Rhodesia from 1970, was an unrecognised state in Southern Africa that existed from 1965 to 1979. Rhodesia served as the &quot;de facto&quot; successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia following a unilateral declaration of independence issued by the ruling white-minority government. Throughout this fourteen-year period, Rhodesia faced internal conflict and political unrest. Following the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979, the territory returned to British political control and then subsequently gained internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980. 

Southern Rhodesia had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923. A landlocked nation, Rhodesia was bordered by Botswana (Bechuanaland: British protectorate until 1966) to the southwest, Mozambique (Portuguese province until 1975) to the east, South Africa to the south, and Zambia to the northwest. From 1965 to 1979, Rhodesia was one of two independent states on the African continent governed by a white minority of European descent and culture, the other being South Africa.

In the late 19th century, the territory north of the Transvaal was chartered to the British South Africa Company, led by Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes and his Pioneer Column marched north in 1890, acquiring a huge block of territory that the company ruled until the early 1920s. In 1923, the company&#x27;s charter was revoked, and Southern Rhodesia attained self-government and established a legislature. Between 1953 and 1963, Southern Rhodesia was joined with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

The rapid decolonisation of Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s alarmed a significant proportion of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s white population. In an effort to delay the transition to black majority rule, the predominantly white Southern Rhodesian government issued its own Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The new nation, identified simply as Rhodesia, initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970. 

Following the declaration of independence in 1965, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that called upon all states not to grant recognition to Rhodesia. Two African nationalist parties, the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) and Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), launched an armed insurgency against the government upon UDI, sparking the Rhodesian Bush War. Growing war weariness, diplomatic pressure, and an extensive trade embargo imposed by the United Nations prompted Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith to concede to majority rule in 1978. However, elections and a multiracial provisional government, with Smith succeeded by moderate Abel Muzorewa, failed to appease international critics or halt the war. By December 1979 Muzorewa had secured an agreement with ZAPU and ZANU, allowing Rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending new elections under British supervision. ZANU secured an electoral victory in 1980, and the country achieved internationally recognised independence in April 1980 as Zimbabwe.

Rhodesia&#x27;s largest cities were Salisbury (its capital city, now known as Harare) and Bulawayo. Prior to 1970, the unicameral Legislative Assembly was predominantly white, with a small number of seats reserved for black representatives. Following the declaration of a republic in 1970, this was replaced by a bicameral Parliament, with a House of Assembly and a Senate. The bicameral system was retained in Zimbabwe after 1980. Aside from its racial franchise, Rhodesia observed a Westminster system inherited from the United Kingdom, with a President acting as ceremonial head of state, while a Prime Minister headed the Cabinet as head of government.

== Etymology ==
The official name of the country, according to the constitution adopted concurrently with the UDI in November 1965, was Rhodesia. This was not the case under British law, however, which considered the territory&#x27;s legal name to be Southern Rhodesia, the name given to the country in 1898 during the British South Africa Company&#x27;s administration of the Rhodesias, and retained by the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia after the end of company rule in 1923.

This naming dispute dated back to October 1964, when Northern Rhodesia became independent from the UK and concurrently changed its name to Zambia. The Southern Rhodesian colonial government in Salisbury felt that in the absence of a &quot;Northern&quot; Rhodesia, the continued use of &quot;Southern&quot; was superfluous. It passed legislation to become simply Rhodesia, but the British government refused to approve this on the grounds that the country&#x27;s name was defined by British legislation, so could not be altered by the colonial government. Salisbury went on using the shortened name in an official manner nevertheless, while the British government continued referring to the country as Southern Rhodesia. This situation continued throughout the UDI period. The shortened name was used by many people including the British government in the House of Commons.

==History==

===Background===

Until after the Second World War, the landlocked British possession of Southern Rhodesia was not developed as an indigenous African territory, but rather as a unique state that reflected its multiracial character. This situation certainly made it very different from other lands that existed under colonial rule, as many Europeans had arrived to make permanent homes, populating the towns as traders or settling to farm the most productive soils. In 1922, faced with the decision to join the Union of South Africa as a fifth province or accept nearly full internal autonomy, the electorate cast its vote against South African integration.

In view of the outcome of the referendum, the territory was annexed by the United Kingdom on 12 September 1923. Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force. Under this constitution, Southern Rhodesia was given the right to elect its own thirty-member legislature, premier, and cabinet—although the British Crown retained a formal veto over measures affecting natives and dominated foreign policy.

Over the course of the next three decades, Southern Rhodesia experienced a degree of economic expansion and industrialisation almost unrivaled in sub-Saharan Africa. Its natural abundance of mineral wealth—including large deposits of chromium and manganese—contributed to the high rate of conventional economic growth. However, most colonies in Africa, even those rich in natural resources, experienced difficulty in achieving similar rates of development due to a shortage of technical and managerial skills. Small, rotating cadres of colonial civil servants who possessed little incentive to invest their skills in the local economy were insufficient to compensate for this disadvantage. Southern Rhodesia had negated the issue by importing a skilled workforce directly from abroad in the form of its disproportionately large European immigrant and expatriate population. For example, in 1951 over 90% of white Southern Rhodesians were engaged in what the British government classified as &quot;skilled occupations&quot;, or professional and technical trades. This made it possible to establish a diversified economy with a strong manufacturing sector and iron and steel industries, and circumvent the normal British protectionist policy of supporting domestic industry in the metropole while discouraging industry in the colonies abroad. As the white population increased, so did capital imports, especially in the wake of the Second World War. This trend, too, stood in sharp contrast to most other colonial territories, which suffered a major capital deficit due to revenues simply being repatriated to the metropole, leaving little capital to be invested locally. The considerable investment made by white Rhodesians in the economy financed the development of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s export industries as well as the infrastructure necessary to integrate it further with international markets.

In August 1953, Southern Rhodesia merged with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the two other British Central African territories, to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – a loose association that placed defence and economic direction under a central government but left many domestic affairs under the control of its constituent territories. As it began to appear that decolonisation was inevitable and indigenous black populations were pressing heavily for change, the federation was dissolved at the end of December 1963.

===Unilateral Declaration of Independence (1965)===

Although prepared to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted a policy of &quot;no independence before majority rule&quot; (NIBMR), dictating that colonies with a significant, politically active population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule. White Rhodesians balked at the premise of NIBMR; many felt they had a right to absolute political control, at least for the time being, despite their relatively small numbers. They were also disturbed by the chaos of the post-colonial political transitions occurring in other African nations at the time, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A vocal segment of the white populace was open to the concept of gradually incorporating black Rhodesians into civil society and a more integrated political structure in theory, although not without qualification and equivocation. A greater degree of social and political equality, they argued, was acceptable once more black citizens had obtained higher educational and vocational standards. The second faction in the white community was wholly unwilling to concede the principle, much less the practice, of equality to the black population. Both groups remained opposed to majority rule in the near future. However, once Rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies, extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the British government, which perceived the scrutiny as a serious embarrassment to the United Kingdom.

After the federation was dissolved in December 1963, the then British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, insisted that preconditions on independence talks hinge on what he termed the &quot;five principles&quot; – unimpeded progress to majority rule, assurance against any future legislation decidedly detrimental to black interests, &quot;improvement in the political status&quot; of local Africans, an end to official racial discrimination, and a political settlement that could be &quot;acceptable to the whole population&quot;. Harold Wilson and his incoming Labour government took an even harder line on demanding that these points be legitimately addressed before a timetable for independence could be set.

In 1964, growing white dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations played a major role in the ousting of Winston Field as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Field was succeeded by Ian Smith, chairman of the conservative Rhodesian Front Party and an outspoken critic of any immediate transition to majority rule. Smith, the colony&#x27;s first Rhodesian-born leader, soon came to personify resistance to liberals in British government and those agitating for change at home. In September 1964, Smith visited Lisbon, where Portuguese prime minister António de Oliveira Salazar promised him &quot;maximum support&quot; if he should declare independence. Aside from a common interest in maintaining security ties in southern Africa, Salazar expressed a great deal of anger at Britain&#x27;s refusal to support Portugal during the Indian annexation of Goa in 1961, admonishing Smith not to trust the British government. A Rhodesian Trade Office was opened in Lisbon in order to co-ordinate breaking the anticipated sanctions in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence later that year, which encouraged Smith not to compromise. In its turn, the Rhodesian Trade Office in Lisbon functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy and caused tension with London, which objected to Rhodesia conducting its own foreign policy. As land-locked Rhodesia bordered the Portuguese colony of Mozambique, Salazar&#x27;s promise of &quot;maximum support&quot; from Portugal in breaking the anticipated sanctions gave Smith more grounds for self-confidence in his talks with London. Smith ruled out acceptance for all five of the British principles as they stood, implying instead that Rhodesia was already legally entitled to independence—a claim that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the predominantly white electorate in a referendum.

Emboldened by the results of this referendum and the subsequent general election, the Rhodesian government threatened to declare independence without British consent. Harold Wilson countered by warning that such an irregular procedure would be considered treasonous, although he specifically rejected using armed force to quell a rebellion by English &quot;kith and kin&quot;, or white Rhodesians of predominantly British descent and origin, many of whom still possessed sympathies and family ties to the United Kingdom. Wilson&#x27;s refusal to consider a military option further encouraged Smith to proceed with his plans. Talks quickly broke down, and final efforts in October to achieve a settlement floundered; the Smith government remained unwilling to accept the five principles of independence, and the British government argued it would settle for nothing less.

On 11 November 1965 the Cabinet of Rhodesia issued a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). The UDI was immediately denounced as an &quot;act of rebellion against the Crown&quot; in the United Kingdom, and Wilson promised that the illegal action would be short-lived. However, given its self-governing status Rhodesia had no longer been within the United Kingdom&#x27;s direct sphere of influence for some time, and the facade of continued British rule was rendered a constitutional fiction by UDI. In light of these circumstances, Wilson quickly realised his ability to assert direct leverage over the incumbent Rhodesian government was limited.

On 12 October 1965, the United Nations General Assembly had noted the repeated threats of the Rhodesian authorities &quot;to declare unilaterally the independence of Southern Rhodesia, in order to perpetuate minority rule&quot;, and called upon Wilson to use all means at his disposal (including military force) to prevent the Rhodesian Front from asserting independence. After UDI was proclaimed, UN officials branded the Rhodesian government as an &quot;illegal racist minority regime&quot; and called on member states to voluntarily sever economic ties with Rhodesia, recommending sanctions on petroleum products and military hardware. In December 1966, the UN further iterated that these sanctions were mandatory, and member states were explicitly barred from purchasing Rhodesian export goods, namely tobacco, chromium, copper, asbestos, sugar, and beef.

The British government, having already adopted extensive sanctions of its own, dispatched a Royal Navy squadron to monitor oil deliveries in the port of Beira in Mozambique, from which a strategic pipeline ran to Umtali in Rhodesia. The warships were to deter &quot;by force, if necessary, vessels reasonably believed to be carrying oil destined for (Southern) Rhodesia&quot;.

Some Western nations, such as Switzerland, and West Germany, which were not UN member states, continued to conduct business openly with Rhodesia – the latter remained the Smith government&#x27;s largest trading partner in Western Europe until 1973, when it was admitted to the UN. Japan remained the chief recipient of Rhodesian exports outside the African continent, and Iran also supplied oil to Rhodesia in violation of the embargo. Portugal served as a conduit for Rhodesian goods, which it exported through Mozambique with false certificates of origin. South Africa, too, refused to observe the UN sanctions. In 1971, the Byrd Amendment was passed in the United States, permitting American firms to go on importing Rhodesian chromium and nickel products as normal.

Despite the poor showing of sanctions, Rhodesia found it nearly impossible to obtain diplomatic recognition abroad. In 1970, the United States declared it would not recognise UDI &quot;under [any] circumstances&quot;. South Africa and Portugal, Rhodesia&#x27;s largest trading partners, also refused to extend diplomatic recognition, and did not open embassies in the Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, preferring to conduct diplomatic activities through &quot;accredited representatives&quot;. This allowed the South African and Portuguese governments to maintain they were continuing to respect British sovereignty while also accepting the practical authority of the Smith administration.

Initially, the Rhodesian state retained its pledged loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, recognising her as Queen of Rhodesia. When Smith and Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Sir Humphrey Gibbs, the Governor of Southern Rhodesia, to formally notify him of the UDI, Gibbs condemned it as an act of treason. After Smith formally announced the UDI on the radio, Governor Gibbs used his reserve power to dismiss Smith and his entire cabinet from office, on orders from the Colonial Office in Whitehall. However, Gibbs was unable to take any concrete actions to bring about a return to lawful colonial government. Rhodesian ministers simply ignored his notices, contending that UDI had made his office obsolete. Even so, Gibbs continued to occupy his official residence, Government House, in Salisbury until 1970, when he finally left Rhodesia, following the declaration of a republic. He had effectively been superseded before then; the Smith government stated that if the Queen did not appoint a Governor-General, it would name Dupont as &quot;Officer Administering the Government&quot;. Smith had intended to have Dupont named Governor-General, but Queen Elizabeth II would not even consider this advice. With few exceptions, the international community backed Whitehall&#x27;s assertion that Gibbs was the Queen&#x27;s only legitimate representative, and hence the only lawful authority in Rhodesia.

In September 1968, the Appellate Division of the High Court of Rhodesia ruled that Ian Smith&#x27;s administration had become the &quot;de jure&quot; government of the country, not merely the &quot;de facto&quot; one. To support his decision, Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle used several statements made by Hugo Grotius, who maintained that there was no way that a nation could rightly claim to be governing a particular territory – if it was waging a war against that territory. Beadle argued that due to Britain&#x27;s economic war against Rhodesia, she could not (at the same point) be described as &quot;governing&quot; Rhodesia. The ruling set the precedent that despite the UDI, the incumbent Smith government &quot;could lawfully do anything its predecessors could lawfully have done&quot;.

A Salisbury commission chaired by prominent lawyer W.R. Waley was appointed to study constitutional options open to the Rhodesian authorities as of April 1968, including on the topic of majority rule, but reopening negotiations with the British on a settlement was ruled out early on. The Waley Commission found that in practical as well as legal terms, &quot;Europeans must surrender any belief in permanent European domination&quot;, pointing out that minority rule was not permanently sustainable. However, Waley also testified that majority rule was not desirable immediately.

Talks aimed at easing the differences between Rhodesia and the United Kingdom were carried out aboard Royal Navy vessels once in December 1966 and again in October 1968. Both efforts failed to achieve agreement, although Harold Wilson added a sixth principle to the five he had previously enunciated: &quot;it would be necessary to ensure that, regardless of race, there was no oppression of the majority by the minority or of [any] minority by the majority.&quot; Rhodesian resolve stiffened following a failure to reach a new settlement, with more radical elements of the Rhodesian Front calling for a republican constitution.

During a two-proposition referendum held in 1969, the proposal for severing all remaining ties to the British Crown passed by a majority of 61,130 votes to 14,327. Rhodesia declared itself a republic on 2 March 1970. Under the new constitution, a president served as ceremonial head of state, with the prime minister nominally reporting to him. Some in Rhodesian government had hoped in vain that the declaration of a republic would finally prompt other nations to grant recognition.

====Impact of UDI====

The years following Rhodesia&#x27;s UDI saw an unfolding series of economic, military, and political pressures placed on the country that eventually brought about majority rule, a totality of these factors rather than any one the reason for introducing change. In 2005, a conference at the London School of Economics that discussed Rhodesia&#x27;s independence concluded that UDI was sparked by an existing racial conflict complicated by Cold War intrigues.

Critics of UDI maintained that Ian Smith intended to safeguard the privileges of an entrenched colonial ruling class at the expense of the impoverished black population. Smith defended his actions by claiming that the black Rhodesian majority was too inexperienced at the time to participate in the complex administrative process of what was, by contemporary African standards, a reasonably industrialised state.

At large, UDI further hardened the white population&#x27;s attitudes towards majority rule and relations with the UK. A significant majority of white Rhodesian residents were either British immigrants or of British ancestry, and many held a special affection for the British Empire. However, the UK&#x27;s refusal to grant them independence on their terms further confirmed their opposition to a political settlement on British terms, and fed their negative attitudes towards British interference in Rhodesian politics at large. In the years prior to UDI, white Rhodesians increasingly saw themselves as beleaguered and threatened, perpetually insecure and undermined by the metropole, unable to rely on anybody but themselves. The policy of &quot;No independence before majority rule&quot; transformed the white community&#x27;s relationship with the UK and increased its suspicions of the British government&#x27;s untrustworthiness and duplicity in colonial affairs, especially since the latter had adopted NIBMR as a formal policy - the very circumstance UDI was carried out to avoid, and which white Rhodesians had struggled to resist since the onset of decolonisation.

Black nationalist parties reacted with outrage at UDI, with one ZANU official stating, &quot;...for all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course that cannot be altered. 11 November 1965 [has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom in that land from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle.&quot; It would, however, be several years before the nationalists adopted armed struggle as their primary strategy for obtaining political power. Violent tactics at this time were intended to create opportunities for external intervention, either by the international community or the British government, rather than seriously undermine the Rhodesian security forces.

Because Rhodesian exports were generally competitive and had previously been entitled to preferential treatment on the British market, the former colony did not recognise the need for escalating the pace of diversification before independence. Following the UDI, however, Rhodesia began to demonstrate that it had the potential to develop a greater degree of economic self-sufficiency. After the Rhodesian Front began introducing incentives accorded to domestic production, industrial output expanded dramatically. A rigid system of countermeasures enacted to combat sanctions succeeded in blunting their impact for at least a decade. Over the next nine years Rhodesian companies, spiting the freezing of their assets and blocking of overseas accounts, also perfected cunning techniques of sanctions evasion through both local and foreign subsidiaries, which operated on a clandestine trade network.

From 1968 until 1970, there was virtually no further dialogue between Rhodesia and the UK. In a referendum in 1969, white voters approved a new constitution and the establishment of a republic, thereby severing Rhodesia&#x27;s last links with the British Crown, duly declared in March 1970. This changed immediately after the election of Edward Heath, who reopened negotiations. Smith remained optimistic that Heath would do his utmost to remedy Anglo-Rhodesian relations, although disappointed that he continued to adhere publicly to the original &quot;five principles&quot; proposed by Alec Douglas-Home, now foreign secretary. In November 1971, Douglas-Home renewed contacts with Salisbury and announced a proposed agreement that would be satisfactory to both sides – it recognised Rhodesia&#x27;s 1969 constitution as the legal frame of government, while agreeing that gradual legislative representation was an acceptable formula for unhindered advance to majority rule. Nevertheless, the new settlement, if approved, would also implement an immediate improvement in black political status, offer a means to terminate racial discrimination, and provide a solid guarantee against retrogressive constitutional amendments.

Implementation of the proposed settlement hinged on popular acceptance, but the Rhodesian government consistently refused to submit it to a universal referendum. A twenty four-member commission headed by an eminent jurist, Lord Pearce, was therefore tasked with ascertaining public opinion on the subject. In 1972, the commission began interviewing interest groups and sampling opinions – although concern was expressed over the widespread apathy encountered. According to the commission, whites were in favour of the settlement, and Rhodesians of Coloured or Asian ancestry generally pleased, while the black response to the settlement&#x27;s terms was resoundingly negative. As many as thirty black Rhodesian chiefs and politicians voiced their opposition, prompting Britain to withdraw from the proposals on the grounds of the commission&#x27;s report.

===The Bush War===
====Early militant activity====

As early as 1960, minority rule in Southern Rhodesia was already being challenged by a rising tide of political violence led by black African nationalists such as Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Sithole. A sustained period of civil unrest between 1960 and 1965 further polarised relations between the government and the increasingly militant black nationalists. After their public campaigns were initially suppressed, many black nationalists believed that negotiation was completely incapable of meeting their aspirations. Petrol bombings by politicised radicals became increasingly common, with the &quot;Zimbabwe Review&quot; observing in 1961, &quot;for the first time home-made petrol bombs were used by freedom fighters in Salisbury against settler establishments.&quot; Between January and September 1962, nationalists detonated 33 bombs and were implicated in 28 acts of arson, and 27 acts of sabotage against communications infrastructure. The nationalists also murdered a number of black Rhodesians who were accused of collaboration with the security forces. Nkomo&#x27;s party, the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) announced that year that it had formed a military wing, the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and &quot;the decision to start bringing in arms and ammunition and to send young men away for sabotage training&quot; had already been implemented. As early as 1960, ZAPU&#x27;s predecessor, the National Democratic Party (NDP), had established informal contacts with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and discussed the possibility of obtaining military training in Eastern Europe for its members. In July 1962, Nkomo visited Moscow and discussed plans for a ZAPU-led armed uprising in Rhodesia. He made formal requests for Soviet funding and arms for ZIPRA, explaining that &quot;for these purposes ZAPU needs arms, explosives, revolvers...the party also needs money to bribe persons who guard important installations, to carry out sabotage&quot;. The Soviets agreed to supply ZAPU with limited funds beginning in 1963, and increased its level of financial support after UDI. In 1963, ZIPRA also made its first formal request to the Soviet Union for military training. The Soviets began training ZIPRA militants in guerrilla warfare in early 1964.

Nkomo&#x27;s public endorsement of a violent strategy confirmed white politicians&#x27; opposition to ZAPU and fed their negative attitudes towards black nationalists at large. In response to the formation of ZIPRA, the Rhodesian government banned ZAPU, driving that party&#x27;s supporters underground. It also passed draconian security legislation restricting the right to assembly and granting the security forces broad powers to crack down on suspected political subversives. For the first time, the death sentence was also introduced for any act of politically inspired terrorism which involved arson or the use of explosives.

The emergence of guerrilla warfare and acts of urban insurrection by the black nationalist parties in Rhodesia allowed racial politics to be elevated into an issue of law and order in white Rhodesian public discourse. To Smith and his government, black nationalists were stateless dissidents whose primary motives were not political, but crime and perpetuating lawlessness; for example, Smith preferred to describe the insurgents as &quot;gangsters&quot; in his commentary. The use of weapons and explosives sourced from communist states by the black nationalists also disguised the racial dynamics of the conflict, allowing white Rhodesians to claim that they were targets of Soviet-directed communist agitators rather than a domestic political movement. Smith and his supporters perceived themselves as collective defenders of the traditional values of the British Empire against the twin threats of international communism, manifested through the Soviet Union&#x27;s support for black nationalist militants, and the social and political decadence of the West. Often repeated appeals to the Christian heritage of their pioneer ancestors in &quot;defending the free world&quot; and sustaining &quot;Western civilisation&quot; reflected these beliefs. This was hardly an unusual opinion among white minorities in Southern Africa at the time; a dossier compiled by United States intelligence officials on the topic found that:
ZAPU&#x27;s attempts to implement its armed struggle were hamstrung by a factional split within the party between 1962 and 1963. A number of ZAPU dissidents rejected Nkomo&#x27;s authority and formed their own organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), with Ndabangingi Sithole as its president and Robert Mugabe as its general secretary. By August 1964, ZANU was banned by the Rhodesian government as well, which cited widespread acts of violent intimidation attributed to its members. ZANU&#x27;s agenda was left-wing and pan-Africanist; it demanded a one-party state with majority rule and the abolition of private property. Ethnic tensions also exacerbated the split: ZANU recruited almost solely from the Shona-speaking peoples of Rhodesia. Its chief support base was the rural peasantry in the Mashonaland countryside. ZAPU did retain Shona members, even among its senior leadership following the split. However, thereafter it recruited predominantly from the Ndebele ethnic group. Due to ZAPU&#x27;s close relationship with the Soviet Union, ZANU found itself ostracised by the Soviet bloc but soon found a new ally in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its political ideology was somewhat more influenced by the principles of Maoism than ZAPU, and a sympathetic Chinese government soon agreed to furnish weapons and training for ZANU&#x27;s own war effort.

After UDI, ZANU formed its own military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). While ZANLA and ZIPRA both planned for an armed struggle against the Rhodesian government, their respective leadership disagreed on the means of conducting the insurgency. ZIPRA favoured Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on acquiring sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu. ZANLA placed greater emphasis on the politicisation of the local populace in the areas it operated, and favoured a more irregular style of warfare.

In early April 1966, two groups of ZANLA insurgents recently trained at a Chinese military facility in Nanjing crossed into Rhodesia from Zambia, having been issued vague instructions to sabotage important installations and kill white farmers. Five were arrested by the Rhodesian security forces almost immediately. Another seven initially evaded capture and planned to destroy an electric pylon near Sinoia. Their explosive charges failed to detonate and were discovered by the security forces, who tracked the insurgents to a nearby ranch on April 28. All seven were cornered and killed after a brief firefight; this event is considered to be the first engagement of the Rhodesian Bush War. The action at Sinoia has been commemorated by supporters of the guerrillas since as &quot;Chimurenga Day&quot;, and occupies a place of pride in ZANU hagiography.

In August 1967, a large and better-equipped column of almost seventy ZIPRA insurgents infiltrated Rhodesia from Zambia, bolstered by recruits from an allied South African militant organisation, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK). The insurgents failed to cultivate prior contacts with the local populace, which immediately informed on their presence to Rhodesian officials. Within the month, the Rhodesian police and army had launched a counteroffensive codenamed Operation Nickel, killing forty-seven insurgents, capturing another twenty, and driving the survivors across the border into Botswana. An even larger ZIPRA column of over a hundred insurgents was intercepted in early 1968 and annihilated by the security forces. A third ZIPRA incursion attempt in July 1969 met with similarly catastrophic results. Thereafter, ZIPRA abandoned the notion of attempting to infiltrate the country with large groups of insurgents equipped only with small arms; it limited itself to more irregular forms of warfare until it could stockpile enough heavy weaponry to mount a major conventional invasion. For its part, the ZANLA leadership criticised ZIPRA&#x27;s continued fixation with winning a major conventional engagement, arguing that the failed incursions demonstrated the futility of engaging the Rhodesian military in the type of pitched battles in which it held an indisputable advantage. ZIPRA&#x27;s failure to obtain support from the locals was also noted, and ZANLA began implementing a long-term covert politicisation programme to cultivate civilian support throughout its future area of operations.

===Military and political escalation (1972–1976)===

By December 1972, ZANLA had cached arms and established a vast underground network of informants and supporters in northeastern Rhodesia. As a result of the erosion of Portuguese authority in Mozambique&#x27;s border provinces due to the Mozambican War of Independence, ZANLA was also able to establish external sanctuaries there. It was also in the process of cultivating a military alliance with the leading black nationalist movement in Mozambique, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). On December 21, a group of ZANLA insurgents under Rex Nhongo crossed into Rhodesia from Mozambique and raided an isolated commercial farm. In the successive months, this attack was followed by a succession of raids on white farmers throughout the northeastern districts of the country and resulted in several casualties among the security forces. The propaganda value of these raids, coupled with the success of ZANLA&#x27;s politicisation campaign, denied intelligence to the security forces and furnished more recruits for the insurgents. In response, the Rhodesian security forces began coordinating operations in Mozambique with the Portuguese army to intercept ZANLA insurgents before they could cross the border.

The practical alliances between ZIPRA and MK, and later ZANLA and FRELIMO, prompted Rhodesia to look increasingly towards South Africa and Portugal for active assistance. Rhodesian politicians frequently reminded officials in the other two nations of common security interests based on the similarity of their restive internal situations. They saw strong parallels between their nation&#x27;s position of being threatened by black nationalist insurgencies and the Portuguese predicament with FRELIMO in Mozambique, as well as to a lesser extent the insurgencies in South Africa and South West Africa. Under the auspices of the Alcora Exercise, the three countries&#x27; bureaucracies began routinely sharing information and seeking common diplomatic positions. Lieutenant General Alan Fraser, a senior strategist in the South African Defence Force wrote in 1970, &quot;there can be no doubt in any of our minds that we have a common enemy: we, i.e. Portugal, the RSA and Rhodesia. Unless we are to lay ourselves open to the possibility of defeat in detail, we must fight this enemy jointly—if not simultaneously.&quot; Nevertheless, aside from intelligence-sharing and some limited coordination on the operational level in Mozambique, the Portuguese could offer Rhodesia little decisive assistance. Portuguese military resources in Mozambique were preoccupied with FRELIMO and somewhat depleted by a decade of war, and little could be spared to assist a foreign ally. Rhodesia expected far more from South Africa, which possessed far greater military resources and infinitely more diplomatic influence abroad.

After the collapse of Portuguese rule in Mozambique in 1974–1975, it was no longer viable for the Smith regime to sustain white minority rule indefinitely. By this time, even South Africa&#x27;s Vorster had come to this view. While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country&#x27;s black people, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where black people outnumbered white people 22:1. In 1976, there were 270,000 Rhodesians of European descent and six million Africans.

International business groups involved in the country (e.g. Lonrho) transferred their support from the Rhodesian government to black nationalist parties. Business leaders and politicians feted Nkomo on his visits to Europe. ZANU also attracted business supporters who saw the course that future events were likely to take. Funding and arms support provided by supporters, particularly from the Soviet Union and its allies in the latter 1970s, allowed both ZIPRA and the ZANLA to acquire more sophisticated weaponry, thereby increasing the military pressure that the guerrillas were able to place on Rhodesia.

Until 1972, containing the guerrillas was little more than a police action. Even as late as August 1975 when Rhodesian government and black nationalist leaders met at Victoria Falls for negotiations brokered by South Africa and Zambia, the talks never got beyond the procedural phase. Rhodesian representatives made it clear they were prepared to fight an all out war to prevent majority rule. However, the situation changed dramatically after the end of Portuguese colonial rule in Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia now found itself almost entirely surrounded by hostile states and even South Africa, its only real ally, pressed for a settlement.

At this point, ZANU&#x27;s alliance with FRELIMO and the porous border between Mozambique and eastern Rhodesia enabled large-scale training and infiltration of ZANU/ZANLA fighters. The governments of Zambia and Botswana were also emboldened sufficiently to allow resistance movement bases to be set up in their territories. Guerrillas began to launch operations deep inside Rhodesia, attacking roads, railways, economic targets and isolated security force positions, in 1976.

The government adopted a strategic hamlets policy of the kind used in Malaya and Vietnam to restrict the influence of insurgents over the population of rural areas. Local people were forced to relocate to protected villages (PVs) which were strictly controlled and guarded by the government against rebel atrocities. The protected villages were compared by the guerrillas to concentration camps. Some contemporary accounts claim that this interference in the lives of local residents induced many of them who had previously been neutral to support the guerrillas.

The war degenerated into rounds of increasing brutality from all three parties involved (ZANU and ZAPU, and the Rhodesian Army). Mike Subritzky, a former NZ Army ceasefire monitor in Rhodesia, in 1980 described the war as &quot;both bloody and brutal and brought out the very worst in the opposing combatants on all three sides.&quot;

A major problem for the Rhodesian state in fighting the Bush War was always a shortage of manpower. Of the 3,000 white men liable for conscription in 1973, only about 1,000 reported when called-up. In February 1978, the Rhodesian Army stated it needed a minimum of 1,041 men to continue combat operations, and of those called up, only 570 reported for duty while the rest chose to move to South Africa. White emigration increased as the state called up more and more men to fight in the war, creating a vicious circle, which gradually limited the capacity of the Rhodesian state to continue the war. In order to stop white emigration, the Smith government brought in a law in 1975 forbidding Rhodesian citizens from holding foreign currency, but the law was widely flouted. In order to encourage white emigration, the guerrillas of ZANU and ZAPU followed a strategy of attacking anything and everything that was of economic value across the country in order to force the state to call up more men, and of killing white civilians. Killing Rhodesian white citizens tended to have an &quot;echo effect&quot; as the ZANU and ZAPU had each estimated that for one white citizen killed, it caused about 20 to leave Rhodesia.

===End of the Bush War===

Rhodesia began to lose vital economic and military support from South Africa, which, while sympathetic to the white minority government, never accorded it diplomatic recognition. The South African government placed limits on the fuel and munitions they supplied to the Rhodesian military. They also withdrew the personnel and equipment that they had previously provided to aid the war effort, though covert military support continued.

In 1976, the South African government and United States governments worked together to place pressure on Smith to agree to a form of majority rule. In response to the initiative of US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in 1976 Ian Smith accepted the principle of black majority rule within two years. The Rhodesians now offered more concessions, but those concessions, focused on reaching an &quot;internal settlement&quot; with moderate black leaders, were insufficient to end the war.

At the time, some Rhodesians said the still embittered history between the British-dominated Rhodesia and the Afrikaner-dominated South Africa partly led the South African government to withdraw its aid to Rhodesia. Ian Smith said in his memoirs that even though many white South Africans supported Rhodesia, South African Prime Minister John Vorster&#x27;s policy of détente with the black African states ended up with Rhodesia being offered as the &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; to buy more time for South Africa. Other observers perceived South Africa&#x27;s distancing itself from Rhodesia as being an early move in the process that led to majority rule in South Africa itself.

In the latter 1970s, the militants had successfully put the economy of Rhodesia under significant pressure while the numbers of guerrillas in the country were steadily increasing. The government abandoned its early strategy of trying to defend the borders in favour of trying to defend key economic areas and lines of communication with South Africa, while the rest of the countryside became a patchwork of &quot;no-go areas&quot;.

====Late 1970s====

By the late 1970s, Rhodesia&#x27;s front-line forces contained about 25,000 regular troops and police – backed up by relatively strong army and police reserves. Its mechanised contingent consisted of light armoured cars and improvised mine-protected armoured personnel carriers, complemented by eight tanks (Polish built T-55LD tanks), delivered in the last year of the war. The Rhodesian Air Force operated an assortment of both Canberra light bombers, Hawker Hunter fighter bombers, older de Havilland Vampire jets as well as a somewhat antiquated, but still potent, helicopter arm. These forces, including highly trained special operations units, were capable of launching devastating raids on resistance movement camps outside the country, as in Operation Dingo in 1977 and other similar operations.

Nevertheless, guerrilla pressure inside the country itself was steadily increasing in the latter 1970s. By 1978–1979, the war had become a contest between the guerrilla warfare placing ever increasing pressure on the Rhodesian regime and civil population, and the Rhodesian government&#x27;s strategy of trying to hold off the militants until external recognition for a compromise political settlement with moderate black leaders could be secured.

By this time, the need to cut a deal was apparent to most Rhodesians, but not to all. Ian Smith had dismissed his intransigent Defence Minister, P. K. van der Byl, as early as 1976. Van der Byl was a hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opposition or the international community since before UDI.

Van der Byl eventually retired to his country estate outside Cape Town, but there were elements in Rhodesia, mainly embittered former security force personnel, who forcibly opposed majority rule up to and well beyond the establishment of majority rule. New white immigrants continued to arrive in Rhodesia right up to the eve of majority rule.

====Intensification of the Bush War====

The work of journalists such as Lord Richard Cecil, son of The 6th Marquess of Salisbury, stiffened the morale of Rhodesians and their overseas supporters. Lord Richard produced news reports for ITN which typically contrasted the &quot;incompetent&quot; insurgents with the &quot;superbly professional&quot; government troops. A group of ZANLA fighters killed Lord Richard on 20 April 1978 when he was accompanying a Rhodesian airborne unit employed in Fire Force Operations.

The shooting down on 3 September 1978 of the civilian Air Rhodesia airliner, a Vickers Viscount named the &quot;Hunyani&quot;, in the Kariba area by ZIPRA fighters using a surface-to-air missile, with the subsequent massacre of 10 of its 18 survivors, is widely considered to be the event that finally destroyed the Rhodesians&#x27; will to continue the war. Although militarily insignificant, the loss of this aircraft (and a second Viscount, named the &quot;Umniati&quot;, in 1979) demonstrated the reach of resistance movements extended to Rhodesian civil society.

The Rhodesians&#x27; means to continue the war were also eroding fast. In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot – the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke that could be seen away. of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia&#x27;s strategic oil reserve) were lost.

The government&#x27;s defence spending increased from R$30 million, 8.5% of the national budget in 1971 to 1972, to R$400 m in 1978 to 1979, 47% of the national budget. In 1980, the post-independence government of Zimbabwe inherited a US$500 million national debt.

===End of UDI (1979)===

The Rhodesian army continued its &quot;mobile counter-offensive&quot; strategy of holding key positions (&quot;vital asset ground&quot;) while carrying out raids into the no-go areas and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion failed to achieve their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on Joshua Nkomo&#x27;s residence in Lusaka (Zambia) with the stated intention of assassinating him. Nkomo and his family left hastily a few hours before the raid – having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.

In 1979, some special forces units were accused of using counterinsurgent operations as cover for ivory poaching and smuggling. Colonel Reid-Daly (commander of the Selous Scouts) discovered that his phone was bugged and after challenging a superior officer on this issue was court martialled for insubordination. He received the lightest sentence possible, a caution, but he continued to fight his conviction and eventually resigned his commission and left the Army.

By 1978–1979, up to 70% of the regular army was composed of black soldiers (though both the army and police reserves remained overwhelmingly white). By 1979 there were also 30 black commissioned officers in the regular army. While there was never any suggestion of disloyalty among the soldiers from predominantly black units (in particular within the Selous Scouts or the Rhodesian African Rifles – RAR), some argue that, by the time of the 1980 election, many of the RAR soldiers voted for Robert Mugabe.

As the result of an Internal Settlement signed on 3 March 1978 between the Rhodesian government and the moderate African nationalist parties, which were not in exile and not involved in the war, elections were held in April 1979. The United African National Council (UANC) party won a majority in this election, and its leader, Abel Muzorewa (a United Methodist Church bishop), became the country&#x27;s first black prime minister on 1 June 1979. The country&#x27;s name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The internal settlement left control of the country&#x27;s police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in white hands, for the moment. It assured whites of about one-third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between white people and black people which, in the eyes of many, particularly the insurgents, did not amount to majority rule. However, the United States Senate voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 12 June.

While the 1979 election was described by the Rhodesian government as non-racial and democratic, it did not include the main nationalist parties ZANU and ZAPU. In spite of offers from Ian Smith, the latter parties declined to participate in an election in which their political position would be insecure and under a proposed constitution which they had played no part in drafting and which was perceived as retaining strong white minority privilege.

Bishop Muzorewa&#x27;s government did not receive international recognition. The Bush War continued unabated and sanctions were not lifted. The international community refused to accept the validity of any agreement which did not incorporate the main nationalist parties. The British Government (then led by the recently elected Margaret Thatcher) issued invitations to all parties to attend a peace conference at Lancaster House. These negotiations took place in London in late 1979. The three-month-long conference almost failed to reach conclusion, due to disagreements on land reform, but resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement. UDI ended, and Rhodesia temporarily reverted to the status of a British colony (the &#x27;Colony of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;). As per the agreement, Lord Soames became Governor with full legislative and executive powers.

The Lancaster House Agreement further provided for a ceasefire which was followed by an internationally supervised general election, held in February 1980. ZANU led by Robert Mugabe won this election, some alleged, by terrorising its political opposition, including supporters of ZAPU, through former insurgents that had not confined themselves to the designated guerrilla assembly points, as stipulated by the Lancaster House Agreement. The observers and Soames were accused of looking the other way, and Mugabe&#x27;s victory was certified. Nevertheless, few could doubt that Mugabe&#x27;s support within his majority Shona tribal group was extremely strong. The Rhodesian military seriously considered mounting a coup against a perceived stolen election (&quot;Operation Quartz&quot;) to prevent ZANU from taking over the country. The alleged coup was to include the assassination of Mugabe and coordinated assaults on guerrilla assembly points throughout the country. The plan was eventually scuttled, as it was obvious that Mugabe enjoyed widespread support from the black majority despite voter intimidation, as well as the fact that the coup would gain no external support, and a conflagration which would engulf the country was seen as inevitable.

===Republic of Zimbabwe (1980)===

On 18 April 1980 the country became independent within the Commonwealth of Nations as the Republic of Zimbabwe, and its capital, Salisbury, was renamed Harare two years later.

== Geography ==

Rhodesia is equivalent in territory to modern Zimbabwe. It was a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15° and 23°S, and longitudes 25° and 34°E. It was bordered by South Africa to the south, the Bechuanaland Protectorate (later Botswana) to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Its northwest corner was roughly from South West Africa (present-day Namibia), South Africa, nearly forming a four-nation quadripoint. Most of the country was elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between . The country&#x27;s extreme east was mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Inyangani as the highest point at .

=== Climate ===

Rhodesia had a tropical climate with many local variations. The southern areas were known for their heat and aridity, parts of the central plateau received frost in winter, the Zambezi valley was also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experienced cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country&#x27;s rainy season was from late October to March and the hot climate was moderated by increasing altitude. The country was faced with recurring droughts, and severe storms were rare.

=== Biodiversity ===

The country was mostly savannah, although the moist and mountainous eastern highlands supported areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees found in these Eastern Highlands included teak, mahogany, enormous specimens of strangling fig, forest newtonia, big leaf, white stinkwood, chirinda stinkwood, knobthorn and many others.

In the low-lying parts of the country fever trees, mopane, combretum and baobabs abound. Much of the country was covered by miombo woodland, dominated by brachystegia species and others. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs were hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya. There were around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Rhodesia. There were also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.

==Government and politics==



Although Southern Rhodesia never gained full Dominion status within the Commonwealth of Nations, Southern Rhodesians ruled themselves from the attainment of &#x27;Responsible Government&#x27; in 1923. Its electoral register had property and education qualifications. Over the years various electoral arrangements made at a national and municipal level upheld these standards. For example, the franchise for the first Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council election in 1899 contained the following requirement:

voters to be British subjects, male, 21 years of age and older, able to write their address and occupation, and then to fulfil the following financial requirements: (a) ownership of a registered mining claim in Southern Rhodesia, or (b) occupying immovable property worth £75, or (c) receiving wages or salary of £50 per annum in Southern Rhodesia. Six months&#x27; continuous residence was also required for qualifications (b) and (c).

Following Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s dictum of &quot;equal rights for all civilised men&quot;, there was an implicit, albeit not an overt, racial component to the franchise, which effectively excluded a majority of native black people from the electorate via such means as property qualifications.

Up until the 1950s, Southern Rhodesia had a vibrant political life with right and left wing parties competing for power. The Rhodesian Labour Party held seats in the Assembly and in municipal councils throughout the 1920s and 1930s. From 1953 to 1958, the prime minister was Garfield Todd, a liberal who did much to promote the development of the black community through investment in education, housing and healthcare. However, the government forced Todd from office because his proposed reforms were seen by many whites as too radical.

From 1958 onwards, white settler politics consolidated and ossified around resistance to majority rule, setting the stage for UDI. The 1961 Constitution governed Southern Rhodesia and independent Rhodesia up until 1969, using the Westminster Parliamentary System modified by a system of separate voter rolls with differing property and education qualifications, without regard to race. Whites ended up with the majority of Assembly seats with Whites attaining 50 out of 66 seats. Blacks would only attain 16 out of the 66 seats in the Rhodesian Parliament.

The 1969 republican constitution established a bicameral Parliament consisting of an indirectly elected Senate and a directly elected House of Assembly, effectively reserving the majority of seats for whites. The office of President had only ceremonial significance with the Prime Minister holding executive power.

The Constitution of the short-lived Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which saw a black-led government elected for the first time, reserved 28 of the 100 parliamentary seats for whites. The independence constitution agreed at Lancaster House watered those provisions down and reserved 20 out of 100 seats for whites in the House of Assembly and 8 out of 40 seats in the Senate. The constitution prohibited Zimbabwe authorities from altering the Constitution for seven years without unanimous consent and required a three-quarters vote in Parliament for a further three years. The government amended the Constitution in 1987 to abolish the seats reserved for whites, and replace the office of Prime Minister with an executive President. In 1990, the government abolished the Senate.

===Administrative divisions===

Rhodesia had a centralised government and was divided into seven provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province had a provincial capital from where government administration was usually carried out.

==Military==

Southern Rhodesia had long been distinctive among British dependencies in that it had financed and developed its own security forces and command structure. After UDI, this posed a particular dilemma for the British government, which considered and rejected various proposals aimed at ending Rhodesia&#x27;s state of rebellion by force. Harold Wilson once remarked that bringing an end to Rhodesian independence &quot;would not be a case of arresting a subversive individual. It would mean a bloody war, and probably a bloody war turning into a bloody civil war.&quot; The formidable nature of the Rhodesian security forces, as well as British fears of a direct South African intervention on behalf of the rogue colony, preempted the further consideration of military options.

For much of its existence Rhodesia maintained a small professional standing army of 3,400 troops, about a third of whom were black volunteers. In the tradition of many colonial armies, it was primarily organised into light infantry battalions trained and equipped for counter-insurgency warfare or internal security actions, and possessed little artillery or armour. The Royal Rhodesian Air Force (RRAF) had 1,000 personnel and six squadrons of aircraft, including forty to fifty Hawker Hunter and de Havilland Vampire strike aircraft and English Electric Canberra light bombers. It also possessed a helicopter squadron, a transport squadron, and a light reconnaissance squadron. The Rhodesian military was backed by the British South Africa Police (BSAP), a well-equipped police force whose title was derived from the law enforcement division of the British South Africa Company. The BSAP had armoured vehicles of its own and a potent paramilitary capability. Domestic and external intelligence gathering were vested in the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO).

As a result of the escalating rural insurgency, the Rhodesian Security Forces began to depend more heavily on white conscripts and reservists of the Territorial Force and Territorial reserves. Regular units remained small throughout the Rhodesian Bush War but became increasingly specialised and were often able to have an effect utterly disproportionate to their size. The security forces included a disproportionate number of personnel who had seen action during the First Malayan Emergency as well as the Aden Emergency, and their experience gave Rhodesia&#x27;s defence establishment a solid grounding in counter-insurgency warfare and small unit tactics in particular. Nevertheless, the vastness of the operational area and Rhodesia&#x27;s limited manpower pool left the army, air force, and BSAP constantly overstretched. Budgetary and resource restraints, coupled with manpower shortages, meant the security forces could not expand quickly enough to match the guerrilla movements, and were almost always outnumbered. Rhodesian units compensated for their disadvantage in this regard by pursuing an aggressive preemptive and counterstrike strategy, raiding neighbouring states to destroy guerrilla forces in their external sanctuaries.

All white, male residents aged eighteen to twenty-three were obligated to fulfill four and a half months (later extended to nine months) of full-time national service. This was followed by a three-year reservist obligation. By 1974 the national service intakes had been doubled, and white men over twenty-three were also conscripted. In 1978 the Rhodesian Army had about 14,000 white national servicemen, but continued manpower shortages forced it to recruit black volunteers in larger numbers and extend compulsory military service to all white males up to sixty years of age. By the end of the Rhodesian Bush War virtually all male white residents were either serving in the military or police in a full-time or part-time capacity. The size of the Rhodesian Army had swelled to about 20,000 personnel, and the BSAP to over 40,000, including reservists.

===Biological and chemical warfare===

From 1975 to 1980 the Rhodesian government made several attempts to weaponise chemical and biological agents. Members of the security forces contaminated supplies before replacing them in guerrilla caches or planted them in rural stores to be stolen by the guerrillas during raids. They also poisoned water sources along known infiltration routes along the Rhodesian border, forcing their opponents to travel through more arid regions or carry more water during their treks.

The chemical agents most used in the Rhodesian chemical and biological warfare (CBW) programme were parathion (an organophosphate insecticide) and thallium (a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide). The weapons the Rhodesians selected for use also included &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; (causative agent of cholera) and possibly &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; (causative agent of anthrax). They also looked at using &quot;Rickettsia prowazekii&quot; (causative agent of epidemic typhus), and &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; (causative agent of typhoid fever), and toxins such as ricin and botulinum toxin.

Biological agents, namely &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, had some impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA. Some former officers of the Rhodesian Security Forces alleged that anthrax was used covertly during the late 1970s, but this has been disputed. Use of &quot;anthracis&quot;, ricin, or botulinum toxin was favoured during assassination attempts of prominent guerrilla commanders.

== Economy ==

Economically, Southern Rhodesia developed an economy that was narrowly based on the production of a few primary products, notably, chromium and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 whites between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. A large number of these immigrants were of British working-class origin, with others coming from the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, and later Angola and Mozambique. They established a relatively balanced economy, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on backwoods farming into an modest industrial power which spawned a strong manufacturing sector, iron and steel industries, and modern mining ventures. These economic successes owed little to foreign aid apart from the immigration of skilled labour and backing from South Africa.

The economy of the state of Rhodesia sustained international sanctions for a decade following the declaration of its independence, a resistance which waned as more southern African states declared independence and majority rule as well as the destruction of the Rhodesian Bush War.

==Demographics==

=== Population ===

A central feature of the white community in Rhodesia was its transience, as white settlers were just as likely to leave Rhodesia after a few years as permanently settle; for example, of the 700 British settlers who were the first white settlers, arriving in 1890, only 15 were still living in Rhodesia in 1924. As the white population of Rhodesia had a low birth rate (18 per 1,000 compared to the African rate of 48 per 1,000), to maintain white population growth was largely dependent upon taking in new white immigrants with immigration accounting for 60% of the growth of the white Rhodesian population between 1955 and 1972.

In the ten years after the nation&#x27;s independence from Britain, around 70,000 from the white population of Rhodesia emigrated out of the nation. 45% of the emigration was to South Africa due to it being geographically adjacent and sharing similarities in climate, topography, economic standards and social customs. The remaining mainly headed to other mainly white, English-speaking nations at the time, which being the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

However, the American historian Josiah Brownell noted that the turnover rate for white residents in Rhodesia was very high, as Rhodesia took in a total of 255,692 white immigrants between 1955 and 1979 while the same period a total of 246,583 whites emigrated. Even during the boom years of the late 1950s, when Rhodesia took in an average of 13,666 white immigrants per year, mostly from the United Kingdom and South Africa, an average of about 7,666 whites emigrated annually. Between 1961 and 1965, Rhodesia took in an average of 8,225 white immigrants per year while also having an average white emigration of 12,912 per year. Many prospective white immigrants in Rhodesia arrived seeking economic opportunities and departed with fluctuations in the security situation as the Bush War intensified. A substantial number were uninterested in settling there permanently and did not apply for Rhodesian citizenship, despite a much-publicised 1967 campaign urging them to do so.

Brownell asserted that patriotism in the white community was &quot;shallow&quot; due to its essentially expatriate character. He also claimed that the majority of white immigrants in the late 1960s and early 1970s were unskilled laborers who competed with the country&#x27;s black African workforce and did not contribute badly needed technical or professional skills to the country, arguing that this was due to government policy aimed at making white immigration as &quot;unselective as possible&quot; and guaranteeing every white immigrant a job. The population of Rhodesia boomed during the late 1960s due to immigration and an exceptional rate of natural increase among its black citizens, the highest in sub-Saharan Africa at the time.



=== Language ===

White Rhodesians mostly spoke English, with a minority that spoke Afrikaans. Approximately 70% of black Rhodesians spoke Shona, and around 20% spoke Ndebele. A majority of Rhodesia&#x27;s Indian community spoke Gujarati and a minority spoke Hindi.

=== Religion ===

Rhodesia predominantly adhered to Christianity, with Protestantism being the largest denomination. However, many native Africans still adhered to traditional African religions.

==Foreign relations==

Throughout the period of its Unilateral Declaration of Independence (1965 to 1979), Rhodesia pursued a foreign policy of attempting to secure recognition as an independent country, and insisting that its political system would include &#x27;gradual steps to majority rule.&#x27; Ardently anti-communist, Rhodesia tried to present itself to the West as a front-line state against communist expansion in Africa, to little avail.

Rhodesia received little international recognition during its existence; recognition only occurred after elections in 1980 and a transition to majority rule.

Rhodesia wished to retain its economic prosperity and also feared communist elements in the rebel forces, and thus felt their policy of a gradual progression to black majority rule was justified. However, the international community refused to accept this rationale, believing that their policies were perpetuating racism. This attitude was part of the larger decolonisation context, during which Western powers such as the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium hastened to grant independence to their colonies in Africa.

===The UK and the UDI===

Rhodesia was originally a British colony. Although decolonisation in Africa had begun after World War II, it began accelerating in the early 1960s, causing Britain to negotiate independence rapidly with several of its colonies. During this period, it adopted a foreign policy called NIBMAR, or No Independence Before Majority African Rule, mandating democratic reforms that placed governance in the hands of the majority black Africans. The governing white minority of Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, opposed the policy and its implications. On 11 November 1965, Rhodesia&#x27;s minority white government made a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom, as it became apparent that negotiations would not lead to independence under the white regime.

The United Kingdom government immediately brought in legislation (Southern Rhodesia Act 1965) which formally abolished all Rhodesian government institutions. This move made life difficult for Rhodesian citizens who wished to travel internationally as passports issued by Rhodesia&#x27;s UDI administration were not recognised as valid; in January 1966, the British issued a statement accepting as valid any passport issued before the declaration of independence and allowing six-month United Kingdom passports to be granted when they expired – provided that the bearer declared they did not intend to aid the UDI Rhodesian government.

Developments in Britain helped to alienate the white Rhodesian population from the former mother country, namely Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 1966 speech to the Jamaican legislature where she endorsed majority rule and her attempt in 1968 to block the hanging of what Rhodesians perceived as Zimbabwean nationalist terrorists.

Until late 1969, Rhodesia still recognised Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, even though it opposed the British government itself for hindering its goals of independence. However she refused to accept the title &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot; and eventually the Smith government abandoned their attempts to remain loyal to the British Crown. In a 1969 referendum, a majority of the electorate voted to declare Rhodesia an independent republic. The hope being that this move would facilitate recognition as an independent state by the international community, but the issue of white minority rule remained and continued to hinder this effort, and like the UDI before it, the proclamation of a republic lacked international recognition.

The British public overall viewed the issue of Rhodesia and UDI as a distant and anachronistic one that they cared relatively little about and saw any expedient response to it by their government as satisfactory. Most Britons saw the end of Rhodesia&#x27;s white supremacist timocracy as inevitable and justified. Although the majority Britons opposed military intervention against the renegade Rhodesian state, this opinion was not uniformly held.

===Sanctions===

After the declaration of independence, and indeed for the entire duration of its existence, Rhodesia did not receive official recognition from any state, although it did maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa, which was then under apartheid. South Africa did not recognise Rhodesia to preserve its fragile positions with other nations, but frequently assisted the Rhodesian state. Portugal maintained informal relations until the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The day following the declaration of independence, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution (S/RES/216) calling upon all states not to accord Rhodesia recognition, and to refrain from any assistance. The Security Council also imposed selective mandatory economic sanctions, which were later made comprehensive.

Malawi, The US, despite voting in favour of the sanctions at the UNSC, violated them to buy chromium ore from Rhodesia. Kenneth Kaunda, president of Zambia, also accused western oil companies of violating the sanctions and selling oil to Rhodesia.

===International perspective===

Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 was promptly condemned by the international community. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 216 of 12 November 1965 called &quot;upon all States not to recognise this illegal racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia.&quot;

Rhodesia campaigned for international acceptance and invoked the doctrine of non-intervention in internal affairs as justification for rebuking external criticism of its internal policies. However, the emerging doctrine of self-determination in colonial situations meant that most nations regarded Rhodesia&#x27;s self-declared independence as illegitimate.

Zambia, formerly Northern Rhodesia, took a pragmatic approach towards Rhodesia. Kenneth Kaunda, heavily dependent on access through Rhodesia for his nation&#x27;s copper ore exports, fuel, and power imports unofficially worked with the Rhodesian government. Rhodesia still allowed Zambia to export and import its goods through its territory to Mozambique ports, despite the Zambian government&#x27;s official policy of hostility and non-recognition of the post-UDI Smith Administration.

The United States, like all other Western nations, refused to recognise Rhodesia, but unlike others allowed its Consulate-General to function as a communications conduit between the US government in Washington, DC and the Rhodesian government in Salisbury. When Rhodesia set up the Rhodesian Information Office in Washington, DC, OAS nations loudly protested. The US government responded by saying the Rhodesian mission and its staff had no official diplomatic status and violated no US laws.

Portugal pursued a middle path with Rhodesia. While not officially recognising Rhodesia under Ian Smith, the government of António Salazar did permit Rhodesia to establish a representative mission in Lisbon, and permitted Rhodesian exports and imports through their colony of Mozambique. The Portuguese government in power at that time, authoritarian and ardently anti-communist, gave active behind-the-scenes support in Rhodesia&#x27;s fight against the guerrilla groups.

South Africa, itself under international pressure as a white minority government, pursued a policy of détente with the black African states at the time. These states wanted South Africa to pressure Ian Smith to accept a faster transition to majority rule in Rhodesia, in return for pledges of non-interference in South Africa&#x27;s internal affairs. Prime Minister John Vorster, believing majority rule in Rhodesia would lead to international acceptance for South Africa, used a number of tactics to pressure Smith. The South African government held up shipments of fuel and ammunition and pulled out friendly South African forces from Rhodesia. The combined loss of Mozambique and the loss of support from South Africa dealt critical blows to the Rhodesian government.

===Diplomatic relations===

After the UDI, Rhodesia maintained several overseas missions, including Pretoria, and until 1975, Lisbon in Portugal and Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) in Mozambique.

Since 1961, Rhodesia had an &quot;Accredited Diplomatic Representative&quot; with South Africa, heading a &quot;Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; embassy. Before South Africa left the Commonwealth that year, the then Southern Rhodesia had exchanged High Commissioners with the then Union of South Africa, but following the change in status, the Republic now had a &quot;South African Diplomatic Mission&quot; in Salisbury.

During 1965, the government of Rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in Lisbon separate from the British Embassy, with its own accredited representative, having previously been able to establish its own consulate in Lourenço Marques, capital of Portuguese Mozambique. This prompted protests from the British government, which was determined that the representative, Harry Reedman, should be a nominal member of the British Ambassador&#x27;s staff. For their part, the Portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept Reedman as an independent representative but deny him diplomatic status.

The Rhodesian Information Office in Washington remained open following UDI, but its director, Ken Towsey, and his staff were deprived of their diplomatic status. Previously, there had been a &quot;Minister for Rhodesian Affairs&quot; operating under the aegis of the British Embassy in Washington, as well representatives in Tokyo and Bonn. Following the country&#x27;s independence as Zimbabwe, Towsey became chargé d&#x27;affaires at the new embassy.

The High Commission in London, known as Rhodesia House, continued to function until it was closed in 1969 following the decision by white Rhodesians in a referendum to make the country a republic, along with the &quot;British Residual Mission&quot; in Salisbury. Prior to its closure, the mission flew the newly adopted Flag of Rhodesia, considered illegal by the Foreign Office, prompting calls by Labour MP Willie Hamilton for its removal.
In Australia, the federal government sought to close the Rhodesia Information Centre in Sydney, but it remained open, operating under the jurisdiction of the state of New South Wales. In 1973, the Labor government of Gough Whitlam cut post and telephone links to the centre, but this was ruled illegal by the High Court. An office was also established in Paris, but this was closed down by the French government in 1977.

Similarly, the United States recalled its consul-general from Salisbury, and reduced consular staff, but did not move to close its consulate until the declaration of a republic in 1970. South Africa, however, retained its &quot;Accredited Diplomatic Representative&quot; after UDI, which allowed it to continue to recognise British sovereignty as well as to deal with the &quot;de facto&quot; authority of the government of Ian Smith.

The South African Diplomatic Mission in Salisbury became the only such mission remaining in the country after 1975, when Portugal downgraded its mission to consul level, having recalled its consul-general in Salisbury in May 1970. After Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence, the new government closed its missions in Pretoria and Cape Town, only maintaining a trade mission in Johannesburg, while the South African Diplomatic Mission in Salisbury was also closed.

===Results===

The growing intensity of the civil war and a lack of international support eventually led the Rhodesian government to submit to an agreement with the UK in 1979. This led to internationally supervised elections, won by Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front and Robert Mugabe, establishing the internationally recognised Zimbabwe.

== Culture ==

===Media===

The most influential newspapers in the country were the &quot;Rhodesia Herald&quot; in Salisbury and &quot;The Chronicle&quot; in Bulawayo. Following UDI, in 1976, the state-run Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation (RBC) took over the privately owned Rhodesia Television (RTV) service, in which it had previously acquired a 51 percent stake.
Among the news magazines published in Rhodesia under UDI were the &quot;Illustrated Life Rhodesia&quot;, while &quot;The Valiant Years&quot; by Beryl Salt told the history of Rhodesia from 1890 to 1978 entirely through the medium of facsimile reproduction of articles and headlines from Rhodesian newspapers.

===Sports===
As Rhodesia was a former colony of the United Kingdom, all of the sports that were born in the United Kingdom enjoyed considerable popularity in Rhodesia; especially cricket, rugby, water polo, football, netball, golf, tennis (including the Rhodesian Open Tennis Championships), lawn bowls, field hockey, etc. Just like neighbouring South Africa, Rhodesia was barred from both competing against and participating with Commonwealth member countries. 
One of the biggest triumphs in Rhodesia sports history was when the team defeated the New Zealand national rugby team 10-8 while the All Blacks were touring South Africa. They are 1 of 8 nations to ever defeat the All Blacks and the only non-test nation to have ever beaten them. As this was the only game the two nations ever played they also have the unique honour of having a 100% win record against the All Blacks.

==Legacy==

In the ten years after transforming into Zimbabwe, around 60% of the white population emigrated, most to South Africa and to other mainly white, English-speaking countries where they formed immigrant communities. Politically within Zimbabwe, the consolidation of power by Robert Mugabe continued through the 1980s. Following amendments to the country&#x27;s constitution in 1987, parliamentary seats reserved for whites were abolished, and an executive presidency was created, held by Mugabe. Many immigrants and some of the whites who stayed in Zimbabwe became deeply nostalgic for Rhodesia. These individuals are known as &quot;Rhodies&quot;. Native whites who are more accepting of the new order are known as &quot;Zimbos&quot;.

<text>The relational model (RM) is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, where all data are represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database.

The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying data and queries: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system software take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries.

Most relational databases use the SQL data definition and query language; these systems implement what can be regarded as an engineering approximation to the relational model. A &quot;table&quot; in a SQL database schema corresponds to a predicate variable; the contents of a table to a relation; key constraints, other constraints, and SQL queries correspond to predicates. However, SQL databases deviate from the relational model in many details, and Codd fiercely argued against deviations that compromise the original principles.

== History ==
The relational model was developed by Edgar F. Codd as a general model of data, and subsequently promoted by Chris Date and Hugh Darwen among others. In their 1995 &quot;The Third Manifesto&quot;, Date and Darwen try to demonstrate how the relational model can accommodate certain &quot;desired&quot; object-oriented features.

=== Extensions ===
Some years after publication of his 1970 model, Codd proposed a three-valued logic (True, False, Missing/NULL) version of it to deal with missing information, and in his &quot;The Relational Model for Database Management Version 2&quot; (1990) he went a step further with a four-valued logic (True, False, Missing but Applicable, Missing but Inapplicable) version.

== Conceptualization ==

=== Basic concepts ===
A &quot;relation&quot; consists of a &quot;heading&quot; and a &quot;body&quot;. The heading defines a set of &quot;attributes&quot;, each with a &quot;name&quot; and &quot;data type&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;domain&quot;). The number of attributes in this set is the relation&#x27;s &quot;degree&quot; or &quot;arity&quot;. The body is a set of &quot;tuples&quot;. A tuple is a collection of &quot;n&quot; &quot;values&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the relation&#x27;s degree, and each value in the tuple corresponds to a unique attribute. The number of tuples in this set is the relation&#x27;s &quot;cardinality&quot;.

Relations are represented by &quot;relational variables&quot; or &quot;relvars&quot;, which can be reassigned. A &quot;database&quot; is a collection of relvars.

In this model, databases follow the &quot;Information Principle&quot;: At any given time, all information in the database is represented solely by values within tuples, corresponding to attributes, in relations identified by relvars.

=== Constraints ===

A database may define arbitrary boolean expressions as constraints. If all constraints evaluate as &quot;true&quot;, the database is &quot;consistent&quot;; otherwise, it is &quot;inconsistent&quot;. If a change to a database&#x27;s relvars would leave the database in an inconsistent state, that change is illegal and must not succeed.

In general, constraints are expressed using relational comparison operators, of which just one, &quot;is subset of&quot; (⊆), is theoretically sufficient.

Two special cases of constraints are expressed as &quot;keys&quot; and &quot;foreign keys&quot;:

==== Keys ====

A &quot;candidate key&quot;, or simply a &quot;key&quot;, is the smallest subset of attributes guaranteed to uniquely differentiate each tuple in a relation. Since each tuple in a relation must be unique, every relation necessarily has a key, which may be its complete set of attributes. A relation may have multiple keys, as there may be multiple ways to uniquely differentiate each tuple.

An attribute may be unique across tuples without being a key. For example, a relation describing a company&#x27;s employees may have two attributes: ID and Name. Even if no employees currently share a name, if it is possible to eventually hire a new employee with the same name as a current employee, the attribute subset {Name} is not a key. Conversely, if the subset {ID} is a key, this means not only that no employees &quot;currently&quot; share an ID, but that no employees &quot;will ever&quot; share an ID.

==== Foreign keys ====
A &quot;foreign key&quot; is a subset of attributes &quot;{A}&quot; in a relation &quot;R1&quot; that corresponds with a key of another relation &quot;R2&quot;, with the property that the projection of &quot;R1&quot; on &quot;{A}&quot; is a subset of the projection of &quot;R2&quot; on &quot;{A}&quot;. In other words, if a tuple in &quot;R1&quot; contains values for a foreign key, there must be a corresponding tuple in &quot;R2&quot; containing the same values for the corresponding key.

=== Relational operations ===
Users (or programs) request data from a relational database by sending it a query. In response to a query, the database returns a result set.

Often, data from multiple tables are combined into one, by doing a join. Conceptually, this is done by taking all possible combinations of rows (the Cartesian product), and then filtering out everything except the answer.

There are a number of relational operations in addition to join. These include project (the process of eliminating some of the columns), restrict (the process of eliminating some of the rows), union (a way of combining two tables with similar structures), difference (that lists the rows in one table that are not found in the other), intersect (that lists the rows found in both tables), and product (mentioned above, which combines each row of one table with each row of the other). Depending on which other sources you consult, there are a number of other operators – many of which can be defined in terms of those listed above. These include semi-join, outer operators such as outer join and outer union, and various forms of division. Then there are operators to rename columns, and summarizing or aggregating operators, and if you permit relation values as attributes (relation-valued attribute), then operators such as group and ungroup.

The flexibility of relational databases allows programmers to write queries that were not anticipated by the database designers. As a result, relational databases can be used by multiple applications in ways the original designers did not foresee, which is especially important for databases that might be used for a long time (perhaps several decades). This has made the idea and implementation of relational databases very popular with businesses.

=== Database normalization ===

Relations are classified based upon the types of anomalies to which they&#x27;re vulnerable. A database that is in the first normal form is vulnerable to all types of anomalies, while a database that is in the domain/key normal form has no modification anomalies. Normal forms are hierarchical in nature. That is, the lowest level is the first normal form, and the database cannot meet the requirements for higher level normal forms without first having met all the requirements of the lesser normal forms.

== Logical interpretation ==

The relational model is a formal system. A relation&#x27;s attributes define a set of logical propositions. Each proposition can be expressed as a tuple. The body of a relation is a subset of these tuples, representing which propositions are true. Constraints represent additional propositions which must also be true. Relational algebra is a set of logical rules that can validly infer conclusions from these propositions.

The definition of a &quot;tuple&quot; allows for a unique empty tuple with no values, corresponding to the empty set of attributes. If a relation has a degree of 0 (i.e. its heading contains no attributes), it may have either a cardinality of 0 (a body containing no tuples) or a cardinality of 1 (a body containing the single empty tuple). These relations represent Boolean truth values. The relation with degree 0 and cardinality 0 is &quot;False&quot;, while the relation with degree 0 and cardinality 1 is &quot;True&quot;.

=== Example ===

If a relation of Employees contains the attributes &quot;{Name, ID}&quot;, then the tuple &quot;{Alice, 1}&quot; represents the proposition: &quot;There exists an employee named &quot;Alice&quot; with ID &quot;1&quot;&quot;. This proposition may be true or false. If this tuple exists in the relation&#x27;s body, the proposition is true (there is such an employee). If this tuple is not in the relation&#x27;s body, the proposition is false (there is no such employee).

Furthermore, if &quot;{ID}&quot; is a key, then a relation containing the tuples &quot;{Alice, 1}&quot; and &quot;{Bob, 1}&quot; would represent the following contradiction:
# There exists an employee with the name &quot;Alice&quot; and the ID &quot;1&quot;.
# There exists an employee with the name &quot;Bob&quot; and the ID &quot;1&quot;.
# There do not exist multiple employees with the same ID.

Under the principle of explosion, this contradiction would allow the system to prove that any arbitrary proposition is true. The database must enforce the key constraint to prevent this.

== Examples ==

=== Database ===
An idealized, very simple example of a description of some relvars (relation variables) and their attributes:
* Customer (Customer ID, Name)
* Order (Order ID, Customer ID, Invoice ID, Date)
* Invoice (Invoice ID, Customer ID, Order ID, Status)

In this design we have three relvars: Customer, Order, and Invoice. The bold, underlined attributes are &quot;candidate keys&quot;. The non-bold, underlined attributes are &quot;foreign keys&quot;.

Usually one candidate key is chosen to be called the primary key and used in preference over the other candidate keys, which are then called alternate keys.

A &quot;candidate key&quot; is a unique identifier enforcing that no tuple will be duplicated; this would make the relation into something else, namely a bag, by violating the basic definition of a set. Both foreign keys and superkeys (that includes candidate keys) can be composite, that is, can be composed of several attributes. Below is a tabular depiction of a relation of our example Customer relvar; a relation can be thought of as a value that can be attributed to a relvar.

=== Customer relation ===
If we attempted to &quot;insert&quot; a new customer with the ID &quot;123&quot;, this would violate the design of the relvar since Customer ID is a &quot;primary key&quot; and we already have a customer &quot;123&quot;. The DBMS must reject a transaction such as this that would render the database inconsistent by a violation of an integrity constraint. However, it is possible to insert another customer named &quot;Alice&quot;, as long as this new customer has a unique ID, since the Name field is not part of the primary key.

&quot;Foreign keys&quot; are integrity constraints enforcing that the value of the attribute set is drawn from a &quot;candidate key&quot; in another relation. For example, in the Order relation the attribute Customer ID is a foreign key. A &quot;join&quot; is the operation that draws on information from several relations at once. By joining relvars from the example above we could &quot;query&quot; the database for all of the Customers, Orders, and Invoices. If we only wanted the tuples for a specific customer, we would specify this using a restriction condition. If we wanted to retrieve all of the Orders for Customer &quot;123&quot;, we could query the database to return every row in the Order table with Customer ID &quot;123&quot; .

There is a flaw in our database design above. The Invoice relvar contains an Order ID attribute. So, each tuple in the Invoice relvar will have one Order ID, which implies that there is precisely one Order for each Invoice. But in reality an invoice can be created against many orders, or indeed for no particular order. Additionally the Order relvar contains an Invoice ID attribute, implying that each Order has a corresponding Invoice. But again this is not always true in the real world. An order is sometimes paid through several invoices, and sometimes paid without an invoice. In other words, there can be many Invoices per Order and many Orders per Invoice. This is a many-to-many relationship between Order and Invoice (also called a &quot;non-specific relationship&quot;). To represent this relationship in the database a new relvar should be introduced whose role is to specify the correspondence between Orders and Invoices:

 OrderInvoice (Order ID, Invoice ID)

Now, the Order relvar has a &quot;one-to-many relationship&quot; to the OrderInvoice table, as does the Invoice relvar. If we want to retrieve every Invoice for a particular Order, we can query for all orders where Order ID in the Order relation equals the Order ID in OrderInvoice, and where Invoice ID in OrderInvoice equals the Invoice ID in Invoice.

== Application to relational databases ==
A data type in a relational database might be the set of integers, the set of character strings, the set of dates, etc. The relational model does not dictate what types are to be supported.

Attributes are commonly represented as columns, tuples as rows, and relations as tables. A table is specified as a list of column definitions, each of which specifies a unique column name and the type of the values that are permitted for that column. An attribute &quot;value&quot; is the entry in a specific column and row.

A database relvar (relation variable) is commonly known as a base table. The heading of its assigned value at any time is as specified in the table declaration and its body is that most recently assigned to it by an update operator (typically, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). The heading and body of the table resulting from evaluating a query are determined by the definitions of the operators used in that query.

=== SQL and the relational model ===
SQL, initially pushed as the standard language for relational databases, deviates from the relational model in several places. The current ISO SQL standard doesn&#x27;t mention the relational model or use relational terms or concepts.

According to the relational model, a Relation&#x27;s attributes and tuples are mathematical sets, meaning they are unordered and unique. In a SQL table, neither rows nor columns are proper sets. A table may contain both duplicate rows and duplicate columns, and a table&#x27;s columns are explicitly ordered. SQL uses a Null value to indicate missing data, which has no analog in the relational model. Because a row can represent unknown information, SQL does not adhere to the relational model&#x27;s &quot;Information Principle&quot;.

== Set-theoretic formulation ==

Basic notions in the relational model are &quot;relation names&quot; and &quot;attribute names&quot;. We will represent these as strings such as &quot;Person&quot; and &quot;name&quot; and we will usually use the variables formula_1 and formula_2 to range over them. Another basic notion is the set of &quot;atomic values&quot; that contains values such as numbers and strings.

Our first definition concerns the notion of &quot;tuple&quot;, which formalizes the notion of row or record in a table:

; Tuple
: A tuple is a partial function from attribute names to atomic values.
; Header
: A header is a finite set of attribute names.
; Projection
: The projection of a tuple formula_3 on a finite set of attributes formula_4 is formula_5.

The next definition defines &quot;relation&quot; that formalizes the contents of a table as it is defined in the relational model.

; Relation
: A relation is a tuple formula_6 with formula_7, the header, and formula_8, the body, a set of tuples that all have the domain formula_7.

Such a relation closely corresponds to what is usually called the extension of a predicate in first-order logic except that here we identify the places in the predicate with attribute names. Usually in the relational model a database schema is said to consist of a set of relation names, the headers that are associated with these names and the constraints that should hold for every instance of the database schema.

; Relation universe
: A relation universe formula_10 over a header formula_7 is a non-empty set of relations with header formula_7.
; Relation schema
: A relation schema formula_13 consists of a header formula_7 and a predicate formula_15 that is defined for all relations formula_16 with header formula_7. A relation satisfies a relation schema formula_13 if it has header formula_7 and satisfies formula_20.

=== Key constraints and functional dependencies ===
One of the simplest and most important types of relation constraints is the &quot;key constraint&quot;. It tells us that in every instance of a certain relational schema the tuples can be identified by their values for certain attributes.

; Superkey
A superkey is a set of column headers for which the values of those columns concatenated are unique across all rows. Formally:
: A superkey is written as a finite set of attribute names.
: A superkey formula_21 holds in a relation formula_6 if:
:* formula_23 and
:* there exist no two distinct tuples formula_24 such that formula_25.
: A superkey holds in a relation universe formula_10 if it holds in all relations in formula_10.
: Theorem: A superkey formula_21 holds in a relation universe formula_10 over formula_7 if and only if formula_23 and formula_32 holds in formula_10.
; Candidate key
A candidate key is a superkey that cannot be further subdivided to form another superkey.
: A superkey formula_21 holds as a candidate key for a relation universe formula_10 if it holds as a superkey for formula_10 and there is no proper subset of formula_21 that also holds as a superkey for formula_10.
; Functional dependency
Functional dependency is the property that a value in a tuple may be derived from another value in that tuple.
: A functional dependency (FD for short) is written as formula_39 for formula_40 finite sets of attribute names.
: A functional dependency formula_39 holds in a relation formula_6 if:
:* formula_43 and
:* formula_44 tuples formula_24, formula_46
: A functional dependency formula_39 holds in a relation universe formula_10 if it holds in all relations in formula_10.
; Trivial functional dependency
: A functional dependency is trivial under a header formula_7 if it holds in all relation universes over formula_7.
: Theorem: An FD formula_39 is trivial under a header formula_7 if and only if formula_54.
; Closure
: Armstrong&#x27;s axioms: The closure of a set of FDs formula_55 under a header formula_7, written as formula_57, is the smallest superset of formula_55 such that:
:* formula_59 (reflexivity)
:* formula_60 (transitivity) and
:* formula_61 (augmentation)
: Theorem: Armstrong&#x27;s axioms are sound and complete; given a header formula_7 and a set formula_55 of FDs that only contain subsets of formula_7, formula_65 if and only if formula_39 holds in all relation universes over formula_7 in which all FDs in formula_55 hold.
; Completion
: The completion of a finite set of attributes formula_69 under a finite set of FDs formula_55, written as formula_71, is the smallest superset of formula_69 such that:
:* formula_73
: The completion of an attribute set can be used to compute if a certain dependency is in the closure of a set of FDs.
: Theorem: Given a set formula_55 of FDs, formula_65 if and only if formula_76.
; Irreducible cover
: An irreducible cover of a set formula_55 of FDs is a set formula_78 of FDs such that:
:* formula_79
:* there exists no formula_80 such that formula_81
:* formula_82 is a singleton set and
:* formula_83.

=== Algorithm to derive candidate keys from functional dependencies ===
 algorithm derive candidate keys from functional dependencies is
 input: a set &quot;S&quot; of FDs that contain only subsets of a header &quot;H&quot;
 output: the set &quot;C&quot; of superkeys that hold as candidate keys in
 all relation universes over &quot;H&quot; in which all FDs in &quot;S&quot; hold
 &quot;C&quot; := ∅ // found candidate keys
 &quot;Q&quot; := { &quot;H&quot; } // superkeys that contain candidate keys
 while &quot;Q&quot; &lt;&gt; ∅ do
 let &quot;K&quot; be some element from &quot;Q&quot;
 &quot;Q&quot; := &quot;Q&quot; – { &quot;K&quot; }
 &quot;minimal&quot; := true
 for each &quot;X-&gt;Y&quot; in &quot;S&quot; do
 &quot;K&#x27; &quot;:= (&quot;K&quot; – &quot;Y&quot;) ∪ &quot;X&quot; // derive new superkey
 if &quot;K&#x27; &quot;⊂ &quot;K&quot; then
 &quot;minimal&quot; := false
 &quot;Q&quot; := &quot;Q&quot; ∪ { &quot;K&#x27; &quot;}
 end if
 end for
 if &quot;minimal&quot; and there is not a subset of &quot;K&quot; in &quot;C&quot; then
 remove all supersets of &quot;K&quot; from &quot;C&quot;
 &quot;C&quot; := &quot;C&quot; ∪ { &quot;K&quot; }
 end if
 end while

== Alternatives ==
Other models include the hierarchical model and network model. Some systems using these older architectures are still in use today in data centers with high data volume needs, or where existing systems are so complex and abstract that it would be cost-prohibitive to migrate to systems employing the relational model. Also of note are newer object-oriented databases. and Datalog.

&quot;Datalog&quot; is a database definition language, which combines a relational view of data, as in the relational model, with a logical view, as in logic programming. Whereas relational databases use a relational calculus or relational algebra, with relational operations, such as &quot;union&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, &quot;set difference&quot; and &quot;cartesian product&quot; to specify queries, Datalog uses logical connectives, such as &quot;if&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;and&quot; and &quot;not&quot; to define relations as part of the database itself.

In contrast with the relational model, which cannot express recursive queries without introducing a least-fixed-point operator, recursive relations can be defined in Datalog, without introducing any new logical connectives or operators.

<text>Rathaus Schöneberg is the city hall for the borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg in Berlin, Germany. From 1949 until 1990 it served as the seat of the state senate of West Berlin and from 1949 until 1991 as the seat of the Governing Mayor.

==History==

The sandstone building was constructed between 1911 and 1914, when it replaced the old town hall of Schöneberg, at that time an independent city () not yet incorporated into Greater Berlin, which took place in 1920. The Nazi authorities had a series of war murals by Franz Eichhorst added to the interior in 1938. In World War II the building was severely damaged by Allied bombing and during the final Battle of Berlin.

After the war the undestroyed &quot;Neues Stadthaus&quot;, former head office of Berlin&#x27;s municipal fire insurance &quot;Feuersozietät&quot;, on Parochialstraße in Mitte, served as intermittent city hall, replacing the ruined Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall, also in East Berlin), the traditional seat of the Berlin government. With the division of Berlin&#x27;s city government and administration in September 1948 the &quot;Neues Stadthaus&quot; was in the Communist &quot;Ostsektor&quot; (eastern sector) and became off limits to West Berlin. As a &quot;temporary&quot; measure the barely repaired Rathaus Schöneberg on Rudolph-Wilde-Platz became the city hall for West Berlin. In 1950 the Freedom Bell (&quot;Freiheitsglocke&quot;), a gift by the United States, was installed in the rebuilt tower.
During the Berlin Blockade, the Uprising of 1953, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Rudolph-Wilde-Platz in front of the building became a gathering place for protest rallies. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the steps of Rathaus Schöneberg were the location where U.S. President John F. Kennedy spoke on 26 June 1963, proclaiming &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;. On the night of his assassination, several thousand Berliners spontaneously gathered at the square, which was officially renamed John-F.-Kennedy-Platz three days later. A large memorial plaque, mounted on a column at the entrance of the building, and the room above the entrance overlooking the square are dedicated to Kennedy and his visit.

There was a large assembly in front of the Rathaus on 10 November 1989, the day after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Prominent people attending were chancellor Helmut Kohl, former chancellor Willy Brandt, and foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.

After reunification, Rathaus Schöneberg reverted to its original purpose of being Schöneberg Borough Town Hall. Upon the 2001 Berlin administrative reform, Rathaus Schöneberg became the town hall for the newly constituted borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.

It was also the permanent home to an exhibition of the life of Willy Brandt (1913–1992), Mayor of West Berlin from 1957 to 1966 and Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany 1969–74. The exhibition was closed as from January 2010; it is planned to open again at another site in the city.

Since 2005, the exhibition called &quot;Wir waren Nachbarn – Biografien jüdischer Zeitzeugen&quot; (English title:&quot;We were Neighbours once – Biographies of Jews in Schöneberg and Tempelhof under the Nazi Regime&quot;) takes place in the exhibition hall of the Rathaus Schöneberg.

<text>Rædwald (, ; &#x27;power in counsel&#x27;), also written as Raedwald or Redwald (), (died c. AD 624) was a king of East Anglia, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom which included the present-day English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He was the son of Tytila of East Anglia and a member of the Wuffingas dynasty (named after his grandfather, Wuffa), who were the first kings of the East Angles. Details about Rædwald&#x27;s reign are scarce, primarily because the Viking invasions of the 9th century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents would have been kept. Rædwald reigned from about 599 until his death around 624, initially under the overlordship of Æthelberht of Kent. In 616, as a result of fighting the Battle of the River Idle and defeating Æthelfrith of Northumbria, he was able to install Edwin, who was acquiescent to his authority, as the new king of Northumbria. During the battle, both Æthelfrith and Rædwald&#x27;s son, Rægenhere, were killed.

From around 616, Rædwald was the most powerful of the English kings south of the Humber estuary. According to Bede, he was the fourth ruler to hold &quot;imperium&quot; over other southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: he was referred to in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, written centuries after his death, as a &quot;bretwalda&quot; (an Old English term meaning &#x27;Britain-ruler&#x27; or &#x27;wide-ruler&#x27;). He was the first king of the East Angles to become a Christian, converting at Æthelberht&#x27;s court some time before 605, while also maintaining a pagan temple. He helped Christianity to survive in East Anglia during the apostasy of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Kent. Historians consider him the most likely occupant of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, although other theories have been advanced. A smaller ship-burial was also discovered in 1998 close to the original Sutton Hoo site, which is thought to have contained the body of his son Rægenhere, who died in battle in 616.

== Sources ==
The kingdom of East Anglia () was a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire Fens. Much less documentary evidence survives from East Anglia than from other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The historian Barbara Yorke argues that East Anglia almost certainly produced a similar range of written materials, but they were destroyed during the Viking conquest in the 9th century.

Rædwald is the first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known, though no details of his life before his accession are known. The earliest and most substantial source for Rædwald is the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;), completed in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede placed Rædwald&#x27;s reign between the advent of the Gregorian mission to Kent in 597 and the marriage and conversion of Edwin of Northumbria during 625–626.

Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, gave some information about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers to guess the dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The &quot;Anglian collection&quot;, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however referred to in the 8th century &quot;Vita&quot; of St Gregory the Great, written by a member of the religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, written by Henry of Huntingdon.

== The context of Rædwald&#x27;s kingdom ==

The Anglo-Saxons, who are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the conquered territories. By the beginning of the 7th century, the southern part of what became England was almost entirely under their control.

During Rædwald&#x27;s youth, the establishment of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert I. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the Humber estuary, repulsed Æthelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although a paucity of sources makes it difficult to know how the Mercian royal line became established.

North of the Humber, the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia possessed rival royal dynasties. Ælla ruled Deira until his death in 588, leaving his daughter Acha, his son Edwin, and another unknown sibling. The Bernician dynasty, allied by kinship to the kingdom of Wessex, gained ascendancy over Deira, forcing Edwin to live in exile in the court of Cadfan ap Iago of Gwynedd. In various wars, Æthelfrith of Bernicia consolidated the Northumbrian state, and in around 604 he was able to bring Deira under his dominion.

== Family ==
Rædwald, which in Old English means &#x27;power in counsel&#x27;, was born around 560–580. The son of Tytila, whom he succeeded, he was the elder brother of Eni. According to Bede, he was descended from Wuffa, the founder of the Wuffingas dynasty: &quot;filius Tytili, cuius pater fuit UUffa&quot; (&#x27;the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa&#x27;).

At some time during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which is typical of the East Saxon dynasty. It has been suggested that Rædwald&#x27;s queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald&#x27;s stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.




For a family tree that includes the descendants of Eni, see Wuffingas.

== Early reign and baptism ==
In 597 in the early years of Rædwald&#x27;s reign Augustine of Canterbury arrived on mission from Rome, leading to the conversion of the bretwalda Æthelberht of Kent as well as Saeberht of Essex, and the establishment of new bishoprics in their kingdoms. 

Bede states that Rædwald also converted to Christianity, presumably at the invitation of Æthelberht who may have been his baptismal sponsor. The date of his conversion is unknown, but it is likely to have been around 604 or later. Since it is claimed that Augustine, who died in about 605, dedicated a church near Ely, it may have swiftly followed Saebert&#x27;s conversion in 604. Rædwald&#x27;s marriage to a member of the royal dynasty of Essex helped form a diplomatic alliance between the neighbouring kingdoms of East Anglia and Essex. His conversion in Kent would have affiliated him with Æthelberht, bringing him directly into the sphere of Kent.

Bede describes Rædwald&#x27;s relationship with Æthelberht in an ambiguous passage which implies that Rædwald retained &quot;ducatus&quot;, or military command of his people, while Æthelberht held &quot;imperium&quot;. This implies that being a &quot;bretwalda&quot; usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that, since Æthelberht is &quot;bretwalda&quot; despite Rædwald&#x27;s control of his own troops. Rædwald did not fully abandon his pagan beliefs which together with the fact that he retained military independence, implies that Æthelberht&#x27;s overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as &quot;Rædwald, king of the East Angles, who while Æthelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people&quot;; if this is Bede&#x27;s intent, then East Anglia firmly was under Æthelberht&#x27;s overlordship.

In East Anglia, Rædwald&#x27;s conversion was not universally accepted by his household or his own queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to the Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one dedicated to pagan gods and the other to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald&#x27;s brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the &quot;regio&quot; of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke argues that Rædwald was not willing to fully embrace Christianity because conversion via Æthelberht would have been acknowledgment of an inferior status to the Kentish king. Rædwald&#x27;s lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.

== Rædwald and Edwin of Northumbria ==
=== Edwin&#x27;s exile ===
Æthelfrith of Northumbria may have married Acha, who was the mother of his son Oswald (born in about 604), according to Bede. Æthelfrith pursued Acha&#x27;s exiled brother Edwin in an attempt to destroy him and ensure that the Bernician rulership of Northumbria would be unchallenged. Edwin found hospitality in the household of Cearl of Mercia and later married Cearl&#x27;s daughter. Edwin&#x27;s nephew Hereric, an exile in the British kingdom of Elmet, was slain there under treacherous circumstances. Edwin eventually sought the protection of Rædwald, where he was received willingly. Rædwald promised to protect him, and Edwin lived with the king amongst his royal companions. When news of Edwin reached Æthelfrith in Northumbria, he sent messengers to Rædwald offering money in return for Edwin&#x27;s death, but Rædwald refused to comply. Æthelfrith sent messengers a second and a third time, offering even greater gifts of silver and promising war if these were not accepted. Rædwald then weakened and promised either to kill Edwin or to hand him over to ambassadors.

When a chance arose for him to escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald&#x27;s court. He was then visited by a stranger who was aware of Rædwald&#x27;s deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, a member of the Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald&#x27;s support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop&#x27;s presence at Rædwald&#x27;s court would throw some light on the king&#x27;s position regarding religion.

Rædwald&#x27;s pagan queen admonished him for acting in a manner dishonourable for a king by betraying his trust for the sake of money and wanting to sell his imperiled friend in exchange for riches. As a result of her admonishment, once Æthelfrith&#x27;s ambassadors had gone, Rædwald resolved on war.

=== The Battle of the River Idle ===

In 616 or 617, Rædwald assembled an army and marched north, accompanied by his son Rægenhere, to confront Æthelfrith. They met on the western boundary of the kingdom of Lindsey, on the east bank of the River Idle. The battle was fierce and was long commemorated in the saying, &#x27;The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen&#x27;. During the fighting, Æthelfrith and Rædwald&#x27;s son Rægenhere were both slain. Edwin then succeeded Æthelfrith as the king of Northumbria, and Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons were subsequently forced into exile.

A separate account of the battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon, stated that Rædwald&#x27;s army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith&#x27;s men cut their way through to him and slew him. After the death of his son, Rædwald furiously breached his lines, killing Æthelfrith amid a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.

D.P. Kirby has argued that the battle was more than a clash between two kings over the treatment of an exiled nobleman but was &quot;part of a protracted struggle to determine the military and political leadership of the Anglian peoples&quot; at that time.

==Rædwald&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot;==

On 24 February 616, the year of the Battle of the River Idle, Æthelberht of Kent died and was succeeded by his pagan son Eadbald. After the death of the Christian Saebert of Essex, his three sons shared the kingdom, returning it to pagan rule, and drove out the Gregorian missionaries led by Mellitus. The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back into the fold. During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to Rædwald. By the time of his death, the mission in Kent had been fully re-established.

Rædwald&#x27;s power became great enough for Bede to recognise him as the successor to the &quot;imperium&quot; of Æthelberht. Bede also called him &quot;Rex Anglorum&quot;, the &#x27;King of the Angles&#x27;, a term that Rædwald&#x27;s contemporaries would have used for their overlord. It is unclear where his power was centred or even how he established his authority over the Angles of eastern England.

By Edwin&#x27;s debt of allegiance to him, Rædwald became the first foreign king to hold direct influence in Northumbria. He would have been instrumental in Edwin&#x27;s secure establishment as king of both Deira and Bernicia.

==The development of Gipeswic==
During the first quarter of the 7th century, the quayside settlement at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under the supervision of Wuffingas . It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.

The excavated grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic, including those found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate. They lacked the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river. One exception was a furnished grave that has been suggested to be that of a visitor from the Rhineland.

==Death==
Rædwald is believed to have died around 624: his death date can be narrowed down to only within a few years. He must have reigned for some time after Æthelberht died, in order for him to have been noted as a &quot;bretwalda&quot;. Barbara Yorke suggests that he died before Edwin converted to Christianity in 627 and also before Paulinus became bishop of Northumbria in 625. His death is recorded twice by Roger of Wendover, in 599 and in 624, in a history that dates from the 13th century but appears to include earlier annals of unknown origin and reliability. Plunkett notes that the earlier date of 599 is now taken as a mistaken reference to the death of Rædwald&#x27;s father, Tytila, and the later date is commonly given for the death of Rædwald.

===Legacy===
It was Rædwald&#x27;s conversion to Christianity rather than his apostasy that was to take hold. He was succeeded by his pagan son Eorpwald although a pagan when he succeeded to the throne, converted to Christianity persuaded by Edwin of Northumbria. However it wasn&#x27;t until Eorpwald&#x27;s brother Sigeberht took the throne that the ruling house of East Anglia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity became permanent.

===Sutton Hoo===

Since the excavation of Mound 1 in 1939 at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, Suffolk there has been speculation that the Rædwald was the person either buried or commemorated in the main chamber.

Rædwald lived at a time when eminent individuals were buried in barrows at the cemetery at Sutton Hoo three still visible large mounds overlooking the upper estuary of the River Deben. In 1939 the largest mound at Sutton Hoo was found to contain a uniquely rich Anglo-Saxon ship-burial in the centre of which was a chamber containing grave goods for a very wealthy man with items pointing to imperial claims such as consular sceptre which may have been a symbol of the office of &quot;bretwalda&quot; and gold and garnet body-equipment which employed a goldsmith at the top level in Europe which could project an image of imperial power.

The symbolism and the wealth displayed point to the death of a person connected with the royal court, with Rupert Bruce-Mitford, first positing the burial as &quot;very likely the monument of the High King or &quot;bretwalda&quot; Rædwald&quot;. Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to Rædwald by subject kings during his period as &quot;bretwalda&quot;. Bruce-Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls and spoons amongst the treasures fits with Bede&#x27;s account of Rædwald&#x27;s conversion: the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance. Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of Rædwald&#x27;s death. 

Although this is a likely explanation it is still controversial, as reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (&quot;It has been argued, more strongly than convincingly, that Rædwald must be the man buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo&quot;) and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for Rædwald is &quot;almost non-existent&quot;. Alternative suggestions as candidates include other East Anglian kings or a prestigious foreign visitor, or a wealthy status-seeker, rather than a king, though Rendlesham, a known residence of the East Anglian kings, is only away.

Swedish cultural influence has been detected at Sutton Hoo: there are strong similarities in both the armour and the burial with Vendel Period finds from Sweden. Bruce-Mitford suggested that the connection is close enough to imply that the Wuffingas dynasty came from that part of Scandinavia. There are also significant differences, and exact parallels with the workmanship and style of the Sutton Hoo artefacts cannot be found elsewhere; as a result the connection is generally regarded as unproven.

If the mound is a cenotaph rather than a grave, this may mean Rædwald could have received a Christian burial with the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion, being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia.

<text>A rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds (usually the exact same phonemes) in the final stressed syllables and any following syllables of two or more words. Most often, this kind of rhyming (&quot;perfect rhyming&quot;) is consciously used for a musical or aesthetic effect in the final position of lines within poems or songs. More broadly, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word &quot;rhyme&quot; has come to be sometimes used as a shorthand term for any brief poem, such as a nursery rhyme or Balliol rhyme.

==Etymology==

The word derives from or , which might be derived from , a Germanic term meaning &quot;series&quot;, or &quot;sequence&quot; attested in Old English (Old English: meaning &quot;enumeration&quot;, series&quot;, or &quot;numeral&quot;) and , ultimately cognate to , ( &quot;number&quot;). Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from , from (, rhythm).&lt;rname=OED&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling &quot;rhyme&quot; (from the original &quot;rime&quot;) was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin . The older spelling &quot;rime&quot; survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of linguistics and phonology for which &quot;rime&quot; or &quot;rhyme&quot; is used to refer to the nucleus and coda of a syllable. Some prefer to spell it &quot;rime&quot; to distinguish it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see syllable rime).

==Function of rhyming words==
Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. Rhyme is a form of art that one can use to communicate to the reader or audience. It also serves as a powerful mnemonic device, facilitating short-term memory. The regular use of tail rhyme helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example, William Shakespeare often used a rhyming couplet to mark off the end of a scene in a play.

==Types of rhyme==
The word &quot;rhyme&quot; can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. Examples are &quot;sight&quot; and &quot;flight&quot;, &quot;deign&quot; and &quot;gain&quot;, &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;sadness&quot;, &quot;love&quot; and &quot;dove&quot;.

===Perfect rhymes===
Perfect rhymes can be classified by the location of the final stressed syllable.

* single, also known as masculine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (&quot;rhyme&quot;, &quot;sublime&quot;)
* double, also known as feminine: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (&quot;picky&quot;, &quot;tricky&quot;)
* dactylic: a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (&quot;amorous&quot;, &quot;glamorous&quot;)

Feminine and dactylic rhymes may also be realized as compound (or mosaic) rhymes (&quot;poet&quot;, &quot;know it&quot;).

===General rhymes===
In the general sense, &quot;general rhyme&quot; can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

* syllabic: a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (&quot;cleaver&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;, or &quot;pitter&quot;, &quot;patter&quot;; the final syllable of the words &quot;bottle&quot; and &quot;fiddle&quot; is , a liquid consonant.)
* imperfect (or near): a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (&quot;wing&quot;, &quot;caring&quot;)
* weak (or unaccented): a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (&quot;hammer&quot;, &quot;carpenter&quot;)
* semirhyme: a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (&quot;bend&quot;, &quot;ending&quot;)
* forced (or oblique): a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (&quot;green&quot;, &quot;fiend&quot;; &quot;one&quot;, &quot;thumb&quot;)
* assonance: matching vowels. (&quot;shake&quot;, &quot;hate&quot;) Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
* consonance: matching consonants. (rabies, robbers)
*half rhyme (or slant rhyme): matching final consonants. (&quot;hand , lend&quot;)
* pararhyme: all consonants match. (&quot;tick&quot;, &quot;tock&quot;)
* alliteration (or head rhyme): matching initial consonants. (ship&quot;, short&quot;)

===Identical rhymes===
Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, &quot;rime riche&quot; in French poetry.

Though homophones and homonyms satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.

If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all. An example of such a &quot;super-rhyme&quot; or &quot;more than perfect rhyme&quot; is the &quot;identical rhyme&quot;, in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;begun&quot;. Punning rhymes, such as &quot;bare&quot; and &quot;bear&quot; are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound very similar or identical, it is called a &quot;holorhyme&quot; (&quot;For I scream/For ice cream&quot;).

In poetics these would be considered &quot;identity&quot;, rather than rhyme.

===Eye rhyme===

Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently. Examples in English are &quot;cough&quot;, &quot;bough&quot;, and &quot;love&quot;, &quot;move&quot;.

Some early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.

===Mind rhyme===

Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to rhyming slang, but it is less generally codified and is &quot;heard&quot; only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, &quot;this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.&quot; If a reader or listener thinks of the word &quot;sweet&quot; instead of &quot;sour,&quot; a mind rhyme has occurred.

===Classification by position===
Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:
*Tail rhyme (also called end rhyme or rime couée) is a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind).
*Internal rhyme occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line, or within a different line.
*Off-centered rhyme is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line. This is sometimes called a misplaced-rhyme scheme or a spoken word rhyme style.
*Holorime, mentioned above, occurs when two entire lines have the same sound.
*Echo rhyme occurs when the same syllable endings are utilized (example: disease/ease). 
*Broken rhyme is a type of enjambement producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line.
*Cross rhyme matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following (or preceding) line.

A rhyme scheme is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.

==History==

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes.

The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese Shi Jing (ca. 10th century BCE). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the Bible. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme, and used rhyme occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem &quot;Cui dono lepidum novum libellum&quot;. The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in &quot;The Wasps&quot; by Aristophanes are noted by a translator.

Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe.

Rhyme is central to classical Arabic poetry tracing back to its pre-Islamic roots. According to some archaic sources, Irish literature introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim. In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. The leonine verse is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.

Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas.

Since dialects vary and languages change over time, lines that rhyme in a given register or era may not rhyme in another, and it may not be clear how one should pronounce the words so that they rhyme. An example is this couplet from Handel&#x27;s Judas Maccabaeus:
:Rejoice, O Judah, and in songs divine
:With cherubim and seraphim harmonious join.

==Rhyme in various languages==
===Arabic===
Rhymes were widely spread in the Arabic language in pre-Islamic times, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas. In addition, the Quran uses a form of rhymed prose named saj&#x27;.

===Celtic languages===
Rhyming in the Celtic languages takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;d&#x27; can rhyme (both being &#x27;voiced plosives&#x27;), as can &#x27;bh&#x27; and &#x27;l&#x27; (which are both &#x27;voiced continuants&#x27;) but &#x27;l&#x27;, a &#x27;voiced continuant&#x27;, cannot rhyme with &#x27;ph&#x27;, a &#x27;voiceless continuant&#x27;. Furthermore, &quot;for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one.&quot; In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song &quot;Bríd Óg Ní Mháille&quot;:
Here the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.

===Chinese===

Besides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, Chinese rhymes often include tone quality (that is, tonal contour) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.

Use of rhyme in Classical Chinese poetry typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.

Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese, such as Middle Chinese.

===English===

Old English poetry is mostly alliterative verse. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is The Rhyming Poem.

As stress is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.

Some words in English, such as &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;silver&quot;, are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming &quot;orange&quot; with combinations of words like &quot;door hinge&quot; or with lesser-known words like &quot;Blorenge&quot; – a hill in Wales – or the surname Gorringe), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a synonym (&quot;orange&quot; could become &quot;amber&quot;, while &quot;silver&quot; could become a combination of &quot;bright and argent&quot;). A skilled orator might be able to tweak the pronunciation of certain words to facilitate a stronger rhyme (for example, pronouncing &quot;orange&quot; as &quot;oringe&quot; to rhyme with &quot;door hinge&quot;).

One view of rhyme in English is from John Milton&#x27;s preface to &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;:
A more tempered view is taken by W. H. Auden in The Dyer&#x27;s Hand:
Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of doggerel.

===French===
In French poetry, unlike in English, it is common to have &quot;identical rhymes&quot;, in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants (&quot;consonnes d&#x27;appui&quot;) as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, &quot;flour&quot; and &quot;flower&quot;, would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones &quot;doigt&quot; (&quot;finger&quot;) and &quot;doit&quot; (&quot;must&quot;) or &quot;point&quot; (&quot;point&quot;) and &quot;point&quot; (&quot;not&quot;) is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories of &quot;rime pauvre&quot; (&quot;poor rhyme&quot;), &quot;rime suffisante&quot; (&quot;sufficient rhyme&quot;), &quot;rime riche&quot; (&quot;rich rhyme&quot;) and &quot;rime richissime&quot; (&quot;very rich rhyme&quot;), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme &quot;tu&quot; with &quot;vu&quot; would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme &quot;pas&quot; with &quot;bras&quot; a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and &quot;tante&quot; with &quot;attente&quot; a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute &quot;e&quot; in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. 

The most important &quot;silent&quot; letter is the &quot;mute e&quot;. In spoken French today, final &quot;e&quot; is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. &quot;Joue&quot; could rhyme with &quot;boue&quot;, but not with &quot;trou&quot;. Rhyming words ending with this silent &quot;e&quot; were said to make up a &quot;double rhyme&quot;, while words not ending with this silent &quot;e&quot; made up a &quot;single rhyme&quot;. It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate masculine and feminine couplets.

The now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that &quot;pont&quot; rhymed with &quot;vont&quot; but not with &quot;long&quot;. (The voicing of consonants was lost in liaison and thus ignored, so &quot;pont&quot; also rhymed with &quot;rond&quot;.) There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:
* The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants is lost in the final position. Therefore, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot; (both pronounced /t/) rhyme. So too with &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;q&quot; (all /k/), and &quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; (all /z/). Rhymes ending in /z/ are called &quot;plural rhymes&quot; because most plural nouns and adjectives end in &quot;s&quot; or &quot;x&quot;.
* Nasal vowels rhyme whether spelled with &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; (e.g., &quot;essaim&quot; rhymes with &quot;sain&quot;).
* If a word ends in a stop consonant followed by &quot;s&quot;, the stop is silent and ignored for purposes of rhyming (e.g., &quot;temps&quot; rhymes with &quot;dents&quot;). In the archaic orthography some of these silent stops are omitted from the spelling as well (e.g., &quot;dens&quot; for &quot;dents&quot;).

====Holorime====
&quot;Holorime&quot; is an extreme example of &quot;rime richissime&quot; spanning an entire verse. Alphonse Allais was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from Marc Monnier:
===German===
Because German phonology features a wide array of vowel sounds, certain imperfect rhymes are widely admitted in German poetry. These include rhyming &quot;e&quot; with &quot;ä&quot; and &quot;ö&quot;, rhyming &quot;i&quot; with &quot;ü&quot;, rhyming &quot;ei&quot; with &quot;eu&quot; (spelled &quot;äu&quot; in some words) and rhyming a long vowel with its short counterpart.

Some examples of imperfect rhymes (all from Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;An die Freude&quot;):
* Deine Zauber binden wieder / Alle Menschen werden Brüder
* Freude trinken alle Wesen / Alle Guten, alle Bösen

===Greek===
:&quot;See Homoioteleuton&quot;

Ancient Greek poetry is strictly metrical. Rhyme is used, if at all, only as an occasional rhetorical flourish.

The first Greek to write rhyming poetry was the fourteenth-century Cretan Stephanos Sachlikis. Rhyme is now a common fixture of Greek poetry.

===Hebrew===
Ancient Hebrew rarely employed rhyme, e.g., in Exodus 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / &#x27;axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the Jewish liturgical poetry written in the Byzantine empire era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of piyyuts that have been discovered in the Cairo Geniza. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the Syriac Christianity (written in Aramaic), and through this mediation introduced into Latin poetry and then into all other languages of Europe.

===Latin===
In Latin rhetoric and poetry homeoteleuton and alliteration were frequently used devices.

Tail rhyme was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by Cicero:
But tail rhyme was not used as a prominent structural feature of Latin poetry until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early Middle Ages. This is the Latin hymn &quot;Dies Irae&quot;:
Medieval poetry may mix Latin and vernacular languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed macaronic.

===Polish=== 
In Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although it was sometimes imitated from Latin. Homer&#x27;s, Virgil&#x27;s and even Milton&#x27;s epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators. Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others ottava rima (ABABABCC) and sonnet (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).
The metre of Mickiewicz&#x27;s sonnet is the Polish alexandrine (tridecasyllable, in Polish &quot;trzynastozgłoskowiec&quot;): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].

===Portuguese===
Portuguese classifies rhymes in the following manner:

*rima pobre (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same grammatical category (e.g., noun with noun) or between very common endings (&quot;-ão&quot;, &quot;-ar&quot;);
*rima rica (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
*rima preciosa (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different morphology, for example &quot;estrela&quot; (star) with &quot;vê-la&quot; (to see her);
*rima esdrúxula (odd rhyme): rhyme between proparoxytonic words (example: &quot;ânimo&quot;, &quot;animus&quot;, and &quot;unânimo&quot;, &quot;unanimous&quot;).

===Russian===
Rhyme was introduced into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Two words ending in an accented vowel are only considered to rhyme if they share a preceding consonant. Vowel pairs rhyme—even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. As in French, formal poetry traditionally alternates between masculine and feminine rhymes.

Early 18th-century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.

The rules for rhyming used by Alexander Pushkin and subsequent Russian poets owe much to French verse. The basic rules, as laid out by Vladimir Nabokov in his &quot;Notes on Prosody&quot;, are as follows:

* As in French, rhymes are divided into masculine and feminine according to whether the word is stressed on the last or second-to-last syllable. Two different masculine rhymes or two feminine rhymes cannot normally occur in succeeding lines. Rhyme schemes involving words stressed on the third-to-last syllable or earlier in the word are found in some poems but are relatively rare, especially in longer poetry.
* As in French, two words with the same pronunciation but different meanings can be rhymed, e.g., &quot;супру́га&quot; (&quot;wife&quot;) and &quot;супру́га &quot; (&quot;husband&#x27;s&quot;).
* Words ending in a stressed vowel (e.g., &quot;вода́&quot;) can only rhyme with other words which share the consonant preceding the vowel (e.g., &quot;когда́&quot;).
** Words ending in a stressed vowel preceded by another vowel, as well as words ending in a stressed vowel preceded by /j/, can all be rhymed with each other: &quot;моя́&quot;, &quot;тая́&quot; and &quot;чья&quot; all rhyme.
** According to Nabokov, a special dispensation is made for &quot;любви́&quot;, an inflected form of &quot;любо́вь&quot; (&quot;love&quot;), allowing it to be rhymed with all words ending in a vowel followed by /ˈi/ (e.g., &quot;твои́&quot;). Some poets, including Pushkin, go further and rhyme &quot;любви́&quot; with any word ending in /ˈi/.
* Unstressed &quot;а&quot; and &quot;о&quot; (e.g., &quot;жа́ло&quot; and &quot;Ура́ла&quot;) can be rhymed with each other. For most contemporary Russian speakers these letters when unstressed are pronounced identically as /ə/. See also &quot;vowel reduction in Russian&quot; and &quot;akanye&quot;.
* In unstressed syllables, /ɨ/, /ɨj/ and /əj/ are considered more or less equivalent: thus &quot;за́лы&quot;, &quot;ма́лый&quot; and &quot;а́лой&quot; can all be rhymed. Nabokov describes rhyming /ɨ/ with /ɨj/ as &quot;not inelegant&quot; and rhyming /ɨj/ with /əj/ as &quot;absolutely correct&quot;.

===Sanskrit===
Patterns of rich rhyme (&quot;prāsa&quot;) play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the &quot;pada&quot; (metrical foot): &quot;ādiprāsa&quot; (first syllable), &quot;dvitīyākṣara prāsa&quot; (second syllable), &quot;antyaprāsa&quot; (final syllable) etc.

===Spanish===
Spanish mainly differentiates two types of rhymes:

* rima consonante (consonant rhyme): Those words of the same stress with identical endings, matching consonants and vowels, for example robo (robbery) and lobo (wolf), legua (league) and yegua (mare) or canción (song) and montón (pile).
* rima asonante (assonant rhyme): those words of the same stress that only the vowels identical at the end, for example zapato (shoe) and brazo (arm), ave (bird) and ame (would love), reloj (watch) and feroz (fierce), puerta (door) and ruleta (roulette).

Spanish rhyme is also classified by stress type since different types cannot rhyme with each other:

* rima llana (plane rhyme): the rhyming words are unaccented, for example cama (bed) and rama (branch), pereza (laziness) and moneda (coin) or espejo (mirror) and pienso (I think).
* rima grave (oxytonic rhyme): The rhyming words are accented on the last syllable, for example: cartón (cardboard) and limón (lemon), jerez (sherry) and revés (backwards). Grave words that end in a single same vowel can be asonante rhymes for example compró (he/she bought) and llevó (he/she carried), tendré (I will have) and pediré (I will ask), perdí (I lost) and medí (I measured). 
* rima esdrújula (odd rhyme): The rhyming words are accented on the antepenult. For example, mácula (stain) and báscula (scale), estrépito (noise) and intrépido (fearless), rápido (fast) and pálido (pallid).

===Tamil===
There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called &quot;etukai&quot; (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.

The other rhyme and related patterns are called &quot;mōnai&quot; (alliteration), &quot;toṭai&quot; (epiphora) and &quot;iraṭṭai kiḷavi&quot; (parallelism).

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as &quot;veṇpā&quot;, have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar.

===Urdu===
Rhymes are called Qafiya in Urdu. Qafiya has a very important place in Urdu Poetry. Couplet of an Urdu Ghazal is incomplete without a Qafiya. Following is an example of an Urdu couplet from Faiz Ahmed Faiz&#x27;s ghazal

dono jahaan teri mohabbat mein &quot;haar&quot; ke,&lt;br&gt;
wo jaa rahaa hai koi shab e ghum &quot;guzaar&quot; ke

&quot;haar&quot; and &quot;guzaar&quot; are qafiyas in this couplet because of rhyming.

===Vietnamese===
Rhymes are used in Vietnamese to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

Nghèo như con mèo
&lt;br&gt;/ŋɛu ɲɯ kɔn mɛu/ 
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Poor as a cat&quot;

Compare the above Vietnamese example, which is a &quot;rhyming&quot; simile, to the English phrase &quot;(as) poor as a church mouse&quot;, which is only a &quot;semantic&quot; simile.

<text>Rhythm (from Greek , &quot;rhythmos&quot;, &quot;any regular recurring motion, symmetry&quot;) generally means a &quot;movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions&quot;. This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines rhythm as &quot;The measured flow of words or phrases in verse, forming various patterns of sound as determined by the relation of long and short or stressed and unstressed syllables in a metrical foot or line; an instance of this&quot;.

Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats:
In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry. In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style. Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as &quot;timed movement through space&quot; and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry. For example, architects often speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the façade. In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, Christopher Hasty, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester,Guerino Mazzola and Steffen Krebber.

==Anthropology==
In his television series &quot;How Music Works&quot;, Howard Goodall presents theories that human rhythm recalls the regularity with which we walk and the heartbeat. Other research suggests that it does not relate to the heartbeat directly, but rather the speed of emotional affect, which also influences heartbeat. Yet other researchers suggest that since certain features of human music are widespread, it is &quot;reasonable to suspect that beat-based rhythmic processing has ancient evolutionary roots&quot;. Justin London writes that musical metre &quot;involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time&quot;. The &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;abstraction&quot; of rhythmic measure is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into &quot;tick-tock-tick-tock&quot;.

Joseph Jordania recently suggested that the sense of rhythm was developed in the early stages of hominid evolution by the forces of natural selection. Plenty of animals walk rhythmically and hear the sounds of the heartbeat in the womb, but only humans have the ability to be engaged (entrained) in rhythmically coordinated vocalizations and other activities. According to Jordania, development of the sense of rhythm was central for the achievement of the specific neurological state of the battle trance, crucial for the development of the effective defense system of early hominids. Rhythmic war cry, rhythmic drumming by shamans, rhythmic drilling of the soldiers and contemporary professional combat forces listening to the heavy rhythmic rock music all use the ability of rhythm to unite human individuals into a shared collective identity where group members put the interests of the group above their individual interests and safety.

Some types of parrots can know rhythm. Neurologist Oliver Sacks states that chimpanzees and other animals show no similar appreciation of rhythm yet posits that human affinity for rhythm is fundamental, so that a person&#x27;s sense of rhythm cannot be lost (e.g. by stroke). &quot;There is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap, peck, or move in synchrony with an auditory beat&quot;, Sacks write, &quot;No doubt many pet lovers will dispute this notion, and indeed many animals, from the Lipizzaner horses of the Spanish Riding School of Vienna to performing circus animals appear to &#x27;dance&#x27; to music. It is not clear whether they are doing so or are responding to subtle visual or tactile cues from the humans around them.&quot; Human rhythmic arts are possibly to some extent rooted in courtship ritual.

The establishment of a basic beat requires the perception of a regular sequence of distinct short-duration pulses and, as a subjective perception of loudness is relative to background noise levels, a pulse must decay to silence before the next occurs if it is to be really distinct. For this reason, the fast-transient sounds of percussion instruments lend themselves to the definition of rhythm. Musical cultures that rely upon such instruments may develop multi-layered polyrhythm and simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature, called polymeter. Such are the cross-rhythms of Sub-Saharan Africa and the interlocking &quot;kotekan&quot; rhythms of the gamelan.

==Terminology==

===Pulse, beat and measure===


Most music, dance and oral poetry establishes and maintains an underlying &quot;metric level&quot;, a basic unit of time that may be audible or implied, the pulse or &quot;tactus&quot; of the mensural level, or &quot;beat level&quot;, sometimes simply called the beat. This consists of a (repeating) series of identical yet distinct periodic short-duration stimuli perceived as points in time. The &quot;beat&quot; pulse is not necessarily the fastest or the slowest component of the rhythm but the one that is perceived as fundamental: it has a tempo to which listeners entrain as they tap their foot or dance to a piece of music. It is currently most often designated as a crotchet or quarter note in western notation (see time signature). Faster levels are &quot;division levels&quot;, and slower levels are &quot;multiple levels&quot;. Maury Yeston clarified &quot;Rhythms of recurrence&quot; arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups. &quot;Once a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present&quot;.

===Unit and gesture===

A durational pattern that synchronises with a pulse or pulses on the underlying metric level may be called a &quot;rhythmic unit&quot;. These may be classified as:
*Metric – even patterns, such as steady eighth notes or pulses;
*Intrametric – confirming patterns, such as dotted eighth-sixteenth note and swing patterns;
*Contrametric – non-confirming, or syncopated patterns; and
*Extrametric – irregular patterns, such as tuplets.

A rhythmic gesture is any durational pattern that, in contrast to the rhythmic unit, does not occupy a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level. It may be described according to its beginning and ending or by the rhythmic units it contains. Rhythms that begin on a strong pulse are &quot;thetic&quot;, those beginning on a weak pulse are &quot;anacrustic&quot; and those beginning after a rest or tied-over note are called &quot;initial rest&quot;. Endings on a strong pulse are &quot;strong&quot;, on a weak pulse, &quot;weak&quot; and those that end on a strong or weak upbeat are &quot;upbeat&quot;.

===Alternation and repetition===
Rhythm is marked by the regulated succession of opposite elements: the dynamics of the strong and weak beat, the played beat and the inaudible but implied rest beat, or the long and short note. As well as perceiving rhythm humans must be able to anticipate it. This depends on repetition of a pattern that is short enough to memorize.

The alternation of the strong and weak beat is fundamental to the ancient language of poetry, dance and music. The common poetic term &quot;foot&quot; refers, as in dance, to the lifting and tapping of the foot in time. In a similar way musicians speak of an upbeat and a downbeat and of the &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; beat. These contrasts naturally facilitate a dual hierarchy of rhythm and depend on repeating patterns of duration, accent and rest forming a &quot;pulse-group&quot; that corresponds to the poetic foot. Normally such pulse-groups are defined by taking the most accented beat as the first and counting the pulses until the next accent. A rhythm that accents another beat and de-emphasises the downbeat as established or assumed from the melody or from a preceding rhythm is called syncopated rhythm.

Normally, even the most complex of meters may be broken down into a chain of duple and triple pulses either by addition or division. According to Pierre Boulez, beat structures beyond four, in western music, are &quot;simply not natural&quot;.

===Tempo and duration===
The tempo of the piece is the speed or frequency of the &quot;tactus&quot;, a measure of how quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in &#x27;beats per minute&#x27; (bpm): 60 bpm means a speed of one beat per second, a frequency of 1 Hz. A rhythmic unit is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a pulse or several pulses. The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.

Musical sound may be analyzed on five different time scales, which Moravscik has arranged in order of increasing duration.
*Supershort: a single cycle of an audible wave, approximately – second (30–10,000 Hz or more than 1,800 bpm). These, though rhythmic in nature, are not perceived as separate events but as continuous musical pitch.
*Short: of the order of one second (1 Hz, 60 bpm, 10–100,000 audio cycles). Musical tempo is generally specified in the range 40 to 240 beats per minute. A continuous pulse cannot be perceived as a musical beat if it is faster than 8–10 per second (8–10 Hz, 480–600 bpm) or slower than 1 per 1.5–2 seconds (0.6–0.5 Hz, 40–30 bpm). Too fast a beat becomes a drone, too slow a succession of sounds seems unconnected. This time frame roughly corresponds to the human heart rate and to the duration of a single step, syllable or rhythmic gesture.
*Medium: ≥ few seconds, this median durational level &quot;defines rhythm in music&quot; as it allows the definition of a rhythmic unit, the arrangement of an entire sequence of accented, unaccented and silent or &quot;rest&quot; pulses into the cells of a &quot;measure&quot; that may give rise to the &quot;briefest intelligible and self-existent musical unit&quot;, a &quot;motif&quot; or &quot;figure&quot;. This may be further organized, by repetition and variation, into a definite &quot;phrase&quot; that may characterise an entire genre of music, dance or poetry and that may be regarded as the fundamental formal unit of music.
*Long: ≥ many seconds or a minute, corresponding to a durational unit that &quot;consists of musical phrases&quot;—which may make up a melody, a formal section, a poetic stanza or a characteristic sequence of dance moves and steps. Thus the temporal regularity of musical organisation includes the most elementary levels of musical form.
*Very long: ≥ minutes or many hours, musical compositions or subdivisions of compositions.

Curtis Roads takes a wider view by distinguishing nine-time scales, this time in order of decreasing duration. The first two, the infinite and the supra musical, encompass natural periodicities of months, years, decades, centuries, and greater, while the last three, the sample and subsample, which take account of digital and electronic rates &quot;too brief to be properly recorded or perceived&quot;, measured in millionths of seconds (microseconds), and finally the infinitesimal or infinitely brief, are again in the extra-musical domain. Roads&#x27; Macro level, encompassing &quot;overall musical architecture or form&quot; roughly corresponds to Moravcsik&#x27;s &quot;very long&quot; division while his Meso level, the level of &quot;divisions of form&quot; including movements, sections, phrases taking seconds or minutes, is likewise similar to Moravcsik&#x27;s &quot;long&quot; category. Roads&#x27; Sound object: &quot;a basic unit of musical structure&quot; and a generalization of note (Xenakis&#x27; mini structural time scale); fraction of a second to several seconds, and his Microsound (see granular synthesis) down to the threshold of audible perception; thousandths to millionths of seconds, are similarly comparable to Moravcsik&#x27;s &quot;short&quot; and &quot;supershort&quot; levels of duration.

===Rhythm–tempo interaction===

One difficulty in defining rhythm is the dependence of its perception on tempo, and, conversely, the dependence of tempo perception on rhythm. Furthermore, the rhythm–tempo interaction is context dependent, as explained by Andranik Tangian using an example of the leading rhythm of &quot;Promenade&quot; from Moussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;:(
This rhythm is perceived as it is rather than as the first three events repeated at a double tempo (denoted as R012 = repeat from 0, one time, twice faster):

However, the motive with this rhythm in the Moussorgsky&#x27;s piece

is rather perceived as a repeat
This context-dependent perception of rhythm is explained by the principle of correlative perception, according to which data are perceived in the simplest way. From the viewpoint of Kolmogorov&#x27;s complexity theory, this means such a representation of the data that minimizes the amount of memory.

The example considered suggests two alternative representations of the same rhythm: as it is, and as the rhythm-tempo interaction – a two-level representation in terms of a generative rhythmic pattern and a &quot;tempo curve&quot;. Table 1 displays these possibilities both with and without pitch, assuming that one duration requires one byte of information, one byte is needed for the pitch of one tone, and invoking the repeat algorithm with its parameters R012 takes four bytes. As shown in the bottom row of the table, the rhythm without pitch requires fewer bytes if it is &quot;perceived&quot; as it is, without repetitions and tempo leaps. On the contrary, its melodic version requires fewer bytes if the rhythm is &quot;perceived&quot; as being repeated at a double tempo.
Thus, the loop of interdependence of rhythm and tempo is overcome due to the simplicity criterion, which &quot;optimally&quot; distributes the complexity of perception between rhythm and tempo. In the above example, the repetition is recognized because of additional repetition of the melodic contour, which results in a certain redundancy of the musical structure, making the recognition of the rhythmic pattern &quot;robust&quot; under tempo deviations. Generally speaking, the more redundant the &quot;musical support&quot; of a rhythmic pattern, the better its recognizability under augmentations and diminutions, that is, its distortions are perceived as tempo variations rather than rhythmic changes:

===Metric structure===


The study of rhythm, stress, and pitch in speech is called prosody (see also: prosody (music)): it is a topic in linguistics and poetics, where it means the number of lines in a verse, the number of syllables in each line and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented. Music inherited the term &quot;meter or metre&quot; from the terminology of poetry.)

The metric structure of music includes meter, tempo and all other rhythmic aspects that produce temporal regularity against which the foreground details or durational patterns of the music are projected. The terminology of western music is notoriously imprecise in this area. MacPherson preferred to speak of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;rhythmic shape&quot;, Imogen Holst of &quot;measured rhythm&quot;.

Dance music has instantly recognizable patterns of beats built upon a characteristic tempo and measure. The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing defines the tango, for example, as to be danced in time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step forwards or backwards, lasting for one beat, is called a &quot;slow&quot;, so that a full &quot;right–left&quot; step is equal to one measure. (&quot;See Rhythm and dance&quot;.)

The general classifications of &quot;metrical rhythm&quot;, &quot;measured rhythm&quot;, and &quot;free rhythm&quot; may be distinguished. Metrical or divisive rhythm, by far the most common in Western music calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of the beat. Normal accents re-occur regularly providing systematical grouping (measures). Measured rhythm (additive rhythm) also calculates each time value as a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but the accents do not recur regularly within the cycle. Free rhythm is where there is neither, such as in Christian chant, which has a basic pulse but a freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse. &quot;See Free time (music)&quot;.

Finally some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as Honkyoku repertoire for shakuhachi, may be considered &quot;ametric&quot;. &quot;Senza misura&quot; is an Italian musical term for &quot;without meter&quot;, meaning to play without a beat, using time to measure how long it will take to play the bar.

==Composite rhythm==

A composite rhythm is the durations and patterns (rhythm) produced by amalgamating all sounding parts of a musical texture. In music of the common practice period, the composite rhythm usually confirms the meter, often in metric or even-note patterns identical to the pulse on a specific metric level. White defines &quot;composite rhythm&quot; as, &quot;the resultant overall rhythmic articulation among all the voices of a contrapuntal texture&quot;. This concept was concurrently defined as &quot;attack point rhythm&quot; by Maury Yeston in 1976 as &quot;the extreme rhythmic foreground of a composition – the absolute surface of articulated movement&quot;.

== Counter rhythm ==
From 1927 and forward the recognized definition of &quot;Counter Rhythm&quot; is &quot;A subordinate rhythm acting as a counterbalance to the main rhythm&quot; (OED). Counter Rhythm is not a common word or phrase in the English Language, appearing approximately 0.01 times per million words in modern written English. Counter Rhythm has been on a steady decrease in usage since its conception, with the exception of a spike in usage in the 1970s. Previous definitions that have been phased out include, &quot;The musical counter-rhythms which Marlowe introduced&quot; and &quot;Splashes of counter-rhythms, flashing tremolos&quot; (OED).  

===African music===

In the Griot tradition of Africa everything related to music has been passed on orally. Babatunde Olatunji (1927–2003) developed a simple series of spoken sounds for teaching the rhythms of the hand-drum, using six vocal sounds, &quot;Goon, Doon, Go, Do, Pa, Ta&quot;, for three basic sounds on the drum, each played with either the left or the right hand. The debate about the appropriateness of staff notation for African music is a subject of particular interest to outsiders while African scholars from Kyagambiddwa to Kongo have, for the most part, accepted the conventions and limitations of staff notation, and produced transcriptions to inform and enable discussion and debate.

John Miller has argued that West African music is based on the tension between rhythms, polyrhythms created by the simultaneous sounding of two or more different rhythms, generally one dominant rhythm interacting with one or more independent competing rhythms. These often oppose or complement each other and the dominant rhythm. Moral values underpin a musical system based on repetition of relatively simple patterns that meet at distant cross-rhythmic intervals and on call-and-response form. Collective utterances such as proverbs or lineages appear either in phrases translated into &quot;drum talk&quot; or in the words of songs. People expect musicians to stimulate participation by reacting to people dancing. Appreciation of musicians is related to the effectiveness of their upholding community values.

===Indian music===

Indian music has also been passed on orally. Tabla players would learn to speak complex rhythm patterns and phrases before attempting to play them. Sheila Chandra, an English pop singer of Indian descent, made performances based on her singing these patterns. In Indian classical music, the Tala of a composition is the rhythmic pattern over which the whole piece is structured.

===Western music===
In the 20th century, composers like Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich wrote more rhythmically complex music using odd meters, and techniques such as phasing and additive rhythm. At the same time, modernists such as Olivier Messiaen and his pupils used increased complexity to disrupt the sense of a regular beat, leading eventually to the widespread use of irrational rhythms in New Complexity. This use may be explained by a comment of John Cage&#x27;s where he notes that regular rhythms cause sounds to be heard as a group rather than individually; the irregular rhythms highlight the rapidly changing pitch relationships that would otherwise be subsumed into irrelevant rhythmic groupings. La Monte Young also wrote music in which the sense of a regular beat is absent because the music consists only of long sustained tones (drones). In the 1930s, Henry Cowell wrote music involving multiple simultaneous periodic rhythms and collaborated with Leon Theremin to invent the rhythmicon, the first electronic rhythm machine, in order to perform them. Similarly, Conlon Nancarrow wrote for the player piano.

==Linguistics==

In linguistics, rhythm or isochrony is one of the three aspects of prosody, along with stress and intonation. Languages can be categorized according to whether they are syllable-timed, mora-timed, or stress-timed. Speakers of syllable-timed languages such as Spanish and Cantonese put roughly equal time on each syllable; in contrast, speakers of stressed-timed languages such as English and Mandarin Chinese put roughly equal time lags between stressed syllables, with the timing of the unstressed syllables in between them being adjusted to accommodate the stress timing.

Narmour describes three categories of prosodic rules that create rhythmic successions that are additive (same duration repeated), cumulative (short-long), or countercumulative (long-short). Cumulation is associated with closure or relaxation, countercumulation with openness or tension, while additive rhythms are open-ended and repetitive. Richard Middleton points out this method cannot account for syncopation and suggests the concept of transformation.

<text>Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement. It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults.

Riboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains.

In its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria.

==Definition==
Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5&#x27;-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins.

In its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide.

==Functions==
Riboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

===Redox reactions===
Redox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione.

===Micronutrient metabolism===
Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5&#x27;-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine.

Riboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia.

==Synthesis==
===Biosynthesis===
Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate while the latter is transformed in a series of reactions that lead to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction .
In the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence.
Conversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially.

===Industrial synthesis===

The industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as &quot;Ashbya gossypii&quot;, &quot;Candida famata&quot; and &quot;Candida flaveri&quot;, as well as the bacteria &quot;Corynebacterium ammoniagenes&quot; and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes.

In the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is &quot;Micrococcus luteus&quot; (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid.

===Laboratory synthesis===
The first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn&#x27;s group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step:

==Uses==
===Treatment of corneal thinning===
Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light.

===Migraine prevention===
In its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400 mg) is &quot;probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,&quot; a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400 mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended.

===Food coloring===
Riboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive.

==Dietary recommendations==
The National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3–0.4 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6 mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0 mg/day. For children aged 1–14 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL.

===Safety===
In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400 mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3–12 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported.

===Labeling===
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

==Sources==
The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched.

The white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5&#x27;-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows&#x27; milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations.

===Fortification===
Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5&#x27;-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75 mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0 mg/kg for &quot;maida&quot; (white) and &quot;atta&quot; (whole wheat) flour.

==Absorption, metabolism, excretion==
More than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin.

Absorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally.

Riboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation.

When excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome.

==Deficiency==
===Prevalence===
Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74 mg/day and men 2.44 mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin.

===Signs and symptoms===
Riboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities.

===Risk factors===
People at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency.

===Causes===
Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency.

There are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving.

Other inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure.

===Diagnosis and assessment===
The assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs.

Indicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The &quot;erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient&quot; (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive &quot;erythrocyte flavin method&quot;, values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5 mg to 1.1 mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1 mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5 mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection.

==History==
The name &quot;riboflavin&quot; comes from &quot;ribose&quot; (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and &quot;flavin&quot;, the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin &quot;flavus&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows&#x27; milk whey, which he named &quot;lactochrome&quot;, that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light.

In the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble &quot;vitamine&quot; A and water-soluble &quot;vitamine&quot; B. (The &quot;e&quot; was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called &quot;pellagra sine pellagra&quot; (pellagra without pellagra).

In 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn&#x27;s group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on &quot;riboflavin&quot; as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin.

Circa 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as &quot;Vitamin G&quot;. In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped.

<text>The Rijksmuseum () is the national museum of the Netherlands dedicated to Dutch arts and history and is located in Amsterdam. The museum is located at the Museum Square in the borough of Amsterdam South, close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw.

The Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague on 19 November 1798 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis. The current main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1885. On 13 April 2013, after a ten-year renovation which cost €375 million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. In 2013 and 2014, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with record numbers of 2.2 million and 2.47 million visitors. It is also the largest art museum in the country.

The museum has on display 8,000 objects of art and history, from their total collection of 1 million objects from the years 1200–2000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer. The museum also has a small Asian collection, which is on display in the Asian pavilion.

==History==
The collection of the Rijksmuseum was built over a period of 200 years and did not originate from a royal collection incorporated into a national museum. Its origins were modest, with its collection fitting into five rooms at the Huis ten Bosch palace in The Hague. Although the seventeenth century was beginning to be recognized as the key period in Dutch art, the museum did not then hold paintings by Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Jan Steen, Johannes Vermeer, or Jacob van Ruisdael. The collection was built up by purchase and donation. Napoleon had carried off the stadholder&#x27;s collection to Paris; the paintings were returned to The Netherlands in 1815 but housed in the Mauritshuis in The Hague rather than the Rijksmuseum. With the founding of the Rijksmuseum in 1885, holdings from other entities were brought together to establish the Rijksmuseum&#x27;s major collections.

===18th century===
In 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed; its Minister of Finance Isaac Gogel argued that a national museum, following the French example of The Louvre, would serve the national interest. On 19 November 1798, the government decided to found the museum.

===19th century===
On 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery (Dutch: &quot;Nationale Kunst-Galerij&quot;), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch stadtholders. 
In 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within The Hague to the Prince William V Gallery, on the Buitenhof. In 1806, the Kingdom of Holland was established by Napoleon Bonaparte. On the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to Amsterdam in 1808. Paintings owned by that city, such as &quot;The Night Watch&quot; by Rembrandt, became part of the collection. In 1809, the museum opened in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.

In 1817, the museum moved to the Trippenhuis. The Trippenhuis turned out to be unsuitable as a museum. In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the Mauritshuis in The Hague and in 1838, the 19th-century paintings &quot;of living masters&quot; were moved to King Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s former summer palace Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.

In 1863, there was a design contest for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. Pierre Cuypers also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place.

In 1876, a new contest was held and this time Pierre Cuypers won. The design was a combination of gothic and renaissance elements. The construction began on 1 October 1876. On both the inside and the outside, the building was richly decorated with references to Dutch art history. Another contest was held for these decorations. The winners were B. van Hove and for the sculptures, for the tile panels and painting and W.F. Dixon for the stained glass. The museum was opened at its new location on 13 July 1885.{{dead link|date=January 2016}}

In 1890, a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum. As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, the building offers an overview of the history of Dutch architecture and has come to be known informally as the &#x27;fragment building&#x27;. It is also known as the &#x27;south wing&#x27; and is currently (in 2013) branded the &quot;Philips Wing&quot;.

===20th century===
In 1906, the hall for &quot;The Night Watch&quot; was rebuilt. In the interior more changes were made between the 1920s and 1950s – most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995–1996 and 2000.

A renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the &#x27;fragment building&#x27; or &#x27;Philips Wing&#x27;, was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.

===21st century===
In December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation. During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the &#x27;fragment building&#x27;, including Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;The Night Watch&quot; and other 17th-century masterpieces.

The restoration and renovation of the Rijksmuseum are based on a design by Spanish architects Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz. Many of the old interior decorations were restored and the floors in the courtyards were removed. The renovation would have initially taken five years, but was delayed and eventually took almost ten years to complete. The renovation cost €375 million.

The reconstruction of the building was completed on 16 July 2012. In March 2013, the museum&#x27;s main pieces of art were moved back from the &#x27;fragment building&#x27; (Philips Wing) to the main building. &quot;The Night Watch&quot; returned to the Night Watch Room, at the end of the Hall of Fame. On 13 April 2013, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. On 1 November 2014, the Philips Wing reopened with the exhibition &quot;Modern Times: Photography in the 20th Century&quot;.

== Building ==

The building of the Rijksmuseum was designed by Pierre Cuypers and opened in 1885. It consists of two squares with an atrium in each centre. In the central axis is a tunnel with the entrances at ground level and the Gallery of Honour at the first floor. The building also contains a library. The fragment building, branded Philips wing, contains building fragments that show the history of architecture in the Netherlands. The Rijksmuseum is a &quot;rijksmonument&quot; (national heritage site) since 1970 and was listed in the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites in 1990. The Asian pavilion was designed by Cruz y Ortiz and opened in 2013.

According to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum&#x27;s renovation, &quot;Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture&quot;. With the Rijks, &quot;there’s no cut between old and new; we’ve tried to merge it. We did this by looking for materials that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture.&quot;

==Collection==
{{See also|120 Paintings from the Rijksmuseum|List of painters in the collection of the Rijksmuseum}}

The collection of the Rijksmuseum consists of 1 million objects and is dedicated to arts, crafts, and history from the years 1200 to 2000. Around 8,000 objects are currently on display in the museum.

The collection contains more than 2,000 paintings from the Dutch Golden Age by notable painters such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Rembrandt&#x27;s pupils.

The museum also has a small Asian collection which is on display in the Asian pavilion.

Some of the more unusual items in the collection include the royal crest from the stern of {{HMS|Royal Charles|1660|6}} which was captured in the Raid on the Medway, the Hartog plate and the FK35 &quot;Bantam&quot; biplane.

In 2012, the museum made some 125,000 high-resolution images available for download via its Rijksstudio webplatform, with plans to add another 40,000 images per year until the entire collection of one million works is available, according to Taco Dibbits, director of collections. As of January 2021, the Rijksstudio hosts 700,000 works, available under a Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, essentially copyright-free and royalty-free.

===Rembrandt===
in 2019, to mark the 350th anniversary of the artist&#x27;s death, the museum mounted an exhibition of all the works by Rembrandt in its collection. Consisting of 22 paintings, 60 drawings and over 300 prints, this was the first time they had all been exhibited together. Principal features were the marriage portraits of Marten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit along with the presentation of the &quot;Night Watch&quot; immediately before its planned restoration. The exhibition ran from February to June.

=== Slavery in the Dutch Empire ===
After previous temporary exhibitions on art historical themes, the Rijksmuseum in 2021 presented an exhibition on the history of slavery in the Dutch colonial empire, focusing on the more than 1.6 million people who were enslaved by Dutch slave traders. It covered trans-Atlantic slavery from the 17th to the 19th century in Suriname, Brazil and the Caribbean, as well as Dutch colonial slavery in South Africa and Asia, where the Dutch West India Company (WIC) and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were engaged in slavery. Besides objects, such as a wooden block for locking slaves, paintings, archival documents, oral sources, poems and music, the exhibition also presented connections of the slavery system at home in the Netherlands. In the permanent collection, labels were added to 77 paintings and objects that had been seen as symbols of the country&#x27;s wealth and power to indicate previously hidden links to slavery.

The exhibition was presented both physically in the museum from May to August 2021 and in an online version. It was complemented by audio tours and videos relating personal and real-life stories as well as an accompanying book titled &quot;Slavery&quot;.

=== Vermeer ===
From 10 February until June 2023 the Rijksmuseum began to exhibit the biggest collection of Vermeers ever, with 28 of the known 37 works on display. Curator Pieter Roelofs called it a &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; event. All time slot reservations were quickly sold out.

== Number of visitors ==
The 20th-century visitor record of 1,412,000 was reached in the year 1975.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Rijksmuseum was annually visited by 0.9 to 1.3 million people. On 7 December 2003, the main building of the museum was closed for a renovation until 13 April 2013. In the preceding decade, the number of visitors had slightly decreased to 0.8 to 1.1 million people. The museum says after the renovation, the museum&#x27;s capacity is 1.5 to 2.0 million visitors annually. Within eight months since the reopening in 2013, the museum was visited by 2 million people.

The museum had 2.2 million visitors in 2013 and reached an all-time record of 2.47 million visitors in 2014. The museum was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 19th most visited art museum in the world in 2013 and 2014.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of the museum from 15 December 2020, until 4 June 2021.

==Library==
The Rijksmuseum Research Library is part of the Rijksmuseum, and is the best and the largest public art history research library in The Netherlands.

== Restaurant ==
Rijks, stylized as RIJKS®, is a restaurant with 140 seats in the Philips Wing. Joris Bijdendijk has been the chef de cuisine since the opening in 2014. The restaurant was awarded a Michelin star in 2017.

<doc id="26232" wikidata="Q38823" url="?curid=26232" title="Ruhollah Khomeini">
<text>Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (17 May 1900 or 24 September 19023 June 1989) was an Iranian Islamist revolutionary, politician and religious leader who served as the first supreme leader of Iran from 1979 until his death in 1989. He was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the main leader of the Iranian revolution, which overthrew Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and ended the Iranian monarchy. Ideologically a Shia Islamist, Khomeini&#x27;s religious and political ideas are known as Khomeinism.

Born in Khomeyn, in what is now Iran&#x27;s Markazi province, his father was murdered in 1903 when Khomeini was just two years old. He began studying the Quran and Arabic from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his relatives, including his mother&#x27;s cousin and older brother. Khomeini was a high ranking cleric in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, an &quot;ayatollah&quot;, a &quot;marja&#x27;&quot; (&quot;source of emulation&quot;), a &quot;mujtahid&quot; or &quot;faqīh&quot; (an expert in &quot;sharia&quot;), and author of more than 40 books. His opposition to the White Revolution resulted in his state-sponsored expulsion to Bursa in 1964. Nearly a year later, he moved to Najaf, where speeches he gave outlining his religiopolitical theory of Guardianship of the Jurist were compiled into &quot;Islamic Government&quot;.

Khomeini was &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence and has been described as the &quot;virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture&quot;, where he was known for his support of the hostage takers during the Iran hostage crisis, his fatwa calling for the murder of British Indian novelist Salman Rushdie who criticised Muhammad, and for referring to the United States as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and Israel as the &quot;Little Satan&quot;. Following the revolution, Khomeini became the country&#x27;s first supreme leader, a position created in the constitution of the Islamic Republic as the highest-ranking political and religious authority of the nation, which he held until his death. Most of his period in power was taken up by the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988. He was succeeded by Ali Khamenei on 4 June 1989.

The subject of a pervasive cult of personality, Khomeini is officially known as Imam Khomeini inside Iran and by his supporters internationally. His state funeral was attended by up to 10 million people, or one fifth of Iran&#x27;s population, one of the largest funerals and human gatherings in history. In Iran, his gold-domed tomb in Tehran&#x27;s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery has become a shrine for his adherents, and he is legally considered &quot;inviolable&quot;, and it is illegal to criticise him. His supporters view him as a champion of Islamic revival, anti-racism, independence, reducing foreign influence in Iran, and anti-imperialism. Critics have criticised him for anti-Western and anti-Semitic rhetoric, anti-democratic actions, and human rights violations including the 1988 execution of thousands of Iranian political prisoners, as well as for using child soldiers extensively during the Iran–Iraq War for human wave attacks.

== Early years ==
=== Background ===
Ruhollah Khomeini came from a lineage of small land owners, clerics, and merchants. His ancestors migrated towards the end of the 18th century from their original home in Nishapur, then part of Khorasan province, in northeastern Iran for a short stay to the Kingdom of Awadh, a region in the modern state of Uttar Pradesh, India, whose rulers were Twelver Shia Muslims of Persian origin. During their rule, they extensively invited and received a steady stream of Persian scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters. The family eventually settled in the small town of Kintoor, near Lucknow, the capital of Awadh.

Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi, was born in Kintoor. He left Lucknow in 1830, on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Ali in Najaf, Ottoman Iraq (now Iraq), and never returned. According to Moin, this migration was to escape from the spread of British power in India. In 1834, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi Hindi visited Persia, and in 1839, he settled in Khomein. Although he stayed and settled in Iran, he continued to be known as &quot;Hindi&quot;, indicating his stay in India, and Ruhollah Khomeini even used &quot;Hindi&quot; as a pen name in some of his ghazals. Khomeini&#x27;s grandfather, Mirza Ahmad Mojtahed-e Khonsari was the cleric issuing a fatwa to forbid usage of tobacco during the Tobacco Protest.

=== Childhood ===
According to his birth certificate, Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, whose first name means &quot;spirit of Allah&quot;, was born on 17 May 1900 in Khomeyn, Markazi Province, although his brother Mortaza (later known as Ayatollah Pasandideh) gives his birth date of 24 September 1902, the birth anniversary of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatima. He was raised by his mother, Agha Khanum, and his aunt, Sahebeth, following the murder of his father, Mustafa Musawi, over two years after his birth in 1903.

Ruhollah began to study the Qur&#x27;an and elementary Persian at the age of six. The following year, he began to attend a local school, where he learned religion, &quot;noheh khani&quot; (lamentation recital), and other traditional subjects. Throughout his childhood, he continued his religious education with the assistance of his relatives, including his mother&#x27;s cousin, Ja&#x27;far, and his elder brother, Morteza Pasandideh.

=== Education and lecturing ===

After the First World War, arrangements were made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Isfahan, but he was attracted instead to the seminary in Arak. He was placed under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdolkarim Haeri Yazdi. In 1920, Khomeini moved to Arak and commenced his studies. The following year, Ayatollah Haeri Yazdi transferred to the Islamic seminary in the holy city of Qom, southwest of Tehran, and invited his students to follow. Khomeini accepted the invitation, moved, and took up residence at the Dar al-Shafa school in Qom. Khomeini&#x27;s studies included Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;) and jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), but by that time, Khomeini had also acquired an interest in poetry and philosophy (&quot;irfan&quot;). So, upon arriving in Qom, Khomeini sought the guidance of Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi, a scholar of philosophy and mysticism. Yazdi died in 1924, but Khomeini continued to pursue his interest in philosophy with two other teachers, Javad Aqa Maleki Tabrizi and Rafi&#x27;i Qazvini. However, perhaps Khomeini&#x27;s biggest influences were another teacher, Mirza Muhammad &#x27;Ali Shahabadi, and a variety of historic Sufi mystics, including Mulla Sadra and Ibn Arabi.
Khomeini studied ancient Greek philosophy and was influenced by both the philosophy of Aristotle, whom he regarded as the founder of logic, and Plato, whose views &quot;in the field of divinity&quot; he regarded as &quot;grave and solid&quot;. Among Islamic philosophers, Khomeini was mainly influenced by Avicenna and Mulla Sadra. Apart from philosophy, Khomeini was interested in literature and poetry. His poetry collection was released after his death. Beginning in his adolescent years, Khomeini composed mystic, political and social poetry. His poetry works were published in three collections: &quot;The Confidant&quot;, &quot;The Decanter of Love and Turning Point&quot;, and &quot;Divan&quot;. His knowledge of poetry is further attested by the modern poet Nader Naderpour (1929–2000), who &quot;had spent many hours exchanging poems with Khomeini in the early 1960s&quot;. Naderpour remembered: &quot;For four hours we recited poetry. Every single line I recited from any poet, he recited the next.&quot;

Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer at Najaf and Qom seminaries for decades before he was known on the political scene. He soon became a leading scholar of Shia Islam. He taught political philosophy, Islamic history and ethics. Several of his students, for example Morteza Motahhari, later became leading Islamic philosophers and also &quot;marja&#x27;&quot;. As a scholar and teacher, Khomeini produced numerous writings on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics. He showed an exceptional interest in subjects like philosophy and mysticism that not only were usually absent from the curriculum of seminaries but were often an object of hostility and suspicion.

Inaugurating his teaching career at the age of 27 by giving private lessons on irfan and Mulla Sadra to a private circle, around the same time, in 1928, he also released his first publication, &quot;Sharh Du&#x27;a al-Sahar&quot; (Commentary on the Du&#x27;a al-Baha), &quot;a detailed commentary, in Arabic, on the prayer recited before dawn during Ramadan by Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq&quot;, followed, some years later, by &quot;Sirr al-Salat&quot; (Secret of the Prayer), where &quot;the symbolic dimensions and inner meaning of every part of the prayer, from the ablution that precedes it to the salam that concludes it, are expounded in a rich, complex, and eloquent language that owes much to the concepts and terminology of Ibn &#x27;Arabi. As Sayyid Fihri, the editor and translator of &quot;Sirr al-Salat&quot;, has remarked, the work is addressed only to the foremost among the spiritual elite (akhass-i khavass) and establishes its author as one of their number.&quot; The second book has been translated by Sayyid Amjad H. Shah Naqavi and released by Brill in 2015 under the title &quot;The Mystery of Prayer: The Ascension of the Wayfarers and the Prayer of the Gnostics&quot;.

=== Political aspects ===
His seminary teaching often focused on the importance of religion to practical social and political issues of the day, and he worked against secularism in the 1940s. His first political book &quot;Kashf al-Asrar&quot; (&quot;Uncovering of Secrets&quot;), published in 1942, was a point-by-point refutation of &quot;Asrar-e Hezar Sale&quot; (&quot;Secrets of a Thousand Years&quot;), a tract written by a disciple of Iran&#x27;s leading anti-clerical historian Ahmad Kasravi, as well as a condemnation of innovations such as international time zones, and the banning of hijab by Reza Shah, whom he always blamed for his father&#x27;s murder. In addition, he went from Qom to Tehran to listen to Ayatullah Hasan Mudarris, the leader of the opposition majority in Iran&#x27;s parliament during the 1920s. Khomeini became a &quot;marja&quot;&#x27; in 1963, following the death of Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi. Khomeini also valued the ideals of Islamists such as Sheikh Fazlollah Noori and Abol-Ghasem Kashani. Khomeini saw Fazlollah Nuri as a &quot;heroic figure&quot;, and his own objections to constitutionalism and a secular government derived from Nuri&#x27;s objections to the 1907 constitution.

== Early political activity ==

=== Background ===
In the late 19th century, the clergy had shown themselves to be a powerful political force in Iran initiating the Tobacco Protest against a concession to a foreign (British) interest. At the age of 61, Khomeini found the arena of leadership open following the deaths of Ayatollah Sayyed Husayn Borujerdi (1961), the leading, although quiescent, Shi&#x27;ah religious leader; and Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani (1962), an activist cleric. The clerical class had been on the defensive ever since the 1920s when the secular, anti-clerical modernizer Reza Shah Pahlavi rose to power. Reza&#x27;s son Mohammad Reza Shah instituted the White Revolution, which was a further challenge to the Ulama.

=== Opposition to the White Revolution ===
In January 1963, the Shah announced the White Revolution, a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation&#x27;s schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi&#x27;a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists. Khomeini viewed them as &quot;an attack on Islam&quot;. Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963, Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing both the Shah and his reform plan. Two days later, the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class.

Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah&#x27;s programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Shia religious scholars. Khomeini&#x27;s manifesto argued that the Shah had violated the constitution in various ways, he condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies.
On the afternoon of &#x27;Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a &#x27;tyrant&#x27; by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a &quot;wretched, miserable man&quot;, and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country. On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. Following this action, there were three days of major riots throughout Iran and the deaths of some 400 people. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini remained under house arrest until August.

=== Opposition to capitulation ===
On 26 October 1964, Khomeini denounced both the Shah and the United States. This time it was in response to the &quot;capitulations&quot; or diplomatic immunity granted by the Shah to American military personnel in Iran. What Khomeini labeled a capitulation law, was in fact a &quot;status-of-forces agreement&quot;, stipulating that U.S. servicemen facing criminal charges stemming from a deployment in Iran, were to be tried before a U.S. court martial, not an Iranian court. Khomeini was arrested in November 1964 and held for half a year. Upon his release, Khomeini was brought before Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur, who tried to convince him to apologize for his harsh rhetoric and going forward, cease his opposition to the Shah and his government. When Khomeini refused, Mansur slapped him in the face in a fit of rage. Two months later, Mansur was assassinated on his way to parliament. Four members of the Fadayan-e Islam, a Shia militia sympathetic to Khomeini, were later executed for the murder.
== Life in exile ==


Khomeini spent more than 14 years in exile, mostly in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf. Initially, he was sent to Turkey on 4 November 1964 where he stayed in Bursa in the home of Colonel Ali Cetiner of the Turkish Military Intelligence. In October 1965, after less than a year, he was allowed to move to Najaf, Iraq, where he stayed until 1978, when he was expelled by then-Vice President Saddam Hussein. By this time, discontent with the Shah was becoming intense and Khomeini visited Neauphle-le-Château, a suburb of Paris, France, on a tourist visa on 6 October 1978.

By the late 1960s, Khomeini was a marja-e taqlid (model for imitation) for &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of Shia, one of six or so models in the Shia world. While in the 1940s Khomeini accepted the idea of a limited monarchy under the Persian Constitution of 1906—as evidenced by his book &quot;Kashf al-Asrar&quot;—by the 1970s he had rejected the idea. In early 1970, Khomeini gave a series of lectures in Najaf on Islamic government, later published as a book titled variously &quot;Islamic Government&quot; or &quot;Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist&quot; (&quot;Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih&quot;). This principle, though not known to the wider public before the revolution, was appended to the new Iranian constitution after the revolution.

===&quot;Velâyat-e Faqih&quot;===
&quot;Velâyat-e Faqih&quot; was his best known and most influential work, and laid out his ideas on governance (at that time):
* That the laws of society should be made up only of the laws of God (&quot;Sharia&quot;), which are sufficient because they cover &quot;all human affairs&quot; and &quot;provide instruction and establish norms&quot; for every topic in human life.
* Since &quot;Shariah&quot;, or Islamic law, is the proper law, those holding government posts should have knowledge of &quot;Sharia&quot;. Since Islamic jurists or faqih have studied and are the most knowledgeable in &quot;Sharia&quot;, the country&#x27;s ruler should be a &quot;faqih&quot; who &quot;surpasses all others in knowledge&quot; of Islamic law and justice, known as a marja&#x27;, as well as having intelligence and administrative ability. Rule by monarchs or assemblies of &quot;those claiming to be representatives of the majority of the people&quot; (i.e. elected parliaments and legislatures) has been proclaimed &quot;wrong&quot; by Islam.
* This system of clerical rule is necessary to prevent injustice, corruption, oppression by the powerful over the poor and weak, innovation and deviation of Islam and Sharia law; and also to destroy anti-Islamic influence and conspiracies by non-Muslim foreign powers.

===Pre-revolutionary political activity===
A modified form of this &quot;wilayat al-faqih&quot; system was adopted after Khomeini and his followers took power, and Khomeini was the Islamic Republic&#x27;s first &quot;Guardian&quot; or &quot;Supreme Leader&quot;. In the meantime, Khomeini talked only about &quot;Islamic Government&quot;, never spelling out what exactly that meant. His network may have been learning about the necessity of rule by Jurists, but &quot;in his interview, speeches, messages and fatvas during this period, there is not a single reference to velayat-e faqih.&quot; Khomenei was careful not to publicize his ideas for clerical rule outside of his Islamic network of opposition to the Shah and so not frighten away the secular middle class from his movement. His movement emphasized populism, talking about fighting for the &quot;mustazafin&quot;, a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived, that in this context came to mean &quot;just about everyone in Iran except the shah and the imperial court&quot;.
In Iran, a number of missteps by the Shah including his repression of opponents began to build opposition to his regime. Cassette copies of his lectures fiercely denouncing the Shah, for example as &quot;the Jewish agent, the American serpent whose head must be smashed with a stone&quot;, became common items in the markets of Iran, helping to demythologize the power and dignity of the Shah and his reign. As Iran became more polarized and opposition more radical, Khomeini &quot;was able to mobilize the entire network of mosques in Iran&quot;, along with their pious faithful, regular gatherings, hitherto skeptical Mullah leaders, and supported by &quot;over 20,000 properties and buildings throughout Iran&quot;—a political resource the secular middle class and Shiite socialists could not hope to compete with.
Aware of the importance of broadening his base, Khomeini reached out to Islamic reformist and secular enemies of the Shah, groups that were suppressed after he took and consolidated power. After the 1977 death of Ali Shariati, an Islamic reformist and political revolutionary author, academic, and philosopher who greatly assisted the Islamic revival among young educated Iranians, Khomeini became the most influential leader of the opposition to the Shah. Adding to his mystique was the circulation among Iranians in the 1970s of an old Shia saying attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kadhem. Prior to his death in 799, al-Kadhem was said to have prophesied that &quot;[a] man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path&quot;. In late 1978, a rumour swept the country that Khomeini&#x27;s face could be seen in the full moon. Millions of people were said to have seen it and the event was celebrated in thousands of mosques. The phenomenon was thought to demonstrate that by late 1978 he was increasingly regarded as a messianic figure in Iran, and perceived by many as the spiritual as well as political leader of the revolt.

As protests grew, so did his profile and importance. Although several thousand kilometers away from Iran in Paris, Khomeini set the course of the revolution, urging Iranians not to compromise and ordering work stoppages against the regime. During the last few months of his exile, Khomeini received a constant stream of reporters, supporters, and notables, eager to hear the spiritual leader of the revolution. While in exile, Khomeini developed what historian Ervand Abrahamian described as a &quot;populist clerical version of Shii Islam&quot;. Khomeini modified previous Shii interpretations of Islam in a number of ways that included aggressive approaches to espousing the general interests of the mostazafin, forcefully arguing that the clergy&#x27;s sacred duty was to take over the state so that it could implement shari&#x27;a, and exhorting followers to protest. Despite their ideological differences, Khomeini also allied with the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran during the early 1970s and started funding their armed operations against the Shah.

==== Khomeini&#x27;s contact with the United States ====
According to the BBC, Khomeini&#x27;s contact with the US &quot;is part of a trove of newly declassified US government documents—diplomatic cables, policy memos, meeting records&quot;. The documents suggest that the Carter administration helped Khomeini return to Iran by preventing the Iranian army from launching a military coup, and that Khomeini told an American in France to convey a message to Washington that &quot;There should be no fear about oil. It is not true that we wouldn&#x27;t sell to the US.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that it &quot;did not have access to the newly declassified documents and was not able to independently verify them&quot;; however it confirmed Khomeini&#x27;s contact with the Kennedy administration and claims of support for US interest in Iran particularly oil through a CIA analysis report titled &quot;Islam in Iran&quot;.

According to a 1980 CIA study, &quot;in November 1963 Ayatollah Khomeini sent a message to the United States Government through [Tehran University professor] Haj Mirza Khalil Kamarei&quot;, where he expressed that &quot;he was not opposed to American interests in Iran&quot;, and that &quot;on the contrary, he thought the American presence was necessary as a counterbalance to Soviet and possibly British influence&quot;. According to the BBC, &quot;these document show that in his long quest for power, he [Khomeini] was tactically flexible; he played the moderate even pro-American card to take control but once change had come he put in place an anti-America legacy that would last for decades.&quot; Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denied the report, and described the documents as &quot;fabricated&quot;. Other Iranian politicians including Ebrahim Yazdi, who was Khomeini&#x27;s spokesman and adviser at the time of the revolution, denounced the documents and the BBC&#x27;s report.

== Supreme Leader of Iran ==

=== Return to Iran ===


On 16 January 1979, the Shah left the country for medical treatment (ostensibly &quot;on vacation&quot;), never to return. Two weeks later, on Thursday, 1 February 1979, Khomeini returned in triumph to Iran, welcomed by a joyous crowd reported to be of up to five million people. On his chartered Air France flight back to Tehran, he was accompanied by 120 journalists, including three women. One of the journalists, Peter Jennings, asked: &quot;Ayatollah, would you be so kind as to tell us how you feel about being back in Iran?&quot; Khomeini answered via his aide Sadegh Ghotbzadeh: &quot;Hichi&quot; (Nothing). This statement—much discussed at the time, and also since—was considered by some reflective of his mystical beliefs and non-attachment to ego. Others considered it a warning to Iranians who hoped he would be a &quot;mainstream nationalist leader&quot; that they were in for disappointment. To others, it was a reflection of Khomeini&#x27;s disinterest in the desires, beliefs, or the needs of the Iranian populace. He was &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year in 1979 for his international influence.

===Revolution===
Khomeini adamantly opposed the provisional government of Shapour Bakhtiar, promising &quot;I shall kick their teeth in. I appoint the government.&quot; On 11 February (Bahman 22), Khomeini appointed his own competing interim prime minister, Mehdi Bazargan, demanding, &quot;since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed&quot;. He warned it was &quot;God&#x27;s government&quot;, and disobedience against him or Bazargan was considered a &quot;revolt against God&quot;, and &quot;revolt against God is Blasphemy&quot;.

As Khomeini&#x27;s movement gained momentum, soldiers began to defect to his side and Khomeini declared ill fortune on troops who did not surrender. On 11 February, as revolt spread and armories were taken over, the military declared neutrality and the Bakhtiar regime collapsed. On 30 and 31 March 1979, a referendum to replace the monarchy with an Islamic Republic—with the question: &quot;should the monarchy be abolished in favour of an Islamic Government?&quot;—passed with 98% voting in favour of the replacement.

====Beginning of the consolidation of power====
While in Paris, Khomeini had &quot;promised a democratic political system&quot; for Iran but once in power advocated for the creation of theocracy, which was based on the &quot;Velayat-e faqih&quot;. This began the process of suppression of groups inside his broad coalition but outside his network that had placed their hopes in Khomeini but whose support was no longer needed. This also led to the purge or replacement of many secular politicians in Iran, with Khomeini and his close associates taking the following steps: establishing Islamic Revolutionary courts; replacing the previous military and police force; placing Iran&#x27;s top theologians and Islamic intellectuals in charge of writing a theocratic constitutions, with a central role for &quot;Velayat-e faqih&quot;; creating the Islamic Republic Party (IRP) through Khomeini&#x27;s &quot;Motjaheds&quot; with the aim of establishing a theocratic government and tearing down any secular opposition; replacing all secular laws with Islamic laws; and neutralising or punishing top theologians (&quot;Khomeini&#x27;s competitors in the religious hierarchy&quot;), whose ideas conflicted with Khomeini&#x27;s, including Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari, Hassan Tabatabaei Qomi, and Hossein Ali Montazeri. Some newspapers were closed, and those protesting the closings were attacked. Opposition groups such as the National Democratic Front and Muslim People&#x27;s Republican Party were attacked and finally banned.

==== Islamic constitution and becoming Supreme Leader ====

As part of the pivot from guide of a broad political movement to strict clerical ruler, Khomeini&#x27;s first expressed approval of the provisional constitution for the Islamic Republic that had no post of supreme Islamic clerical ruler. After his supporters gained an overwhelming majority of the seats in the body making final changes in the draft (the Assembly of Experts), they rewrote the proposed constitution to include an Islamic jurist Supreme Leader of the country, and a more powerful Council of Guardians to veto un-Islamic legislation and screen candidates for office, disqualifying those found un-Islamic. The Supreme Leader followed closely but not completely Khomeini ideas in his 1970 book &quot;Hokumat-e Islami: Velayat-e faqih&quot; (&quot;Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist&quot;) that had been distributed to his supporters and kept from the public. In November 1979, the new constitution of the Islamic Republic was adopted by national referendum. Khomeini himself became instituted as the Supreme Leader of Iran, and officially became known as the &quot;Leader of the Revolution&quot;. On 4 February 1980, Abolhassan Banisadr was elected as the first president of Iran. Critics complained that Khomeini had gone back on his word to advise, rather than rule the country.

==== Hostage crisis ====

Before the constitution was approved, on 22 October 1979, the United States admitted the exiled and ailing Shah into the country for cancer treatment. In Iran, there was an immediate outcry, with both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah&#x27;s return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November, a group of Iranian college students calling themselves the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam&#x27;s Line took control of the American Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 embassy staff hostage for 444 days, an event known as the Iran hostage crisis. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a flagrant violation of international law and aroused intense anger and anti-Iranian sentiment.

In Iran, the takeover was immensely popular and earned the support of Khomeini under the slogan &quot;America can&#x27;t do a damn thing against us&quot;. The seizure of the embassy of a country he called the &quot;Great Satan&quot; helped to advance the cause of theocratic government and outflank politicians and groups who emphasized stability and normalized relations with other countries. Khomeini is reported to have told his president: &quot;This action has many benefits ... this has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people&#x27;s vote without difficulty, and carry out presidential and parliamentary elections.&quot; The new constitution was successfully passed by referendum a month after the hostage crisis began.

The crisis had the effect of splitting of the opposition into two groups: radicals supporting the hostage taking, and the moderates opposing it. On 23 February 1980, Khomeini proclaimed Iran&#x27;s Majlis would decide the fate of the American embassy hostages, and demanded that the United States hand over the Shah for trial in Iran for crimes against the nation. Although the Shah died a few months later, during the summer, the crisis continued. In Iran, supporters of Khomeini named the embassy a &quot;Den of Espionage&quot;, publicizing details regarding armaments, espionage equipment and many volumes of official and classified documents which they found there.

=== Relationship with Islamic and non-aligned countries ===

Khomeini believed in Muslim unity and solidarity and the export of his revolution throughout the world. He believed Shia and the significantly more numerous Sunni Muslims should be &quot;united and stand firmly against Western and arrogant powers&quot;, and also said: &quot;Establishing the Islamic state world-wide belong to the great goals of the revolution.&quot; He declared the birth week of Muhammad (the week between 12th to 17th of Rabi&#x27; al-awwal) as the Unity Week and the last Friday of Ramadan as Quds Day in 1981.

=== Iran–Iraq War ===
Shortly after assuming power, Khomeini began calling for Islamic revolutions across the Muslim world, including Iran&#x27;s Arab neighbor Iraq, the one large state besides Iran with a Shia majority population. At the same time Saddam Hussein, Iraq&#x27;s secular Arab nationalist Ba&#x27;athist leader, was eager to take advantage of Iran&#x27;s weakened military and (what he assumed was) revolutionary chaos, and in particular to occupy Iran&#x27;s adjacent oil-rich province of Khuzestan, and to undermine Iranian Islamic revolutionary attempts to incite the Shi&#x27;a majority of his country. In September 1980, Iraq launched a full-scale invasion of Iran, beginning the Iran–Iraq War (September 1980 – August 1988). A combination of fierce resistance by Iranians and military incompetence by Iraqi forces soon stalled the Iraqi advance and, despite Saddam&#x27;s internationally condemned use of poison gas, Iran had by early 1982 regained almost all of the territory lost to the invasion. The invasion rallied Iranians behind the new regime, enhancing Khomeini&#x27;s stature and allowing him to consolidate and stabilize his leadership. After this reversal, Khomeini refused an Iraqi offer of a truce, instead demanding reparations and the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power. In 1982, there was an attempted military coup against Khomeini.

Although Iran&#x27;s population and economy were three times the size of Iraq&#x27;s, the latter was aided by neighboring Persian Gulf Arab states, as well as the Soviet Bloc and Western countries. The Persian Gulf Arabs and the West wanted to be sure the Islamic revolution did not spread across the Persian Gulf, while the Soviet Union was concerned about the potential threat posed to its rule in central Asia to the north; however, Iran had large amounts of ammunition provided by the United States of America during the Shah&#x27;s era and the United States illegally smuggled arms to Iran during the 1980s despite Khomeini&#x27;s anti-Western policy (see Iran–Contra affair).

During the war, the Iranians used human wave attacks (people walking to certain death included child soldiers), with Khomeini promising that they would automatically go to paradise—al Janna—if they died in battle. Khomeini&#x27;s pursuit of victory ultimately proved futile. By March 1984, two million of Iran&#x27;s most educated citizens had left the country. In July 1988, Khomeini, in his words, &quot;drank the cup of poison&quot; and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. Despite the high cost of the war, including 450,000 to 950,000 Iranian casualties and US$300 billion, Khomeini insisted that extending the war into Iraq in an attempt to overthrow Saddam had not been a mistake. In a &quot;Letter to Clergy&quot;, he wrote that &quot;we do not repent, nor are we sorry for even a single moment for our performance during the war. Have we forgotten that we fought to fulfill our religious duty and that the result is a marginal issue?&quot;

=== Fatwa against chemical weapons ===
In an interview with Gareth Porter, Mohsen Rafighdoost, the eight-year war time minister of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, disclosed how Khomeini had opposed his proposal for beginning work on both nuclear and chemical weapons by a fatwa which had never been made public in details of when and how it was issued.

=== Rushdie fatwa ===

In early 1989, Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the assassination of Salman Rushdie, an India-born British author. Rushdie&#x27;s book, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, published in 1988, was alleged to commit blasphemy against Islam and Khomeini&#x27;s juristic ruling (fatwā) prescribed Rushdie&#x27;s assassination by any Muslim. The fatwā required not only Rushdie&#x27;s execution, but also the execution of &quot;all those involved in the publication&quot; of the book.

Khomeini&#x27;s fatwā was condemned across the Western world by governments on the grounds that it violated the universal human rights of free speech and freedom of religion. The fatwā has also been attacked for violating the rules of fiqh by not allowing the accused an opportunity to defend himself, and because &quot;even the most rigorous and extreme of the classical jurist only require a Muslim to kill anyone who insults the Prophet in his hearing and in his presence.&quot;

Although Rushdie publicly regretted &quot;the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam&quot;, the fatwa was not revoked. The fatwa was followed by a number of deaths, including the lethal stabbing of Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator of the book, in 1991. Rushdie himself and two other translators of the book survived murder attempts, the last (in Rushdie&#x27;s case) in August 2022. The controversy, and subsequent unrest associated with the fatwa has been linked to surges in sales for Rushdie&#x27;s work.

=== Life under Khomeini ===
In a speech on 1 February 1979 delivered to a huge crowd after returning to Iran from exile, Khomeini made a variety of promises to Iranians for his coming Islamic regime: a popularly elected government that would represent the people of Iran and with which the clergy would not interfere. He promised that &quot;no one should remain homeless in this country&quot;, and that Iranians would have free telephone, heating, electricity, bus services and free oil at their doorstep.

Under Khomeini&#x27;s rule, s&quot;haria&quot; (Islamic law) was introduced, with the Islamic dress code enforced for both men and women by Islamic Revolutionary Guards and other Islamic groups. Women were required to cover their hair, and men were forbidden to wear shorts. Alcoholic drinks, most Western movies, and the practice of men and women swimming or sunbathing together were banned. The Iranian educational curriculum was Islamized at all levels with the Islamic Cultural Revolution; this was out thoroughly by the Committee for Islamization of Universities. The broadcasting of any music other than martial or religious on Iranian radio and television was banned by Khomeini in July 1979. The ban lasted 10 years (approximately the rest of his life). According to Janet Afari, &quot;the newly established regime of Ayatollah Khomeini moved quickly to repress feminists, ethnic and religious minorities, liberals, and leftists – all in the name of Islam.&quot;

==== Women and child rights ====
Khomeini took on extensive and proactive support of the female populace during the ousting of the Shah and his subsequent homecoming, advocating for mainstreaming of women into all spheres of life and even hypothesizing about a woman head of state; however, once he returned, his stances on women&#x27;s rights exhibited drastic changes. Khomeini revoked Iran&#x27;s 1967 divorce law, considering any divorce granted under this law to be invalid. Nevertheless, Khomeini supported women&#x27;s right to divorce as allowed by Islamic law. Khomeini reaffirmed the traditional position of rape in Islamic law in which rape by a spouse was not equivalent to rape or zina, but forbidden. declaring &quot;Issue 2412 – A woman who has entered into a permanent marriage should not go out of the house without her husband&#x27;s permission, and she should consent to whatever pleasure he wants and not prevent him from sleeping with her without a legitimate excuse. If she obeys the husband in these matters, it is obligatory on the husband to provide her food, clothes, house and other items mentioned in the books, and if he does not provide, he is indebted to the wife, whether he has the ability or not. Issue 2413 – If a woman does not obey her husband in the matters mentioned in the previous issue, she is a sinner and has no right to food, clothing, housing, and co-sleeping, but her dowry is not lost. Issue 2414 – A man has no right to force his wife to serve the house. Issue 2420- If they did not specify a period of time for giving the dowry at the time of reading the permanent contract, the woman can prevent the husband from sleeping with him before receiving the dowry, whether the husband has the ability to pay the dowry or not. . But if she is satisfied with intercourse before taking the dowry and the husband has intercourse with her, she cannot prevent the husband from intercourse without a legitimate excuse.&quot;

A mere three weeks after assuming power, under the pretext of reversing the Shah&#x27;s affinity for westernization and backed by a vocal conservative section of Iranian society, he revoked the divorce law. Under Khomeini the minimum age of marriage was lowered to 15 for boys and 13 for girls; nevertheless, the average age of women at marriage continued to increase. Laws were passed that continued to allow polygamy, and treated adultery as a high form of criminal offense. Women were compelled to wear veils and the image of Western women was carefully reconstructed as a symbol of impiety. Morality and modesty were perceived as fundamental womanly traits that needed state protection, and concepts of individual gender rights were relegated to women&#x27;s social rights as ordained in Islam. Fatima was widely presented as the ideal emulatable woman. At the same time, amidst the religious orthodoxy, there was an active effort to rehabilitate women into employment. Female participation in healthcare, education and the workforce increased drastically during his regime. Reception among women of his regime has been mixed. Whilst a section were dismayed at the increasing Islamisation and concurrent degradation of women&#x27;s rights, others did notice more opportunities and mainstreaming of relatively religiously conservative women.

==== LGBTQ persecution ====
Shortly after his accession as supreme leader in February 1979, Khomeini imposed capital punishment on homosexuals. Between February and March, sixteen Iranians were executed due to offenses related to sexual violations. Khomeini also created the Revolutionary Tribunals. According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, Khomeini encouraged the clerical courts to continue implementing their version of the Shari&#x27;a. As part of the campaign to &quot;cleanse&quot; the society, these courts executed over 100 drug addicts, prostitutes, homosexuals, rapists, and adulterers on the charge of &quot;sowing corruption on earth&quot;. According to author Arno Schmitt, &quot;Khomeini asserted that &#x27;homosexuals&#x27; had to be exterminated because they were parasites and corruptors of the nation by spreading the &#x27;stain of wickedness.&#x27;&quot; In 1979, he had declared that the execution of homosexuals (as well as prostitutes and adulterers) was reasonable in a moral civilization in the same sense as cutting off decayed skin.

Being transgender, however, was designated by Khomeini as a sickness that was able to be cured through gender-affirming surgery. Since the mid-1980s, the Iranian government has legalized the practice of sex reassignment surgery (under medical approval) and the modification of pertinent legal documents to reflect the reassigned gender. In 1983, Khomeini passed a fatwa allowing gender reassignment operations as a cure for &quot;diagnosed transsexuals&quot;, allowing for the basis of this practice becoming legal.

==== Emigration and economy ====
Khomeini is said to have stressed &quot;the spiritual over the material&quot;. Six months after his first speech he expressed exasperation with complaints about the sharp drop in Iran&#x27;s standard of living, saying that: &quot;I cannot believe that the purpose of all these sacrifices was to have less expensive melons.&quot; On another occasion emphasizing the importance of martyrdom over material prosperity, he said: &quot;Could anyone wish his child to be martyred to obtain a good house? This is not the issue. The issue is another world.&quot; He also reportedly answered a question about his economic policies by declaring that &#x27;economics is for donkeys&#x27;. This disinterest in economic policy is said to be &quot;one factor explaining the inchoate performance of the Iranian economy since the revolution.&quot; Other factors include the long war with Iraq, the cost of which led to government debt and inflation, eroding personal incomes, and unprecedented unemployment, ideological disagreement over the economy, and &quot;international pressure and isolation&quot; such as US sanctions following the hostage crisis.

Due to the Iran–Iraq War, poverty is said to have risen by nearly 45% during the first 6 years of Khomeini&#x27;s rule. Emigration from Iran also developed, reportedly for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. Since the revolution and war with Iraq, an estimated &quot;two to four million entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and skilled craftspeople (and their capital)&quot; have emigrated to other countries.

==== Suppression of opposition ====
In a talk at the Fayzieah School in Qom on 30 August 1979, Khomeini warned his opponents: &quot;Those who are trying to bring corruption and destruction to our country in the name of democracy will be oppressed. They are worse than Bani-Ghorizeh Jews, and they must be hanged. We will oppress them by God&#x27;s order and God&#x27;s call to prayer.&quot; In 1983, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) helped him by providing a list of Soviet KGB agents and collaborators operating in Iran to Khomeini, who then executed up to 200 suspects and closed down the Communist Tudeh Party of Iran.

The Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his family left Iran and escaped harm but hundreds of former members of the overthrown monarchy and military were executed by firing squads, with exiled critics complaining of &quot;secrecy, vagueness of the charges, the absence of defense lawyers or juries&quot;, or the opportunity of the accused &quot;to defend themselves&quot;. In later years these were followed in larger numbers by the erstwhile revolutionary allies of Khomeini&#x27;s movement—Marxists and socialists, mostly university students—who opposed the theocratic regime. From 1980 to 1981, the People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran and other opposition groups (including leftist and moderate groups) rallied against the takeover of the Islamic Republic Party through large demonstrations. On Khomeini&#x27;s order, the Islamic Republic responded by shooting the demonstrators and arresting them, including their leaders. The 1981 Hafte Tir bombing escalated the conflict, leading to increasing arrests, torture, and executions of thousands of Iranians. Targets also included &quot;innocent, non political civilians, such as members of the Baha&#x27;i religious minority, and others deemed problematic by the IRP&quot;. The number of those executed between 1981 and 1985&#x27;s &quot;reign of terror&quot; is reported to be between 8,000 and 10,000.

In the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners, following the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran&#x27;s unsuccessful attack, known as Operation Mersad, against Iran from Iraq and their support of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner (mostly but not all Mujahedin), and kill those judged to be apostates from Islam (&quot;mortad&quot;) or &quot;waging war on God&quot; (&quot;moharebeh&quot;). Almost all of those interrogated were killed, 1,000 to 30,000 of them. Because of the large number, prisoners were loaded into forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hour intervals.

==== Minority religions ====

Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians are officially recognized and protected by the government. Shortly after Khomeini&#x27;s return from exile in 1979, he issued a fatwa ordering that Jews and other minorities (except those of the Baháʼí Faith) be treated well. In power, Khomeini distinguished between Zionism as a secular political party that employs Jewish symbols and ideals and Judaism as the religion of Moses. Senior government posts were reserved for Muslims. Schools set up by Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians had to be run by Muslim principals. Conversion to Islam was encouraged by entitling converts to inherit the entire share of their parents or even uncle&#x27;s estate if their siblings or cousins remain non-Muslim. Iran&#x27;s non-Muslim population has decreased. For example, the Jewish population in Iran dropped from 80,000 to 30,000. The Zoroastrian population has also decreased, due to suffering from renewed persecution and the revived legal contrasts between a Muslim and Zoroastrian, which mirrors the laws that Zoroastrians experienced under earlier Islamic regimes. The view that Zoroastrians are &quot;najis&quot; (&quot;unclean&quot;) has also been renewed. Four of the 270 seats in Parliament were reserved for each three non-Muslim minority religions, under the Islamic constitution that Khomeini oversaw. Khomeini also called for unity between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims. Sunni Muslims make up 9% of the entire Muslim population in Iran. 

One non-Muslim group treated differently were the 300,000 members of the Baháʼí Faith. Starting in late 1979, the new government systematically targeted the leadership of the Baháʼí community by focusing on the Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) and Local Spiritual Assemblies (LSAs); prominent members of NSAs and LSAs were often detained and even executed, and &quot;[s]ome 200 of whom have been executed and the rest forced to convert or subjected to the most horrendous disabilities&quot;. Like most conservative Muslims, Khomeini believed Baháʼí to be apostates. He argued that they were a political rather than a religious movement, declaring that &quot;the Baháʼís are not a sect but a party, which was previously supported by Britain and now the United States. The Baháʼís are also spies just like the Tudeh [Communist Party].&quot;

==== Ethnic minorities ====

After the Shah left Iran in 1979, a Kurdish delegation traveled to Qom to present the Kurds&#x27; demands to Khomeini. Their demands included language rights and the provision for a degree of political autonomy. Khomeini responded that such demands were unacceptable since it involved the division of the Iranian nation. In a speech during the same year, Khomeini hinted that the new government&#x27;s attitudes were to curb contrasts instead of accepting them. Khomeini is quoted saying: &quot;Sometimes the word minorities is used to refer to people such as Kurds, Lurs, Turks, Persians, Baluchis, and such. These people should not be called minorities because this term assumes there is a difference between these brothers.&quot; The following months saw numerous clashes between Kurdish militia groups and the Revolutionary Guards. The referendum on the Islamic Republic was massively boycotted in Kurdistan, where it was thought 85 to 90% of voters abstained. Khomeini ordered additional attacks later on in the year, and by September most of Iranian Kurdistan was under direct martial law.

== Death and funeral ==

Khomeini&#x27;s health declined several years prior to his death. After spending eleven days in Jamaran hospital, he died on 3 June 1989 after suffering five heart attacks in ten days. He was succeeded as Supreme Leader by Ali Khamenei. Large numbers of Iranians took to the streets to publicly mourn his death and in the scorching summer heat, fire trucks sprayed water on the crowds to cool them. At least 10 mourners were trampled to death, more than 400 were badly hurt and several thousand more were treated for injuries sustained in the ensuing pandemonium. According to Iran&#x27;s official estimates, 10.2 million people lined the route to Tehran&#x27;s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery on 11 June 1989, for the funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Western agencies estimated that 2 million paid their respects as the body lay in state.

Figures about Khomeini&#x27;s initial funeral attendance which took place on 4 June range around 2.5–3.5 million people. Early the following day, Khomeini&#x27;s corpse was flown in by helicopter for burial at the Behesht-e Zahra. Iranian officials postponed Khomeini&#x27;s first funeral after a huge mob stormed the funeral procession, destroying Khomeini&#x27;s wooden coffin in order to get a last glimpse of his body or touch of his coffin. In some cases, armed soldiers were compelled to fire warning shots in the air to restrain the crowds. At one point, Khomeini&#x27;s body fell to the ground, as the crowd ripped off pieces of the death shroud, trying to keep them as if they were holy relics. According to journalist James Buchan:

The second funeral was held under much tighter security five hours later. This time, Khomeini&#x27;s casket was made of steel, and in accordance with Islamic tradition, the casket was only to carry the body to the burial site. In 1995, his son Ahmad was buried next to him. Khomeini&#x27;s grave is now housed within a larger mausoleum complex.

=== Succession ===

Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, a former student of Khomeini and a major figure of the Revolution, was chosen by Khomeini to be his successor as Supreme Leader and approved as such by the Assembly of Experts in November 1985. The principle of &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot; and the Islamic constitution called for the Supreme Leader to be a &quot;marja&quot; (a grand ayatollah), and of the dozen or so grand ayatollahs living in 1981 only Montazeri qualified as a potential Leader (this was either because only he accepted totally Khomeini&#x27;s concept of rule by Islamic jurists, or, as at least one other source stated, because only Montazeri had the &quot;political credentials&quot; Khomeini found suitable for his successor). The execution of Mehdi Hashemi in September 1987 on charges of counterrevolutionary activities was a blow to Ayatollah Montazeri, who knew Hashemi since their childhood. In 1989 Montazeri began to call for liberalization, freedom for political parties. Following the execution of thousands of political prisoners by the Islamic government, Montazeri told Khomeini: &quot;Your prisons are far worse than those of the Shah and his SAVAK.&quot; After a letter of his complaints was leaked to Europe and broadcast on the BBC, a furious Khomeini ousted him in March 1989 from his position as official successor. His portraits were removed from offices and mosques.

To deal with the disqualification of the only suitable &quot;marja&quot;, Khomeini called for an &#x27;Assembly for Revising the Constitution&#x27; to be convened. An amendment was made to Iran&#x27;s constitution removing the requirement that the Supreme Leader be a Marja and this allowed Ali Khamenei, the new favoured jurist who had suitable revolutionary credentials but lacked scholarly ones and who was not a Grand Ayatollah, to be designated as successor. Ayatollah Khamenei was elected Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989. Montazeri continued his criticism of the regime and in 1997 was put under house arrest for questioning what he regarded to be an unaccountable rule exercised by the supreme leader.

=== Anniversary ===
The anniversary of Khomeini&#x27;s death is a public holiday. To commemorate Khomeini, people visit his mausoleum placed on Behesht-e Zahra to hear sermons and practice prayers on his death day.

== Reception, political thought and legacy ==


According to at least one scholar, politics in the Islamic Republic of Iran &quot;are largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini&#x27;s legacy&quot; and that &quot;staying faithful to his ideology has been the litmus test for all political activity&quot; there. Throughout his many writings and speeches, Khomeini&#x27;s views on governance evolved. Originally declaring rule by monarchs or others permissible so long as sharia law was followed Khomeini later adamantly opposed monarchy, arguing that only rule by a leading Islamic jurist (a marja&#x27;) would ensure Sharia was properly followed (velâyat-e faqih), before finally insisting the ruling jurist need not be a leading one and Sharia rule could be overruled by that jurist if necessary to serve the interests of Islam and the &quot;divine government&quot; of the Islamic state.
Khomeini&#x27;s concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist (ولایت فقیه, &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot;) as Islamic government did not win the support of the leading Iranian Shi&#x27;i clergy of the time. Towards the 1979 Revolution, many clerics gradually became disillusioned with the rule of the Shah, although none came around to supporting Khomeini&#x27;s vision of a theocratic Islamic Republic. Khomeini has been described as the &quot;virtual face of Shia Islam in Western popular culture&quot;.

There is much debate to as whether Khomeini&#x27;s ideas are or are not compatible with democracy and whether he intended the Islamic Republic to be a democratic republic. According to the state-run &quot;Aftab News&quot;, both ultraconservative supporters (Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi) and reformist opponents of the regime (Akbar Ganji and Abdolkarim Soroush) believe he did not while regime officials and supporters, such as Ali Khamenei, Mohammad Khatami, and Mortaza Motahhari, maintain the Islamic republic is democratic as Khomeini intended it to be. Khomeini himself also made statements at different times indicating both support and opposition to democracy.
One scholar, Shaul Bakhash, explains this contradiction as coming from Khomeini&#x27;s belief that the huge turnout of Iranians in anti-Shah demonstrations during the revolution constituted a &#x27;referendum&#x27; in favor of an Islamic republic, more important than any elections. Khomeini also wrote that since Muslims must support a government based on Islamic law, Sharia-based government will always have more popular support in Muslim countries than any government based on elected representatives. Khomeini&#x27;s policies aimed to position Iran as the &quot;champion of all Muslims, regardless of sect&quot;, by making Iran to be the main &quot;hardline opponent of the Jewish state&quot;. Khomeini offered himself as a &quot;champion of Islamic revival&quot; and unity, emphasizing issues Muslims agreed upon—the fight against Zionism and imperialism—and downplaying Shia issues that would divide Shia from Sunni. The Egyptian Jihadist ideologue Sayyid Qutb was an important source of influence to Khomeini and the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The Islamic Republic of Iran under Khomeini honoured Qutb&#x27;s &quot;martyrdom&quot; by issuing an iconic postage stamp in 1984, and before the revolution prominent figures in the Khomeini network translated Qutb&#x27;s works into Persian. While he publicly spoke of Islamic unity and minimized differences with Sunni Muslims, he is accused by some of privately rebuking Sunni Islam as heretical and covertly promoted an anti-Sunni foreign policy in the region.

Khomeini has been lauded as politically astute, a &quot;charismatic leader of immense popularity&quot;, a &quot;champion of Islamic revival&quot; by Shia scholars, and a major innovator in political theory and religious-oriented populist political strategy. Khomeini strongly opposed close relations with either Eastern or Western Bloc nations, believing the Islamic world should be its own bloc, or rather converge into a single unified power. He viewed Western culture as being inherently decadent and a corrupting influence upon the youth. The Islamic Republic banned or discouraged popular Western fashions, music, cinema, and literature. In the Western world it is said &quot;his glowering visage became the virtual face of Islam in Western popular culture&quot; and &quot;inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam&quot;, making the word &#x27;Ayatollah&#x27; &quot;a synonym for a dangerous madman ... in popular parlance&quot;. This has particularly been the case in the United States where some Iranians complained that even at universities they felt the need to hide their Iranian identity for fear of physical attack. There Khomeini and the Islamic Republic are remembered for the American embassy hostage taking and accused of sponsoring hostage-taking and terrorist attacks, and which continues to apply economic sanctions against Iran. Before taking power, Khomeini expressed support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, saying: &quot;We would like to act according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We would like to be free. We would like independence.&quot; Once in power, Khomeini took a firm line against dissent, warning opponents of theocracy for example: &quot;I repeat for the last time: abstain from holding meetings, from blathering, from publishing protests. Otherwise I will break your teeth.&quot;

Many of Khomeini&#x27;s political and religious ideas were considered to be progressive and reformist by leftist intellectuals and activists prior to the Revolution. Once in power, his ideas often clashed with those of modernist or secular Iranian intellectuals. This conflict came to a head during the writing of the Islamic constitution when many newspapers were closed by the government. Khomeini angrily told the intellectuals: &quot;Yes, we are reactionaries, and you are enlightened intellectuals: You intellectuals do not want us to go back 1400 years. You, who want freedom, freedom for everything, the freedom of parties, you who want all the freedoms, you intellectuals: freedom that will corrupt our youth, freedom that will pave the way for the oppressor, freedom that will drag our nation to the bottom.&quot;
In contrast to his alienation from Iranian intellectuals, and &quot;in an utter departure from all other Islamist movements&quot;, Khomeini embraced international revolution and Third World solidarity, giving it &quot;precedence over Muslim fraternity&quot;. From the time Khomeini&#x27;s supporters gained control of the media until his death, the Iranian media &quot;devoted extensive coverage to non-Muslim revolutionary movements (from the Sandinistas to the African National Congress and the Irish Republican Army) and downplayed the role of the Islamic movements considered conservative, such as the Afghan mujahidin.&quot; Khomeini&#x27;s supporters and pro-government media in Iran also argue that he was a fighter against racism, as Khomeini was a staunch critic of the Apartheid regime in South Africa. After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, anti-Apartheid activist and African National Congress president Oliver Tambo sent a letter to congratulate Khomeini for the success of the revolution. Former South African President Nelson Mandela stated several times that Khomeini served as an inspiration for the anti-apartheid movement. During the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, Khomeini ordered the release of all female and African-American staff working there.

Khomeini&#x27;s legacy to the economy of the Islamic Republic has been expressions of concern for the &quot;mustazafin&quot; (a Quranic term for the oppressed or deprived), but not always results that aided them. During the 1990s, the &quot;mustazafin&quot; and disabled war veterans rioted on several occasions, protesting the demolition of their shantytowns and rising food prices, among others. Khomeini&#x27;s disdain for the science of economics is said to have been &quot;mirrored&quot; by the populist redistribution policies of former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who allegedly wears &quot;his contempt for economic orthodoxy as a badge of honour&quot;, and has overseen sluggish growth and rising inflation and unemployment.

In 1963, Khomeini wrote a book in which he stated that there is no religious restriction on corrective surgery for transgender individuals. At the time Khomeini was an anti-Shah revolutionary and his fatwas did not carry any weight with the imperial government, which did not have any specific policies regarding transsexual individuals.
After 1979, his fatwa &quot;formed the basis for a national policy&quot; and perhaps in part because of a penal code that &quot;allows for the execution of homosexuals&quot;. As of 2005, Iran &quot;permits and partly finances seven times as many gender reassignment operations as the entire European Union&quot;.

== Appearance and habits ==

Khomeini was described as &quot;slim&quot;, but athletic and &quot;heavily boned&quot;. He was also known for his punctuality:

Khomeini was known for his aloofness and austere demeanor. He is said to have had &quot;variously inspired admiration, awe, and fear from those around him.&quot; His practice of moving &quot;through the halls of the madresehs never smiling at anybody or anything; his practice of ignoring his audience while he taught, contributed to his charisma.&quot; Khomeini adhered to traditional beliefs of Islamic hygienical jurisprudence holding that things like urine, excrement, blood, wine, and also non-Muslims were some of the eleven ritualistically &quot;impure&quot; things that physical contact with which while wet required ritual washing or Ghusl before prayer or salat. He is reported to have refused to eat or drink in a restaurant unless he knew for sure the waiter was a Muslim.

== Mystique ==

According to Baqer Moin, with the success of the revolution, not only had a personality cult developed around Khomeini, but he &quot;had been transformed into a semi-divine figure. He was no longer a grand ayatollah and deputy of the Imam, one who represents the Hidden Imam, but simply &#x27;The Imam&#x27;.&quot; Khomeini&#x27;s cult of personality fills a central position in foreign- and domestically targeted Iranian publications. The methods used to create his personality cult have been compared to those used by such figures as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro. An 8th-century Hadith attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim that said &quot;A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path. There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by violent winds, unsparing and relying on God&quot; was repeated in Iran as a tribute to Khomeini. (In Lebanon, however, this saying was also attributed to Musa al-Sadr.)

Khomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as &quot;Imam&quot;, a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early Shi&#x27;a. He was also associated with the &quot;Mahdi&quot; or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was &quot;Na&#x27;eb-e Imam&quot; (Deputy to the Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as &quot;taghut&quot; and &quot;Mofsed-e-filarz&quot;, religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah&#x27;s government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of &quot;fighting against the Twelfth Imam&quot;. When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini directly if he was the &#x27;promised Mahdi&#x27;, Khomeini did not answer, &quot;astutely&quot; neither confirming nor denying the title.

As the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe towards Khomeini, called him &quot;magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving&quot;. His image was as &quot;absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation&quot;:

The Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.

Even many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his &quot;messianic&quot; appeal. Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist Afshin Molavi writes that defenses of Khomeini are &quot;heard in the most unlikely settings&quot;:

Another journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who &quot;repeatedly&quot; makes the point &quot;that life had been better&quot; under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that &quot;the Imam&quot;—over 85 years old at the time and known to be ailing—might be dying, the critic becomes &quot;ashen faced&quot; and speechless, pronouncing the news to be &quot;terrible for my country&quot;. Non-Iranians were not immune from the effect. In 1982, after listening to a half-hour-long speech on the Quran by him, a Muslim scholar from South Africa, Sheikh Ahmad Deedat gushed:

== Family and descendants ==

In 1929, or possibly 1931, Khomeini married Khadijeh Saqafi, the daughter of a cleric in Tehran. Some sources report that Khomeini married Saqafi when she was ten years old, while others state that she was fifteen years old. By all accounts, their marriage was harmonious and happy. She died on 21 March 2009 at the age of 93. They had seven children, though only five survived infancy. His daughters all married into either merchant or clerical families, and both his sons entered into religious life. Mostafa, the elder son, died in 1977 while in exile in Najaf, Iraq with his father and was rumored by supporters of his father to have been murdered by SAVAK. Ahmad Khomeini, who died in 1995 at the age of 50, was also rumoured to be a victim of foul play but this time at the hands of Ali Khamenei&#x27;s regime. Zahra Mostafavi, a professor at the University of Tehran and still alive, is perhaps his &quot;most prominent daughter&quot;.

Khomeini&#x27;s fifteen grandchildren include:
* Zahra Eshraghi, granddaughter, married to Mohammad-Reza Khatami, head of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the main reformist party in the country, and is considered a pro-reform character herself.
* Hassan Khomeini, Khomeini&#x27;s elder grandson Sayid Hasan Khomeini, son of the Seyyed Ahmad Khomeini, is a cleric and the trustee of the Mausoleum of Khomeini and also has shown support for the reform movement in Iran, and Mir-Hossein Mousavi&#x27;s call to cancel the 2009 election results.
* Husain Khomeini (Sayid Husain Khomeini), Khomeini&#x27;s other grandson, son of Sayid Mustafa Khomeini, is a mid-level cleric who is strongly against the system of the Islamic republic. In 2003, he was quoted as saying: &quot;Iranians need freedom now, and if they can only achieve it with American interference I think they would welcome it. As an Iranian, I would welcome it.&quot; In that same year Husain Khomeini visited the United States, where he met figures such as Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah and the pretender to the Sun Throne. Later that year, Husain returned to Iran after receiving an urgent message from his grandmother. According to Michael Ledeen, quoting &quot;family sources&quot;, he was blackmailed into returning. In 2006, he called for an American invasion and overthrow of the Islamic Republic, telling Al-Arabiyah television station viewers: &quot;If you were a prisoner, what would you do? I want someone to break the prison [doors open].&quot;
* Another of Khomeini&#x27;s grandchildren, Ali Eshraghi, was disqualified from the 2008 parliamentary elections on grounds of being insufficiently loyal to the principles of the Islamic revolution but later reinstated.
