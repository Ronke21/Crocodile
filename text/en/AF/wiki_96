<text>Silesia (see names below) is a historical region of Central Europe that lies mostly within Poland, with small parts in the Czech Republic and Germany. Its area is approximately , and the population is estimated at 8,000,000. Silesia is split into two main subregions, Lower Silesia in the west and Upper Silesia in the east. Silesia has a diverse culture, including architecture, costumes, cuisine, traditions, and the Silesian language (minority in Upper Silesia). The largest city of the region is Wrocław.

Silesia is situated along the Oder River, with the Sudeten Mountains extending across the southern border. The region contains many historical landmarks and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is also rich in mineral and natural resources, and includes several important industrial areas. The largest city and Lower Silesia&#x27;s capital is Wrocław; the historic capital of Upper Silesia is Opole. The biggest metropolitan area is the Katowice metropolitan area, the centre of which is Katowice. Parts of the Czech city of Ostrava and the German city of Görlitz are within Silesia&#x27;s borders.

Silesia&#x27;s borders and national affiliation have changed over time, both when it was a hereditary possession of noble houses and after the rise of modern nation-states, resulting in an abundance of castles, especially in the Jelenia Góra valley. The first known states to hold power in Silesia were probably those of Greater Moravia at the end of the 9th century and Bohemia early in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Silesia was incorporated into the early Polish state, and after its fragmentation in the 12th century it formed the Duchy of Silesia, a provincial duchy of Poland. As a result of further fragmentation, Silesia was divided into many duchies, ruled by various lines of the Polish Piast dynasty. In the 14th century, it became a constituent part of the Bohemian Crown Lands under the Holy Roman Empire, which passed to the Austrian Habsburg monarchy in 1526; however, a number of duchies remained under the rule of Polish dukes from the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski as formal Bohemian fiefdoms, some until the 17th–18th centuries. As a result of the Silesian Wars, the region was annexed by the German state of Prussia from Austria in 1742.

After World War I, when the Poles and Czechs regained their independence, the easternmost part of Upper Silesia became again part of Poland by the decision of the Entente Powers after insurrections by Poles and the Upper Silesian plebiscite, while the remaining former Austrian parts of Silesia were divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland. During World War II, as a result of German occupation the entire region was under control of Nazi Germany. In 1945, after World War II, most of the German-held Silesia was transferred to Polish jurisdiction by the Potsdam Agreement between the victorious Allies and became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime. The small Lusatian strip west of the Oder–Neisse line, which had belonged to Silesia since 1815, became part of East Germany.

As the result of the forced population shifts of 1945–48, today&#x27;s inhabitants of Silesia speak the national languages of their respective countries. Previously German-speaking Lower Silesia has developed a new mixed Polish dialect and novel costumes. There is ongoing debate about whether the Silesian language, common in Upper Silesia, should be considered a dialect of Polish or a separate language. The Lower Silesian German dialect is nearing extinction due to its speakers&#x27; expulsion.

==Etymology==

The names of Silesia in different languages most likely share their etymology— ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Latin, Spanish and English: &quot;Silesia&quot;; ; ; . The names all relate to the name of a river (now Ślęza) and mountain (Mount Ślęża) in mid-southern Silesia, which served as a place of cult for pagans before Christianization.

&quot;Ślęża&quot; is listed as one of the numerous Pre-Indo-European topographic names in the region (see old European hydronymy). According to some Polonists, the name &quot;Ślęża&quot; or &quot;Ślęż&quot; is directly related to the Old Polish words &quot;ślęg&quot; or &quot;śląg&quot; , which means dampness, moisture, or humidity. They disagree with the hypothesis of an origin for the name &quot;Śląsk&quot; from the name of the Silings tribe.
In Polish common usage, &quot;Śląsk&quot; refers to traditionally Polish Upper Silesia and today&#x27;s Silesian Voivodeship, but less to Lower Silesia, which is different from Upper Silesia in many respects as its population was predominantly German-speaking from around the mid 19th century until 1945–48.

==History==

In the fourth century BC from the south, through the Kłodzko Valley, the Celts entered Silesia, and settled around Mount Ślęża near modern Wrocław, Oława and Strzelin.
Germanic Lugii tribes were first recorded within Silesia in the 1st century BC. West Slavs and Lechites arrived in the region around the 7th century, and by the early ninth century, their settlements had stabilized. Local West Slavs started to erect boundary structures like the Silesian Przesieka and the Silesia Walls. The eastern border of Silesian settlement was situated to the west of the Bytom, and east from Racibórz and Cieszyn. East of this line dwelt a closely related Lechitic tribe, the Vistulans. Their northern border was in the valley of the Barycz River, north of which lived the Western Polans tribe who gave Poland its name.

The first known states in Silesia were Greater Moravia and Bohemia. In the 10th century, the Polish ruler Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty incorporated Silesia into the newly established Polish state. In 1000, the Diocese of Wrocław was established as the oldest Catholic diocese in the region, and one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, subjugated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno. Poland repulsed German invasions of Silesia in 1017 at Niemcza and in 1109 at Głogów. During the Fragmentation of Poland, Silesia and the rest of the country were divided into many smaller duchies ruled by various Silesian dukes. In 1178, parts of the Duchy of Kraków around Bytom, Oświęcim, Chrzanów, and Siewierz were transferred to the Silesian Piasts, although their population was primarily Vistulan and not of Silesian descent. 

Walloons came to Silesia as one of the first foreign immigrant groups in Poland, probably settling in Wrocław since the 12th century, with further Walloon immigrants invited by Duke Henry the Bearded in the early 13th century. Since the 13th century, German cultural and ethnic influence increased as a result of immigration from German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire.
The first granting of municipal privileges in Poland took place in the region, with the granting of rights for Złotoryja by Henry the Bearded. Medieval municipal rights modeled after Lwówek Śląski and Środa Śląska, both established by Henry the Bearded, became the basis of municipal form of government for several cities and towns in Poland, and two of five local Polish variants of medieval town rights. The Book of Henryków, which contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language, as well as a document which contains the oldest printed text in Polish, were created in Henryków and Wrocław in Silesia, respectively.

In 1241, the Mongols conducted their first invasion of Poland, causing widespread panic and mass flight. They looted much of the region and defeated the combined Polish, Moravian and German forces led by Duke Henry II the Pious at the Battle of Legnica, which took place at Legnickie Pole near the city of Legnica. Upon the death of Orda Khan, the Mongols chose not to press forward further into Europe, but returned east to participate in the election of a new Grand Khan (leader).

Between 1289 and 1292, Bohemian king Wenceslaus II became &quot;suzerain&quot; of some of the Upper Silesian duchies. Polish monarchs had not renounced their hereditary rights to Silesia until 1335. The province became part of the Bohemian Crown which was part of the Holy Roman Empire; however, a number of duchies remained under the rule of the Polish dukes from the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski as formal Bohemian fiefdoms, some until the 17th–18th centuries. In 1469, sovereignty over the region passed to Hungary, and in 1490, it returned to Bohemia. In 1526 Silesia passed with the Bohemian Crown to the Habsburg monarchy.

In the 15th century, several changes were made to Silesia&#x27;s borders. Parts of the territories that had been transferred to the Silesian Piasts in 1178 were bought by the Polish kings in the second half of the 15th century (the Duchy of Oświęcim in 1457; the Duchy of Zator in 1494). The Bytom area remained in the possession of the Silesian Piasts, though it was a part of the Diocese of Kraków. The Duchy of Krosno Odrzańskie () was inherited by the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1476 and with the renunciation of King Ferdinand I and the estates of Bohemia in 1538, became an integral part of Brandenburg. From 1645 until 1666, the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz was held in pawn by the Polish House of Vasa as dowry of the Polish queen Cecylia Renata.

In 1742, most of Silesia was seized by King Frederick II of Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession, eventually becoming the Prussian Province of Silesia in 1815; consequently, Silesia became part of the German Empire when it was proclaimed in 1871. The Silesian capital Breslau became at that time one of the big cities in Germany. Breslau was a center of Jewish life in Germany and an important place of science (university) and industry (manufacturing of locomotives). German mass tourism started in the Silesian mountain region (Hirschberg, Schneekoppe). 

After World War I, a part of Silesia, Upper Silesia, was contested by Germany and the newly independent Second Polish Republic. The League of Nations organized a plebiscite to decide the issue in 1921. It resulted in 60% of votes being cast for Germany and 40% for Poland. Following the third Silesian uprising (1921), however, the easternmost portion of Upper Silesia (including Katowice), with a majority ethnic Polish population, was awarded to Poland, becoming the Silesian Voivodeship. The Prussian Province of Silesia within Germany was then divided into the provinces of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. Meanwhile, Austrian Silesia, the small portion of Silesia retained by Austria after the Silesian Wars, was mostly awarded to the new Czechoslovakia (becoming known as Czech Silesia and Trans-Olza), although most of Cieszyn and territory to the east of it went to Poland.

Polish Silesia was among the first regions invaded during Germany&#x27;s 1939 attack on Poland, which started World War II. One of the claimed goals of Nazi German occupation, particularly in Upper Silesia, was the extermination of those whom Nazis viewed as &quot;subhuman&quot;, namely Jews and ethnic Poles. The Polish and Jewish population of the then Polish part of Silesia was subjected to genocide involving expulsions, mass murder and deportation to Nazi concentration camps and forced labour camps, while Germans were settled in pursuit of . Two thousand Polish intellectuals, politicians, and businessmen were murdered in the in 1940 as part of a Poland-wide Germanization program. Silesia also housed one of the two main wartime centers where medical experiments were conducted on kidnapped Polish children by Nazis. Czech Silesia was occupied by Germany as part of so-called Sudetenland. In Silesia, Nazi Germany operated the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, several prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs (incl. the major Stalag VIII-A, Stalag VIII-B, Stalag VIII-C camps), numerous Nazi prisons and thousands of forced labour camps, including a network of forced labour camps solely for Poles (), subcamps of prisons, POW camps and of the Gross-Rosen and Auschwitz concentration camps.

The Potsdam Conference of 1945 defined the Oder-Neisse line as the border between Germany and Poland, pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place. At the end of WWII, Germans in Silesia fled from the battle ground, assuming they would be able to return when the war was over. However, they could not return, and those who had stayed were expelled and a new Polish population, including people displaced from former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and from Central Poland, joined the surviving native Polish inhabitants of the region. After 1945 and in 1946, nearly all of the 4.5 million Silesians of German descent fled, or were interned in camps and expelled, including some thousand German Jews who survived the Holocaust and had returned to Silesia.
The newly formed Polish United Workers&#x27; Party created a Ministry of the Recovered Territories that claimed half of the available arable land for state-run collectivized farms. Many of the new Polish Silesians who resented the Germans for their invasion in 1939 and brutality in occupation now resented the newly formed Polish communist government for their population shifting and interference in agricultural and industrial affairs.

The administrative division of Silesia within Poland has changed several times since 1945. Since 1999, it has been divided between Lubusz Voivodeship, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Opole Voivodeship, and Silesian Voivodeship. Czech Silesia is now part of the Czech Republic, forming part of the Moravian-Silesian Region and the northern part of the Olomouc Region. Germany retains the Silesia-Lusatia region ( or ) west of the Neisse, which is part of the federal state of Saxony.

The region was affected by the 1997, 2010 and 2024 Central European floods.

==Geography==

Most of Silesia is relatively flat, although its southern border is generally mountainous. It is primarily located in a swath running along both banks of the upper and middle Oder (Odra) River, but it extends eastwards to the upper Vistula River. The region also includes many tributaries of the Oder, including the Bóbr (and its tributary the Kwisa), the Barycz and the Nysa Kłodzka. The Sudeten Mountains run along most of the southern edge of the region, though at its south-eastern extreme it reaches the Silesian Beskids and Moravian-Silesian Beskids, which belong to the Carpathian Mountains range.

Historically, Silesia was bounded to the west by the Kwisa and Bóbr Rivers, while the territory west of the Kwisa was in Upper Lusatia (earlier &quot;Milsko&quot;). However, because part of Upper Lusatia was included in the Province of Silesia in 1815, in Germany Görlitz, Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis and neighbouring areas are considered parts of historical Silesia. Those districts, along with Poland&#x27;s Lower Silesian Voivodeship and parts of Lubusz Voivodeship, make up the geographic region of Lower Silesia.

Silesia has undergone a similar notional extension at its eastern extreme. Historically, it extended only as far as the Brynica River, which separates it from Zagłębie Dąbrowskie in the Lesser Poland region. However, to many Poles today, Silesia () is understood to cover all of the area around Katowice, including Zagłębie. This interpretation is given official sanction in the use of the name Silesian Voivodeship () for the province covering this area. In fact, the word in Polish (when used without qualification) now commonly refers exclusively to this area (also called or Upper Silesia).

As well as the Katowice area, historical Upper Silesia also includes the Opole region (Poland&#x27;s Opole Voivodeship) and Czech Silesia. Czech Silesia consists of a part of the Moravian-Silesian Region and the Jeseník District in the Olomouc Region.

===Natural resources===
Silesia is a resource-rich and populous region. Since the middle of the 18th century, coal has been mined. The industry had grown while Silesia was part of Germany, and peaked in the 1970s under the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. During this period, Silesia became one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of coal, with a record tonnage in 1979. Coal mining declined during the next two decades, but has increased again following the end of Communist rule.

The 41 coal mines in Silesia are mostly part of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, which lies in the Silesian Upland. The coalfield has an area of about . Deposits in Lower Silesia have proven to be difficult to exploit and the area&#x27;s unprofitable mines were closed in 2000. In 2008, an estimated 35 billion tonnes of lignite reserves were found near Legnica, making them some of the largest in the world.

From the fourth century BC, iron ore has been mined in the upland areas of Silesia. The same period had lead, copper, silver, and gold mining. Zinc, cadmium, arsenic, and uranium have also been mined in the region. Lower Silesia features large copper mining and processing between the cities of Legnica, Głogów, Lubin, and Polkowice. In the Middle Ages, gold () and silver () were mined in the region, which is reflected in the names of the former mining towns of Złotoryja, Złoty Stok and Srebrna Góra.

The region is known for stone quarrying to produce limestone, marl, marble, and basalt.


The region also has a thriving agricultural sector, which produces cereals (wheat, rye, barley, oats, corn), potatoes, rapeseed, sugar beets and others. Milk production is well developed. The Opole Silesia has for decades occupied the top spot in Poland for their indices of effectiveness of agricultural land use.

Mountainous parts of southern Silesia feature many significant and attractive tourism destinations (e.g., Karpacz, Szczyrk, Wisła). Silesia is generally well forested. This is because greenness is generally highly desirable by the local population, particularly in the highly industrialized parts of Silesia.

===Demographics===
Silesia has been historically diverse in every aspect. Nowadays, the largest part of Silesia is located in Poland; it is often cited as one of the most diverse regions in that country.

The United States Immigration Commission, in its &quot;Dictionary of Races or Peoples&quot; (published in 1911, during a period of intense immigration from Silesia to the United States), considered Silesian as a geographical (not ethnic) term, denoting the inhabitants of Silesia. It is also mentioned the existence of both Polish Silesian and German Silesian dialects in that region.

====Ethnicity====
Modern Silesia is inhabited by Poles, Silesians, Germans, and Czechs. Germans first came to Silesia during the Late Medieval Ostsiedlung. The last Polish census of 2011 showed that the Silesians are the largest ethnic or national minority in Poland, Germans being the second; both groups are located mostly in Upper Silesia. The Czech part of Silesia is inhabited by Czechs, Moravians, Silesians, and Poles.

In the early 19th century the population of the Prussian part of Silesia was between 2/3 and 3/4 German-speaking, between 1/5 and 1/3 Polish-speaking, with Sorbs, Czechs, Moravians and Jews forming other smaller minorities (see Table 1. below).

Before the Second World War, Silesia was inhabited mostly by Germans, with Poles a large minority, forming a majority in Upper Silesia. Silesia was also the home of Czech and Jewish minorities. The German population tended to be based in the urban centres and in the rural areas to the north and west, whilst the Polish population was mostly rural and could be found in the east and in the south.

Ethnic structure of Prussian Upper Silesia (Opole regency) during the 19th century and the early 20th century can be found in Table 2.:
The Austrian part of Silesia had a mixed German, Polish and Czech population, with Polish-speakers forming a majority in Cieszyn Silesia.

====Religion====

Historically, Silesia was about equally split between Protestants (overwhelmingly Lutherans) and Roman Catholics. In an 1890 census taken in the German part, Roman Catholics made up a slight majority of 53%, while the remaining 47% were almost entirely Lutheran. Geographically speaking, Lower Silesia was mostly Lutheran except for the Glatzer Land (now Kłodzko County). Upper Silesia was mostly Roman Catholic except for some of its northwestern parts, which were predominantly Lutheran. Generally speaking, the population was mostly Protestant in the western parts, and it tended to be more Roman Catholic the further east one went. In Upper Silesia, Protestants were concentrated in larger cities and often identified as German. After World War II, the religious demographics changed drastically as Germans, who constituted the bulk of the Protestant population, were forcibly expelled. Poles, who were mostly Roman Catholic, were resettled in their place. Today, Silesia remains predominantly Roman Catholic.

Existing since the 12th century, Silesia&#x27;s Jewish community was concentrated around Wrocław and Upper Silesia, and numbered 48,003 (1.1% of the population) in 1890, decreasing to 44,985 persons (0.9%) by 1910. In Polish East Upper Silesia, the number of Jews was around 90,000–100,000. Historically, the community had suffered a number of localised expulsions such as their 1453 expulsion from Wrocław. From 1712 to 1820 a succession of men held the title Chief Rabbi of Silesia (&quot;Landesrabbiner&quot;): Naphtali ha-Kohen (1712–16); Samuel ben Naphtali (1716–22); Ḥayyim Jonah Te&#x27;omim (1722–1727); Baruch b. Reuben Gomperz (1733–54); Joseph Jonas Fränkel (1754–93); Jeremiah Löw Berliner (1793–99); Lewin Saul Fränkel (1800–7); Aaron Karfunkel (1807–16); and Abraham ben Gedaliah Tiktin (1816–20).

====Consequences of World War II====
After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, following Nazi racial policy, the Jewish population of Silesia was subjected to Nazi genocide with executions performed by Einsatzgruppe z. B.V. led by Udo von Woyrsch and Einsatzgruppe I led by Bruno Streckenbach, imprisonment in ghettos and ethnic cleansing to the General Government. In their efforts to exterminate the Jews through murder and ethnic cleansing Nazi established in Silesia province the Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen camps. Expulsions were carried out openly and reported in the local press. Those sent to ghettos would from 1942 be expelled to concentration and work camps. Between 5 May and 17 June, 20,000 Silesian Jews were sent to Birkenau to gas chambers and during August 1942, 10,000 to 13,000 Silesian Jews were murdered by gassing at Auschwitz. Most Jews in Silesia were exterminated by the Nazis. After the war Silesia became a major centre for repatriation of the Jewish population in Poland which survived Nazi German extermination and in autumn 1945, 15,000 Jews were in Lower Silesia, mostly Polish Jews returned from territories now belonging to Soviet Union, rising in 1946 to seventy thousand as Jewish survivors from other regions in Poland were relocated.

The majority of Germans fled or were expelled from the present-day Polish and Czech parts of Silesia during and after World War II. From June 1945 to January 1947, 1.77 million Germans were expelled from Lower Silesia, and 310,000 from Upper Silesia. Today, most German Silesians and their descendants live in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, many of them in the Ruhr area working as miners, like their ancestors in Silesia. One of its most notable but controversial spokesmen was the Christian Democratic Union politician Herbert Hupka.

The expulsion of Germans led to widespread underpopulation. The population of the town of Głogów fell from 33,500 to 5,000, and from 1939 to 1966 the population of Wrocław fell by 25%. Attempts to repopulate Silesia proved unsuccessful in the 1940s and 1950s, and Silesia&#x27;s population did not reach pre-war levels until the late 1970s. The Polish settlers who repopulated Silesia were partly from the former Polish Eastern Borderlands, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939. Wrocław was partly repopulated with refugees from the formerly Polish city of Lwów.

===Cities and towns===
The following table includes the cities and towns in Silesia with a population greater than 20,000 (2022).

* Only part in Silesia

== Flags and coats of arms ==
The emblems of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia originate from the emblems of the Piasts of Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. The coat of arms of Upper Silesia depicts the golden eagle on the blue shield. The coat of arms of Lower Silesia depicts a black eagle on a golden (yellow) shield.

Flags with their colors refer to the coat of arms of Silesia.

<text>The Sudetes ( ), also known as the Sudeten Mountains or Sudetic Mountains, is a geomorphological subprovince of the Bohemian Massif province in Central Europe, shared by the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. They consist mainly of mountain ranges and are the highest part of Bohemian Massif. They stretch from the Saxon capital of Dresden in the northwest across to the region of Lower Silesia in Poland and to the Moravian Gate in the Czech Republic in the east. Geographically the Sudetes are a &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; with some characteristics typical of high mountains. Its plateaus and subtle summit relief makes the Sudetes more akin to mountains of Northern Europe than to the Alps.

In the east of the Sudetes, the Moravian Gate and Ostrava Basin separates from the Carpathian Mountains. The Sudetes&#x27; highest mountain is Mount Sněžka/Śnieżka , which is also the highest mountain of the Czech Republic, Bohemia, Silesia, and Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the Giant Mountains, lying on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland. Mount Praděd (1,491 m/4,893 ft) in the Hrubý Jeseník mountains is the highest mountain of Moravia. Lusatia&#x27;s highest point (1,072 m/3,517 ft) lies on Mount Smrk/Smrek in the Jizera Mountains, and the Sudetes&#x27; highest mountain in Germany, which is also the country&#x27;s highest mountain east of the river Elbe, is Mount Lausche/Luž (793 m/2,600 ft) in the Zittau Mountains, the highest part of the Lusatian Mountains. The most notable rivers rising in the Sudetes are Elbe, Oder, Spree, Morava, Bóbr, Lusatian Neisse, Eastern Neisse, Jizera and Kwisa. The highest parts of the Sudetes are protected by national parks; Karkonosze and Stołowe (Table) in Poland and Krkonoše in the Czech Republic.

In the west, the Sudetes border with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The westernmost point of the Sudetes lies in the Dresden Heath (&quot;Dresdner Heide&quot;), the westernmost part of the West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands, in Dresden.

The Sudeten Germans (the German-speaking inhabitants of Czechoslovakia) as well as the Sudetenland (the border regions of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia they inhabited) are named after the Sudetes.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Sudetes&quot; is derived from &quot;Sudeti montes&quot;, a Latinization of the name &quot;Soudeta ore&quot; used in the &quot;Geographia&quot; by the Greco-Roman writer Ptolemy (Book 2, Chapter 10) for a range of mountains in Germania in the general region of the modern Czech Republic.

There is no consensus about which mountains he meant, and he could for example have intended the Ore Mountains, joining the modern Sudetes to their west, or even (according to Schütte) the Bohemian Forest (although this is normally considered to be equivalent to Ptolemy&#x27;s Gabreta forest). The modern Sudetes are probably Ptolemy&#x27;s Askiburgion mountains.

Ptolemy wrote &quot;Σούδητα&quot; in Greek, which is a neuter plural. Latin &quot;mons&quot;, however, is a masculine, hence Sudeti. The Latin version, and the modern geographical identification, is likely to be a scholastic innovation, as it is not attested in classical Latin literature. The meaning of the name is not known. In one hypothetical derivation, it means &quot;Mountains of Wild Boars&quot;, relying on Indo-European *su-, &quot;pig&quot;. A better etymology perhaps is from Latin &quot;sudis&quot;, plural &quot;sudes&quot;, &quot;spines&quot;, which can be used of spiny fish or spiny terrain.

High Sudetes (, , ) is together name for the ranges of Giant Mountains, Hrubý Jeseník and Králický Sněžník Mountains.

== Climate ==
The highest mountains, those located along the Czech–Polish border have annual precipitations around . The Table Mountains, which reach in elevation, have precipitations ranging from at lower locations to in the upper parts, with July being the rainiest month. Snow cover at the Table Mountains typically last 70 to 95 days depending on altitude.

== Vegetation ==
Settlement, logging and clearance has left forest pockets in the foothills with dense and continuous forest being found in the upper parts of the mountains. Due to logging in the last centuries little remains of the broad-leaf trees like beech, sycamore, ash and littleleaf linden that were once common in the Sudetes. Instead Norway spruce was planted in their place in the early 19th century, in some places amounting to monocultures. To provide more space for spruce plantations various peatlands were drained in the 19th and 20th century. Some spruce plantations have suffered severe damage as the seeds used came from lowland specimens that were not adapted to mountain conditions. Silver fir grow naturally in the Sudetes being more widespread in past times, before clearance since the Late Middle Ages and subsequent industrial pollution reduced the stands.

Many arctic-alpine and alpine vascular plants have a disjunct distribution being notably absent from the central Sudetes despite suitable habitats. Possibly this is the result a warm period during the Holocene (last 10,000 years) which wiped out cold-adapted vascular plants in the medium-sized mountains of the central Sudetes where there was no higher ground that could serve as refugia. Besides altitude the distribution of some alpine plants is influenced by soil. This is the case of &quot;Aster alpinus&quot; that grows preferentially on calcareous ground. Other alpine plants such as &quot;Cardamine amara&quot;, &quot;Epilobium anagallidifolium&quot;, &quot;Luzula sudetica&quot; and &quot;Solidago virgaurea&quot; occur beyond their altitudinal zonation in very humid areas.

Peatlands are common in the mountains occurring on high plateaus or in valley bottoms. Fens occur at slopes.

=== Timber line ===
The higher mountains of the Sudetes lie above the timber line which is made up of Norway spruce. Spruces in wind-exposed areas display features such as flag tree disposition of branches, tilted stems and elongated stem cross sections. Forest-free areas above the timber line have increased historically by deforestation yet lowering of the timber line by human activity is minimal. Areas above the timber line appear discontinuously as &quot;islands&quot; in the Sudetes. In the Giant Mountains the timber line lies at &quot;c&quot;. 1230 m a.s.l. while to the southeast in the Hrubý Jeseník mountains it lie at &quot;c&quot;. 1310 m a.s.l. Part of the Hrubý Jeseník mountains have been above the timber line for no less than 5000 years. Mountains rise considerably above the timber line, at most 400 m, a characteristic that sets the Sudetes apart from other &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; of Central Europe.

== Geology ==
Geological research has been hampered by the multinational geography of the Sudetes with and the limitation of studies to state boundaries.

=== Bedrock ===

The igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Sudetes originated during the Variscan orogeny and its aftermath. The Sudetes are the northeasternmost accessible part of Variscan orogen as in the North European Plain the orogen is buried beneath sediments. Plate tectonic movements during the Variscan orogeny assembled together four major and two to three lesser tectonostratigraphic terranes. The assemblage of the terranes ought to have involved the closure of at least two ocean basins containing oceanic crust and marine sediments. This is reflected in the ophiolites, MORB-basalts, blueschists and eclogites that occur in-between terranes. Various terranes of the Sudetes are likely extensions of the Armorican terrane while other terranes may be the fringes of the ancient Baltica continent. One possibility for the amalgamation of terranes in the Sudetes is that the Góry Sowie-Kłodzko terrane collided with the Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane causing the closure of a small oceanic basin. This event led to obduction of the Central Sudetic ophiolite in the Devonian period. In the Early Carboniferous the joint Góry Sowie-Kłodzko-Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane collided with the Brunovistulian terrane. This last terrane was part of the Old Red Continent and could correspond either to Baltica or the eastern tip of the narrow Avalonia terrane. Also by the Early Carboniferous the Saxothuringian terrane collided with the Góry Sowie-Kłodzko-Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane closing the Rheic Ocean.

Once the main phase of deformation of the orogeny was over basins that had formed in-between metamorphic rock massifs were filled by sedimentary rock in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. During and after sedimentation large granitic plutons intruded the crust. Viewed in a map today these plutons make up about 15% the Sudetes. Granites are of S-type. The granites and grantic-gneisses of Izera in the west Sudetes are disassociated from orogeny and thought to have formed during rifting along a passive continental margin. The Karkonosze Granite, also in the west Sudetes, have been dated to have formed &quot;c&quot;. 318 million years ago at the beginning of the Variscan orogeny. The Karkonosze Granite is intruded by somewhat younger lamprophyre dykes.

A NW-SE to WNW-ESE oriented strike-slip fault —the Intra-Sudetic fault— runs through the length of the Sudetes. The Intra-Sudetic fault is parallel with the Upper Elbe fault and Middle Oder fault. Other main faults at the sudetes are also NW-SE oriented, dextral and of strike slip type. These include the Tłumaczów-Sienna Fault and the Marginal Sudetic Fault.

=== Volcanism and thermal waters ===

There are remnants of lava flows and volcanic plugs in the Sudetes. The volcanic rocks making up these outcrops are of mafic chemistry and include basanite and represent episodes of volcanism in the Oligocene and Miocene periods. Volcanism affected not only the Sudetes but also parts of the Sudetic foreland being part of a SW-NE oriented Bohemo-Silesian Belt of volcanic rocks. Mantle xenoliths have been recovered from the lavas of a volcano at Ještěd-Kozákov Ridge in the Czech western Sudetes. These pyroxenite xenoliths arrived to surface from approximate depths of 35, 70 and 73 km and indicate a complex history for the mantle beneath the Sudetes.

There are thermal springs in the Sudetes with measured temperatures of 29 to 44 °C. Drilling has revealed the existence of waters at 87 °C at depths of 2000 m. These modern waters are believed to be associated to the Late Cenozoic volcanism in Central Europe.

=== Uplift and landforms ===

The Sudetes forms the NE border of the Bohemian Massif. In detail the Sudetes is made up of a series of massifs that are rectangular and rhomboid in plan view. These mountains corresponds to horsts and domes separated by basins, including grabens. The mountains took their present form after the Late Mesozoic retreat of the seas from the area which left the Sudetes subject to denudation for at least 65 million years. This meant that during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic 8 to 4 km of rock was eroded from the top of what is now the Sudetes. Concurrently with the Cenozoic denudation the climate cooled due to the northward drift of Europe. The collision between Africa and Europe has resulted in the deformation and uplift of the Sudetes. As such the uplift is related to the contemporary rise of the Alps and Carpathians. The acceleration of uplift of the Sudetes occurred during the Middle Miocene because of the Bohemian Massif&#x27;s growth. Uplift was accomplished by the creation or reactivation of numerous faults leading to a reshaping of the relief by renewed erosion. Various &quot;hanging valleys&quot; attest to this uplift. Block tectonics has uplifted or sunken crustal blocks. While the Late Cenozoic uplift has uplifted the Sudetes as a whole some grabens precede this uplift.

Weathering during the Cenozoic led to the formation of an etchplain in parts of Sudetes. While this etchplain has been eroded various landforms and weathering mantles have been suggested to attest its former existence. At present the mountain range shows a remarkable diversity of landforms. Some of the landforms present are escarpments, inselbergs, bornhardts, granitic domes, tors, flared slopes and weathering pits. Various escarpments have originated from faults and may reach heights of up to 500 m. To the northeast the Sudetes is separated from the Sudetic foreland by a sharp mountain front made up of an escarpment linked to the Sudetic Marginal Fault. Near Kaczawa this escarpment reaches 80 to 120 m in height. The relative influence of Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic movements and erosion in shaping the mountain landscape may vary along the northern front of the Sudetes.

During the Quaternary glaciations the Giant Mountains was the most glaciated part of the Sudetes. Evidence of this are its glacial cirques and the glacial valleys that develop next to it. The precise timing of the glaciations in the Sudetes is poorly constrained. Parts of the Sudetes remained free from glacier ice developing permafrost soils and periglacial landforms such as rock glaciers, nivation hollows, patterned ground, blockfields, solifluction landforms, blockstreams, tors and cryoplanation terraces. The occurrence or not of these periglacial landforms depends on altitude, the steepness and direction of slopes and the underlying rock type.

=== Mass wasting ===
Other than debris flows there is little contemporary mass wasting in the mountains. Avalanches are common in the Sudetes.

== History ==
The area around the Sudetes had by the 12th century been relatively densely settled with agriculture and settlements expanding further in the High Middle Ages from the 13th century onward. The majority of settlers were Germans from neighbouring Silesia, founding typical &quot;Waldhufendörfer&quot;. As this trend went on thinning of forest and deforestation had turned clearly unsustainable by the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries agriculture had reached the inner part of Table Mountains in the Central Sudetes. Destruction and degradation of the Sudetes forest peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries with demand of firewood coming from glasshouses that operated through the area in the early modern period.

Some limited form of forest management begun in the 18th century while in the industrial age demand for firewood was sustained by metallurgic industries in the settlements and cities around the mountains. In the 19th century the Central Sudetes had an economic boom with sandstone quarrying and a flourishing tourism industry centered on the natural scenery. Despite this there was at least since the 1880s a trend of depopulation of villages and hamlets which continued into the 20th century. Since World War II various areas that were cleared of forest have been re-naturalized. Industrial activity across Europe has caused considerable damage to the forests as acid rain and heavy metals has arrived with westerly and southwesterly winds. Silver firs have proven particularly vulnerable to industrial soil contamination.

=== Sudetes and &quot;Sudetenland&quot; ===

After World War I, the name &quot;Sudetenland&quot; came into use to describe areas of the First Czechoslovak Republic with large ethnic German populations. In 1918, the short-lived rump state of German-Austria proclaimed a Province of the Sudetenland in northern Moravia and Austrian Silesia around the city of Opava (&quot;Troppau&quot;).

The term was used in a wider sense when on 1 October 1933 Konrad Henlein founded the Sudeten German Party and in Nazi German parlance &quot;Sudetendeutsche&quot; (Sudeten Germans) referred to all autochthonous ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia. They were heavily clustered in the entire mountainous periphery of Czechoslovakia—not only in the former Moravian &quot;Provinz Sudetenland&quot; but also along the northwestern Bohemian borderlands with German Lower Silesia, Saxony and Bavaria, in an area formerly called German Bohemia. In total, the German minority population of interwar Czechoslovakia numbered around 20% of the total national population.

Sparking the Sudeten Crisis, Adolf Hitler got his future enemies Britain and France to concede the &quot;Sudetenland&quot; with most of the Czechoslovak border fortifications in the 1938 Munich Agreement, leaving the remainder of Czechoslovakia shorn of its natural borders and buffer zone, finally occupied by Germany in March 1939. After being annexed by Nazi Germany, much of the region was redesignated as the &quot;Reichsgau Sudetenland&quot;.

After World War II, most of the previous population of the Sudetes was forcibly expelled on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement and the Beneš decrees, and the region was resettled by new Polish and Czechoslovak citizens. A considerable proportion of the Czechoslovak populace thereafter strongly objected to the use of the term &quot;Sudety&quot;. In the Czech Republic the designation &quot;Krkonošsko-jesenická subprovincie&quot; is used in academic context and usually only the discrete Czech names for the individual mountain ranges (e.g. Giant Mountains) appear, as under Subdivisions above.

== Economy and tourism ==

Part of the economy of the Sudetes is dedicated to tourism. Coal mining towns like Wałbrzych have re-oriented their economies towards tourism since the decline of mining in the 1980s. As of 2000 scholar Krzysztof R. Mazurski judged that the Sudetes, much like Poland&#x27;s Baltic coast and the Carpathians, were unlikely to attract much foreign tourism. Sandstone was quarried in Sudetes during the 19th and 20th centuries. Likewise volcanic rock has also been quarried to such degree untouched volcanoes are scarce. Sandstone labyrinths have been a notable tourist attraction since the 19th century with considerable investments being done in projecting trails some of which involve rock engineering.

In the Sudetes there are many spa towns with sanatoria. In many places the developed tourist base – hotels, guest houses, ski infrastructure.

The nearest international airports are Dresden Airport in Dresden and Wrocław Airport in Wrocław.

<text>Sigismund Báthory (; 1573 – 27 March 1613) was Prince of Transylvania several times between 1586 and 1602, and Duke of Racibórz and Opole in Silesia in 1598. His father, Christopher Báthory, ruled Transylvania as voivode (or deputy) of the absent prince, Stephen Báthory. Sigismund was still a child when the Diet of Transylvania elected him voivode at his dying father&#x27;s request in 1581. Initially, regency councils administered Transylvania on his behalf, but Stephen Báthory made János Ghyczy the sole regent in 1585. Sigismund adopted the title of prince after Stephen Báthory died.

The Diet proclaimed Sigismund to be of age in 1588, but only after he agreed to expel the Jesuits. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated him, but the ban was lifted in 1590, and the Jesuits returned a year later. His blatant favoritism towards the Catholics made him unpopular among his Protestant subjects. He decided to join the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire. Since he could not convince the Diet to support his plan, he renounced the throne in July 1594, but the commanders of the army convinced him to revoke his abdication. At their proposal, he purged the noblemen who opposed the war against the Ottomans. He officially joined the Holy League and married Maria Christina of Habsburg, a niece of the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II. The marriage was never consummated.

Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, and Ștefan Răzvan, Voivode of Moldavia, acknowledged his suzerainty. Their united forces defeated an Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu. The triumph was followed by a series of Ottoman victories, and Sigismund abdicated in favor of Rudolph II in early 1598, receiving the duchies of Racibórz and Opole as a compensation. His maternal uncle, Stephen Bocskai, persuaded him to return in late summer, but he could not make peace with the Ottoman Empire. He renounced Transylvania in favor of Andrew Báthory and settled in Poland in 1599. During the following years, Transylvania was regularly pillaged by unpaid mercenaries and Ottoman marauders. Sigismund returned at the head of a Polish army in 1601, but he could not strengthen his position. He again abdicated in favor of Rudolph and settled in Bohemia in June 1602. After he was accused of a conspiracy against the emperor, he spent fourteen months in jail in Prague in 1610 and 1611. He died at his Bohemian estate.

== Early life ==

Sigismund was the son of Christopher Báthory and his second wife, Elisabeth Bocskai. He was born in Várad (now Oradea in Romania) in 1573, according to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy. At the time of Sigismund&#x27;s birth, his uncle, Stephen Báthory, was the voivode of Transylvania. After being elected King of Poland in late 1575, Stephen Báthory adopted the title of Prince of Transylvania and made Sigismund&#x27;s father voivode. Stephen Báthory set up a separate chancellery in Kraków to supervise the administration of the principality.

Sigismund&#x27;s father and uncle were Roman Catholic, but his mother was Calvinist. According to the Jesuit Antonio Possevino, Sigismund demonstrated his devotion to Catholicism already at the age of seven. His mother mocked him for his piety, saying that he only wanted to secure his uncle&#x27;s goodwill. Sigismund was especially hostile towards the Anti-Trinitarians in his youth. His mother died in early 1581.

== Reign ==

=== Voivode ===

Christopher Báthory fell seriously ill after his wife&#x27;s death. At his request, the Diet of Transylvania elected Sigismund voivode in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca in Romania) around 15May 1581. Since Sigismund was still a minor, his dying father tasked a council of twelve noblemen with the government. Christopher Báthory&#x27;s cousin, Dénes Csáky, and his brother-in-law, Stephen Bocskai, headed the council. Christopher Báthory died on 27May.

The Ottoman Sultan, Murad III, confirmed Sigismund&#x27;s election on 3July 1581, reminding him of his obligation to pay a yearly tribute of 15,000 florins. However, Pál Márkházy, a young nobleman who lived in Istanbul, offered to double the tribute and to pay an additional tax of 100,000 florins if he was made the ruler of Transylvania. The Grand Vizier, Koca Sinan Pasha, supported Márkházy&#x27;s claim. Taking advantage of the situation, Murad demanded the same payments from Sigismund, but Stephen Báthory and the &quot;Three Nations of Transylvania&quot; resisted. After receiving the customary tribute from Transylvania, the sultan again confirmed Sigismund&#x27;s rule in November 1581.

Stephen Báthory who took charge of Sigismund&#x27;s education confirmed the position of his Jesuit tutors, János Leleszi and Gergely Vásárhelyi. According to Szamosközy, Stephen Báthory also ordered Sigismund&#x27;s companions to talk of foreign lands, wars, and hunting with him during their dinners together. He reorganized the government on 3May 1583, charging Sándor Kendi, Farkas Kovacsóczy, and László Sombori with the administration of Transylvania during Sigismund&#x27;s minority. The Diet suggested to Stephen Báthory that he dismiss them, but he only dissolved the council on 1May 1585. He replaced the three councillors with the devout Calvinist János Ghyczy, making him regent for Sigismund.

=== Prince under guardianship ===

Sigismund adopted the title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. He was still a minor, and Ghyczy continued to rule as regent. Sigismund was one of the candidates to the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors knew that he had little chance to win, but they wanted to demonstrate that the Báthorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacsóczy officially announced Sigismund&#x27;s application at the &quot;Sejm&quot; (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.

Sigismund&#x27;s cousins, Balthasar and Stephen Báthory, returned from Poland to Transylvania. Balthasar wanted to take charge of the government, making his court at Fogaras (present-day Făgăraș in Romania) the center of those who opposed Ghyczy&#x27;s rule. Kovacsóczy, the chancellor of Transylvania, remained neutral in the conflict.

In October 1588 the Diet proposed to declare the sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, mainly because he did not want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund&#x27;s cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.

=== Internal conflicts ===

Sigismund took the customary oath of the Transylvanian monarchs on 23December 1588. Pope Sixtus V excommunicated him for the expulsion of the Jesuits. Sigismund&#x27;s cousin, Cardinal Andrew Báthory, urged the pope to lift the ban, saying that the prince&#x27;s Protestant advisors had forced him to throw out the priests. The pope authorized Sigismund to employ a confessor in May 1589, and the excommunication was revoked on Easter 1590.

Sigismund made several attempts to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church, especially by appointing Catholics to the highest positions of state administration. Carillo and other Jesuit priests returned to Sigismund&#x27;s court in disguise in early 1591. Sigismund met Andrew and Balthasar Báthory in August to seek their support for the legalization of the Jesuits&#x27; presence, but they refused to stand by the priests at the Diet.

Sigismund dispatched his favorite, István Jósika, to Tuscany to start negotiations regarding his marriage to Eleonora Orsini (a niece of Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici), although his cousins had sharply opposed Jósika&#x27;s appointment. He also invited Italian artists and artisans to his court, making them his advisors or butlers. Szamosközy described them as &quot;the trashiest representatives of the noblest nation&quot;. The delegates of the &quot;Three Nations&quot; criticized Sigismund for his prodigal way of life at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár in November. To reduce his authority, the Diet prescribed that Sigismund should only make decisions in the royal council. Sigismund deprived his cousins of the allowances that the royal treasury had paid to them.

Gossip about conspiracies spread during the following months. Sándor Kendi accused Sigismund&#x27;s former tutor, János Gálffy, of deliberately stirring up debates between the prince and his cousins. Other courtiers claimed that Balthasar Báthory was planning to dethrone Sigismund. A Jesuit priest was informed at Vienna that Gálffy and his allies wanted to murder the prince and his cousins. In late 1591 Sigismund stated that he was willing to renounce in favor of Balthasar if the members of the royal council favored his cousin. His offer was refused, but during the debate Kendi referred to Sigismund and Balthasar as the &quot;two monsters and greatest disasters of the Transylvanian realm&quot;. Pope Clement VIII&#x27;s legate, Attilio Amalteo, mediated a reconciliation between Sigismund and his cousins in the summer of 1592. The pope also urged Sigismund to marry a Catholic princess from the House of Lorraine.

At the demand of the sultan, Transylvania troops assisted Aaron the Tyrant, Voivode of Moldavia. The sultan also ordered Sigismund to pay double the amount of the yearly tribute. Balthasar Báthory murdered Sigismund&#x27;s secretary, Pál Gyulai, on 10December 1592. He also persuaded Sigismund to order the execution of Gálffy on 8March 1593. That summer, Sigismund went to Kraków in disguise to start negotiations regarding his marriage with Anna, the sister of SigismundIII of Poland. The Holy See had proposed the marriage, which could have enabled Sigismund to rule Poland during the absence of the king, who was also King of Sweden, but the plan came to nothing.

Murad III declared war against the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph in August. The sultan ordered Sigismund to send reinforcements to support the Ottoman army in Royal Hungary. According to diplomatic sources, the grand vizier was planning to occupy Transylvania. At the proposal of Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of Poland, Sigismund sent envoys to Elizabeth I of England, asking her to intervene on his behalf at the Sublime Porte. She ordered her ambassador at Istanbul, Edward Barton, to support Sigismund.

Pope Clement VIII wanted to persuade Sigismund to join the Holy League that the pope had organized against the Ottoman Empire. After Rudolph&#x27;s troops defeated the Ottomans in a series of battles in the autumn of 1593, Sigismund decided to join the Holy League, provided that Rudolph acknowledged the independence of Transylvania from the Hungarian Crown. However, the delegates of the Three Nations refused to declare war against the Ottoman Empire at three consecutive Diets between May and July. Sigismund abdicated, tasking Balthasar Báthory with the government in late July. Balthasar wanted to seize the throne, but Kovacsóczy, Kendi, and the other leading officials decided to set up an aristocratic council to administer Transylvania.

The commanders of the army (including Stephen Bocskai), and Friar Carillo jointly convinced Sigismund to return on 8August. They also persuaded him to order the arrest of Kovacsóczy, Kendi, Balthasar Báthory, and twelve other noblemen who had opposed the war against the Ottomans on 28August, accusing them of plotting. Sándor and Gábor Kendi were beheaded along with two other members of the royal council; Balthasar Báthory, Kovacsóczy, and Ferenc Kendi were strangled in prison. All but one murdered noblemen were Protestants, mostly Unitarians. Many of their relatives converted to Catholicism to prevent the confiscation of their estates.

=== Holy League ===


Sigismund decided to join the Holy League together with Aaron the Tyrant, voivode of Moldavia, and Michael the Brave, voivode of Wallachia, on 5October 1594. The two voivodes had started direct negotiations with the Holy See, but Sigismund, who claimed suzerainty over them, prevented them from conducting further direct negotiations. Sigismund&#x27;s envoy, Stephen Bocskai, signed the document that confirmed the membership of Transylvania in the Holy League in Prague on 28January 1595. According to the treaty, RudolphII recognized Sigismund&#x27;s hereditary right to rule Transylvania and Partium and to use the title of prince, but he also stipulated that the principality was to be re-united with the Hungarian Crown if Sigismund&#x27;s family died out. The Diet of Transylvania confirmed the treaty on 16April. The Diet also prohibited religious innovations, which gave rise to the persecution of Szekler Sabbatarians in Udvarhelyszék.

The Wallachian boyars and prelates recognized Sigismund&#x27;s suzerainty over Wallachia on behalf of Michael the Brave in Gyulafehérvár on 20May 1595. According to the treaty, Michael was forbidden to enter into an alliance with foreign powers without Sigismund&#x27;s approval. The voivode&#x27;s right to sentence his boyars to death was also limited. The Diet of Transylvanian was authorized to impose taxes in Wallachia with a council of twelve boyars. After Aaron the Tyrant refused to sign a similar treaty, Sigismund invaded Moldavia and captured him in Iași. He made Ștefan Răzvan the new voivode on 3June, forcing him to swear fealty to him. Thereafter, Sigismund styled himself &quot;By the Grace of God, Prince of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Count of the Székelys and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;.

Sigismund married Maria Christina of Habsburg, a niece of RudolphII, on 6August. However, the marriage was never consummated. Sigismund accused (who was the mother of his executed cousin, Balthasar Báthory) of witchcraft, causing his impotence. Historian László Nagy notes that Sigismund&#x27;s contemporaries made no reference to his relationship with women, showing that Sigismund was homosexual.

György Borbély, Ban of Karánsebes, captured Lippa (now Lipova in Romania) and other Ottoman fortresses along the Maros River before the end of August. Koca Sinan Pasha broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael the Brave to retreat towards Transylvania. Michael confronted the invaders in the Battle of Călugăreni, but he could not prevent them from seizing Târgoviște and Bucharest. He withdrew to Stoenești to await the arrival of the Transylvanian and Moldavian troops.

Since the Ottoman army outnumbered the forces at Sigismund&#x27;s disposal, he proposed the Székely commoners (who had been reduced to serfdom in the 1560s) to restore their freedom if they joined his campaign against the Ottomans. The Székelys accepted his offer, enabling Sigismund to launch a counter-invasion in Wallachia in early October. The united forces of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia defeated the retreating Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu on 25October. Although the victory was not decisive, the battle enabled the two voivodes to maintain their alliance with the Holy League.

Ignoring the Székely warriors&#x27; preeminent role during the war, the Diet of Transylvania refused to restore their freedom on 15December. Sigismund left for Prague to start negotiations with RudolphII in early January 1596, tasking his wife and Stephen Bocskai with the government. The Székelys tried to secure their freedom, but Bocskai repressed their movement with extraordinary cruelty during the &quot;Bloody Carnival&quot; in early 1596.

Rudolph II promised Sigismund to send reinforcements and money to continue the war against the Ottomans. Sigismund returned to Transylvania on 4March. He laid siege to Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania), but he lifted the siege when an Ottoman army of 20,000 strong approached the fortress. The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed III invaded Royal Hungary in summer. Sigismund joined his forces with the royal army, which was under the command of Maximilian of Habsburg. However, the Ottomans routed their united army in the Battle of Mezőkeresztes between 23 and 26 October.

Sigismund again went to Prague to meet RudolphII and offered to abdicate in January 1597. After he returned to Transylvania, he restored the Roman Catholic bishopric in Gyulafehérvár. He sent envoys to Italy to demand the supreme command of a new Christian army, but his delegates at Istanbul started negotiations regarding a reconciliation with the sultan.

=== Abdications and returns ===


The failure of his marriage and the defeats of the Holy League diminished Sigismund&#x27;s self-confidence. He sent his envoys to RudolphII and again offered to abdicate in September 1597. An agreement regarding his abdication was signed on 23December 1597. RudolphII granted Sigismund the Silesian duchies of Racibórz and Opole and a yearly subsidy of 50,000 thalers. The agreement was kept secret for months.

The Diet of Transylvania acknowledged Sigismund&#x27;s abdication on 23March 1598. Maria Christierna took charge of the government until the arrival of Maximilian of Habsburg, whom RudolphII had appointed to administer Transylvania. Sigismund went to Silesia, but he did not like his new duchies. Bocskai, who had been dismissed after Sigismund&#x27;s abdication, urged him to return.

Sigismund came to Kolozsvár on 21 August. On the following day, Bocskai convoked the Diet to his military camp at Szászsebes (now Sebeș in Romania), and the delegates proclaimed Sigismund prince. Most Transylvanians accepted the decision, but György Király, the deputy captain of Várad, remained loyal to RudolphII. In September an Ottoman army invaded the principality, capturing the fortresses along the Maros. Sigismund sent his envoys to the commander of the army, Mehmed, convincing him to attack Várad instead of breaking into Transylvania proper.

All of Sigismund&#x27;s attempts to make peace with the sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague to negotiate with RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund&#x27;s invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could make peace with the Ottomans with the assistance of Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.

Andrew Báthory lost his throne and his life fighting against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII&#x27;s governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund announced that he was ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave&#x27;s campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.

The elected leader of the Transylvanian noblemen, István Csáky, sought assistance from RudolphII&#x27;s military commander, Giorgio Basta, against Michael. Basta invaded Transylvania and expelled Michael the Brave in September. Basta&#x27;s unpaid soldiers regularly pillaged the principality, while Ottoman and Tatar marauders made frequent incursions across the frontiers. Sigismund returned to Transylvania across Moldavia at the head of a Polish army on 24March 1601. The Diet proclaimed him prince in Kolozsvár on 3April. Basta and Michael the Brave invaded Transylvania in summer. They routed Sigismund&#x27;s army in the Battle of Goroszló on 3August 1601. After the battle, Sigismund fled to Moldavia, but he returned on 6September.

The sultan&#x27;s envoy confirmed Sigismund&#x27;s position as Prince of Transylvania in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania) on 2October. At the head of an army which also included Ottoman and Tatar soldiers, Sigismund expanded his rule over most regions of the principality, but he could not capture Kolozsvár in late November. He started new negotiations with Basta over his abdication in March 1602, because he did not trust his own supporters. He referred to them as &quot;intoxicated and brutish sons of a bitch&quot; and asked István Csáky to help him to leave their camp on 2July. He left Transylvania for the last time on 26July 1602.

== Last years ==

Basta&#x27;s soldiers accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, he went to Prague to beg for RudolphII&#x27;s mercy. He received the &quot;incolatus&quot; (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, but he did not accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor&#x27;s offer.

Sigismund received the domain of Libochovice in Bohemia. After one of his employees accused him of plotting against the emperor, Sigismund was imprisoned for fourteen months in the jails of Prague Castle in 1610. Sigismund died of a stroke in Libochovice on 27March 1613. He was buried in a crypt in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

<doc id="28406" wikidata="Q642342" url="?curid=28406" title="Scopes trial">
<text>The Scopes trial, formally The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes, and commonly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial, was an American legal case from July 10 to July 21, 1925, in which a high school teacher, John T. Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee&#x27;s Butler Act, which had made it illegal for teachers to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held. Scopes was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, but he incriminated himself deliberately so the case could have a defendant.

Scopes was found guilty and was fined $100 (), but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity, as national reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the high-profile lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential candidate and former secretary of state, argued for the prosecution, while Clarence Darrow served as the defense attorney for Scopes. The trial publicized the fundamentalist–modernist controversy, which set modernists, who said evolution could be consistent with religion, against fundamentalists, who said the word of God as revealed in the Bible took priority over all human knowledge. The case was thus seen both as a theological contest and as a trial on whether evolution should be taught in schools.

== Origins ==

State Representative John Washington Butler, a Tennessee farmer and head of the World Christian Fundamentals Association, lobbied state legislatures to pass anti-evolution laws. He succeeded when the Butler Act was signed into law in Tennessee, on March 21, 1925. Butler later stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anything about evolution... I&#x27;d read in the papers that boys and girls were coming home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense.&quot; Tennessee governor Austin Peay signed the bill to gain support among rural legislators, but believed the law would neither be enforced nor interfere with education in Tennessee schools. William Jennings Bryan thanked Peay enthusiastically for the bill: &quot;The Christian parents of the state owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an unproven hypothesis.&quot;

In response, the American Civil Liberties Union financed a test case in which John Scopes, a Tennessee high school science teacher, agreed to be tried for violating the Act. Scopes, who had substituted for the regular biology teacher, was charged on May 5, 1925, with teaching evolution from a chapter in George William Hunter&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Civic Biology: Presented in Problems&quot; (1914), which described the theory of evolution, race, and eugenics. The two sides brought in the biggest legal names in the nation, Bryan for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense, and the trial was followed on radio transmissions throughout the United States.

==Dayton, Tennessee==

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) offered to defend anyone accused of teaching the theory of evolution in defiance of the Butler Act. On April 5, 1925, George Rappleyea, local manager for the Cumberland Coal and Iron Company, arranged a meeting with county superintendent of schools Walter White and local attorney Sue K. Hicks at Robinson&#x27;s Drug Store, convincing them that the controversy of such a trial would give Dayton much needed publicity. According to Robinson, Rappleyea said &quot;As it is, the law is not enforced. If you win, it will be enforced. If I win, the law will be repealed. We&#x27;re game, aren&#x27;t we?&quot; The men then summoned 24-year-old John T. Scopes, a Dayton high school science and math teacher. The group asked Scopes to admit to teaching the theory of evolution.
Rappleyea pointed out that, while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use a textbook that explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, and that teachers were, therefore, effectively required to break the law. Scopes mentioned that while he could not remember whether he had actually taught evolution in class, he had, however, gone through the evolution chart and chapter with the class. Scopes added to the group: &quot;If you can prove that I&#x27;ve taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I&#x27;ll be willing to stand trial.&quot;

Scopes urged students to testify against him and coached them in their answers. He was indicted on May 25, after three students testified against him at the grand jury; one student afterwards told reporters: &quot;I believe in part of evolution, but I don&#x27;t believe in the monkey business.&quot; Judge John T. Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and &quot;...all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom&quot;. Scopes was charged with having taught from the chapter on evolution to a high-school class in violation of the Butler Act and nominally arrested, though he was never actually detained. Paul Patterson, owner of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, put up $500 in bail for Scopes.

The original prosecutors were Herbert E. and Sue K. Hicks, two brothers who were local attorneys and friends of Scopes, but the prosecution was ultimately led by Tom Stewart, a graduate of Cumberland School of Law, who later became a U.S. Senator. Stewart was aided by Dayton attorney Gordon McKenzie, who supported the anti-evolution bill on religious grounds, and described evolution as &quot;detrimental to our morality&quot; and an assault on &quot;the very citadel of our Christian religion.&quot;

Hoping to attract major press coverage, George Rappleyea went so far as to write to the British novelist H. G. Wells asking him to join the defense team. Wells replied that he had no legal training in Britain, let alone in America, and declined the offer. John R. Neal, a law school professor from Knoxville, announced that he would act as Scopes&#x27; attorney whether Scopes liked it or not, and he became the nominal head of the defense team.
Baptist pastor William Bell Riley, the founder and president of the World Christian Fundamentals Association, was instrumental in calling lawyer and three-time Democratic presidential nominee, former United States Secretary of State, and lifelong Presbyterian William Jennings Bryan to act as that organization&#x27;s counsel. Bryan had originally been invited by Sue Hicks to become an associate of the prosecution and Bryan had readily accepted, despite the fact he had not tried a case in thirty-six years. As Scopes pointed out to James Presley in the book &quot;Center of the Storm&quot;, on which the two collaborated: &quot;After [Bryan] was accepted by the state as a special prosecutor in the case, there was never any hope of containing the controversy within the bounds of constitutionality.&quot;

Following the recruitment of Bryan, Clarence Darrow approached John Neal of the defense team and offered his services. Neal accepted, without consulting the rest of the defense team or the defendant himself. The ACLU had been seeking out an addition to the defense that would parallel Bryan&#x27;s political experience and had previously expressed concern that &quot;Darrow&#x27;s militant agnosticism would imperil Scopes&#x27; defense&quot; and therefore &quot;did not want Darrow anywhere near&quot; the Scopes trial. Darrow later claimed he was motivated to join the defense after he &quot;realized there was no limit to the mischief that might be accomplished unless the country was aroused to the evil at hand&quot;. After many changes back and forth, the defense team consisted of Darrow, ACLU attorney Arthur Garfield Hays, Dudley Field Malone, an international divorce lawyer who had worked at the State Department, W. O. Thompson, who was Darrow&#x27;s law partner, and F. B. McElwee. The defense was also assisted by librarian and Biblical authority Charles Francis Potter, who was a modernist Unitarian preacher.

The prosecution team was led by Tom Stewart, district attorney for the 18th Circuit (and future United States Senator), and included, in addition to Herbert and Sue Hicks, Ben B. McKenzie and William Jennings Bryan.

The trial was covered by journalists from the South and around the world, including H. L. Mencken for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, which was also paying part of the defense&#x27;s expenses. It was Mencken who provided the trial with its most colorful labels such as the &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; of &quot;the infidel Scopes&quot;. It was also the first United States trial to be broadcast on national radio.

== Proceedings ==

The ACLU had originally intended to oppose the Butler Act on the grounds that it violated the teacher&#x27;s individual rights and academic freedom, and was therefore unconstitutional. Principally because of Clarence Darrow, this strategy changed as the trial progressed. The earliest argument proposed by the defense once the trial had begun was that there was actually no conflict between evolution and the creation account in the Bible; later, this viewpoint would be called theistic evolution. In support of this claim, they brought in eight experts on evolution. But other than Maynard Metcalf, a zoologist from Johns Hopkins University, the judge would not allow these experts to testify in person. Instead, they were allowed to submit written statements so their evidence could be used at the appeal. In response to this decision, Darrow made a sarcastic comment to Judge Raulston (as he often did throughout the trial) on how he had been agreeable only on the prosecution&#x27;s suggestions. Darrow apologized the next day, keeping himself from being found in contempt of court.
The presiding judge, John T. Raulston, was accused of being biased towards the prosecution and frequently clashed with Darrow. At the outset of the trial, Raulston quoted Genesis and the Butler Act. He also warned the jury not to judge the merit of the law (which would become the focus of the trial) but on the violation of the Act, which he called a &#x27;high misdemeanor&#x27;. The jury foreman himself was unconvinced of the merit of the Act but he acted, as did most of the jury, on the instructions of the judge.

Bryan chastised evolution for teaching children that humans were but one of 35,000 types of mammals and bemoaned the notion that human beings were descended &quot;Not even from American monkeys, but from old world monkeys&quot;.

Darrow responded for the defense in a speech that was universally considered the oratorical climax of the trial. Arousing fears of &quot;inquisitions&quot;, Darrow argued that the Bible should be preserved in the realm of theology and morality and not put into a course of science. In his conclusion, Darrow declared that Bryan&#x27;s &quot;duel to the death&quot; against evolution should not be made one-sided by a court ruling that took away the chief witnesses for the defense. Darrow promised there would be no duel because &quot;there is never a duel with the truth.&quot; The courtroom went wild when Darrow finished; Scopes declared Darrow&#x27;s speech to be the dramatic high point of the entire trial and insisted that part of the reason Bryan wanted to go on the stand was to regain some of his tarnished glory.

=== Examination of Bryan ===

On the sixth day of the trial, the defense ran out of witnesses. The judge declared that all the defense testimony on the Bible was irrelevant and should not be presented to the jury (which had been excluded during the defense). On the seventh day of the trial, the defense asked the judge to call Bryan as a witness to question him on the Bible, as their own experts had been rendered irrelevant; Darrow had planned this the day before and called Bryan a &quot;Bible expert&quot;. This move surprised those present in the court, as Bryan was a counsel for the prosecution and Bryan himself (according to a journalist reporting the trial) never made a claim of being an expert, although he did tout his knowledge of the Bible. This testimony revolved around several questions regarding Biblical stories and Bryan&#x27;s beliefs (as shown below); this testimony culminated in Bryan declaring that Darrow was using the court to &quot;slur the Bible&quot; while Darrow replied that Bryan&#x27;s statements on the Bible were &quot;foolish&quot;.

On the seventh day of the trial, Clarence Darrow took the unorthodox step of calling William Jennings Bryan, counsel for the prosecution, to the stand as a witness in an effort to demonstrate that belief in the historicity of the Bible and its many accounts of miracles was unreasonable. Bryan accepted, on the understanding that Darrow would in turn submit to questioning by Bryan. Although Hays would claim in his autobiography that the examination of Bryan was unplanned, Darrow spent the night before in preparation. The scientists the defense had brought to Dayton—and Charles Francis Potter, a modernist minister who had engaged in a series of public debates on evolution with the fundamentalist preacher John Roach Straton—prepared topics and questions for Darrow to address to Bryan on the witness stand. Kirtley Mather, chairman of the geology department at Harvard and also a devout Baptist, played Bryan and answered questions as he believed Bryan would. Raulston had adjourned court to the stand on the courthouse lawn, ostensibly because he was &quot;afraid of the building&quot; with so many spectators crammed into the courtroom, but probably because of the stifling heat.

==== Adam and Eve ====

An area of questioning involved the book of Genesis, including questions about whether Eve was actually created from Adam&#x27;s rib, where Cain got his wife, and how many people lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science, telling Bryan, &quot;You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion.&quot; Bryan&#x27;s declaration in response was &quot;The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him.&quot;
Stewart objected for the prosecution, demanding to know the legal purpose of Darrow&#x27;s questioning. Bryan, gauging the effect the session was having, snapped that its purpose was &quot;to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in the Bible&quot;. Darrow, with equal vehemence, retorted &quot;We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States.&quot;
A few more questions followed in the charged open-air courtroom. Darrow asked where Cain got his wife; Bryan answered that he would &quot;leave the agnostics to hunt for her&quot;. When Darrow addressed the issue of the temptation of Eve by the serpent, Bryan insisted that the Bible be quoted verbatim rather than allowing Darrow to paraphrase it in his own terms. However, after another angry exchange, Judge Raulston banged his gavel, adjourning the court.

==== End of the trial ====

The confrontation between Bryan and Darrow lasted approximately two hours on the afternoon of the seventh day of the trial. It is likely that it would have continued the following morning but for Judge Raulston&#x27;s announcement that he considered the whole examination irrelevant to the case and his decision that it should be &quot;expunged&quot; from the record. Thus Bryan was denied the chance to cross-examine the defense lawyers in return, although after the trial Bryan would distribute nine questions to the press to bring out Darrow&#x27;s &quot;religious attitude&quot;. The questions and Darrow&#x27;s short answers were published in newspapers the day after the trial ended, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterizing Darrow as answering Bryan&#x27;s questions &quot;with his agnostic&#x27;s creed, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know,&#x27; except where he could deny them with his belief in natural, immutable law&quot;.

After the defense&#x27;s final attempt to present evidence was denied, Darrow asked the judge to bring in the jury only to have them come to a guilty verdict:
We claim that the defendant is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue as to whether he taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.

After they were brought in, Darrow then addressed the jury:
We came down here to offer evidence in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so all we can do is to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not... we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.

Darrow closed the case for the defense without a final summation. Under Tennessee law, when the defense waived its right to make a closing speech, the prosecution was also barred from summing up its case, preventing Bryan from presenting his prepared summation.

Scopes never testified since there was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later admitted that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial.

William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s summation of the Scopes trial, which was distributed to reporters but not read in court, read:
Science is a magnificent force, but it is not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth&#x27;s surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.

After eight days of trial, it took the jury only nine minutes to deliberate. Scopes was found guilty on July 21 and ordered by Raulston to pay a $100 fine (). Raulston imposed the fine before Scopes was given an opportunity to say anything about why the court should not impose punishment upon him and after Neal brought the error to the judge&#x27;s attention the defendant spoke for the first and only time in court:
Your honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute. I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.

Bryan died suddenly five days after the trial&#x27;s conclusion. The connection between the trial and his death is still debated by historians.

== Appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee ==

Scopes&#x27;s lawyers appealed, challenging the conviction on several grounds. First, they argued that the statute was overly vague because it prohibited the teaching of &quot;evolution&quot;, a very broad term. The court rejected that argument, holding:
Evolution, like prohibition, is a broad term. In recent bickering, however, evolution has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution was used in this act. It is in this sense that the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.

Second, the lawyers argued that the statute violated Scopes&#x27; constitutional right to free speech because it prohibited him from teaching evolution. The court rejected this argument, holding that the state was permitted to regulate his speech as an employee of the state:
He was an employee of the state of Tennessee or of a municipal agency of the state. He was under contract with the state to work in an institution of the state. He had no right or privilege to serve the state except upon such terms as the state prescribed. His liberty, his privilege, his immunity to teach and proclaim the theory of evolution, elsewhere than in the service of the state, was in no wise touched by this law.

Third, it was argued that the terms of the Butler Act violated the Tennessee State Constitution, which provided that &quot;It shall be the duty of the General Assembly in all future periods of this government, to cherish literature and science.&quot; The argument was that the theory of the descent of man from a lower order of animals was now established by the preponderance of scientific thought, and that the prohibition of the teaching of such theory was a violation of the legislative duty to cherish science. The court rejected this argument, holding that the determination of what laws cherished science was an issue for the legislature, not the judiciary:
The courts cannot sit in judgment on such acts of the Legislature or its agents and determine whether or not the omission or addition of a particular course of study tends to cherish science.

Fourth, the defense lawyers argued that the statute violated the provisions of the Tennessee Constitution that prohibited the establishment of a state religion. The Religious Preference provisions of the Tennessee Constitution (Section3 of ArticleI) stated, &quot;no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship&quot;.

Writing for the court two sittings and one year after receiving the appeal, Chief Justice Grafton Green rejected this argument, holding that the Tennessee Religious Preference clause was designed to prevent the establishment of a state religion as had been the experience in England and Scotland at the writing of the Constitution, and held:
We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.

Further, the court held that while the statute &quot;forbade&quot; the teaching of evolution (as the court had defined it) it did not &quot;require&quot; teaching any other doctrine and thus did not benefit any one religious doctrine or sect over others.

Nevertheless, having found the statute to be constitutional, the court set aside the conviction on appeal because of a legal technicality: the jury should have decided the fine, not the judge, since under the state constitution, Tennessee judges could not at that time set fines above $50, and the Butler Act specified a minimum fine of $100.

Justice Green added a totally unexpected recommendation:
The court is informed that the plaintiff in error is no longer in the service of the state. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a &quot;nolle prosequi&quot; herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.

Attorney General L. D. Smith immediately announced that he would not seek a retrial, while Scopes&#x27; lawyers offered angry comments on the stunning decision.

In 1968, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; 393 U.S. 97 (1968) that such bans contravene the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because their primary purpose is religious. Tennessee had repealed the Butler Act the previous year.

== Aftermath ==

=== Creation versus evolution debate ===

The trial revealed a growing chasm in American Christianity and two ways of finding truth, one &quot;biblical&quot; and one &quot;evolutionist&quot;. Author David Goetz writes that the majority of Christians denounced evolution at the time.

Author Mark Edwards contests the conventional view that in the wake of the Scopes trial, a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint which is evidenced in the 1955 play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (and subsequent 1960 film), which fictionalized the trial, as well as in the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism&#x27;s retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory rather than a defeat, but Bryan&#x27;s death soon after it created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups which argued in defense of the anti-evolutionist position.

Adam Shapiro criticized the view that the Scopes trial was an essential and inevitable conflict between religion and science, claiming that such a view was &quot;self-justifying&quot;. Instead, Shapiro emphasizes the fact that the Scopes trial was the result of particular circumstances, such as politics postponing the adoption of new textbooks.

=== Anti-evolution movement ===

The trial escalated the political and legal conflict in which strict creationists and scientists struggled over the teaching of evolution in Arizona and California science classes. Before the Dayton trial only the South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Kentucky legislatures had dealt with anti-evolution laws or riders to educational appropriations bills. After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar anti-evolution laws for their states. 

By 1927, there were 13 states, both in the North and in the South, that had deliberated over some form of anti-evolution law. At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly. Nearly all these efforts were rejected, but Mississippi and Arkansas did put anti-evolution laws on the books after the Scopes trial, laws that would outlive the Butler Act (which survived until 1967). However, the influence of Christian fundamentalists declined following the trial and Bryan&#x27;s death, and it was not until the rise of the Christian right in the late 1970s that conservative fundamentalists became politically active and powerful again.

In the Southwest, anti-evolution crusaders included ministers R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study in the schools or, failing that, to relegate it to the status of unproven hypothesis perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than elsewhere, finally collapsing in the Sputnik era after 1957, when the national mood inspired increased trust for science in general and for evolution in particular.

The opponents of evolution made a transition from the anti-evolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from overtly religious to covertly religious objections to evolutionary theory—sometimes described as a Wedge Strategy—raising what it claimed was scientific evidence in support of a literal interpretation of the Bible. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized pseudoscientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.

=== Teaching of science ===

The Scopes trial had both short- and long-term effects in the teaching of science in schools in the United States. Though often portrayed as influencing public opinion against fundamentalism, the victory was not complete. Though the ACLU had taken on the trial as a cause, in the wake of Scopes&#x27; conviction they were unable to find more volunteers to take on the Butler law and, by 1932, had given up. The anti-evolutionary legislation was not challenged again until 1965, and in the meantime, William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s cause was taken up by a number of organizations, including the Bryan Bible League and the Defenders of the Christian Faith.

The effects of the Scopes Trial on high school biology texts has not been unanimously agreed by scholars. Of the most widely used textbooks after the trial, only one included the word &quot;evolution&quot; in its index; the relevant page includes biblical quotations. Some scholars have accepted that this was the result of the Scopes Trial: for example Hunter, the author of the biology text which Scopes was on trial for teaching, revised the text by 1926 in response to the Scopes Trial controversy. However, George Gaylord Simpson challenged this notion as confusing cause and effect, and instead posited that the trend of anti-evolution movements and laws that provoked the Scopes Trial was also to blame for the removal of evolution from biological texts, and that the trial itself had little effect. The fundamentalists&#x27; target slowly veered off evolution in the mid-1930s. Miller and Grabiner suggest that as the anti-evolutionist movement died out, biology textbooks began to include the previously removed evolutionary theory. This also corresponds to the emerging demand that science textbooks be written by scientists rather than educators or education specialists.

This account of history has also been challenged. In &quot;Trying Biology&quot; Robert Shapiro examines many of the eminent biology textbooks in the 1910–1920s, and finds that while they may have avoided the word &quot;evolution&quot; to placate anti-evolutionists, the overall focus on the subject was not greatly diminished, and the books were still implicitly evolution based. It has also been suggested that the narrative of evolution&#x27;s being removed from textbooks due to religious pressure, only to be reinstated decades later, was an example of &quot;Whig history&quot; propagated by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, and that the shift in the ways biology textbooks discussed evolution can be attributed to other race and class based factors.

In 1958 the National Defense Education Act was passed with the encouragement of many legislators who feared the United States education system was falling behind that of the Soviet Union. The act yielded textbooks, produced in cooperation with the American Institute of Biological Sciences, which stressed the importance of evolution as the unifying principle of biology. The new educational regime was not unchallenged. The greatest backlash was in Texas where attacks were launched in sermons and in the press. Complaints were lodged with the State Textbook Commission. However, in addition to federal support, a number of social trends had turned public discussion in favor of evolution. These included increased interest in improving public education, legal precedents separating religion and public education, and continued urbanization in the South. This led to a weakening of the backlash in Texas, as well as to the repeal of the Butler Law in Tennessee in 1967.

== Publicity ==
Edward J. Larson, a historian who won the Pulitzer Prize for History for his book &quot;Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America&#x27;s Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion&quot; (2004), notes: &quot;Like so many archetypal American events, the trial itself began as a publicity stunt.&quot; The press coverage of the &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; was overwhelming. The front pages of newspapers like &quot;The New York Times&quot; were dominated by the case for days. More than 200 newspaper reporters from all parts of the country and two from London were in Dayton. Twenty-two telegraphers sent out 165,000 words per day on the trial, over thousands of miles of telegraph wires hung for the purpose; more words were transmitted to Britain about the Scopes trial than for any previous American event. Trained chimpanzees performed on the courthouse lawn. Chicago&#x27;s WGN radio station broadcast the trial with announcer Quin Ryan via clear-channel broadcasting first on-the-scene coverage of the criminal trial. Two movie cameramen had their film flown out daily in a small plane from a specially prepared airstrip.

H.L. Mencken&#x27;s trial reports were heavily slanted against the prosecution and the jury, which were &quot;unanimously hot for Genesis&quot;. He mocked the town&#x27;s inhabitants as &quot;yokels&quot; and &quot;morons&quot;. He called Bryan a &quot;buffoon&quot; and his speeches &quot;theologic bilge&quot;. In contrast, he called the defense &quot;eloquent&quot; and &quot;magnificent&quot;. Even today, some American creationists, fighting in courts and state legislatures to demand that creationism be taught on an equal footing with evolution in the schools, have claimed that it was Mencken&#x27;s trial reports in 1925 that turned public opinion against creationism. The media&#x27;s portrayal of Darrow&#x27;s cross-examination of Bryan, and the play and movie &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), caused millions of Americans to ridicule religious-based opposition to the theory of evolution.

The trial also brought publicity to the town of Dayton, Tennessee, and was hatched as a publicity stunt. From &quot;The Salem Republican&quot;, June 11, 1925:
The whole matter has assumed the portion of Dayton and her merchants endeavoring to secure a large amount of notoriety and publicity with an open question as to whether Scopes is a party to the plot or not.

== Courthouse ==
In a $1-million restoration of the Rhea County Courthouse in Dayton, completed in 1979, the second-floor courtroom was restored to its appearance during the Scopes trial. A museum of trial events in its basement contains such memorabilia as the microphone used to broadcast the trial, trial records, photographs, and an audiovisual history. Every July, local people re-enact key moments of the trial in the courtroom. In front of the courthouse stands a commemorative plaque erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission, reading as follows:


The Rhea County Courthouse was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1976. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

== Humor ==
Anticipating that Scopes would be found guilty, the press fitted the defendant for martyrdom and created an onslaught of ridicule, and hosts of cartoonists added their own portrayals to the attack. For example:
* &quot;American Experience&quot; has published a gallery of such cartoons, and 14 such cartoons are also reprinted in L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;The Great Monkey Trial&quot;.
* &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s initial coverage of the trial focused on Dayton as &quot;the fantastic cross between a circus and a holy war&quot;. 
* &quot;Life&quot; magazine adorned its masthead with monkeys reading books and proclaimed &quot;the whole matter is something to laugh about.&quot; 
* Both &quot;Literary Digest&quot; and the popular humor magazine &quot;Life&quot; (1890–1930) ran compilations of jokes and humorous observations garnered from newspapers around the country.

Overwhelmingly, the butt of these jokes was the prosecution and those aligned with it: Bryan, the city of Dayton, the state of Tennessee, and the entire South, as well as fundamentalist Christians and anti-evolutionists. Rare exceptions were found in the Southern press, where the fact that Darrow had saved Leopold and Loeb from the death penalty continued to be a source of ugly humor. The most widespread form of this ridicule was directed at the inhabitants of Tennessee. &quot;Life&quot; described Tennessee as &quot;not up to date in its attitude to such things as evolution&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine related Bryan&#x27;s arrival in town with the disparaging comment &quot;The populace, Bryan&#x27;s to a moron, yowled a welcome.&quot;

Attacks on Bryan were frequent and acidic: &quot;Life&quot; awarded him its &quot;Brass Medal of the Fourth Class&quot; for having &quot;successfully demonstrated by the alchemy of ignorance hot air may be transmuted into gold, and that the Bible is infallibly inspired except where it differs with him on the question of wine, women, and wealth&quot;.

Vituperative attacks came from journalist H. L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; drew vivid caricatures of the &quot;backward&quot; local populace, referring to the people of Rhea County as &quot;Babbits&quot;, &quot;morons&quot;, &quot;peasants&quot;, &quot;hill-billies&quot;, &quot;yaps&quot;, and &quot;yokels&quot;. He chastised the &quot;degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls&quot;. However, Mencken did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing
The town, I confess, greatly surprised me. I expected to find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. What I found was a country town full of charm and even beauty—a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair.

He described Rhea County as priding itself on a kind of tolerance or what he called &quot;lack of Christian heat&quot;, opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out &quot;The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee.&quot; Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the &quot;Rev. Elmer Chubb&quot;, but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only &quot;Commonweal&quot; magazine bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his withering obituary of Bryan, &quot;In Memoriam: W.J.B.&quot;, in which he charged Bryan with &quot;insincerity&quot;—not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan &quot;as a quack pure and unadulterated&quot; was &quot;really just&quot;. Mencken&#x27;s columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general indignation from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch &quot;All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant.&quot; Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow&#x27;s cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.

== In popular culture ==

===Stage, film and television===

* Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee&#x27;s play &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1955), fictionalizes the 1925 Scopes &quot;Monkey&quot; Trial as a means to discuss the then-contemporary McCarthy trials. It portrays Darrow and Bryan as the characters who are named Henry Drummond and Matthew Brady. In a note at the opening of the play, the playwrights state that it is not meant to be a historical account, and there are numerous instances where events were substantially altered or invented. Despite the disclaimer in the play&#x27;s preface that the trial was its &quot;genesis&quot; but it is &quot;not history&quot;, the play has largely been accepted as history by the public. (Lawrence and Lee later said that it was written in response to McCarthyism and was chiefly about intellectual freedom.)
** Adaptations:
*** &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; was made into a 1960 film directed by Stanley Kramer, with Spencer Tracy as Drummond and Fredric March as Brady. Although there are numerous changes in the plot, they include more of the actual events which are recorded in the trial transcript, such as when Darrow implies that the court is prejudiced, being cited for contempt of court for his comments and his subsequent statement of contrition that persuaded the judge to drop the charge. 
*** There have also been three television versions of the play, with Melvyn Douglas and Ed Begley in 1965, Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas in 1988, and Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott in 1999.
* Peter Goodchild&#x27;s play, &quot;The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial&quot; (1993), was based on original sources and transcripts of the Scopes trial, because it was written with the goal of being historically accurate. It was produced as part of L.A. Theatre Works&#x27; Relativity Series, which features science-themed plays and receives major funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which seeks &quot;to enhance public understanding of science and technology in the modern world&quot;. According to &quot;Audiofile Magazine&quot;, which pronounced this production the 2006 D.J.S. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award: &quot;Because there are no recordings of the actual trial, this production is certainly the next best thing.&quot; The BBC broadcast &quot;The Great Tennessee Monkey Trial&quot; in 2009, in a radio version starring Neil Patrick Harris and Ed Asner.
* Gale Johnson&#x27;s play &quot;Inherit the Truth&quot; (1987) was based on the original transcripts of the case. &quot;Inherit the Truth&quot; was performed yearly during the Dayton Scopes Festival until it ended its run in 2009. The play was written as a rebuttal of the 1955 play and the 1960 film, which Dayton residents claim did not accurately depict either the trial or William Jennings Bryan. In 2007 Bryan College purchased the rights to the production and began work on a student film version of the play, which was screened at that year&#x27;s Scopes Festival.
* The 1997 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; drew inspiration from the trial, along with the Cardiff Giant and Piltdown Man hoaxes. 
* The film &quot;Alleged&quot; (2010), a romantic drama which is set around the Scopes Trial, starring Brian Dennehy as Clarence Darrow and Fred Thompson as William Jennings Bryan, was released by Two Shoes Productions. While the main storyline is fictional, all the courtroom scenes are accurate according to the actual trial transcripts. Coincidentally, Dennehy had played Matthew Harrison Brady, the fictionalized counterpart of Bryan, in the 2007 Broadway revival of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;.
* In 2013, the Comedy Central series &quot;Drunk History&quot; retold portions of the trial in the &quot;Nashville&quot; episode, with Bradley Whitford portraying Bryan, Jack McBrayer as Darrow, and Derek Waters as Scopes.
* In 2018, the Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts presented a reading of a musical adaptation entitled &quot;Nothing to See Here&quot;, with book and music by Bryan Blaskie and book and lyrics by Laurie Hochman.

===Music===

* A series of folk songs produced in reaction to the trial, from PBS&#x27; &quot;American Experience&quot;, includes:
** &quot;Bryan&#x27;s Last Fight&quot;
** &quot;Can&#x27;t Make a Monkey of Me&quot;
** &quot;Monkey Business&quot;
** &quot;Monkey Out of Me&quot;
** &quot;The John Scopes Trial (The Old Religion&#x27;s Better After All)&quot;
** &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Bugs&quot;
** &quot;Monkey Biz-Ness (Down in Tennessee)&quot; by the International Novelty Orchestra with Billy Murray is a 1925 comedy song about the Scopes Monkey Trial.
* Bruce Springsteen performed a song called &quot;Part Man, Part Monkey&quot; during his 1988 Tunnel of Love Express Tour, and recorded a version of it in 1990 that was first released as a 1992 B-side and was later released on the 1998 multi-volume &quot;Tracks&quot; collection. The song references the Scopes trial (&quot;They prosecuted some poor sucker in these United States / For teaching that man descended from the apes&quot;) but says that the trial could have been avoided by merely looking at how men behave around women (&quot;They coulda settled that case without a fuss or fight / If they&#x27;d seen me chasing you, sugar, through the jungle last night / They&#x27;da called in that jury and a one two three, said / Part man, part monkey, definitely&quot;).

===Non-fiction===

* It was not until the 1960s that the Scopes trial began to be mentioned in the history textbooks which were used in American high schools and colleges. Such textbooks usually portrayed it as an example of the conflict between fundamentalists and modernists, and it was frequently mentioned in the sections of those same textbooks which also described the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the South.

<text>Stephen Báthory (; ; ; 27 September 1533 – 12 December 1586) was Voivode of Transylvania (1571–1576), Prince of Transylvania (1576–1586), as well as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1576–1586).

The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Hungarian Báthory noble family, Báthory was a ruler of Transylvania in the 1570s, defeating another challenger for that title, Gáspár Bekes. 

In 1576, Báthory became the husband of Queen Anna Jagiellon and the third elected king of Poland. He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski. The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power, defeating a fellow claimant to the throne, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, most notably, the Danzig rebellion. 

He reigned only a decade, but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish and Lithuanian history, particularly in the military realm. His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign, in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace (the Peace of Jam Zapolski).

==Youth==

Stephen Báthory was born on 27 September 1533 in the castle at Somlyó, also known as Szilágysomlyó (today&#x27;s Șimleu Silvaniei). He was the son of Stephen VIII Báthory (d. 1534) of the noble Hungarian Báthory family and his wife Catherine Telegdi. He had at least five siblings: two brothers and three sisters.

Little is known about his childhood. Around 1549–1550, he briefly visited Italy and probably spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553, Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya&#x27;s supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time he fell out of favor at Zápolya&#x27;s court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya.

After Zápolya&#x27;s death in 1571, the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania. Bekes, supported by the Habsburgs, disputed his election, but by 1573, Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania. He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position.

==Elected king==

In 1572, the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time the largest and one of the most populous states in Europe, was vacated when King Sigismund II Augustus died without heirs. The Sejm was given the power to elect a new king, and in the 1573 Polish–Lithuanian royal election chose Henry of France; Henry soon ascended the French throne and forfeited the Polish-Lithuanian one by returning to France. Báthory decided to enter into the election; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania, which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of Kerelőszentpál.

On 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Archduke Maximilian III as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski, Piotr Zborowski and other opponents of Habsburgs argued against a Habsburg king, fearing the political power of a native Polish king. Zborowski in particular supported electing a princely or ducal ruler. Bathory also pledged several bribes, including 200,000 florins and ransoms for Polish captives taken by the Tatars. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of the former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected &#x27;king&#x27; and marry Stephen Báthory. In January 1576 Báthory passed the mantle of voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland. On 1 May 1576 Báthory married Anna and was crowned king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania. After being chosen as king in the 1576 Polish–Lithuanian royal election, Báthory also began using the title of the prince of Transylvania.

==Establishing power==
Báthory&#x27;s position was at first extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action. At first the representatives of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as a grand duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June, Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania. On 29 May 1580, a ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented Báthory a decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin. The Báthory&#x27;s ceremony of 29 May 1580 coincided with the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł, Eustachy Wołłowicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) initial demands before the Union of Lubin to have a separate declaration act of the Grand Duke of Lithuania in Vilnius.

With Lithuania secure, the other major region refusing to recognize his election was Prussia. Maximilian&#x27;s sudden death improved Báthory&#x27;s situation, but the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) still refused to recognize his election without significant concessions. The Hanseatic League city, bolstered by its immense wealth, fortifications, and the secret support of Maximilian, had supported the Emperor&#x27;s election and decided not to recognize Báthory as the legitimate ruler. The resulting conflict was known as the Danzig rebellion. Most armed opposition collapsed when the prolonged Siege of Danzig by Báthory&#x27;s forces was lifted as an agreement was reached. The Danzig army was utterly defeated in a field battle on 17 April 1577. However, since Báthory&#x27;s armies were unable to take the city by force, a compromise was reached. In exchange for some of Danzig&#x27;s demands being favorably reviewed, the city recognised Báthory as ruler of Poland and paid the sum of 200,000 zlotys in gold as compensation. Tying up the administration of the Commonwealth&#x27;s northern provinces, in February 1578 he acknowledged George Frederick as the ruler of Duchy of Prussia, receiving his feudal tribute.

==Policies==

After securing control over the Commonwealth, Báthory had a chance to devote himself to strengthening his authority, in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski, who would soon become one of the king&#x27;s most trusted advisers. Báthory reorganised the judiciary by the formation of legal tribunals (the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581). While this somewhat weakened the royal position, it was of little concern to Báthory, as the loss of power was not significant in the short term, and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne. In exchange, the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military, including the establishment of the &quot;piechota wybraniecka&quot;, an infantry formation composed of peasants. Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army, reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania. He also founded the Academy of Vilnius, the third university in the Commonwealth, transforming what had been a Jesuit college into a major university. He founded several other Jesuit colleges, and was active in propagating Catholicism, while at the same time being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance, issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews, and denouncing any religious violence.

In external relations, Báthory sought peace through strong alliances. Though remaining distrustful of the Habsburgs, he maintained the tradition of good relations that the Commonwealth enjoyed with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian&#x27;s successor, Rudolf II. The troublesome south-eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579. The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies for the inevitable war against Muscovy.

A number of his trusted advisers were Hungarian, and he remained interested in Hungarian politics. In his last years, Báthory, with Pope Gregory XVIII&#x27;s approval, made a plan with Antonio Possevino for the liberation of Ottoman Hungary by a well organized (mostly Polish) Christian army, and the creation of a strong and independent Hungarian-Polish union under his rule. However, the unfavorable international situation did not allow him significantly to advance any of his plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.

In his personal life, he was described as rather frugal in his personal expenditures, with hunting and reading as his favorite pastimes.

==War with Muscovy==

Before Báthory&#x27;s election to the throne of the Commonwealth, Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere of interest in the northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each of them was vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, became known as the Livonian War. By 1577, Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578, Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and began pushing Ivan&#x27;s forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. Báthory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.

In 1581, Stephen penetrated once again into Russia and, on 22 August, laid siege to the city of Pskov. While the city held, on 13 December 1581 Ivan the Terrible began negotiations that concluded with the Truce of Jam Zapolski on 15 January 1582. The treaty was favorable to the Commonwealth, as Ivan ceded Polatsk, Veliz and most of the Duchy of Livonia in exchange for regaining Velikiye Luki and Nevel.

==Final years==

In 1584, Báthory allowed Zamoyski to execute Samuel Zborowski, whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade. This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family, framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility, would be a major recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years. In external politics, Báthory was considering another war with Russia, but his plans were delayed due to the lack of support from the Sejm, which refused to pass the requested tax raises.

Báthory&#x27;s health had been declining for several years. He died on 12 December 1586. He had no legitimate children, though contemporary rumours suggested he might have had several illegitimate children. None of these rumours have been confirmed by modern historians. His death was followed by an interregnum of one year. Maximilian II&#x27;s son, Archduke Maximilian III, was elected king but was contested by the Swedish Sigismund III Vasa, who defeated Maximilian at the Byczyna and succeeded as ruler of the Commonwealth.

==Remembrance==
Báthory actively promoted his legend, sponsoring many works about his life and achievements, from historical treatises to poetry. In his lifetime, he was featured in the works of Jan Kochanowski, Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński and many others. He became a recurring character in Polish poetry and literature and featured as a central figure in poems, novels and drama by Jakub Jasiński, Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Henryk Rzewuski and others. He has been a subject of numerous paintings, both during his life and posthumously. Among the painters who took him as a subject were Jan Matejko and Stanisław Wyspiański.

A statue of Báthory by Giovanni Ferrari was raised in 1789 in Padua, Italy, sponsored by the last king of the Commonwealth, Stanisław August Poniatowski. Other monuments to him include one in the Łazienki Palace (1795 by André Lebrun) and one in Sniatyn (1904, destroyed in 1939). He was a patron of the Vilnius University (then known as the Stefan Batory University) and several units in the Polish Army from 1919 to 1939. His name was borne by two 20th-century passenger ships of the Polish Merchant Navy, the MS Batory and TSS Stefan Batory. In modern Poland, he is the namesake of the Batory Steelmill, a nongovernmental Stefan Batory Foundation, the Polish 9th Armored Cavalry Brigade, and numerous Polish streets and schools. One of the districts of the town of Chorzów is named after him.

Immediately after his death, he was not fondly remembered in the Commonwealth. Many nobles took his behavior in the Zborowski affair and his domestic policies as indicating an interest in curtailing the nobility&#x27;s Golden Freedoms and establishing an absolute monarchy. His contemporaries were also rankled by his favoritism toward Hungarians over nationals of the Commonwealth. He was also remembered, more trivially, for his Hungarian-style cap and saber (szabla &quot;batorówka&quot;).

His later resurgence in Polish memory and historiography can be traced to the 19th-century era of partitions of Poland when the Polish state lost its independence. He was remembered for his military triumphs and praised as an effective ruler by many, including John Baptist Albertrandi, Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie, Michał Bobrzyński, Józef Szujski and others. Though some historians like Tadeusz Korzon, Joachim Lelewel and Jędrzej Moraczewski remained more reserved, in 1887, Wincenty Zakrzewski noted that Báthory is &quot;the darling of both the Polish public opinion and Polish historians&quot;. During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic he was a cult figure, often compared - with the government&#x27;s approval - to the contemporary dictator of Poland, Józef Piłsudski. After the Second World War, in the communist People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, he became more of a controversial figure, with historians more ready to question his internal politics and attachment to Hungary. Nonetheless, his good image remained intact, reinforced by the positive views of a popular Polish historian of that period, Paweł Jasienica.

<doc id="28408" wikidata="Q1772736" url="?curid=28408" title="Subud">
<text>Subud (pronounced ) is an international, interfaith spiritual movement that began in Indonesia in the 1920s, founded by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo (1901–1987). The basis of Subud is a spiritual exercise called the &quot;latihan kejiwaan&quot;, which Muhammad Subuh said represents guidance from &quot;the Power of God&quot; or &quot;the Great Life Force.&quot;

Subuh asserted that Subud was neither a new teaching nor a religion. Rather, he suggested that, as a result of following the inner guidance from the latihan, members could be guided towards a religion that was right for them, whether it is Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. While following a religion can provide discipline that can be valuable for a member&#x27;s inner development, it is not necessary to follow a religion in order to be in Subud and do the latihan.

There are Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000 in 2023.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Subud&quot; is an acronym that stands for three Javanese words, Susila Budhi Dharma, which are derived from the Sanskrit terms &quot;suśīla&quot; (good-tempered), , and dharma.

The original Sanskrit root words are defined differently than Pak Subuh indicates:

Sanskrit

*&quot;Suśīla&quot;: &quot;well-disposed&quot;, &quot;having an amiable disposition&quot;, &quot;good-tempered&quot;.
*&quot;Buddhi&quot;: &quot;intelligence, mind, reason&quot;.
*Dharma: the Law that &quot;upholds, supports or maintains the regulatory order of the universe&quot;.

;Pak Subuh
Pak Subuh gives the following definitions:
* Susila: the good character of man in accordance with the Will of Almighty God.
* Budhi: the force of the inner self within man.
* Dharma: surrender, trust and sincerity towards Almighty God.

==History==

Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo explained in talks to Subud members that during 1925 he was taking a late-night walk when he had an unexpected and unusual experience. He said he found himself enveloped in a brilliant light, and looked up to see what seemed like the sun falling directly onto his body, and he thought that he was having a heart attack. He said he went directly home, lay down on his bed, and prepared to die with the feeling that maybe it was his time, and that he could not fight it, so he surrendered himself to God.

According to the story, however, instead of dying he was moved from within to stand up and perform movements similar to his normal Muslim prayer routine. It seemed that he was not moving through his own volition; but was being guided by what he interpreted as the power of God. This same kind of experience reportedly happened to him for a few hours each night over a period of about 1000 days during which he slept little but was able to continue working full-time. He said he experienced a kind of &quot;inner teaching&quot; whereby he was given to understand a variety of things spontaneously.

As these experiences proceeded, Pak Subuh explained, he gained spontaneous insight into people and situations that he had not possessed before. Around 1933, as he reported, he received that if other people were physically near him while he was in a state of &quot;latihan&quot;, then the experience would begin in them also. While still in his early thirties, Pak Subuh&#x27;s reputation as someone with spiritual insight apparently grew, and people went to him to be &#x27;opened&#x27;. They in turn could open others, and this is how Subud eventually spread around the world.

In Jakarta, Husein Rofé, an English linguist who had been living in Indonesia since 1950, met Pak Subuh. Rofé had been searching for a spiritual path and became the first non-Indonesian to be opened.

Subud moved outside Indonesia when Rofé attended a religious congress in Japan in 1954. Subud first spread internationally into Japan, followed by Hong Kong and Cyprus. In 1957, Rofé (who was then in London) suggested that Pak Subuh visit Britain. Pak Subuh accepted the invitation and visited the home of John G. Bennett in Coombe Springs. It was at this time that many UK followers of George Gurdjieff were initiated into Subud, including Bennett himself, though he later left the group. Over the next 14 months Pak Subuh visited many countries before returning to Indonesia.

==Symbol==

The Subud symbol was envisioned by Pak Subuh in 1959. It consists of seven concentric circles and seven spokes, which, in traditional Javanese mysticism, represent seven life forces as well as the Great Life Force that connects them. Each circle grows wider, the further out from the center, and each spoke narrows as it approaches the center. The space between the circles remains constant.

The symbol is often printed in black and white when color printing is not available. When colors are used, usually the circles and spokes are gold and the background is dark blue to black. However, the symbol is also sometimes blue on white or white on blue. The World Subud Association has registered this design, as well as the name &quot;Subud&quot;, as a trade, service or collective membership mark in many countries.

==Practices==

The core of Subud is the &quot;latihan&quot; experience. Pak Subuh gives the following descriptions of &quot;Subud&quot;:
The central practice of Subud is the &quot;latihan kejiwaan&quot; (literally &quot;spiritual exercise&quot; or &quot;training of the spirit&quot;) or simply &quot;the latihan&quot;. This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to &quot;receive&quot; it is passed on by being in the presence of another practicing member at the &quot;opening&quot; (see below). About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately. The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space. After a period of sitting quietly, the members are typically asked to stand and relax by a &quot;helper&quot; (see below), who then announces the start of the exercise.

In the practice of the exercise, members are typically advised to follow &quot;what arises from within&quot;, not expecting anything in advance. They are advised not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the transcendent good or the will of God. (The term &quot;God&quot; is used here with a broad and inclusive intention. An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.) One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan. During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever. The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time.

Many Subud members believe that this experience provides them with something of what they currently need in life. For some, the latihan may appear to initially involve a &quot;purification&quot;, which possibly permits subsequently deeper experience. Members may describe their latihan as leaving them feeling &quot;cleansed&quot;, &quot;centered&quot;, &quot;at peace&quot;, or &quot;energized&quot;. The latihan is sometimes said to &quot;work&quot; 24 hours a day, not only when one is explicitly &quot;doing&quot; it. Supposedly, the regular practice of the latihan will enable people to experience positive development in various aspects of their daily life and being. The official website talks of &quot;a deepening of the natural connection with wisdom, one&#x27;s higher self, the divine, or God, depending on one&#x27;s preferred terminology&quot;. (see links)

Although the latihan can be practised alone, members are advised to participate regularly, ideally twice a week, in a group latihan. When a member has enough experience to reliably sense the appropriate time to finish his or her latihan session, he or she may add perhaps one more weekly session of the latihan at home.

While the suggestions of Subud&#x27;s founder are held as valuable by many members, there is no requirement to believe anything, and the latihan is open to individuals of all faiths or none. Subud officially endorses no doctrine regarding the latihan&#x27;s nature or benefits.

===The Opening===
The &quot;opening&quot; refers to a person&#x27;s first latihan, which is specially arranged to pass on the &quot;contact&quot;, metaphorically resembling a candle flame that lights a new candle with no difference in quality of the flame. Only after the formal opening process, in most cases, is a person able to receive for himself or herself, and is then welcome to participate in the group latihan. In the opening, the person is accompanied by one or more experienced members called &quot;helpers&quot;, and is asked to simply stand and relax with the helpers standing nearby. A simple statement or agreed set of &quot;opening words&quot; is read by one of the helpers that acknowledges the person&#x27;s wish to receive the contact. The helpers then begin the exercise as they would normally do. The contact is passed on to the new member without effort or intention on the part of anyone present. This is the moment of the person&#x27;s first connection with the latihan kejiwaan of Subud.

===Testing===
Testing is a distinct variety of the latihan directed toward receiving guidance or insight on a particular issue. Some question or request for clarification is acknowledged, and then the exercise is performed with openness to the issue. The original word for testing used by Muhammad Subuh was &quot;terimah,&quot; which is Indonesian for &quot;receiving&quot;. Many people who have been practicing the latihan for some time claim to be able to recognize indications or intuitions &quot;from their inner feeling&quot; in response to questions that are put forward.

Such indications may take various forms, including sounds, visions, vibrations and/or spontaneous physical movements similar to, though perhaps more intense than, those experienced in the usual latihan. However, it appears that such indications often defy intellectual analysis and that the supposed guidance can be obscured or biased by the mental or emotional attitudes of those present. Testing is generally viewed as an instrument for helping to clarify issues in the present, but may lead to confusion if treated as a kind of fortune-telling. Nevertheless, many Subud members claim to benefit from testing in terms of resolving issues.

Testing is normally used to help select helpers, and often committee members, throughout the World Subud Association. Pak Subuh&#x27;s book &quot;Susila Budhi Dharma&quot; cites examples of situations in which testing may be useful, including self-training in putting any benefits of the latihan into practice. (Throughout Muhammad Subuh&#x27;s book &quot;Susila Budhi Dharma&quot;, which was written in 1952, testing is always referred to as &quot;feeling&quot; or &quot;receiving&quot;. The first time &quot;testing&quot; was called by that name was in 1957 by John G. Bennett.)

===Fasting===
Individual Subud members often voluntarily engage in occasional fasting as Pak Subuh recommended. Each year, some members fast at the same time as the Muslim fast of Ramadan which Pak Subuh, himself a Muslim, claimed to be suitable for non-Muslims. Others fast during Lent or simply on a regular, private basis. In this context, fasting is regarded by many Subud members as spiritually edifying, although its practice is not expected.

===Rules===
Pak Subuh provided advice and guidance in his talks to provide direction to members as their latihan deepens. Although in general there are no rules in the practice of the latihan, non-members may not attend the latihan exercise without first receiving the contact referred to above, known as their opening.

Subud&#x27;s founder wanted the latihan to be accessible to people of all cultures, faiths and ethnicities. Respect for the diversity of personal backgrounds and the uniqueness of each individual, along with a general absence of &quot;thou shalt nots&quot;, are aspects of the organization that have been attractive to many members.

==Association==
Members who wish to take on organizational responsibility in Subud can volunteer as a committee member or as a helper. Each responsibility can be performed at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Members often move from one responsibility to another, as needed.

The broadest organizational responsibility rests with the World Subud Association, which organizes a World Congress every four years and consists of the Subud World Council, Subud representatives from each country, and individual members who wish to participate, although only representatives can vote. The headquarters of the international organization moves to a different country every four years.

===Helpers===

Each level of the association has members called &quot;helpers&quot; whose role is to coordinate the timing of group latihan, witness the opening of new members, speak to those interested in the latihan, be available to discuss problems relating to the latihan, and sometimes attend to the latihan needs of isolated or indisposed Subud members. Helpers are usually selected from members who are willing to perform the duties, and selection generally occurs through testing. In no way does selection mean that a person is more spiritually advanced than a member who is not a helper.

Helpers exist at the local, regional (in some countries), national and international levels. Helpers&#x27; geographical status relates to the regional or national supportive duties they are expected to provide – otherwise, there are no geographical restrictions on where a helper is considered to be a helper. A local helper from London who travels to Jakarta, for example, will be seen as a helper there, and can do testing or participate in a new member&#x27;s opening in the same way as any Indonesian helper.

There are normally 18 international helpers—nine men and nine women. Three men and three women are assigned to each of the three areas in Subud:

# Area I covers Zones 1 &amp; 2 (Australasia and Asia)
# Area II covers Zones 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Europe and Africa)
# Area III covers Zones 7, 8 &amp; 9 (the Americas)

The international helpers are members of the World Subud Council. They serve on a voluntary basis for a four-year term, which runs from World Congress to World Congress. There is no distinction in rank between local, national, or international helpers. Nor is there a difference in status between helpers, committee or members. Being a helper is seen not as a talent but as a service role.

===Ibu Rahayu===
Ibu Siti Rahayu Wiryohudoyo is Pak Subuh&#x27;s eldest daughter. In a talk given on 5 March 2010 to a National Gathering in Semarang, Indonesia, Ibu Siti Rahayu explains how she came to be appointed &quot;spiritual advisor&quot; by the Subud International Congress.

===Committees===
Most Subud groups have a committee, typically including a chairperson, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary. This committee is responsible for making sure there is a place to do group latihan, communications, budgets, and supporting the mutual efforts of members at the local group. A similar structure functions at the regional (in certain countries), national, zonal and international levels.

The international executive is the International Subud Committee (ISC). Apart from ensuring communication, publishing, budgeting, archives and support of affiliates, it organizes a World Congress every four years. The ISC chairperson sits on the World Subud Council.

For purposes of a practical organizational structure, the Subud association is divided into nine multinational zones, more or less as follows:

:*Zones 1 &amp; 2 – Australasia and Asia
:*Zone 3 – includes 8 countries of western Europe
:*Zone 4 – central and eastern European countries
:*Zones 5 &amp; 6 – Francophone and Anglophone African countries, respectively
:*Zone 7 – USA, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Surinam, and the Caribbean
:*Zone 8 – the upper part of South America
:*Zone 9 – the lower part of South America

Each Zone has its own four representatives that are the voting members on the World Subud Council. They also serve as volunteers a four-year term like helpers. They are selected at Zone Meetings.

The chairperson of the World Subud Association serves a four-year term from one World Congress to the next and is also the chairperson of the World Subud Council. The World Subud Council is responsible for ensuring that decisions made at World Congress are carried through.

===Affiliates===
Subud affiliates (sometimes called ‘wings’) are subsidiary organizations that focus on specific projects at a national or international level. They are technically independent organizations but have overlapping boards of trustees. They include:

:*Susila Dharma International Association (SDI or SDIA) – humanitarian projects
:*Subud International Cultural Association (SICA) – networking cultural activities
:*Subud Enterprise Services International (SES or SESI) – networks between entrepreneurial activities
:*Subud Youth Association (SYA) – networks among younger Subud members
:*Subud International Health Organisation (SIHA) – incorporates both scientific and alternative approaches

Some chairpersons of these affiliates also sit on the World Subud Council and serve a four-year term.

In addition to the above affiliates, a foundation – the Muhammad Subuh Foundation (MSF) – has been set up, whose main work is helping groups acquire their own latihan premises.

Informal networks and interest groups initiated by members include a Peace Network, a Spiritual Support Network (Yahoo group) and several Facebook groups.

===Enterprises===
When Subud first spread outside Indonesia, Pak Subuh talked mainly about the spiritual exercise. He started to encourage Subud members to engage in enterprises and donate a proportion of profits to welfare projects and to maintaining the Subud organisation. He explained that the fact of the latihan &quot;bringing to life&quot; the physical body indicates that worship need not be viewed as narrowly as prayer in places of worship; that people&#x27;s ordinary lives, when following and guided by the Power of God, are ongoing worship, such that there is a dynamic interplay between &quot;material&quot; life and &quot;spiritual&quot; life. Therefore, his encouragement for Subud members to engage in enterprise is seen in the context of putting the latihan into practice.

===Membership===
Membership is open to any person over 17 years of age, irrespective of the person&#x27;s religion or lack of religion. (As Pak Subuh saw it, the latihan is for &quot;all of mankind.&quot;) The exception is that someone suffering from a serious mental illness may not be initiated as a member.

There is normally a waiting period of up to three months before a person may be opened. During this period, the enquirer is expected to meet a few times with the local helpers so that he or she can have questions answered and doubts clarified.

There is no membership fee, but most Subud members contribute, for example, to the rent or upkeep of premises where they meet.

===Update===
Some long established Subud groups and communities are dwindling or folding. Stalwart longstanding members are aging and dying while there are very few new enquiries and fewer new members.

Why is this? Subud has always avoided self-promotion. But in the 1950s - 1970s when Subud was growing and spreading there were a number of current books in print that reached library shelves and there was a community of all ages so that new people had a peer group to join.

The challenge now is that &#x27;seekers&#x27; can easily discover many forms of spirituality while Subud remains almost hidden. The recommended three month introductory period, which in the 1950s - 1970s seemed a reasonable test of sincerity, in today&#x27;s high-speed culture is a far greater deterrent than it was 70 years ago. As an organisation Subud tends to be change-averse, so the challenge these days is how to renew group membership, maintain properties and running costs, and fill committee positions.

<text>The Stolen Generations (also known as Stolen Children) were the children of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent who were removed from their families by the Australian federal and state government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments. The removals of those referred to as &quot;half-caste&quot; children were conducted in the period between approximately 1905 and 1967, although in some places mixed-race children were still being taken into the 1970s.

Official government estimates are that in certain regions between one in ten and one in three Indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970.

The Bringing Them Home Royal Commission report (1997) described the Australian policies of removing Aboriginal children as genocide.

==Emergence of the child-removal policy==
Numerous 19th and early 20th century contemporaneous documents indicate that the policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their mothers related to an assumption that the Aboriginal peoples were dying off. Given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, whites assumed that the full-blood tribal Aboriginal population would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to extinction. The idea expressed by A. O. Neville, the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, and others as late as 1930 was that mixed-race children could be trained to work in white society, and over generations would marry white and be assimilated into the society.

The Colony of Victoria was the first to pass acts (1869 and 1886) that allowed for the removal of mixed-race persons from Aboriginal reserves. With an 1899 regulation expressly granting permission for the removal of Aboriginal children from their families.

Some European Australians considered any proliferation of mixed-descent children (labelled &quot;half-castes&quot;, &quot;crossbreeds&quot;, &quot;quadroons&quot;, and &quot;octoroons&quot;, terms now considered derogatory to Indigenous Australians) to be a threat to the stability of the prevailing culture, or to a perceived racial or cultural &quot;heritage&quot;. The Northern Territory Chief Protector of Aborigines, Dr. Cecil Cook, argued that &quot;everything necessary [must be done] to convert the half-caste into a white citizen&quot;. Studies that were then viewed as scientific claimed that Australian Aborigines traits were less visible after mixing with Europeans than sub-Saharan African traits are, so Australia did not apply a one drop rule to Aborigines like the American South did to people of African descent.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, the segregation of Indigenous Australians of mixed descent from &quot;full-blood&quot; Indigenous people began with the government removing children of mixed descent from their communities and placing them in church-run missions, and later creating segregated reserves and compounds to hold all Indigenous Australians. This was a response to public concern over the increase in the number of mixed-descent children and sexual exploitation of young Aboriginal women by non-Indigenous men, as well as fears among non-Indigenous people of being outnumbered by a mixed-descent population.

Under the &quot;Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910&quot;, the Chief Protector of Aborigines was appointed the &quot;legal guardian of every Aboriginal and every half-caste child up to the age of 18 years&quot;, thus providing the legal basis for enforcing segregation. After the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, under the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot;, the Chief Protector was given total control of all Indigenous women regardless of their age, unless married to a man who was &quot;substantially of European origin&quot;, and his approval was required for any marriage of an Indigenous woman to a non-Indigenous man.

==Policy in practice==

The &quot;Aboriginal Protection Act 1869&quot; (Vic) included the earliest legislation to authorise child removal from Aboriginal parents. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860. Passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and &quot;half-caste&quot; persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially &quot;at-risk&quot; girls. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, similar policies and legislation were adopted by other states and territories, such as the &quot;Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897&quot; (Qld), the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot; (NT), the &quot;Aborigines Act 1934&quot; (SA), and the &quot;1936 Native Administration Act&quot; (WA).

As a result of such legislation, states arranged widespread removal of (primarily) mixed-race children from their Aboriginal mothers. In addition, appointed Aboriginal protectors in each state exercised wide-ranging guardianship powers over Aboriginal people up to the age of 16 or 21, often determining where they could live or work. Policemen or other agents of the state (some designated as &quot;Aboriginal Protection Officers&quot;) were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers, families, and communities into institutions for care. In these Australian states and territories, institutions (both government and missionary) for half-caste children were established in the early decades of the 20th century to care for and to educate the mixed-race children taken from their families, with the goal of assimilation into Anglo-Australian society. Examples of such institutions include Moore River Native Settlement in Western Australia, Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission in Queensland, Ebenezer Mission in Victoria, and Wellington Valley Mission in New South Wales, as well as Catholic missions such as Beagle Bay and Garden Point.

The exact number of children removed is unknown. Estimates of numbers have been widely disputed. The &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report (produced by the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families in 1987), says that &quot;at least 100,000&quot; children were removed from their parents. This figure was estimated by multiplying the Aboriginal population in 1994 (303,000), by the report&#x27;s maximum estimate of &quot;one in three&quot; Aboriginal persons separated from their families. The report stated that &quot;between one in three and one in ten&quot; children were separated from their families. Given differing populations over a long period of time, different policies at different times in different states (which also resulted in different definitions of target children), and incomplete records, accurate figures are difficult to establish. The academic Robert Manne has stated that the lower-end figure of one in 10 is more likely; he estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 Aboriginal children were removed over six decades, based on a survey of self-identified Indigenous people by the television station ABS. According to the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report:

The report closely examined the distinctions between &quot;forcible removal&quot;, &quot;removal under threat or duress&quot;, &quot;official deception&quot;, &quot;uninformed voluntary release&quot;, and &quot;voluntary release&quot;. The evidence indicated that in numerous cases, children were brutally and forcibly removed from their parent or parents, possibly even from the hospital shortly after birth, when identified as mixed-race babies. Aboriginal Protection Officers often made the judgement to remove certain children. In some cases, families were required to sign legal documents to relinquish care to the state. In Western Australia, the &quot;Aborigines Act 1905&quot; removed the legal guardianship of Aboriginal parents. It made all their children legal wards of the state, so the government did not require parental permission to relocate the mixed-race children to institutions.

In 1915, in New South Wales, the &quot;Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915&quot; gave the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Board authority to remove Aboriginal children &quot;without having to establish in court that they were neglected.&quot; At the time, some members of Parliament objected to the NSW amendment; one member stated it enabled the Board to &quot;steal the child away from its parents.&quot; At least two members argued that the amendment would result in children being subjected to unpaid labour (at institutions or farms) tantamount to &quot;slavery&quot;. Writing in the 21st century, Professor Peter Read said that Board members, in recording reasons for removal of children, noted simply &quot;For being Aboriginal.&quot;

In 1909, the Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly &quot;lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute&quot;. South argued that &quot;all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected&quot;. His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the &quot;Aborigines Act (1911).&quot; This designated his position as the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, not only the so-called &quot;half-castes&quot;.

The &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report identified instances of official misrepresentation and deception, such as when caring and able parents were incorrectly described by Aboriginal Protection Officers as not being able to properly provide for their children. In other instances, parents were told by government officials that their child or children had died, even though this was not the case. One first-hand account referring to events in 1935 stated:

The report discovered that removed children were, in most cases, placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations. A significant number, particularly females, were &quot;fostered&quot; out. Children taken to such institutions were trained to be assimilated to Anglo-Australian culture. Policies included punishment for speaking their local Indigenous languages. The intention was to educate them for a different future and to prevent their being socialised in Aboriginal cultures. The boys were generally trained as agricultural labourers and the girls as domestic servants; these were the chief occupations of many Europeans at the time in the largely rural areas outside cities.

A common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. As is stated in the report:
the physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children&#x27;s homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered.

The children were taken into care purportedly to protect them from neglect and abuse. However sexual assault and abuse was widespread, with the report finding that among the 502 inquiry witnesses, 17% of female witnesses and 7.7% of male witnesses reported having suffered a sexual assault while in an institution, at work, or while living with a foster or adoptive family. Beyond this, conditions in the institutions were found to be invariably poor, with severe discipline, excessive child labour, poor nutrition, physical and emotional abuse, and poor quality education. Staff were found to be generally unqualified and given complete control and power over the children.

Documentary evidence, such as newspaper articles and reports to parliamentary committees, suggest a range of rationales. Apparent motivations included the belief that the Aboriginal people would die out, given their catastrophic population decline after white contact, the belief that they were heathens and were better off in non-indigenous households, and the belief that full-blooded Aboriginal people resented miscegenation and the mixed-race children fathered and abandoned by white men.

==Effects on the removed and their descendants==
===Removed people===
The stated aim of the &quot;resocialisation&quot; program was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern [European-Australian] society; however, a recent study conducted in Melbourne reported that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of &quot;removed&quot; Aboriginal people as compared to &quot;non-removed&quot;. Particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education, the removed children had about the same results as those who were not removed. In the early decades of the program, post-secondary education was limited for most Australians, but the removed children lagged behind their white contemporaries as educational opportunities improved.

The study indicated that removed Aboriginal people were less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record, and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs as were Aboriginal people who grew up in their ethnic community. The only notable advantage &quot;removed&quot; Aboriginal people achieved was a higher average income. The report noted this was likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginal people living in remote communities. There seemed to be little evidence that removed mixed-race Aboriginal people had been successful in gaining better work even in urbanised areas.

By around the age of 18, the children were released from government control. In cases where their files were available, individuals were sometimes allowed to view their own files. According to the testimony of one Aboriginal person:

I was requested to attend at the Sunshine Welfare Offices, where they formerly (sic) discharged me from State ward ship. It took the Senior Welfare Officer a mere 20 minutes to come clean, and tell me everything that my heart had always wanted to know...that I was of &quot;Aboriginal descent&quot;, that I had a Natural mother, father, three brothers and a sister, who were alive...He placed in front of me 368 pages of my file, together with letters, photos and birthday cards. He informed me that my surname would change back to my Mother&#x27;s maiden name of Angus.

The &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report condemned the policy of disconnecting children from their cultural heritage. One witness said to the commission:

I&#x27;ve got everything that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that&#x27;s all material stuff. It&#x27;s all the non-material stuff that I didn&#x27;t have—the lineage... You know, you&#x27;ve just come out of nowhere; there you are.

In 2015, many of the recommendations of &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; were yet to be fulfilled. In 2017, 35% of all children in out-of-home care in Australia identify as being Aboriginal, an increase from 20% in 1997 when &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; was published.

===Generational effects===
A 2019 study by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found that children living in households with members of the Stolen Generations are more likely &quot;to experience a range of adverse outcomes&quot;, including poor health, especially mental health, missing school and living in poverty. There are high incidences of anxiety, depression, PTSD and suicide, along with alcohol abuse, among the Stolen Generations, with this resulting in unstable parenting and family situations.

==Public awareness and recognition==
Historian Professor Peter Read, then at the Australian National University, was the first to use the phrase &quot;stolen generation&quot;. He published a magazine article on the topic with this title, based on his research. He expanded the article into a book, &quot;The Stolen Generations&quot; (1981). Widespread awareness of the Stolen Generations, and the practices that created them, grew in the late 1980s through the efforts of Aboriginal and white activists, artists, and musicians (Archie Roach&#x27;s &quot;Took the Children Away&quot; and Midnight Oil&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Heart&quot; being examples of the latter). The &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; case (commonly known as the &quot;Mabo case&quot;) attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.

In early 1995, Rob Riley, an activist with the Aboriginal Legal Service, published &quot;Telling Our Story.&quot; It described the large-scale negative effects of past government policies that resulted in the removal of thousands of mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families and their being reared in a variety of conditions in missions, orphanages, reserves, and white foster homes.

The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&#x27;s &quot;National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families&quot; commenced in May 1995, presided over by the Commission&#x27;s president Sir Ronald Wilson and its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Dodson. During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from more than 600 more. In April 1997, the Commission released its official &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report.

Between the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the government of John Howard had replaced the Paul Keating government. At the Australian Reconciliation Convention in May 1997, Howard was quoted as saying: &quot;Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies.&quot;

Following publication of the report, the parliament of the Northern Territory and the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales passed formal apologies to the Aboriginal people affected. On 26 May 1998, the first &quot;National Sorry Day&quot; was held; reconciliation events such as the Walk for Reconciliation across Sydney Harbour Bridge and in other cities were held nationally, and attended by a total of more than one million people. As public pressure continued to increase on the government, Howard drafted a Motion of Reconciliation with Senator Aden Ridgeway, expressing &quot;deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents&quot;, which was passed by the federal parliament in August 1999. Howard said that the Stolen Generation represented &quot;the most blemished chapter in the history of this country&quot;.

Activists took the issue of the Stolen Generations to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. At its hearing on this subject in July 2000, the Commission on Human Rights strongly criticised the Howard government for its handling of issues related to the Stolen Generations. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination concluded its discussion of Australia&#x27;s 12th report on its actions by acknowledging &quot;the measures taken to facilitate family reunion and to improve counselling and family support services for the victims&quot;, but expressed concern: 
that the Commonwealth Government does not support a formal national apology and that it considers inappropriate the provision of monetary compensation for those forcibly and unjustifiably separated from their families, on the grounds that such practices were sanctioned by law at the time and were intended to &quot;assist the people whom they affected&quot;.The Committee recommended &quot;that the State party consider the need to address appropriately the extraordinary harm inflicted by these racially discriminatory practices.&quot;

Activists highlighted the Stolen Generations and related Aboriginal issues during the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. They set up a large &quot;Aboriginal Tent City&quot; on the grounds of Sydney University to bring attention to Aboriginal issues in general. Cathy Freeman is an Aboriginal athlete who was chosen to light the Olympic flame and won the gold medal in the 400 metre sprint. In interviews, she said that her own grandmother was a victim of forced removal. The internationally successful rock group Midnight Oil attracted worldwide media interest by performing at the Olympic closing ceremony in black sweatsuits with the word &quot;SORRY&quot; emblazoned across them.

In 2000, Australian journalist Phillip Knightley summed up the Stolen Generations in these terms:

This cannot be over-emphasized—the Australian government literally kidnapped these children from their parents as a matter of policy. White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them away. If their parents protested they were held at bay by police.

According to the archaeologist and writer Josephine Flood, &quot;The well-meaning but ill-conceived policy of forced assimilation of mixed-race Aborigines is now universally condemned for the trauma and loss of language and culture it brought to the stolen children and their families.&quot;

==Australian federal parliament apology==


One of the recommendations of the 1997 Bringing Them Home report was for Australian parliaments to offer an official apology. A decade later, on 13 February 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd presented an apology to Indigenous Australians as a motion to be voted on by the house. The apology text was as follows:

The text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people generally or to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action. The government&#x27;s apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-Indigenous general public.

Opposition leader Brendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the &quot;under-policing&quot; of child welfare in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people. His speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in around Australia to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House&#x27;s Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs.

The apology was unanimously adopted by the House of Representatives, although six members of Nelson&#x27;s opposition caucus left the House in protest at the apology. Later that day, the Senate considered a motion for an identical apology, which was also passed unanimously. Beforehand, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attempted to amend the motion to include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past Indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties.

==Legal cases and compensation==

The states all have redress schemes: first Tasmania (2006), followed by Western Australia (2007), Queensland (2012), South Australia (2015), New South Wales (2017) and Victoria (2022), while a redress scheme for the territories, formerly controlled by the Commonwealth Government, was announced in August 2021.

For victims of sexual abuse, there is also National Redress Scheme, set up in the wake of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which started on 1 July 2019 and open for applications until 30 June 2027.

===New South Wales===
Compensation claims have been heard by the NSW Supreme Court&#x27;s Court of Appeal in &quot;Williams v The Minister Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 and New South Wales&quot; [2000] NSWCA 255 and the Australian Federal Court in &quot;Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia&quot; [2000] FCA 1084. In &quot;Williams&quot;, an individual (rather than a group of plaintiffs) made claims in negligence arising from having been placed under the control of the Aborigines Welfare Board pursuant to s 7(2) of the &quot;Aborigines Welfare Act 1909&quot; shortly after her birth, and was placed by the Board with the United Aborigines Mission at its Aborigines Children Home at Bomaderry near Nowra, NSW. The trial judge found that there was no duty of care and therefore that an action in negligence could not succeed. This was upheld by the NSW Court of Appeal in 2000.

In relation to whether the action in NSW courts was limited by the passage of time, the Court of Appeal, reversing Studert J, extended the limitation period for the non-equitable claims by about three decades pursuant to s 60G of the &quot;Limitation Act 1969&quot; (&quot;Williams v Minister&quot;, &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983&quot; (1994) 35 NSWLR 497).

Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#x27;s 2008 Apology to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples was not expected to have any legal effect on claims for compensation in NSW.

New South Wales set up a scheme running from 1 July 2017 until 30 June 2022, enabling survivors to claim compensation. Its funding also allows for a healing fund, allocating grants to healing centres, memorials and keeping places, as well as a separate fund to help fund Stolen Generations members&#x27; funerals. There were estimated to be between 700 and 1,300 survivors in NSW in 2017.

===Queensland===
Queensland has the &quot;Redress Scheme&quot; that provides compensation payments ranging from $7000 to $40,000 to people who experienced abuse and neglect as children in Queensland institutions (Government of Queensland 2012). The scheme is not exclusive for Indigenous peoples but is for anyone who experienced abuse as a child whilst in state care.

===South Australia===
In June 1998, Bruce Trevorrow, a Ngarrindjeri man, sued the South Australian Government for pain and suffering suffered as a result of his being removed from his parents when he was a baby. 
On 1 August 2007, aged 50, Trevorrow became the first member of the Stolen Generations to be awarded compensation by a court of law, when it awarded him . The SA government appealed in February 2008, but lost their appeal in March 2010, but Trevorrow had died only a few months after they lodged the appeal.

The South Australian reparations scheme was set up in November 2015, after a 2013 parliamentary committee reported that such a fund would be cheaper than fighting legal claims. The fund allows for around 300 eligible people to receive up to each. A Individual Reparations Scheme provided ex-gratia payments to Aboriginal people who were eligible for reparations, and in 2018, a payment of was made to eligible applicants, with an additional to follow. After the total fund of was underspent, the Community Reparations Fund was established to support projects that would promote healing for the Stolen Generations, their families and the wider community.

===Tasmania===
In October 2006 the Tasmanian Government allocated a package of to fund various reconciliation measures, including compensation for affected people, or their descendants if no longer living, under the &quot;Stolen Generation of Aboriginal Children Act 2006&quot;. In a first for the country, 106 people were found to qualify for the payments.

===Victoria===
On 3 March 2022, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced a reparations package worth . Aboriginal Victorians who were removed before 1977 are able to access payments of each. Each person deemed eligible will also receive a personal apology from the Victorian Government and access to healing programs. It is thought that around 12000 people will be eligible to access the payments and programs. The reparations package was raised as a key issue at the first meeting of the First Peoples&#x27; Assembly of Victoria in 2020, and Andrews acknowledged that it was long overdue. Applications open on 31 March 2022.

===Western Australia===
Western Australia has a redress scheme that is not exclusive for Indigenous peoples but is for anyone who experienced abuse as a child whilst in state care.

===Territories===
====&quot;Kruger v Commonwealth&quot;====

====21st century====
A compensation fund worth was announced by the federal government on 6 August 2021, to be used to award one-off payments of in recognition of the harm suffered as well as to pay for counselling, for survivors of the Stolen Generations in the Northern Territory, Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory.

A class action on behalf of around 1700 deceased estates and family members was launched in the Northern Territory in 2021. In August 2022 the Commonwealth agreed to pay compensation of over A$50 million to the claimants, pending formal approval from the New South Wales Supreme Court.

==Historical debate==
===Use of the word &quot;stolen&quot;===
The word &quot;stolen&quot; is used here to refer to the Aboriginal children having been taken away from their families. It has been in use for this since the early 20th century. For instance, Patrick McGarry, a member of the Parliament of New South Wales, objected to the &quot;Aborigines Protection Amending Act 1915&quot; which authorised the Aborigines&#x27; Protection Board to remove Aboriginal children from their parents without having to establish cause. McGarry described the policy as &quot;steal[ing] the child away from its parents&quot;.

In 1924, the &quot;Adelaide&quot; &quot;Sun&quot; wrote: &quot;The word &#x27;stole&#x27; may sound a bit far-fetched but by the time we have told the story of the heart-broken Aboriginal mother we are sure the word will not be considered out of place.&quot;

In most jurisdictions, Indigenous Australians were put under the authority of a Protector, effectively being made wards of the State. The protection was done through each jurisdiction&#x27;s Aboriginal Protection Board; in Victoria and Western Australia these boards were also responsible for applying what were known as &quot;Half-Caste Acts&quot;.

More recent usage has developed since Peter Read&#x27;s publication of &quot;The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal Children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969&quot; (1981), which examined the history of these government actions. The 1997 publication of the government&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Them Home – Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families&quot; heightened awareness of the Stolen Generations. The acceptance of the term in Australia is illustrated by the 2008 formal apology to the Stolen Generations, led by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and passed by both houses of the Parliament of Australia. Previous apologies had been offered by State and Territory governments in the period 1997–2001.

Some have objected to the use of the term &quot;Stolen Generations&quot;. Former Prime Minister John Howard did not believe the government should apologise to the Australian Aboriginal peoples. Then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs John Herron disputed usage of the term in April 2000. Others who disputed the use of the term include Peter Howson, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1971 to 1972, and Keith Windschuttle, an historian who argues that some of the abuses towards Australian Aboriginal peoples have been exaggerated and in some cases invented. Many historians argue against these denials, including to Windschuttle in particular. Anthropologist Ron Brunton also criticised the proceedings on the basis that there was no cross-examination of those giving their testimonies or critical examination of the factual basis of the testimony.

The &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report provided extensive details about the removal programs and their effects. Sir Ronald Wilson, former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission and a Commissioner on the Inquiry, stated that &quot;when it comes to the credibility of those stories, there is ample credibility, not from the cross-examination of the children themselves, but from the governments whose laws, practices and policies enabled these forced removals to take place. We had the support of every State government; they came to the Inquiry, came with lever-arch files setting out the laws from the earliest days right up to the end of the assimilation policy, that is up to the 1970s and more importantly, senior government officers attended. In every case, these senior officers acknowledged that there was a lot of cruelty in the application of those laws and policies.&quot;

In April 2000, Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron tabled a report in the Australian Parliament in response to the Human Rights Commission report which stated that, as &quot;only 10% of Aboriginal children&quot; had been removed, they did not constitute an entire &quot;generation&quot;. The report attracted media attention and protests. Herron apologised for the &quot;understandable offence taken by some people&quot; as a result of his comments, although he refused to alter the report as it had been tabled.

Historian Peter Read referred to the children affected as the &quot;Stolen Generations&quot;. Another historian, Robert Manne, defended that terminology, making the analogy that other people refer to the &quot;generation that lost their lives in the First World War&quot; without meaning over 50 per cent of the young people at the time; rather, people use that phrasing as a metaphor for a collective experience. Similarly, he believes, some of the Aboriginal community use the term to describe their collective suffering.

===Genocide debate===
There is ongoing contention among politicians, commentators, and historical, political, and legal experts as to whether the forced removals of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that occurred during the Stolen Generations can be accurately described as genocidal acts, and particularly whether they meet the definition of genocide in article II (e) of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. While it is generally not disputed that these forced removals occurred, the contention surrounds whether they were enacted with the intention of destroying the Indigenous people of Australia. There is further contention as to whether those responsible for the Stolen Generations should be criminally liable for genocide. In response to a submission by the National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Johnston considered whether the policies and practices of the Australian Governments pertinent to the Stolen Generations constituted a breach of the Convention but concluded that &quot;[i]t is not my function to interpret the Convention or to decide whether it has been breached, particularly since the policies involved were modified in 1962 somewhat and abandoned by 1970&quot;. The &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report concluded that:
However, in the subsequent case of &quot;Kruger v Commonwealth&quot;, the High Court judges rejected the claim of the plaintiffs that the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot; authorised genocide as defined by the Convention and ruled that there was no legislation to implement the Convention under Australian municipal law at the time. One of the recommendations of the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report was that &#x27;the Commonwealth legislate to implement the Genocide Convention with full domestic effect&#x27;. While genocide has been a crime under international law since the commencement of the Convention in 1951, in accordance with Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, it has only been a crime under Australian law since the commencement of the &quot;International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Act 2002&quot;, and so the Stolen Generations cannot be considered genocide under Australian law because the Act is not retrospective. In its twelfth report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Australian Government argued that the removal policies and programs did not constitute a breach of the Convention.

In 1997, Sir Ronald Wilson, then President of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, commissioner of the &quot;National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families&quot;, and co-author of the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report, argued that the policies resulting in the Stolen Generations constitute attempted genocide: he stated, &quot;It clearly was attempted genocide. It was believed that the Aboriginal people would die out.&quot;

Manne argues that the expressed views of government bureaucrats, such as A. O. Neville, to assimilate the mixed-race children into the white population by means of &quot;breeding out the colour&quot;, and therefore eventually resulting in the full-bloods being &quot;forgotten&quot;, bore strong similarities to the racial views of the Nazis in 1930s Nazi Germany. Manne points out that, though the term &quot;genocide&quot; had not yet entered the English language, the policies of Neville and others were termed by some contemporaries as the &quot;die out&quot; or &quot;breed out&quot; policy, giving an indication of their proposed intent. He also states that academics &quot;generally acknowledge&quot; that the authors of the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report were wrong to argue that Australian authorities had committed genocide by removing indigenous children from their families. Social assimilation has never been regarded in law as equivalent to genocide.

Though genocide historian Paul Bartrop rejects the use of the word genocide to describe Australian colonial history in general, he does believe that it applies to describing the Stolen Generations. Bartrop and US genocide scholar Samuel Totten together wrote the &quot;Dictionary of Genocide&quot;, for which Bartrop wrote the entry on Australia. He said he used as the benchmark for usage of the term genocide the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which is also cited in the &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot; report.

In 2006, Australian historian Patrick Wolfe wrote:To take an example from genocide&#x27;s definitional core, Article II (d) of the UN Convention on Genocide, which seems to have been relatively overlooked in Australian discussions, includes among the acts that constitute genocide (assuming they are committed with intent to destroy a target group in whole or in part) the imposition of &quot;measures intended to prevent births within the group.&quot; Given that the Australian practice of abducting Aboriginal children, assuming its &quot;success&quot;, would bring about a situation in which second-generation offspring were born into a group that was different from the one from which the child/parent had originally been abducted, there is abundant evidence of genocide being practised in post-war Australia on the basis of Article II (d) alone.In 2008, Australian historian Inga Clendinnen suggested that the term genocide rests on the &quot;question of intentionality&quot;, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s not much doubt, with great murderous performances that were typically called genocide, that they were deliberate and intentional. Beyond that, it always gets very murky.&quot;

==Representation in other media==
===Documentary===
*The documentary &quot;Lousy Little Sixpence&quot; (1983) was the first film to deal with the Stolen Generations. Directed and produced by Alec Morgan, it won several international and Australian awards. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation did not air it for two years. The film is now standard fare in educational institutions, and has been highly influential.
*The documentary film &quot;Kanyini&quot; (2006), directed by Melanie Hogan, featured Bob Randall. He is an elder of the Yankunytjatjara people and one of the listed traditional owners of Uluru. He was taken away from his mother as a child, living at the government reservation until he was 20, and working at various jobs, including as a carpenter, stockman, and crocodile hunter. He helped establish the Adelaide Community College and has lectured on Aboriginal cultures. He served as the director of the Northern Australia Legal Aid Service and established Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander centres at the Australian National University, University of Canberra, and University of Wollongong.
*Episode 5, &quot;Unhealthy Government Experiment&quot;, of the 1998 SBS documentary television series &quot;First Australians&quot; concerns the Stolen Generations in Western Australia.

===Feature film and television drama===
*The Australian film &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; (2002), directed by Phillip Noyce, was loosely based on the book &quot;Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; by Doris Pilkington Garimara. It concerns the author&#x27;s mother and two other mixed-race Aboriginal girls who ran away from Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth, and returned to their Aboriginal families. In a subsequent interview with the ABC, Doris recalled her removal in 1931 from her mother at age three or four, and subsequent rearing at the settlement. She was not reunited with her mother until she was 25; all those years, she believed that her mother had given her away. When the two women were reunited, Doris was no longer able to speak her native language and had been taught to regard Indigenous culture as evil.
*Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Australia&quot;, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, deals with the Stolen Generations.
*The Australian film &quot;The Sapphires&quot; (2012), written by Tony Briggs and based on his 2004 stage play of the same name, tells the story of an Aboriginal girl group performing in Vietnam during the Vietnam War, with one member having been stolen from her family as a child. The film is loosely based on the lives of Briggs&#x27; mother and aunt.

===Stage===
*&quot;Stolen&quot; (1998) is a play by Australian playwright Jane Harrison. It tells the story of five fictional Aboriginal people by the names of Sandy, Ruby, Jimmy, Anne, and Shirley who dealt with the issues for forceful removal by Australian governments. 
*The Indigenous opera &quot;Pecan Summer&quot; (2010) by Deborah Cheetham, which premiered in Mooroopna, is set at Federation Square, in Melbourne, on the day of Kevin Rudd&#x27;s apology, and quotes some of his words.

===Literature===
*Bryce Courtenay&#x27;s novel &quot;Jessica&quot; tells of a case brought in a New South Wales court against the Aboriginal Protection Board. It challenged the &quot;Aboriginal Protection Act of 1909&quot; in order to return two children from Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls to the Aboriginal mother.
*Aboriginal artist and author Sally Morgan has written several novels based on the lives of her and her family members, featuring intimate portrayals of the impact of forced removal on individuals, their families, and communities, although Sally herself was not a stolen child. Her first, &quot;My Place&quot;, involves her quest to uncover her Aboriginal heritage which had previously been denied by her family, who insisted &quot;as a survival mechanism&quot; that they were of Indian extraction.
*&quot;Benang&quot; is Indigenous Australian Kim Scott&#x27;s second novel. &quot;Benang&quot; is about forced assimilation and finding how one can return to one&#x27;s own culture. The novel presents how difficult it is to form a working history of a population who had been historically uprooted from its past. &quot;Benang&quot; follows Harley, a young man who has gone through the process of &quot;breeding out the colour&quot;, as he pieces together his family history through documentation, such as photograph and his grandfather&#x27;s notes, as well as memories and experiences. Harley and his family have undergone a process of colonial scientific experimentation called &quot;breeding of the colour&quot;, which separated individuals from their indigenous families and origins.

==Trauma and healing==
Trauma suffered as a result of children being separated from their families and forced to adopt a culture foreign to them is ongoing and passed down through generations.

The Healing Foundation is a government-funded body established on 30 October 2009 as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Healing Foundation was established after several months of consultation with community representatives. The head office is in Canberra, with branches in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Darwin and on the Torres Strait Islands. the Foundation had provided funding for more than 175 community organisations to develop and run healing projects, &quot;to address the ongoing trauma caused by actions like the forced removal of children from their families&quot;. It also conducts research into Indigenous healing.

The Marumali Program was designed and established by Stolen Generations survivor Lorraine Peeters, starting with her presentation of the model she had created, the &quot;Marumali Journey of Healing Model&quot;, to a conference of mental health professionals at a conference in Sydney in 1999. Her body of work was copyrighted and subsequently circulated to and used by many organisations to help survivors to heal from specific types of trauma suffered as a result of the removals. Peeters then developed the Marumali Program to train Indigenous counsellors to use her model. , she and her daughter continue to give workshops, both in the community and in prisons. &quot;Marumali&quot; is a Gamilaroi word meaning &quot;to put back together&quot;, and she says it relates to the ultimate goal of reconnecting with what has been lost. She continues to advise the Healing Foundation.

==&quot;White stolen generations&quot;==

During the same period from the 1930s to 1982, 250,000 Australian-born non-Indigenous children were also removed from parents who were deemed &quot;unfit&quot;, and forcibly adopted. The term &quot;white stolen generations&quot; has been used by survivors of this practice.

<text>Lucius Septimius Severus (; ; 11 April 145 – 4 February 211) was Roman emperor from 193 to 211. He was born in Leptis Magna (present-day Al-Khums, Libya) in the Roman province of Africa. As a young man he advanced through the customary succession of offices under the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Severus was the final contender to seize power after the death of the emperor Pertinax in 193 during the Year of the Five Emperors.

After deposing and killing the incumbent emperor Didius Julianus, Severus fought his rival claimants, the Roman generals Pescennius Niger and Clodius Albinus. Niger was defeated in 194 at the Battle of Issus in Cilicia. Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier, annexing the Kingdom of Osroene as a new province. Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the Battle of Lugdunum in Gaul. Following the consolidation of his rule over the western provinces, Severus waged another brief, more successful war in the east against the Parthian Empire, sacking their capital Ctesiphon in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the Tigris. He then enlarged and fortified the &quot;Limes Arabicus&quot; in Arabia Petraea. In 202, he campaigned in Africa and Mauretania against the Garamantes, capturing their capital Garama, and expanding the &quot;Limes Tripolitanus&quot; along the southern desert frontier of the empire.

With his second wife, Julia Domna, Severus had two sons; the elder, Caracalla, was proclaimed &quot;Augustus&quot;, or co-emperor, in 198, and the younger, Geta, in 209. Severus travelled to Britain in 208, strengthening Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and reoccupying the Antonine Wall. In 209 he invaded Caledonia (modern Scotland) with an army of 50,000 men but his ambitions were cut short when he died of an infectious disease in early 211 at Eboracum (modern York). His sons, advised by Julia Domna, succeeded him, thus founding the Severan dynasty. It was the last dynasty of the Roman Empire before the Crisis of the Third Century.

== Early life ==

=== Family and education ===

Born on 11 April 145 at Leptis Magna (in present-day Libya) as the son of Publius Septimius Geta and Fulvia Pia, Septimius Severus came from a wealthy and distinguished family of equestrian rank. On his mother&#x27;s side, he descended from Roman immigrants (the Fulvii) who had intermarried with locals of Libyan origin. His father, Publius Septimius Geta, hailed from a family of Libyan-Punic origin. Severus had thus Italic, Libyan and Punic ancestry. He was described as &quot;Libyan by race&quot;, by the Roman historian and senator Cassius Dio. Due to his family background he is considered the first provincial emperor, as he was the first emperor not only born in the provinces but also into a provincial family of non-Italian origin. Severus&#x27; father, an obscure provincial, held no major political status, but he had two cousins, Publius Septimius Aper and Gaius Septimius Severus, who served as consuls under the emperor Antoninus Pius . His mother&#x27;s ancestors had moved from Italy to North Africa; they belonged to the &quot;gens&quot; Fulvia, an Italian patrician family that originated in Tusculum.

Septimius Severus had two siblings: an elder brother, Publius Septimius Geta; and a younger sister, Septimia Octavilla. Severus&#x27; maternal cousin was the praetorian prefect and consul Gaius Fulvius Plautianus. Septimius Severus grew up in Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic language fluently, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus&#x27; education but, according to Cassius Dio, the boy had been eager for more education than he actually received. Presumably, Severus received lessons in oratory: at the age of 17, he gave his first public speech.

=== Public service ===

Severus sought a public career in Rome in around 162. At the recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus, the emperor Marcus Aurelius () granted him entry into the senatorial ranks. Membership in the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless, it appears that Severus&#x27; career during the 160s met with some difficulties.

It is likely that he served as a &quot;vigintivir&quot; in Rome, overseeing road maintenance in or near the city, and he may have appeared in court as an advocate. At the time of Marcus Aurelius, he was the State Attorney (&quot;Advocatus fisci&quot;). However, he omitted the military tribunate from the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; and had to delay his quaestorship until he had reached the required minimum age of 25. To make matters worse, the Antonine Plague swept through the capital in 166.

With his career at a halt, Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis, where the climate was healthier. According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a usually unreliable source, he was prosecuted for adultery during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169, Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5December, he took office and was officially enrolled in the Roman Senate. Between 170 and 180 his activities went largely unrecorded, in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The Antonine Plague had thinned the senatorial ranks and, with capable men now in short supply, Severus&#x27; career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have.

The sudden death of his father necessitated another return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa, Mauri tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the emperor, while the Senate gained temporary control of Sardinia as compensation. Thus, Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island of Sardinia.

In 173, Severus&#x27; cousin Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed proconsul of the province of Africa Proconsularis and chose Severus as one of his two &quot;legati pro praetore&quot;, a senior military appointment. Following the end of this term, Septimius Severus returned to Rome, taking up office as tribune of the plebs, a senior legislative position, with the distinction of being the &quot;candidatus&quot; of the emperor.

=== Marriages ===
About 175, Septimius Severus, in his early thirties at the time, contracted his first marriage, to Paccia Marciana, a woman from Leptis Magna. He probably met her during his tenure as legate under his uncle. Marciana&#x27;s name suggests Punic or Libyan origin, but nothing else is known of her. Septimius Severus does not mention her in his autobiography, though he commemorated her with statues when he became emperor. The unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters, but no other attestation of them has survived. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children, despite lasting for more than ten years.

Marciana died of natural causes around 186. Septimius Severus, now in his forties, childless and eager to remarry, began enquiring into the horoscopes of prospective brides. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; relates that he heard of a woman in Syria of whom it had been foretold that she would marry a king, and so Severus sought her as his wife. This woman was an Emesene Syrian named Julia Domna. Her father, Julius Bassianus, descended from the Arab Emesene dynasty and served as a high priest to the local cult of the sun god Elagabal. Domna&#x27;s older sister, Julia Maesa, would become the grandmother of the future emperors Elagabalus and Alexander Severus.

Bassianus accepted Severus&#x27; marriage proposal in early 187, and in the summer the couple married in Lugdunum (modern-day Lyon, France), of which Severus was the governor. The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions. Julia built &quot;the most splendid reputation&quot; by applying herself to letters and philosophy. They had two sons, Lucius Septimius Bassianus (later nicknamed Caracalla, born 4April 188 in Lugdunum) and Publius Septimius Geta (born 7March 189 in Rome).

== Rise to power ==
In 191, on the advice of Quintus Aemilius Laetus, prefect of the Praetorian Guard, emperor Commodus appointed Severus as governor of Pannonia Superior. At around this time he is described by the classicist Kyle Harper as being &quot;a middling senator of modest physical stature and unexceptional accomplishment&quot;. Commodus was assassinated the following year. Pertinax was acclaimed emperor, but he was then killed by the Praetorian Guard in early 193. In response to the murder of Pertinax, Severus&#x27; legion &quot;XIV Gemina&quot; acclaimed him emperor at Carnuntum on 9 April. Nearby legions, such as &quot;X Gemina&quot; at Vindobona, soon followed suit. Having assembled an army, Severus hurried to Italy.

Pertinax&#x27;s successor in Rome, Didius Julianus, had bought the emperorship in an auction. Julianus was condemned to death by the Senate and killed. Severus took possession of Rome without opposition. He executed Pertinax&#x27;s murderers and dismissed the rest of the Praetorian Guard, filling its ranks with loyal troops from his own legions.

The legions of Syria had proclaimed Pescennius Niger emperor. At the same time Severus felt it reasonable to offer Clodius Albinus, the powerful governor of Britannia, who had probably supported Didius against him, the rank of Caesar, which implied some claim to the succession. With his rear safe, he moved to the East and crushed Niger&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Issus (194).
While campaigning against Byzantium, he ordered that the tomb of his fellow-Carthaginian Hannibal be covered with fine marble.

He devoted the following year to suppressing Mesopotamia and other Parthian vassals who had backed Niger. Afterwards, Severus declared his son Caracalla as his successor, which caused Albinus to be hailed emperor by his troops and to invade Gaul. After a short stay in Rome, Severus moved north to meet him. On 19February 197 at the Battle of Lugdunum, with an army of about 75,000 men, mostly composed of Pannonian, Moesian and Dacian legions and a large number of auxiliaries, Severus defeated and killed Clodius Albinus, securing his full control over the empire.
Upon returning to Rome, Septimus had 29 senators executed for treason over their support of Albinus, despite having previously taken an oath promising not to put any senators to death (a customary oath for emperors).

== Emperor ==
=== War against Parthia ===


In early 197 Severus left Rome and sailed to the east. He embarked at Brundisium and probably landed at the port of Aegeae in Cilicia, travelling on to Syria by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the Euphrates. Abgar IX, titular King of Osroene but essentially only the ruler of Edessa since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province, handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus&#x27; expedition by providing archers. King Khosrov I of Armenia also sent hostages, money and gifts.

Severus travelled on to Nisibis, which his general Julius Laetus had prevented from falling into Parthian hands. Afterwards Severus returned to Syria to plan a more ambitious campaign. The following year he led another, more successful campaign against the Parthian Empire, reportedly in retaliation for the support it had given to Pescennius Niger. His legions sacked the Parthian royal city of Ctesiphon and he annexed the northern half of Mesopotamia to the empire; Severus took the title &quot;&quot;, following the example of Trajan. However, he was unable to capture the fortress of Hatra, even after two lengthy sieges—just like Trajan, who had tried nearly a century before. During his time in the east, though, Severus also expanded the &quot;Limes Arabicus&quot;, building new fortifications in the Arabian Desert from Basie to Dumatha.

===Relations with the Senate and People===
Severus&#x27; relations with the Senate were never good. He was unpopular with them from the outset, having seized power with the help of the military, and he returned the sentiment. Severus ordered the execution of a large number of Senators on charges of corruption or conspiracy against him and replaced them with his favourites. Although his actions turned Rome more into a military dictatorship, he was popular with the citizens of Rome, having stamped out the rampant corruption of Commodus&#x27; reign. When he returned from his victory over the Parthians, he erected the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.

According to Cassius Dio, however, after 197 Severus fell heavily under the influence of his Praetorian prefect, Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, who came to have almost total control of the imperial administration. At the same time, a bloody power crisis erupted between Plautianus and Julia Domna, Severus&#x27; influential and powerful wife, which had a relatively destructive effect on the centre of power. Plautianus&#x27; daughter Fulvia Plautilla was married to Severus&#x27; son Caracalla. Plautianus&#x27; excessive power came to an end in 204, when he was denounced by the emperor&#x27;s dying brother. In January 205 Julia Domna and Caracalla accused Plautianus of plotting to kill him and Severus. The powerful prefect was executed while he was trying to defend his case in front of the two emperors. One of the two following &quot;praefecti&quot; was the famous jurist Papinian. Executions of senators did not stop: Cassius Dio records that many of them were put to death, some after being formally tried. After the assassination of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus in the rest of his reign, he relied more on the advice of his clever and educated wife, Julia Domna, in the administration of the empire.

===Military reforms===
Upon his arrival at Rome in 193, Severus discharged the Praetorian Guard, which had murdered Pertinax and had then auctioned the Roman Empire to Didius Julianus. Its members were stripped of their ceremonial armour and forbidden to come within of the city on pain of death. Severus replaced the old guard with 10 new cohorts recruited from veterans of his Danubian legions.

Around 197 he increased the number of legions from 30 to 33, with the introduction of the three new legions: I, II and III &quot;Parthica&quot;. He garrisoned Legio II Parthica at Albanum, only from Rome. He gave his soldiers a donative of a thousand &quot;sesterces&quot; (250 &quot;denarii&quot;) each, and raised the annual wage for a soldier in the legions from 300 to 400 &quot;denarii&quot;.

Severus was the first Roman emperor to station some of the imperial army in Italy. He realized that Rome needed a military central reserve with the capability to be sent anywhere.

=== Persecution of Christians ===
At the beginning of Severus&#x27; reign, Trajan&#x27;s policy toward the Christians was still in force. That is, Christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out. Therefore, persecution was inconsistent, local and sporadic. Faced with internal dissidence and external threats, Severus felt the need to promote religious harmony by promoting syncretism. He possibly issued an edict that punished conversion to Judaism and Christianity.

A number of persecutions of Christians occurred in the Roman Empire during his reign and were traditionally attributed to Severus by the early Christian community. A decree by Severus against the Christians is mentioned in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, an unreliable mix of fact and fiction. Early church historian Eusebius described Severus as a persecutor. However, the Christian apologist Tertullian stated that Severus was well disposed towards Christians, employed a Christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from the mob. Some scholars think that Eusebius&#x27; description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; as the martyrs of Madauros, Charalambos and Perpetua and Felicity in Roman-ruled Africa. These were probably the result of local persecutions rather than empire-wide actions or decrees by Severus.

=== Military activity in Africa ===
In late 202 Severus launched a campaign in the province of Africa. The &quot;legatus legionis&quot; or commander of Legio III Augusta, Quintus Anicius Faustus, had been fighting against the Garamantes along the &quot;Limes Tripolitanus&quot; for five years. He captured several settlements such as Cydamus, Gholaia, Garbia and their capital Garama—over south of Leptis Magna. The province of Numidia was also enlarged: the empire annexed the settlements of Vescera, Castellum Dimmidi, Gemellae, Thabudeos and Thubunae. By 203 the entire southern frontier of Roman Africa had been dramatically expanded and re-fortified. Desert nomads could no longer safely raid the region&#x27;s interior and escape back into the Sahara.

=== Britain ===

In 208 Severus travelled to Britain with the intention of conquering Caledonia. Modern archaeological discoveries illuminate the scope and direction of his northern campaign. Severus probably arrived in Britain with an army of over 40,000, considering some of the camps constructed during his campaign could house this number.

He strengthened Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and reconquered the Southern Uplands up to the Antonine Wall, which was also enhanced. Supported and supplied by a strong naval force, Severus then thrust north with his army across the wall into Caledonian territory. Retracing the steps of Agricola of over a century before, Severus rebuilt and garrisoned many abandoned Roman forts along the east coast, such as Carpow.

Cassius Dio&#x27;s account of the invasion reads:

By 210 Severus&#x27; campaigning had made significant gains, despite Caledonian guerrilla tactics and purportedly heavy Roman casualties. The Caledonians sued for peace, which Severus granted on condition they relinquish control of the Central Lowlands (of what is now Scotland) as evidenced by the extensive Severan-era fortifications there. The Caledonians, short on supplies and feeling that their position was desperate, revolted later that year with the Maeatae. Severus prepared for another protracted campaign within Caledonia. He was now intent on exterminating the Caledonians, telling his soldiers: &quot;Let no-one escape sheer destruction, no-one our hands, not even the babe in the womb of the mother, if it be male; let it nevertheless not escape sheer destruction.&quot;

== Death ==
Severus&#x27; campaign was cut short when he fell ill. He withdrew to Eboracum (modern York, England) and died there in 211. Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again. Shortly after this, the frontier was permanently withdrawn south to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

Severus is famously said to have given the advice to his sons: &quot;Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others&quot; before he died on 4 February 211. On his death, Severus was deified by the Senate and succeeded by his sons, Caracalla and Geta, who were advised by his wife Julia Domna. Severus was buried in the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.

== Assessment and legacy ==
By the close of his reign the Roman Empire reached an extent of over million square kilometres, which scholars like David L. Kennedy, Lukas De Blois, and Derrick Riley state expanded the empire to its greatest physical extent.

Edward Gibbon famously levelled a harsh indictment of Septimius Severus as a principal agent in the empire&#x27;s decline. &quot;The contemporaries of Severus, in the enjoyment of the peace and glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been introduced. Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his maxims and example, justly considered him as the principal author of the decline of the Roman empire.&quot; According to Gibbon, &quot;his daring ambition [...] was never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the feelings of humanity.&quot; His enlargement of the Limes Tripolitanus secured Africa, the agricultural base of the empire where he was born. His victory over the Parthian Empire was for a time decisive, securing Nisibis and Singara for the empire and establishing a &quot;status quo&quot; of Roman dominance in the region until 251. His policy of an expanded and better-rewarded army was criticised by his contemporaries Cassius Dio and Herodianus: in particular, they pointed out the increasing burden, in the form of taxes and services, the civilian population had to bear to maintain the new and better-paid army. The large and ongoing increase in military expenditure caused problems for all of his successors.

To maintain his enlarged military, he debased the Roman currency. Upon his accession he decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 81.5% to 78.5%, although the silver weight actually increased, rising from 2.40 grams to 2.46 grams. Nevertheless, the following year he debased the denarius again because of rising military expenditures. The silver purity decreased from 78.5% to 64.5%—the silver weight dropping from 2.46 grams to 1.98 grams. In 196 he reduced the purity and silver weight of the denarius again, to 54% and 1.82 grams, respectively. Severus&#x27; currency debasement was the largest since the reign of Nero, compromising the long-term strength of the economy.

Severus was also distinguished for his buildings. Apart from the triumphal arch in the Roman Forum carrying his full name, he also built the Septizodium in Rome. He enriched his native city of Leptis Magna, including commissioning a triumphal arch on the occasion of his visit of 203.

<text>The San Francisco Giants are an American professional baseball team based in San Francisco. The Giants compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. Founded in 1883 as the New York Gothams, the team was renamed the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] three years later, eventually relocating from New York City to San Francisco in 1958. The Giants play their home games at Oracle Park in San Francisco.

The franchise is one of the oldest and most successful in professional baseball, with more wins than any other team in the history of major American sports. The team was the first major-league organization based in New York City, most memorably playing home games at several iterations of the Polo Grounds. The Giants have played in the World Series 20 times. In 2014, the Giants won their then-record 23rd National League pennant; this mark has since been equaled and then eclipsed by the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, who won their 25th NL crown in 2024. The Giants&#x27; eight World Series championships are second-most in the NL and fifth-most of any franchise.

The franchise won 17 pennants and five World Series championships while in New York, led by managers John McGraw, Bill Terry, and Leo Durocher. New York-era star players including Christy Mathewson, Carl Hubbell, Mel Ott, and Willie Mays join 63 other Giants in the Baseball Hall of Fame, the most of any franchise. The Giants&#x27; rivalry with the Dodgers, one of the longest-standing and most famed rivalries in American sports, began in New York and continued when both teams relocated to California in 1958.

Despite the efforts of Mays and Barry Bonds, regarded as two of baseball&#x27;s all-time best players, the Giants endured a 56-year championship drought following the move west, a stretch that included three World Series losses. The drought finally ended in the early 2010s; under manager Bruce Bochy, the Giants embraced sabermetrics and eventually formed a baseball dynasty that saw them win the World Series in , , and , making the Giants the second team in NL history to win three championships in five years.

Through 2024, the franchise&#x27;s all-time record is (). Since moving to San Francisco in 1958, the Giants have an overall win–loss record of () through the end of 2024. The team&#x27;s current manager is Bob Melvin.

==History==
===New York Giants===

The Giants originated in New York City as the New York Gothams in 1883, and were known as the New York Giants from 1885 until the team relocated to San Francisco after the 1957 season. During most of their 75 seasons in New York City, the Giants played home games at various incarnations of the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan.

Numerous inductees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum played for the New York Giants, including John McGraw, Christy Mathewson, Mel Ott, Bill Terry, Willie Mays, Monte Irvin, and Travis Jackson. During the club&#x27;s tenure in New York, they produced five of the franchise&#x27;s eight World Series wins (1905, 1921, 1922, 1933, 1954) and 17 of its 23 National League pennants. Famous moments in the Giants&#x27; New York history include the 1922 World Series, in which the Giants swept the Yankees in four games, the 1951 home run by New York Giants outfielder and third baseman Bobby Thomson known as the &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;, and the defensive feat by Mays during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series known as &quot;the Catch&quot;.

The Giants had intense rivalries with their fellow New York teams, the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Giants faced the Yankees in six World Series and played the league rival Dodgers multiple times per season. Games between any two of these three teams were known collectively as the Subway Series. The Dodgers-Giants rivalry continues, as both teams moved to California after the 1957 season, with the Dodgers relocating to Los Angeles. The New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) are named after the team.

=== San Francisco Giants ===
The Giants, along with their rival Los Angeles Dodgers, became the first Major League Baseball teams to play on the West Coast. On April 15, 1958, the Giants played their first game in San Francisco, defeating the former Brooklyn and now Los Angeles Dodgers, 8–0. The Giants played for two seasons at Seals Stadium (from 1931 to 1957, the stadium was the home of the PCL&#x27;s San Francisco Seals) before moving to Candlestick Park in 1960. The Giants played at Candlestick Park until 1999, before opening Pacific Bell Park (now known as Oracle Park) in 2000, where the Giants currently play.

The Giants struggled to sustain consistent success in their first 50 years in San Francisco. They made nine playoff appearances and won three NL pennants between 1958 and 2009. The Giants lost the 1962 World Series in seven games to the New York Yankees. The Giants were swept in the 1989 World Series by their cross-Bay rival Oakland Athletics, a series best known for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused a 10-day delay between Games 2 and 3. The Giants also lost the 2002 World Series to the Anaheim Angels. One of the team&#x27;s biggest highlights during this time was the 2001 season, in which outfielder Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs, breaking the record for most home runs in a season. In 2007, Bonds would surpass Hank Aaron&#x27;s career record of 755 home runs. Bonds finished his career with 762 home runs (586 hit with the Giants), which is still the MLB record.

The Giants won three World Series championships in 2010, 2012, and 2014, giving the team eight total World Series titles, including the five won as the New York Giants.

Players inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum as members of the San Francisco Giants include CF Willie Mays, 1B Orlando Cepeda, P Juan Marichal, 1B Willie McCovey, and P Gaylord Perry.

==Uniforms==
===1958–1972===
Upon moving to San Francisco, the Giants kept the same uniform they wore in New York, save for two changes. The cap logo now had an interlocking &quot;SF&quot; in orange, while the road uniform now featured &quot;San Francisco&quot; in black block letters with orange trim. Neckline, pants and sleeves feature thin black and orange stripes.

===1973–1976===
Changing to double-knit polyester, the Giants made a few noticeable changes to their uniform. The color scheme on the letters was changed to orange with black trim, and player names were added on the back. The cap logo remained the same.

===1977–1982===
For the 1977 season, the Giants switched to pullover uniforms. &quot;Giants&quot; on the home uniform was changed from serifed block lettering to cursive script, and the color scheme returned to black with orange trim. The road uniform became orange, with letters in black with white trim. Neck and sleeve stripes are in black, orange and white. Both uniforms received chest numbers. The standard cap was changed to feature an orange brim.

The 1978 season saw the Giants add a black alternate uniform, an inverse of their road orange uniform. All three uniforms now featured the &quot;Giants&quot; script previously exclusive to the home uniform.

===1983–1993===
Before the 1983 season, the Giants returned to a traditional buttoned uniform designed by Sidjakov Berman &amp; Gomez. This design returned to the classic look they wore early in their San Francisco tenure, but with a few exceptions. The lettering became more rounded (save for the player&#x27;s name), the neck stripes were removed, and the interlocking &quot;SF&quot; and black piping was added on the road gray uniform. The caps returned to an all-black design.

===1994–1999===
In 1994, the Giants made a few changes to their uniform. The road uniform reverted to &quot;San Francisco&quot; in front and removed the piping. The front of both uniforms returned to stylized block letters with pointed edges, but kept the rounded numbers. The &quot;SF&quot; on the cap was also changed to reflect the lettering change.

===2000–present===
Coinciding with the move to Oracle Park (then Pacific Bell Park) in 2000, the Giants unveiled new uniforms which were aesthetically close to the style they originally wore in their early years. On each uniform, numbers returned to a block letter style.

====Home====
The base of the home uniform was changed to cream. The &quot;Giants&quot; wordmark kept the same stylized block letter treatment but the arrangement was changed from a vertical to a radial arch. Neck stripes also returned with this uniform. Gold drop shadows were also added. A sleeve patch containing the team logo and the words &quot;San Francisco Baseball Club&quot; was also featured.

====Road====
The gray road uniform returned to the classic &quot;San Francisco&quot; wordmark used in the 1960s, though in 2005 gold drop shadows were also added. This uniform was then tweaked to include black piping in 2012. Two sleeve patches were used. Between 2000 and 2010, the patch featured &quot;SF&quot; in orange letters in front of a baseball, with the full name added within a black circle. In 2011, this was changed to the sleeve patch used on the home uniform. Until 2020, only the road uniform featured player names; since 2021, all Giants uniforms have player names on the back.

====Black alternate====
In 2001, the Giants added a road and home alternate black uniform. Each uniform shared the same design as their home and road counterparts, with the exception of the road alternate receiving gold drop shadows. The home design was dropped after only one season, and the road version was retired the following year. Both sets were worn with an all-black cap but with the squatchee in black (the primary cap has an orange squatchee) and the &quot;SF&quot; wordmark changed to black with orange trim.

In 2015, the Giants unveiled a new black alternate uniform to be used on select Saturday home games. This set has the interlocking &quot;SF&quot; in front along with orange piping and a new sleeve patch containing the Golden Gate Bridge atop the &quot;Giants&quot; wordmark. Initially, the letters were in black with orange trim, but this was changed to orange with black trim and orange drop shadows.

====Orange alternate====
Before the 2010 season, the Giants unveiled a new orange alternate uniform to be used on Friday home games. Initially, this design was similar to the home uniform save for a trim change to cream, but in 2011, the sleeve patch was changed to the one previously used on the team&#x27;s road uniform. In 2014, the orange alternate were tweaked slightly, adding black piping and a new sleeve patch featuring the interlocking &quot;SF&quot; logo, and returning to the script &quot;Giants&quot; lettering previously used in the late 1970s. This design is usually paired with a black cap with orange brim featuring the &quot;SF&quot; logo.

====Road alternate====
Between 2012 and 2019, the Giants wore a second gray road uniform. This design was similar to the primary roads, but with the &quot;SF&quot; in place of the city name (a nod to the 1983–1993 road uniforms).

====City Connect====
In 2021, Major League Baseball and Nike introduced the &quot;City Connect&quot; program, with teams wearing special uniforms that reflect the pride and personality of their community. The Giants&#x27; version is a white base with orange accents, featuring the stylized &quot;G&quot; in an orange/white gradient. The gradient represents the San Francisco fog that envelopes the Bay Area many months per year. An orange silhouette of the Golden Gate Bridge is printed on the sleeves. The uniform is paired with an all-orange cap with the &quot;SF&quot; in orange with white trim. The uniforms are usually worn on Tuesday home games.

==Rivalries==
The Giants&#x27; rivalry with the Los Angeles Dodgers dates back to when the two teams were based in New York, as does their rivalry with the New York Yankees. The Dodger and Giants rivalry is one of the longest rivalries in sports history. Their rivalry with the Oakland Athletics dates back to when the Giants were in New York and the A&#x27;s were in Philadelphia and played each other in the 1905, 1911, &amp; 1913 World Series, and was renewed in 1968 when the Athletics moved from Kansas City and the teams again played each other in the earthquake-interrupted 1989 Bay Bridge World Series. The 2010 NLCS inaugurated a Giants rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies after confrontations between Jonathan Sánchez and Chase Utley, and between Ramón Ramírez and Shane Victorino. However, with the Philadelphia Phillies dropping off as one of the premier teams of the National League, this rivalry has died down since 2010 and 2011. Another rivalry that has intensified recently is with the St. Louis Cardinals, whom the team has faced 4 times in the NLCS.

The rivalry between the New York Giants and Chicago Cubs in the early 20th century was once regarded as one of the most heated in baseball, with Merkle&#x27;s Boner leading to a 1908 season-ending matchup in New York of particular note. That historical rivalry was revisited when the Giants beat the Cubs in the 1989 National League Championship Series, in their tiebreaker game in Chicago at the end of the 1998 season, on June 6, 2012, in a &quot;Turn Back The Century&quot; game in which both teams wore replica 1912 uniforms, and in the 2016 National League Division Series in which the Cubs won.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

The Giants-Dodgers rivalry is one of the longest-standing rivalries in team sports.

The Giants-Dodgers feud began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers based in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley decided to move the team to Los Angeles primarily for financial reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham (who was considering moving his team to Minnesota) to preserve the rivalry by taking his team to San Francisco as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been competitors in economic, cultural and political arenas, their new California venues became fertile ground for transplantation of the ancient rivalry. In the wake of the Giants&#x27; and Dodgers&#x27; leaving New York, a new ballclub was born in 1962 in Queens: The New York Mets. The team&#x27;s colors (blue and orange) were an homage to the recently departed teams.

Both teams&#x27; having endured for over a century while leaping across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry&#x27;s growth from cross-city to cross-state, have led to its being considered one of the greatest in sports history.

The Giants-Dodgers rivalry has seen both teams enjoy periods of success at the expense of the other. While the Giants have more total wins and head-to-head wins in their overall franchise histories, the Dodgers have more total wins and head-to-head wins since the two teams moved to California in 1958. The Dodgers have also won the National League West 14 more times than the Giants since the start of division play in 1969. Both teams have made the postseason as a National League wild card three times. The Giants won their first world championship in California in 2010, while the Dodgers won their last world title in 2024. As of the end of the 2024 baseball season, the Los Angeles Dodgers lead the San Francisco Giants in California World Series triumphs, 7–3, whereas in 20th-century New York, the Giants led the Dodgers in World Series championships, 5–1. Overall, the two franchises are tied 8–8 in total World Series championships.

===Oakland Athletics===

A geographic rivalry with the cross-Bay American League Athletics greatly increased with the 1989 World Series, nicknamed the &quot;Battle of the Bay&quot;, which Oakland swept (and which was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake moments before the scheduled start of Game 3 in San Francisco). This dates back to when the Giants and Athletics were rivals, when the Giants were in New York and the Athletics in Philadelphia. They met in the 1905, 1911, and 1913 World Series. In addition, the introduction of interleague play in 1997 has pitted the two teams against each other for usually six games every season since 1997, three in each city (but only four in 2013, two in each city). Before 1997, they played each other only in Cactus League spring training. Their interleague play wins and losses (63–57 in favor of the A&#x27;s) have been fairly evenly divided despite differences in league, style of play, stadium, payroll, fan base stereotypes, media coverage and World Series records, all of which have heightened the rivalry in recent years. The intensity of the rivalry and how it is understood varies among Bay Area fans. A&#x27;s fans generally view the Giants as a hated rival, while Giants fans generally view the A&#x27;s as a friendly rival much lower on the scale. This is most likely due to the A&#x27;s lack of a historical rival, while the Giants have their heated rivalry with the Dodgers. Some Bay Area fans are fans of both teams. The &quot;split hats&quot; that feature the logos of both teams best embodies the shared fan base. Other Bay Area fans view the competition between the two teams as a &quot;friendly rivalry&quot;, with little actual hatred compared to similar ones such as the Subway Series (New York Mets vs. New York Yankees), the Red Line Series (Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox) and the Freeway Series (Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Los Angeles Angels).

The Giants and A&#x27;s enjoyed a limited rivalry at the start of the 20th century before the Yankees began to dominate after the acquisition of Babe Ruth in 1920, when the Giants were in New York and the A&#x27;s were in Philadelphia. The teams were managed by legendary leaders John McGraw and Connie Mack, who were considered not only friendly rivals but the premier managers during that era, especially in view of their longevity (Mack for 50 years, McGraw for 30) since both were majority owners. Each team played in five of the first 15 World Series (tying them with the Red Sox and Cubs for most World Series appearances during that time period). As the New York Giants and the Philadelphia A&#x27;s, they met in three World Series, with the Giants winning in and the A&#x27;s in &amp; . After becoming the San Francisco Giants and Oakland A&#x27;s, they met in a fourth Series in resulting in the A&#x27;s last world championship (as of 2024).

===New York Yankees===

Though in different leagues, the Giants have also been historical rivals of the Yankees, starting in New York before the Giants moved to the West Coast. Before the institution of interleague play in 1997, the two teams had little opportunity to play each other except in seven World Series: , , , , , and , the Yankees winning last five of the seven Series. The teams have met five times in regular season interleague play: In 2002 at the old Yankee Stadium, in 2007 at Oracle Park (then known as AT&amp;T Park), in 2013, 2016, and 2023 at the current Yankee Stadium, and in 2019 at Oracle Park. The teams&#x27; next regular season meetings will occur yearly, with the advent of the balanced schedule format introduced in 2023.

In his July 4, 1939, farewell speech ending with the renowned &quot;Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth&quot;, Yankee slugger Lou Gehrig, who played in 2,130 consecutive games, declared that the Giants were a team he &quot;would give his right arm to beat, and vice versa&quot;.

==Baseball Hall of Famers==

==Roster==
==Minor league affiliations==
The San Francisco Giants farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.

==Radio and television==

Giants&#x27; television telecasts are on NBC Sports Bay Area (cable) with select games simulcasted on KNTV (broadcast). KNTV&#x27;s broadcast contract with the Giants began in 2008, one year after the team and KTVU mutually ended a relationship that dated to 1961. Jon Miller regularly called the action on KNTV, which used to be exclusive to the NBC Bay Area channel up until 2021, while the announcing team for NBCSBA telecasts is Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow, affectionately known as &quot;Kruk and Kuip&quot; (pronounced &quot;Kruke&quot; and &quot;Kype&quot;). During the 2016 season, the Giants had an average 4.71 rating and 117,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts. Since the 2022 season, as Krukow is unable to travel with the team due to his inclusion body myositis, the pair only work home games and select road games, which the road games are done via &quot;SplitKast&quot; where Kuiper would be at the away ballpark and Krukow will be at the NBC Sports Bay Area studio in San Francisco. Shawn Estes, Javier López, and Hunter Pence serve as an alternate analysts for all other Giants road games with either Kuiper or Flemming.

The Giants&#x27; flagship radio station is KNBR (680 AM). KNBR&#x27;s owner, Cumulus Media, is a limited partner in San Francisco Baseball Associates LP, the owner of the team. Jon Miller and Dave Flemming are the regular play-by-play announcers. Joe Ritzo and F.P. Santangelo serves as a backup play by play when Jon is absent and Dave is on TV. In addition to KNBR, the Giants can be heard throughout Northern California and parts of Nevada, Oregon, and Hawaii on the Giants Radio Network. Erwin Higueros and Tito Fuentes handle Spanish-language radio broadcasts on KXZM (93.7 FM).

==Fight song and other music==
First used for Giants radio broadcasts on KSFO, the team&#x27;s fight song &quot;Bye, Bye Baby!&quot; is currently used following any Giants home run. The song is played in the stadium, and an instrumental version is played on telecasts when the inning in which the home run was hit concludes. The title and chorus &quot;Bye bye baby!&quot; coming from famed former Giants broadcaster Russ Hodges, which was his home run call.

Following a Giants home win, Tony Bennett&#x27;s &quot;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&quot; is played in Oracle Park in celebration.

<text>The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team based in San Diego. The Padres compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. The team plays its home games at Petco Park in downtown San Diego. Founded in 1969 as an expansion franchise, the Padres adopted their name from the Pacific Coast League (PCL) team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. The team&#x27;s name, Spanish for &quot;fathers&quot;, refers to the Spanish Franciscan friars who founded Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769.

In 1976, Randy Jones achieved the first Cy Young Award for the Padres. In the 1980s, Tony Gwynn became a major star, winning eight National League batting titles. Under manager Dick Williams, the Padres clinched their first NL pennant, losing to the Detroit Tigers in the 1984 World Series. In 1995, Kevin Towers became general manager; under his lead, Ken Caminiti became the first Padres player to win the MVP Award. The Padres achieved their second NL pennant alongside Trevor Hoffman, eventually being swept by the New York Yankees in the 1998 World Series.

The Padres are owned by the estate of Peter Seidler, who owned the team from 2012 until his death in 2023. The team has won two NL pennants, in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both years; they are the oldest team that has never won the World Series, along with the Milwaukee Brewers. As of 2024, the Padres have had 18 winning seasons in franchise history. Despite reaching the postseason five times from 2005 to 2024, the team has yet to return to the World Series. From 1969 through 2024, the Padres have an overall record of ().

==History==
The Padres adopted their name from the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, a team that arrived in San Diego in 1936. This minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by 18-year-old Ted Williams, the future Hall of Famer who was a native of San Diego. 

In 1969, the Padres joined the ranks of Major League Baseball as one of four new expansion teams, along with the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals), the Kansas City Royals, and the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers). 

One of its earliest owners was C. Arnholt Smith, a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and Buzzie Bavasi, as well as a new stadium, the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the NL West, losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger Nate Colbert, an expansion draftee from the Houston Astros and was the long-time home run leader until 2024, when Manny Machado overtook him.

The team&#x27;s fortunes gradually improved as they won five National League West titles and reached the World Series twice, in 1984 and in 1998, but lost both times. The Padres&#x27; main draw during the 1980s and 1990s was Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn, who won eight league batting titles. They moved into their current stadium, Petco Park, in 2004.

On August 20, 2020, the Padres became the first team in MLB history to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games earning the nickname, &quot;Slam Diego Padres&quot;.

Until 2021, the Padres were the last team in MLB that had yet to throw a no-hitter. The record was broken on April 9, 2021, as Joe Musgrove accomplished the feat against the Texas Rangers, finally ending the longest no-hit drought by a team in MLB history. On September 5, 1997, Andy Ashby took a no-hitter into the ninth inning, which was previously the closest that the team had come to achieving this feat. In 2024, first year Padre Dylan Cease threw a no-hitter against the Washington Nationals on July 25th.

On November 14, 2023, Peter Seidler, who owned the Padres since 2012, died at the age of 63. MLB owners approved of John Seidler as the Padres&#x27; control person on February 6, 2025.

===Retired numbers===
The Padres have retired six numbers. The numbers are commemorated in a display at Petco Park&#x27;s entrance at Home Plate Plaza. Fans are allowed to pose for pictures next to the aluminum numbers, which are high, wide, and deep. Originally, the numbers were atop the batter&#x27;s eye in center field, until they were relocated in 2016. The numbers were not ready for display in time for the park&#x27;s opening in 2004, but they were unveiled midseason. Also beginning in 2016, the numbers are displayed in the Ring of Honor on the upper deck façade above the press box behind home plate.

In 1988, Steve Garvey was the first player to have his number retired by the Padres. He played only five seasons with San Diego, but hit the game-winning two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning against the Chicago Cubs in Game 4 of the 1984 National League Championship Series (NLCS), tying the series before the Padres won the next day. He was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player, and San Diego advanced to their first World Series. In 2016, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; ranked Garvey&#x27;s Game 4 homer as the No. 1 moment in San Diego sports history. However, he played 14 of his 19 seasons with the rival Los Angeles Dodgers, where he was also more productive, and the retirement of his number by San Diego has been heavily debated.
On April 15, 1997, exactly 50 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line, the No. 42 he wore with the Brooklyn Dodgers was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Later that year, Randy Jones&#x27;s No. 35 was retired by the Padres. He was a two-time All-Star (1975, 1976) and the club&#x27;s first Cy Young Award winner in 1976. On the day his number was retired, the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; wrote that Jones was &quot;the most popular athlete in the history of this city&quot; during the mid-1970s. Dave Winfield was next to have his number, 31, retired in 2001, when he was also inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His retirement ceremony also celebrated his decision to be the first member of the Hall of Fame to have his plaque depicting him wearing a Padres cap. Winfield played for six teams in his 22-year career, spending his first eight seasons in San Diego. In 2004, the Padres retired No. 19 in honor of Gwynn, who is widely considered the greatest Padres player ever. He played his entire 20-year career with San Diego and won an NL-record eight batting titles. The most recent number to be retired was Trevor Hoffman&#x27;s No. 51 in 2011. He had retired from playing after 2010, when he left the game as MLB&#x27;s career leader in saves with 601, including 552 with the Padres.

Prior to moving to Petco, the team played at San Diego Stadium, where the retired numbers were originally displayed on banners hanging from the light towers above the left field stands. However, Garvey&#x27;s number was commemorated instead on the wall behind the spot in right-center field where his winning home run in the 1984 NLCS cleared the fence, but the number disappeared when the stadium was expanded in 1997 and the location was masked by an overhang. It reappeared in 2002 when all the retired numbers were moved and inscribed on the outfield fence.

† Number retired by Major League Baseball

The Padres also have a &quot;star on the wall&quot; in honor of broadcaster Jerry Coleman, in reference to his trademark phrase &quot;Oh Doctor! You can hang a star on that baby!&quot; Nearby the initials of the late owner Ray Kroc are also displayed. Both the star and the initials are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down the right-field line accompanied by the name of the person in white. Kroc was honored in 1984, Coleman in 2001.

On March 23, 2024, the team held a public memorial and celebration of life for team owner Peter Seidler, who died in November 2023. The club honored his memory with his initials of &quot;PS&quot; inside a gold heart next to Coleman&#x27;s memorial on the front of the pressbox down the right-field line.

===Padres Hall of Fame===

The following 16 people have been inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame since it was founded in 1999.

===San Diego Hall of Champions===
Gwynn, Winfield, Fingers, Gossage, Randy Jones, and Graig Nettles (3B, 1984–1987) are members of the San Diego Hall of Champions, which is open to athletes native to the San Diego area (such as Nettles) as well as to those who played for San Diego teams (such as Gwynn).
==Roster==
==Minor league affiliates==
The San Diego Padres farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.

==Logos and colors==
Throughout the team&#x27;s history, the San Diego Padres have used multiple logos, uniforms, and different color combinations.

===1969–1979: Original brown &amp; gold===
Their first logo in 1969 depicted a friar swinging a bat with Padres written at the top while standing in a sun-like figure with San Diego Padres on the exterior of it. The &quot;Swinging Friar&quot; has popped up on the uniform on and off ever since. Although the &quot;Swinging Friar&quot; is no longer used as the primary logo, it remains as the mascot of the team and is now used as an alternate logo and on the uniform sleeve.

Brown and gold were the Padres&#x27; original colors. The team&#x27;s first uniforms featured a cream base for the home uniforms and a tan base for the road uniforms. Brown letters with gold trim adorned the uniforms, which featured the team name in front of both designs. A second tan uniform, this time with the city name, was used as a road alternate before becoming the primary in 1971. Caps were all-brown with the gold &quot;SD&quot;, though the team later broke out an alternate gold cap with a brown brim and &quot;SD&quot; letters.
Switching from flannel to polyester in 1972, the Padres radically changed their uniforms. The team wore all-gold uniforms and pants regardless of road or home games, with the only difference being the road uniform emblazoned with the city name and the home uniform with the team name. The Padres also broke out a new brown cap, complete with a gold front panel and a brown &quot;SD&quot;, which would remain for the next several years. The gold front panel was shaped as a bell, alluding to the bells in historic missions in California.

In 1974, the Padres returned to wearing traditional uniforms. The home design now had a script &quot;Padres&quot; lettering in front, with the road design keeping much of the original aesthetic. Chest numbers were also added. In 1976, the Padres ditched the buttons in favor of pullovers for their home uniform. In addition, they went with a brown uniform top for road games, featuring gold sleeves and gold letters.

The brown uniforms served as a template for the Padres&#x27; next uniform set beginning in 1978. The home uniforms now featured brown sleeves and gold letters, and a gold alternate with brown sleeves and letters was also released. The full team name, which was written in a more futuristic font, was emblazoned in front while the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. However, this set only lasted for that season, as the Padres tweaked its design the next season. The updated design removed the swinging friar logo while returning to the team name/city name dynamic for home and road games respectively. The gold uniforms were also retired.

===1980–1984: Brown, gold, &amp; orange===

In 1980, the Padres added orange to the palette. The team&#x27;s next uniform set removed the contrasting colored sleeves and chest numbers, and orange was added to the letters and striping of the home uniforms and trim and striping of the road uniforms. The caps were also updated to feature orange trim on the &quot;SD&quot; and within the gold panel. In 1984, the Padres added the initials &quot;RAK&quot; on the left sleeve in honor of Ray Kroc, who had owned the team since 1974.

===1985–1990: Brown &amp; orange pinstripes===

In 1985, the Padres switched to using a script-like logo in which &quot;Padres&quot; was written sloped up. That would later become a script logo for the Padres. The team&#x27;s colors were changed to brown and orange and remained this way through the 1990 season. In 1989, the Padres took the scripted Padres logo and put it in a gray ring that read &quot;San Diego Baseball Club&quot; with a striped center.

That same year, the Padres returned to wearing traditional buttoned uniforms designed by Sidjakov Berman &amp; Gomez. The home uniforms featured the script &quot;Padres&quot; in front while the road uniforms had the &quot;SD&quot; emblazoned on the left chest. Brown letters with orange trim and brown pinstripes adorned both uniforms. The &quot;RAK&quot; initials remained until 1986. An all-brown cap with the orange &quot;SD&quot; was used with the uniform.

===1991–2003: Blue &amp; orange===

In 1991, the Padres logo was updated. The color of the ring was changed to silver, and the Padres script was changed from brown to blue. The logo only lasted one year, as the Padres changed their logo for the third time in three years, again by switching colors of the ring. The logo became a white ring with fewer stripes in the center and a darker blue Padres script with orange shadows and they also wearing blue pin stripes. In 1991, the team&#x27;s colors were also changed, to a combination of orange and navy blue.

The home uniform kept the pinstripes but was changed to navy blue, which was also implemented on the letters. The road uniforms eliminated the pinstripes and added the city name in navy blue block letters with white trim and orange drop shadows. A navy cap with the &quot;S&quot; in white and &quot;D&quot; in orange was used with the uniform. The team logo was added on the left sleeve in 1996.

The Padres unveiled a navy blue alternate uniform in 1997, featuring the team name in front written in navy blue with orange drop shadows. Other features included orange numbers at the back and white piping along the chest, neck and sleeves. White chest numbers were added in 1999. Initially, the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve, but was removed after the 1998 season in favor of the team&#x27;s primary logo which lasted until the 2000 season.

The following year, the Padres began wearing an alternate home white uniform which bore the same features as the primary home uniform minus the pinstripes and orange trim. Navy blue piping was also added. An alternate navy cap with the white &quot;SD&quot; was used with the uniform. This uniform became the primary in 2001, after which the pinstriped uniforms were retired following that season.

===2004–2015: Blue &amp; sand===
The logo was completely changed when the team changed stadiums between the 2003 and 2004 seasons, with the new logo looking similar to home plate with &quot;San Diego&quot; written in sand font at the top right corner and the Padres new script written completely across the center. Waves finished the bottom of the plate. Navy remained but a sandy beige replaced orange as a secondary color. The team&#x27;s colors were also changed, to navy blue and sand brown. In 2009, the &quot;San Diego&quot; was removed from the top right corner of the logo.

For the next seven seasons the Padres were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not have a grey jersey. On the road, the team wore sand uniforms with the city name in front. The home design featured the updated &quot;Padres&quot; script in navy with sand drop shadows. Both uniforms featured the primary logo on the left sleeve. The alternate blue uniform featured the same &quot;Padres&quot; script in sand, and the swinging friar logo was added to the left sleeve. The Padres continued to wear their primary navy cap at home, while on the road they went with a second navy cap with &quot;SD&quot; in sand.

In 2011, the Padres&#x27; road uniform was changed to a grey base, and the navy and sand caps were used exclusively with the navy alternates. After the season, the alternate navy cap was retired.

For the 2012 season, the Padres unveiled a new primary logo, featuring the cap logo inside a navy blue circle with the words &quot;San Diego Padres Baseball Club&quot; adorning the outer circle. The &quot;swinging friar&quot; logo was recolored navy blue and white and was added to the left sleeve of the home uniform. Another secondary logo features the Padres script carried over from the previous year&#x27;s primary logo below the depiction of Petco Park in sand and above the year of the team&#x27;s first season (EST. 1969); this design was added to the team&#x27;s road and navy alternates. While the home uniforms kept the sand trim, the road and navy alternates did not. In addition, the &quot;SD&quot; replaced &quot;Padres&quot; in front of the navy alternates, and the city name wordmark on the road uniforms was updated. All uniforms also added piping around the chest, neck and sleeves.

===2016–2019: Blue &amp; white===
In the 2016 season, the Padres wore a navy blue and gold color scheme, similar to the one used on the 2016 All-Star Game logo. The home uniform was patterned similarly to the alternate navy uniforms, with gold trim accenting the piping and letters. An alternate navy cap with the &quot;S&quot; in white and &quot;D&quot; in gold was also used with the uniform. To coincide with the change, the Padres added a new brown and gold alternate uniform to be worn mostly during Friday home games, along with an updated gold-paneled brown cap.

For the 2017 season, the Padres revealed a new color scheme and new jerseys for the second straight year. The gold was scrapped from the home uniform and the team reverted to a navy blue-and-white combo. The word &quot;Padres&quot; returned to the front of the home uniform, but with a new script, while the script on the road uniform reverted to the &quot;San Diego&quot; wordmark style it used from 2004 to 2011. Both uniforms also added the &quot;SD&quot; logo on the left sleeve. The navy blue alternates remained intact minus the left sleeve patch. Despite this major change, the brown and gold alternate uniform from the previous set was retained, with the addition of the &quot;SD&quot; on the left sleeve.

===2020–present: Return to brown &amp; gold ===
The club announced in January 2019 that the original brown and gold colors would return for the 2020 season. The new uniform designs featuring the brown and gold colors were officially unveiled on November 9. The team featured brown and gold on each of the three unveiled jerseys, including the return of pinstripes to the Padre home jersey for the first time since 2001 and a sand-colored road jersey (also with pinstripes) for the first time since 2010. Alternate non-pinstriped sand pants are paired with the brown alternate jersey. The shade of the sand color is noticeably darker than the sand-colored road jerseys worn from 2004 to 2010. An all-brown cap with &quot;SD&quot; in gold was also released. With the uniform change, the San Diego Padres are once again the only team in the league that do not feature grey in their road uniforms.

The return to brown and gold uniforms has coincided with an increase in team merchandise sales, with the Padres ranking in the top 10 in MLB team merchandise sales at U.S. sports retailer Lids during the 2022 season.

====City Connect====
In 2022, the Padres joined 13 other teams in wearing Nike&#x27;s &quot;City Connect&quot; uniforms. The primarily white uniform featured pink, mint green and yellow accents on the letters and sleeves, and has &quot;San Diego&quot; written in a graffiti style. The left mint sleeve contained a recolored version of the &quot;swinging friar&quot; logo in pink and yellow. The all-mint cap featured the pink interlocking &quot;SD&quot; in front. The uniform intended to pay tribute to the San Diego–Tijuana bi-national metropolitan area, highlighting San Diego&#x27;s long-standing relations with Tijuana in Baja California, Mexico.

==Mascot==

The Padres&#x27; official mascot is the “Swinging Friar”, a pudgy man dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat and rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win. He is named and patterned after the Spanish Franciscans, who founded Mission San Diego de Alcalá around which the city of San Diego was established in 1769.

The Swinging Friar was designed by 19-year-old Carlos Hadaway in the 1950s and first appeared on team programs for the 1962 home opener, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a Minor League Baseball organization. The mascot was retained when the team joined Major League Baseball in 1969. Originally, the Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since the 1990s, the character has been a full mascot costume.

The San Diego Chicken has often been mistaken as the Padres&#x27; team mascot due to the frequency with which he appears at Padres games. Although he does make appearances at San Diego sporting events, the Famous Chicken is an independent character owned by professional mascot Ted Giannoulas and has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.

==Rivalry==
The Padres&#x27; historical rivalry against the Los Angeles Dodgers has often been largely lopsided in favor of LA, however; recent growth between the two teams in competition during the 2020s has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego (driving from Dodger Stadium to Petco Park can be done by simply taking Interstate 5). San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for multiple sports franchises as both the Chargers and the Clippers had relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to secure either a new arena or stable finances in San Diego. Following the relocation of the Chargers to Los Angeles in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the four major American professional sports leagues in the San Diego sports market, strengthening the rivalry and San Diego&#x27;s animosity to Los Angeles sports in general. The Dodgers currently lead the series 504–412, and both teams have met in the post season three times (Los Angeles winning the 2020 NLDS and 2024 NLDS, while San Diego won in 2022). Off the field, the rivalry has been just as competitive, as the two teams have aggressively battled on the trade market and free agency over numerous star players.

==Military appreciation==
In 1996, the Padres became the first national sports team to have an annual military appreciation event. In 2000, the Padres began wearing a camouflage jersey to honor the military. Starting in 2008, the Padres began wearing camouflage jerseys for every Sunday home game. The team also wears the uniforms on Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. For 2011, the Padres changed the camouflage design to a more modern &quot;digital&quot; design, using the MARPAT design after receiving permission from then-Commandant James Conway, and dropped the green from the lettering and logo of the jersey. Green was replaced by a sand-olive color (also in the cap worn with the jersey). For 2016, to coincide with hosting the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the Padres added a second camouflage jersey, this time in navy blue. The Padres alternated the navy camouflage jersey with a Marines style, which were used through 2019. For 2020, the Padres began using two different camouflage jersey colors: green and sand-olive, both with the current &quot;Padres&quot; logo. Even though MLB and Nike implemented a &quot;4+1&quot; rule regarding team uniforms starting in 2023, the Padres were given special permission to continue wearing their military uniforms; thus they are the only team to wear six different uniforms per season.

Since 1995 Marine Recruits from the nearby Marine Corps Recruit Depot often visit the games en masse during Military Appreciation Day, in uniform, often filling entire sections of the upper deck of Petco Park. When present, the team commemorates them with a special Fourth Inning Stretch featuring the Marines&#x27; Hymn played by stadium organist Bobby Cressey. Through April 2005 over 60,000 marine recruits were hosted by the Padres. This is part of an extensive military outreach program, which also includes a series of Military Appreciation Night games, and game tapes mailed to deployed United States Navy ships of the Pacific Fleet for onboard viewing (a large portion of the Pacific Fleet is home ported in San Diego). Now, every Sunday home games the Padres play is &quot;Military Sunday&quot;.

The San Diego area is home to a number of military installations, including several Navy and Coast Guard bases centered on San Diego Bay, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (former home of the &quot;Top Gun&quot; training program), and the Marine Corps training ground at Camp Pendleton. Civilians employed at those bases account for around 5% of the county&#x27;s working population.

==Radio and television==

As of May 31, 2023, the Padres&#x27; regional telecasts are produced by MLB&#x27;s local media department and distributed via local origination channels on television providers in the team&#x27;s regional market, as well as an over-the-top subscription service distributed by MLB.tv. These telecasts are branded as PADRES.TV. Games air on the following cable providers and networks:

*DirecTV (CH. 694-3)
*DirecTV Stream (CH. 694)
*AT&amp;T U-Verse (CH. 781 or CH. 1781)
*Cox (San Diego) (CH. 83)

Don Orsillo is the play-by-play announcer, with Mark Grant as color analyst and Bob Scanlan as field reporter. Bally Sports San Diego (formerly Fox Sports San Diego) had assumed the rights to the team in 2012 under a 20-year deal, replacing Cox Cable&#x27;s 4SD. Amid the chapter 11 bankruptcy of the network&#x27;s parent company Diamond Sports Group, Bally missed a rights payment to the Padres in May 2023, causing the rights to the Padres to revert to the team; MLB subsequently took over production of the Padres&#x27; regional broadcasts, retaining the commentators and contracted employees.

As of the 2021 season, Padres radio broadcasts in English are carried by KWFN &quot;97.3 The Fan&quot;, after having previously been carried by sister station 94.9 KBZT upon the acquisition of the radio rights by Entercom in 2017. Jesse Agler is the primary play-by-play announcer, with Tony Gwynn Jr. serving as color analyst. The games are also broadcast in Spanish on XEXX-AM, &quot;Radio Ranchito 1420 AM&quot;, with Eduardo Ortega, Carlos Hernández and Pedro Gutiérrez announcing. Padre games were also aired from 2006 to 2010 on XHPRS-FM 105.7.

Spanish language telecasts of Sunday games are seen XHAS-TDT channel 33. Until September 2007, Friday and Saturday games were seen in Spanish on KBOP-CA channel 43, until that station changed to an all-infomercial format. This makes XHAS-TDT the only over-the-air-television station carrying Padres baseball. English-language Padres over-the-air broadcasts aired through the years on XETV-TV 6, KCST-TV 39, KUSI-TV 51, KFMB-TV 8 and KSWB-TV 69.

John Demott was the Padres&#x27; first public address announcer when the team began in 1969. By the late 1970s, Bruce Binkowski had taken over as PA announcer, and became the longest-serving public address announcer in the team&#x27;s history, remaining until the end of the 1999 season. First DeMott and then Binkowski also were responsible with PA announcing duties for the San Diego Chargers and the San Diego State Aztecs, both of which were joint tenants at Qualcomm Stadium with the Padres until the Padres moved into Petco Park. From Petco Park&#x27;s opening in 2004 until 2013, the PA announcer was Frank Anthony, a radio host with 105.7 XHPRS-FM. On April 19, 2014, Alex Miniak was announced as the new Public Address announcer for the San Diego Padres. Miniak was formerly the PA announcer for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, the Double-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, and is the current PA commentator for the &quot;MLB The Show&quot; series.

The San Diego Padres were first portrayed in the 1979 NBC made-for-TV film &quot;The Kid from Left Field&quot;, starring Gary Coleman as Jackie Robinson &quot;J.R.&quot; Cooper, a youngster who is passionate about baseball, and puts his knowledge to good use when he becomes the manager of the Padres and helps lead them to the World Series.

In 2015, the San Diego Padres were also seen in an HBO original comedy/Documentary style movie, Ferrell Takes the Field starring Will Ferrell, where he plays ten major league baseball Spring-training games in ten different positions on the field in one day, one of the teams including The San Diego Padres. The movie was a special by HBO sponsored by MLB and dedicated to the fight against cancer charity, Cancer for College. The movie premiered in Petco Park after the Padres vs. Dodgers game on September 5, 2015.

In 2016, the San Diego Padres were portrayed once again in the one-season Fox television series &quot;Pitch&quot;, starring Kylie Bunbury as Ginny Baker, the first female to play in Major League Baseball.

<text>The Sinclair QL (for &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;) is a personal computer launched by Sinclair Research in 1984, as an upper-end counterpart to the ZX Spectrum. 

The QL was the last desktop microcomputer aimed at the serious home user and professional and executive users markets from small to medium-sized businesses and higher educational establishments, but failed to achieve commercial success. 

While the ZX Spectrum has an 8-bit Zilog Z80 as the CPU, the QL uses a Motorola 68008. The 68008 is a member of the Motorola 68000 family with 32-bit internal data registers, but an 8-bit external data bus characteristic of microcomputers.

== History ==

=== Development ===
The QL was conceived in 1981 under the code name &quot;ZX83&quot;, as a portable computer for business users, with a built-in ultra-thin flat-screen CRT display similar to the later TV80 pocket TV, printer and modem. As development progressed it eventually became clear that the portability features were over-ambitious and the specification was reduced to a conventional desktop configuration. 

The electronics were primarily designed by David Karlin, who joined Sinclair Research in summer 1982. The industrial design was done by Rick Dickinson, who already designed the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum range of products.

The QL was designed to be more powerful than the IBM Personal Computer, and comparable to Apple&#x27;s Macintosh. While the CPU clock speed is comparable to that of the Macintosh, and the later Atari ST and Amiga, the 8-bit databus and cycle stealing of the ZX8301 gate array limit the QL&#x27;s performance.

Sinclair had commissioned GST Computer Systems to produce the operating system for the machine, but switched to Domesdos, developed by Tony Tebby as an in-house alternative, before launch. GST&#x27;s OS, designed by Tim Ward, was later made available as 68K/OS, in the form of an add-on ROM card. The tools developed by GST for the QL would later be used on the Atari ST, where GST object format became standard.

=== Launch ===
At the time of the rushed launch, on 12 January 1984, the QL was far from being ready for production, with no complete working prototype. Although Sinclair started taking orders immediately, promising delivery within 28 days, first customer deliveries only started, slowly, in April. This provoked criticism of the company and the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority.

Because of its premature launch, the QL was plagued by a number of problems from the start. Early production QLs were shipped with preliminary versions of firmware containing numerous bugs, mainly in SuperBASIC. Part of the firmware was held on an external 16 KiB ROM cartridge also known as the &quot;kludge&quot; or &quot;dongle&quot;, until the QL was redesigned to accommodate the necessary 48 KiB of ROM internally, instead of the 32 KiB initially specified.

The QL also suffered from reliability problems of its Microdrives. These problems were later rectified, by Sinclair engineers, especially on Samsung produced models, as well as by aftermarket firms such as Adman Services and TF Services, to the point where several QL users report the Samsung Microdrives in particular working perfectly even after almost 17 years of service; but in any case too late to redeem the negative image they had already created.

=== Reception ===
Although the computer was hyped as being advanced for its time, and relatively cheap, it failed to sell well, and UK production was suspended in 1985, due to lack of demand. After Amstrad acquired Sinclair&#x27;s computer product lines in April 1986, the QL was officially discontinued.

Apart from its reliability issues, the target business market was becoming wedded to the IBM PC platform, whilst the majority of ZX Spectrum owners were uninterested in upgrading to a machine which had a minimal library of games (with only about 70 titles, compared to the Spectrum&#x27;s more than 4700). Sinclair&#x27;s persistence with the non-standard Microdrive and uncomfortable keyboard did not endear it to the business market. Clive Sinclair later maintained that the Microdrive was &quot;a marvellous approach&quot;, also claiming that he had really wanted to base the QL on the Z80, that others in the company had persuaded him to use the 68000, and that &quot;there was nothing you could do on the 68000 that you couldn&#x27;t do on the Z80&quot;. Software publishers were also reluctant to support the QL because Microdrive cartridges were the only available distribution medium for the QL, and the unfavourable pricing of the medium (production costs being given as over six times that of compact cassette) impacted profitability and made QL-based products uncompetitive.

Dedicated magazines were published for the system, such as &quot;QL World&quot; (published from 1985 to 1994), &quot;QL User&quot; (published from 1984 to 1985), or &quot;QL Today&quot; (published from 1996 to 2013).

== Design ==
Based on a Motorola 68008 processor clocked at 7.5 MHz, the QL included 128 KiB of RAM, which is officially expandable to 640 KiB and in practice, 896 KB.

It can be connected to a monitor or TV for display. Sinclair recommended the &quot;SINCLAIR VISION-QL&quot; RGB monitor for usage with the QL. When connected to a normally-adjusted TV or monitor, the QL&#x27;s video output overscans horizontally. This is reputed to have been due to the timing constants in the ZX8301 chip being optimised for the flat-screen CRT display originally intended for the QL.
Two video modes are available, pixels with 8 primary RGB colours and per-pixel flashing, or pixels with four colours: black, red, green and white. Both screen modes use a 32 KiB framebuffer in main memory. The hardware is capable of switching between two different areas of memory for the frame buffer, thus allowing double buffering. However, this would use 64 KB of the standard machine&#x27;s 128 KiB of RAM and there is no support for this feature in the QL&#x27;s original firmware. The alternative and improved operating system Minerva provides full support for the second frame buffer. Internally, the QL comprises the CPU, two ULAs (ZX8301 &quot;Master Chip&quot; and ZX8302 &quot;Peripheral Chip&quot;) and an Intel 8049 microcontroller known as the IPC, or &quot;Intelligent Peripheral Controller&quot;. The ZX8301 implements the video display generator and also provides DRAM refresh. The ZX8302 interfaces to the RS-232 ports (transmit only), Microdrives, QLAN ports, real-time clock and the 8049 via a synchronous serial link. The 8049 runs at 11 MHz and provides a keyboard/joystick interface, RS-232 serial receivers and an audio generator. The 8049 was added at a late stage in the QL&#x27;s design, as the ZX8302 was originally intended to include its functions. 

Two built-in Microdrive tape-loop cartridge drives provide mass storage, in place of the more expensive floppy disk drives found on similar systems of the era. Microdrives had been introduced for the ZX Spectrum in July 1983, although the QL uses a different logical tape format.

Interfaces include an expansion slot, ROM cartridge socket, dual RS-232 ports, proprietary QLAN local area network ports, dual joystick ports and an external Microdrive bus. The QL uses British Telecom type 631W plugs of similar design to British telephone sockets for serial cables except for QLs built by Samsung for export markets, which have DE-9 sockets. Joysticks connect to the QL with similar type 630W plugs.

Physically, the QL is the same black colour as the preceding ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, but introduced a new angular styling theme and keyboard design which would later be seen in the ZX Spectrum+.

QDOS, a pre-emptive multitasking operating system primarily designed by Tony Tebby, is included on ROM, as is an advanced structured BASIC interpreter, named SuperBASIC designed by Jan Jones, which is also used as the command-line interpreter. The QL is bundled with an office suite, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database, and business graphics written by Psion. 

According to Sinclair Research, it was the first mass-market computer with an OS featuring pre-emptive multitasking and a Windows-style operating system, predating Microsoft Windows 95 by 11 years, and Apple Computer Macintosh launch by a month.

== Legacy ==

=== ICL One Per Desk ===
The QL&#x27;s CPU, ZX8301 and ZX8302 ASICs and Microdrives form the basis of One Per Desk (OPD). Built by International Computers Limited (ICL), it was also marketed by British Telecom as the Merlin Tonto and by Telecom Australia as the Computerphone.

The result of a three-year collaboration between Sinclair Research, ICL and British Telecom, the One Per Desk adds a telephone handset at one end of the keyboard, and rudimentary Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) software. This machine interested a number of high-profile business customers, including certain divisions of the former UK Customs and Excise Department, but its success was generally limited. In the late 1980s they were used in bingo halls to allow a country-wide networked bingo game.

=== Linux ===

Linus Torvalds has attributed his eventually developing the Linux kernel, likewise having pre-emptive multitasking, in part to having owned a Sinclair QL in the 1980s. Because of the lack of support, particularly in his native Finland, Torvalds became used to writing his own software rather than relying on programs written by others. In part, his frustration with Minix on the Sinclair led years later to his purchase of a more standard IBM PC compatible on which he would develop Linux. In &quot;Just for Fun&quot;, Torvalds wrote, &quot;Back in 1987, one of the selling points of the QL was that it &quot;looked&quot; cool&quot;, because it was &quot;entirely matte black, with a black keyboard&quot; and was &quot;fairly angular&quot;. He also wrote he bought a floppy controller so he could stop using microdrives, but the floppy controller driver was bad, so he wrote his own. Bugs in the operating system, or discrepancies with the documentation, that made his software not work properly, got him interested in operating systems. &quot;Like any good computer purist raised on a 68008 chip,&quot; Torvalds &quot;despised PCs&quot;, but decided in autumn 1990 to purchase a 386 custom-made IBM PC compatible, which he did in January 1991.

=== Clones ===
After Amstrad abandoned the QL in 1986, several companies previously involved in the QL peripherals market stepped in to fill the void. These included CST and DanSoft, creators of the Thor line of compatible systems; Miracle Systems, creator of the Gold Card and Super Gold Card processor/memory upgrade cards and the QXL PC-based hardware emulator; and Qubbesoft, with the Aurora, the first replacement QL mainboard, with enhanced graphics modes.

In the late 1990s, two partly QL-compatible motherboards named Q40 and Q60 (collectively referred to as Qx0) were designed by Peter Graf and marketed by D&amp;D Systems. The Q40 and Q60, based on the Motorola 68040 and 68060 CPUs respectively, are much more powerful than the original QL and have the ability among other things (such as multimedia, high resolution graphics, Ethernet networking etc.) to run the Linux operating system.

In 2013 Peter Graf announced that he was working on the Q68, a FPGA based QL compatible single board computer. The Q68 was first presented to the public in April 2014 and became available in autumn 2017. It is produced and marketed by Derek Stewart (of former D&amp;D Systems).

Hardware add-ons such as new developments like the QL-SD (designed by Peter Graf) and reengineered or even expanded 1990s designs such as QubIDE interfaces (by José Leandro Novellón). Trump, Gold &amp; Super Gold Cards (by Tetroid) are still being produced for the original QL.

RWAP Software supplies various hardware and software upgrades and spare parts.

=== Operating systems ===

Patched or reengineered versions of QDOS were produced, most notably Minerva which gradually evolved into a completely rewritten operating system, offering improved speed, with multitasking SuperBASIC interpreters. Tony Tebby went on to produce another updated operating system, SMSQ/E, which has continued to be developed for the Sinclair QL and emulators, offering many more features.

=== Emulators, virtual QLs and distributions ===

Several emulators and virtual QLs became available over time, of which Q-emuLator (Windows/Mac), QPC2 (Windows), SMSQmulator (Java), ZEsarUX (Windows/Mac/Linux) and sQLux (Windows/Mac/Linux) are actively maintained. 

Several distributions of emulators, applications and information have been produced, of which Black Phoenix and QL/E are the most actively maintained.

<text>In thermodynamics, the specific heat capacity (symbol ) of a substance is the amount of heat that must be added to one unit of mass of the substance in order to cause an increase of one unit in temperature. It is also referred to as Massic heat capacity or as the Specific heat. More formally it is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the mass of the sample. The SI unit of specific heat capacity is joule per kelvin per kilogram, J⋅kg−1⋅K−1. For example, the heat required to raise the temperature of of water by is , so the specific heat capacity of water is .

Specific heat capacity often varies with temperature, and is different for each state of matter. Liquid water has one of the highest specific heat capacities among common substances, about at 20 °C; but that of ice, just below 0 °C, is only . The specific heat capacities of iron, granite, and hydrogen gas are about 449 J⋅kg−1⋅K−1, 790 J⋅kg−1⋅K−1, and 14300 J⋅kg−1⋅K−1, respectively. While the substance is undergoing a phase transition, such as melting or boiling, its specific heat capacity is technically undefined, because the heat goes into changing its state rather than raising its temperature.

The specific heat capacity of a substance, especially a gas, may be significantly higher when it is allowed to expand as it is heated (specific heat capacity &quot;at constant pressure&quot;) than when it is heated in a closed vessel that prevents expansion (specific heat capacity &quot;at constant volume&quot;). These two values are usually denoted by formula_1 and formula_2, respectively; their quotient formula_3 is the heat capacity ratio.

The term &quot;specific heat&quot; may also refer to the ratio between the specific heat capacities of a substance at a given temperature and of a reference substance at a reference temperature, such as water at 15 °C; much in the fashion of specific gravity. Specific heat capacity is also related to other intensive measures of heat capacity with other denominators. If the amount of substance is measured as a number of moles, one gets the molar heat capacity instead, whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per mole, J⋅mol−1⋅K−1. If the amount is taken to be the volume of the sample (as is sometimes done in engineering), one gets the volumetric heat capacity, whose SI unit is joule per kelvin per cubic meter, J⋅m−3⋅K−1.

== History ==

=== Discovery of specific heat ===

One of the first scientists to use the concept was Joseph Black, an 18th-century medical doctor and professor of medicine at Glasgow University. He measured the specific heat capacities of many substances, using the term &quot;capacity for heat&quot;. In 1756 or soon thereafter, Black began an extensive study of heat. In 1760 he realized that when two different substances of equal mass but different temperatures are mixed, the changes in number of degrees in the two substances differ, though the heat gained by the cooler substance and lost by the hotter is the same. Black related an experiment conducted by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit on behalf of Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave. For clarity, he then described a hypothetical, but realistic variant of the experiment: If equal masses of 100 °F water and 150 °F mercury are mixed, the water temperature increases by 20 ° and the mercury temperature decreases by 30 ° (both arriving at 120 °F), even though the heat gained by the water and lost by the mercury is the same. This clarified the distinction between heat and temperature. It also introduced the concept of specific heat capacity, being different for different substances. Black wrote: “Quicksilver [mercury] ... has less capacity for the matter of heat than water.”

== Definition ==
The specific heat capacity of a substance, usually denoted by formula_4 or formula_5, is the heat capacity formula_6 of a sample of the substance, divided by the mass formula_7 of the sample:
formula_8
where formula_9 represents the amount of heat needed to uniformly raise the temperature of the sample by a small increment formula_10.

Like the heat capacity of an object, the specific heat capacity of a substance may vary, sometimes substantially, depending on the starting temperature formula_11 of the sample and the pressure formula_12 applied to it. Therefore, it should be considered a function formula_13 of those two variables.

These parameters are usually specified when giving the specific heat capacity of a substance. For example, &quot;Water (liquid): formula_1 = 4187 J⋅kg−1⋅K−1 (15 °C).&quot; When not specified, published values of the specific heat capacity formula_4 generally are valid for some standard conditions for temperature and pressure.

However, the dependency of formula_4 on starting temperature and pressure can often be ignored in practical contexts, e.g. when working in narrow ranges of those variables. In those contexts one usually omits the qualifier formula_17 and approximates the specific heat capacity by a constant formula_4 suitable for those ranges.

Specific heat capacity is an intensive property of a substance, an intrinsic characteristic that does not depend on the size or shape of the amount in consideration. (The qualifier &quot;specific&quot; in front of an extensive property often indicates an intensive property derived from it.)

===Variations===
The injection of heat energy into a substance, besides raising its temperature, usually causes an increase in its volume and/or its pressure, depending on how the sample is confined. The choice made about the latter affects the measured specific heat capacity, even for the same starting pressure formula_12 and starting temperature formula_11. Two particular choices are widely used:
* If the pressure is kept constant (for instance, at the ambient atmospheric pressure), and the sample is allowed to expand, the expansion generates work, as the force from the pressure displaces the enclosure or the surrounding fluid. That work must come from the heat energy provided. The specific heat capacity thus obtained is said to be measured at constant pressure (or isobaric) and is often denoted 
* On the other hand, if the expansion is prevented for example, by a sufficiently rigid enclosure or by increasing the external pressure to counteract the internal one no work is generated, and the heat energy that would have gone into it must instead contribute to the internal energy of the sample, including raising its temperature by an extra amount. The specific heat capacity obtained this way is said to be measured at constant volume (or isochoric) and denoted 

The value of formula_2 is always less than the value of formula_1 for all fluids. This difference is particularly notable in gases where values under constant pressure are typically 30% to 66.7% greater than those at constant volume. Hence the heat capacity ratio of gases is typically between 1.3 and 1.67.

===Applicability===
The specific heat capacity can be defined and measured for gases, liquids, and solids of fairly general composition and molecular structure. These include gas mixtures, solutions and alloys, or heterogenous materials such as milk, sand, granite, and concrete, if considered at a sufficiently large scale.

The specific heat capacity can be defined also for materials that change state or composition as the temperature and pressure change, as long as the changes are reversible and gradual. Thus, for example, the concepts are definable for a gas or liquid that dissociates as the temperature increases, as long as the products of the dissociation promptly and completely recombine when it drops.

The specific heat capacity is not meaningful if the substance undergoes irreversible chemical changes, or if there is a phase change, such as melting or boiling, at a sharp temperature within the range of temperatures spanned by the measurement.

== Measurement ==
The specific heat capacity of a substance is typically determined according to the definition; namely, by measuring the heat capacity of a sample of the substance, usually with a calorimeter, and dividing by the sample&#x27;s mass. Several techniques can be applied for estimating the heat capacity of a substance, such as differential scanning calorimetry.
The specific heat capacities of gases can be measured at constant volume, by enclosing the sample in a rigid container. On the other hand, measuring the specific heat capacity at constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids, since one often would need impractical pressures in order to prevent the expansion that would be caused by even small increases in temperature. Instead, the common practice is to measure the specific heat capacity at constant pressure (allowing the material to expand or contract as it wishes), determine separately the coefficient of thermal expansion and the compressibility of the material, and compute the specific heat capacity at constant volume from these data according to the laws of thermodynamics.
==Units==
===International system===
The SI unit for specific heat capacity is joule per kelvin per kilogram , J⋅K−1⋅kg−1. Since an increment of temperature of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, that is the same as joule per degree Celsius per kilogram: J/(kg⋅°C). Sometimes the gram is used instead of kilogram for the unit of mass: 1 J⋅g−1⋅K−1 = 1000 J⋅kg−1⋅K−1.

The specific heat capacity of a substance (per unit of mass) has dimension L2⋅Θ−1⋅T−2, or (L/T)2/Θ. Therefore, the SI unit J⋅kg−1⋅K−1 is equivalent to metre squared per second squared per kelvin (m2⋅K−1⋅s−2).

===Imperial engineering units===
Professionals in construction, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and other technical disciplines, especially in the United States, may use English Engineering units including the pound (lb = 0.45359237 kg) as the unit of mass, the degree Fahrenheit or Rankine (°R = K, about 0.555556 K) as the unit of temperature increment, and the British thermal unit (BTU ≈ 1055.056 J), as the unit of heat.

In those contexts, the unit of specific heat capacity is BTU/lb⋅°R, or 1 = 4186.68. The BTU was originally defined so that the average specific heat capacity of water would be 1 BTU/lb⋅°F. Note the value&#x27;s similarity to that of the calorie - 4187 J/kg⋅°C ≈ 4184 J/kg⋅°C (~.07%) - as they are essentially measuring the same energy, using water as a basis reference, scaled to their systems&#x27; respective lbs and °F, or kg and °C.

===Calories===
In chemistry, heat amounts were often measured in calories. Confusingly, there are two common units with that name, respectively denoted &quot;cal&quot; and &quot;Cal&quot;: 
* the &quot;small calorie&quot; (&quot;gram-calorie, cal&quot;) is 4.184 J exactly. It was originally defined so that the specific heat capacity of liquid water would be 1 cal/(°C⋅g). 
*The &quot;grand calorie&quot; (&quot;kilocalorie, kilogram-calorie, food calorie, kcal, Cal&quot;) is 1000 small calories, 4184 J exactly. It was defined so that the specific heat capacity of water would be 1 Cal/(°C⋅kg).
While these units are still used in some contexts (such as kilogram calorie in nutrition), their use is now deprecated in technical and scientific fields. When heat is measured in these units, the unit of specific heat capacity is usually: 

Note that while cal is &#x27; of a Cal or kcal, it is also per &quot;gram&quot; instead of &quot;&#x27;kilogram&quot;: ergo, in either unit, the specific heat capacity of water is approximately 1.

==Physical basis ==

The temperature of a sample of a substance reflects the average kinetic energy of its constituent particles (atoms or molecules) relative to its center of mass. However, not all energy provided to a sample of a substance will go into raising its temperature, exemplified via the equipartition theorem.

===Monatomic gases===
Statistical mechanics predicts that at room temperature and ordinary pressures, an isolated atom in a gas cannot store any significant amount of energy except in the form of kinetic energy, unless multiple electronic states are accessible at room temperature (such is the case for atomic fluorine). Thus, the heat capacity per mole at room temperature is the same for all of the noble gases as well as for many other atomic vapors. More precisely, formula_23 and formula_24, where formula_25 is the ideal gas unit (which is the product of Boltzmann conversion constant from kelvin microscopic energy unit to the macroscopic energy unit joule, and the Avogadro number).

Therefore, the specific heat capacity (per gram, not per mole) of a monatomic gas will be inversely proportional to its (adimensional) atomic weight formula_26. That is, approximately,

formula_27

For the noble gases, from helium to xenon, these computed values are
===Polyatomic gases===
On the other hand, a polyatomic gas molecule (consisting of two or more atoms bound together) can store heat energy in additional degrees of freedom. Its kinetic energy contributes to the heat capacity in the same way as monatomic gases, but there are also contributions from the rotations of the molecule and vibration of the atoms relative to each other (including internal potential energy). 

There may also be contributions to the heat capacity from excited electronic states for molecules where the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state is sufficiently small, such as . For a few systems, quantum spin statistics can also be important contributions to the heat capacity, even at room temperature. The analysis of the heat capacity of due to ortho/para separation, which arises from nuclear spin statistics, has been referred to as &quot;one of the great triumphs of post-quantum mechanical statistical mechanics.&quot;

These extra degrees of freedom or &quot;modes&quot; contribute to the specific heat capacity of the substance. Namely, when heat energy is injected into a gas with polyatomic molecules, only part of it will go into increasing their kinetic energy, and hence the temperature; the rest will go to into the other degrees of freedom. To achieve the same increase in temperature, more heat energy is needed for a gram of that substance than for a gram of a monatomic gas. Thus, the specific heat capacity per mole of a polyatomic gas depends both on the molecular mass and the number of degrees of freedom of the molecules.

Quantum statistical mechanics predicts that each rotational or vibrational mode can only take or lose energy in certain discrete amounts (quanta), and that this affects the system’s thermodynamic properties. Depending on the temperature, the average heat energy per molecule may be too small compared to the quanta needed to activate some of those degrees of freedom. Those modes are said to be &quot;frozen out&quot;. In that case, the specific heat capacity of the substance increases with temperature, sometimes in a step-like fashion as mode becomes unfrozen and starts absorbing part of the input heat energy.

For example, the molar heat capacity of nitrogen at constant volume is formula_28 (at 15 °C, 1 atm), which is formula_29. That is the value expected from the Equipartition Theorem if each molecule had 5 kinetic degrees of freedom. These turn out to be three degrees of the molecule&#x27;s velocity vector, plus two degrees from its rotation about an axis through the center of mass and perpendicular to the line of the two atoms. Because of those two extra degrees of freedom, the specific heat capacity formula_2 of (736 J⋅K−1⋅kg−1) is greater than that of an hypothetical monatomic gas with the same molecular mass 28 (445 J⋅K−1⋅kg−1), by a factor of . The vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom do not contribute significantly to the heat capacity in this case, due to the relatively large energy level gaps for both vibrational and electronic excitation in this molecule.

This value for the specific heat capacity of nitrogen is practically constant from below −150 °C to about 300 °C. In that temperature range, the two additional degrees of freedom that correspond to vibrations of the atoms, stretching and compressing the bond, are still &quot;frozen out&quot;. At about that temperature, those modes begin to &quot;un-freeze&quot; as vibrationally excited states become accessible. As a result formula_2 starts to increase rapidly at first, then slower as it tends to another constant value. It is 35.5 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 at 1500 °C, 36.9 at 2500 °C, and 37.5 at 3500 °C. The last value corresponds almost exactly to the value predicted by the Equipartition Theorem, since in the high-temperature limit the theorem predicts that the vibrational degree of freedom contributes twice as much to the heat capacity as any one of the translational or rotational degrees of freedom.

==Derivations of heat capacity==
===Relation between specific heat capacities===
Starting from the fundamental thermodynamic relation one can show,

formula_32

where
*formula_33 is the coefficient of thermal expansion, 
*formula_34 is the isothermal compressibility, and
*formula_35 is density.
A derivation is discussed in the article Relations between specific heats.

For an ideal gas, if formula_36 is expressed as molar density in the above equation, this equation reduces simply to Mayer&#x27;s relation,

formula_37

where formula_38 and formula_39 are intensive property heat capacities expressed on a per mole basis at constant pressure and constant volume, respectively.

===Specific heat capacity===
The specific heat capacity of a material on a per mass basis is

formula_40

which in the absence of phase transitions is equivalent to

formula_41

where
*formula_6 is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question,
*formula_43 is the mass of the body,
*formula_44 is the volume of the body, and
*formula_45 is the density of the material.

For gases, and also for other materials under high pressures, there is need to distinguish between different boundary conditions for the processes under consideration (since values differ significantly between different conditions). Typical processes for which a heat capacity may be defined include isobaric (constant pressure, formula_46) or isochoric (constant volume, formula_47) processes. The corresponding specific heat capacities are expressed as

formula_48

A related parameter to formula_4 is formula_50, the volumetric heat capacity. In engineering practice, formula_2 for solids or liquids often signifies a volumetric heat capacity, rather than a constant-volume one. In such cases, the mass-specific heat capacity is often explicitly written with the subscript formula_43, as formula_53. Of course, from the above relationships, for solids one writes

formula_54

For pure homogeneous chemical compounds with established molecular or molar mass or a molar quantity is established, heat capacity as an intensive property can be expressed on a per mole basis instead of a per mass basis by the following equations analogous to the per mass equations:

formula_55

where &quot;n&quot; = number of moles in the body or thermodynamic system. One may refer to such a &quot;per mole&quot; quantity as molar heat capacity to distinguish it from specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis.

===Polytropic heat capacity===
The polytropic heat capacity is calculated at processes if all the thermodynamic properties (pressure, volume, temperature) change

formula_56

The most important polytropic processes run between the adiabatic and the isotherm functions, the polytropic index is between 1 and the adiabatic exponent (&quot;γ&quot; or &quot;κ&quot;)

===Dimensionless heat capacity===
The dimensionless heat capacity of a material is

formula_57

where 
*&quot;C&quot; is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question (J/K)
*&quot;n&quot; is the amount of substance in the body (mol)
*&quot;R&quot; is the gas constant (J⋅K−1⋅mol−1)
*&quot;N&quot; is the number of molecules in the body. (dimensionless)
*&quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant (J⋅K−1)

Again, SI units shown for example.

In the Ideal gas article, dimensionless heat capacity formula_58 is expressed as formula_59.

===Heat capacity at absolute zero===
From the definition of entropy

formula_60

the absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero kelvins temperature to the final temperature &quot;Tf&quot;

formula_61

The heat capacity must be zero at zero temperature in order for the above integral not to yield an infinite absolute entropy, thus violating the third law of thermodynamics. One of the strengths of the Debye model is that (unlike the preceding Einstein model) it predicts the proper mathematical form of the approach of heat capacity toward zero, as absolute zero temperature is approached.

===Solid phase===
The theoretical maximum heat capacity for larger and larger multi-atomic gases at higher temperatures, also approaches the Dulong–Petit limit of 3&quot;R&quot;, so long as this is calculated per mole of atoms, not molecules. The reason is that gases with very large molecules, in theory have almost the same high-temperature heat capacity as solids, lacking only the (small) heat capacity contribution that comes from potential energy that cannot be stored between separate molecules in a gas.

The Dulong–Petit limit results from the equipartition theorem, and as such is only valid in the classical limit of a microstate continuum, which is a high temperature limit. For light and non-metallic elements, as well as most of the common molecular solids based on carbon compounds at standard ambient temperature, quantum effects may also play an important role, as they do in multi-atomic gases. These effects usually combine to give heat capacities lower than 3&quot;R&quot; per mole of &quot;atoms&quot; in the solid, although in molecular solids, heat capacities calculated &quot;per mole of molecules&quot; in molecular solids may be more than 3&quot;R&quot;. For example, the heat capacity of water ice at the melting point is about 4.6&quot;R&quot; per mole of molecules, but only 1.5&quot;R&quot; per mole of atoms. The lower than 3&quot;R&quot; number &quot;per atom&quot; (as is the case with diamond and beryllium) results from the “freezing out” of possible vibration modes for light atoms at suitably low temperatures, just as in many low-mass-atom gases at room temperatures. Because of high crystal binding energies, these effects are seen in solids more often than liquids: for example the heat capacity of liquid water is twice that of ice at near the same temperature, and is again close to the 3&quot;R&quot; per mole of atoms of the Dulong–Petit theoretical maximum.

For a more modern and precise analysis of the heat capacities of solids, especially at low temperatures, it is useful to use the idea of phonons. See Debye model.

===Theoretical estimation===
The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number &gt; iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3R = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms (Dulong–Petit law, R is the gas constant). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic Einstein temperatures or Debye temperatures can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below.
*Water (liquid): CP = 4185.5 J⋅K−1⋅kg−1 (15 °C, 101.325 kPa)
*Water (liquid): CVH = 74.539 J⋅K−1⋅mol−1 (25 °C)
For liquids and gases, it is important to know the pressure to which given heat capacity data refer. Most published data are given for standard pressure. However, different standard conditions for temperature and pressure have been defined by different organizations. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) changed its recommendation from one atmosphere to the round value 100 kPa (≈750.062 Torr).

=== Relation between heat capacities ===

Measuring the specific heat capacity at constant volume can be prohibitively difficult for liquids and solids. That is, small temperature changes typically require large pressures to maintain a liquid or solid at constant volume, implying that the containing vessel must be nearly rigid or at least very strong (see coefficient of thermal expansion and compressibility). Instead, it is easier to measure the heat capacity at constant pressure (allowing the material to expand or contract freely) and solve for the heat capacity at constant volume using mathematical relationships derived from the basic thermodynamic laws.

The heat capacity ratio, or adiabatic index, is the ratio of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor.

==== Ideal gas ====
For an ideal gas, evaluating the partial derivatives above according to the equation of state, where &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant, for an ideal gas

formula_62

Substituting

formula_63

this equation reduces simply to Mayer&#x27;s relation:

formula_64

The differences in heat capacities as defined by the above Mayer relation is only exact for an ideal gas and would be different for any real gas.

=== Specific heat capacity ===
The specific heat capacity of a material on a per mass basis is

formula_65

which in the absence of phase transitions is equivalent to

formula_66

where
*formula_6 is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question,
*formula_43 is the mass of the body,
*formula_44 is the volume of the body,
*formula_45 is the density of the material.

For gases, and also for other materials under high pressures, there is need to distinguish between different boundary conditions for the processes under consideration (since values differ significantly between different conditions). Typical processes for which a heat capacity may be defined include isobaric (constant pressure, formula_71) or isochoric (constant volume, formula_72) processes. The corresponding specific heat capacities are expressed as

formula_73

From the results of the previous section, dividing through by the mass gives the relation

formula_74

A related parameter to formula_4 is formula_76, the volumetric heat capacity. In engineering practice, formula_2 for solids or liquids often signifies a volumetric heat capacity, rather than a constant-volume one. In such cases, the specific heat capacity is often explicitly written with the subscript formula_43, as formula_53. Of course, from the above relationships, for solids one writes

formula_80

For pure homogeneous chemical compounds with established molecular or molar mass, or a molar quantity, heat capacity as an intensive property can be expressed on a per-mole basis instead of a per-mass basis by the following equations analogous to the per mass equations:

formula_81

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of moles in the body or thermodynamic system. One may refer to such a per-mole quantity as molar heat capacity to distinguish it from specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis.

=== Polytropic heat capacity ===
The polytropic heat capacity is calculated at processes if all the thermodynamic properties (pressure, volume, temperature) change:

formula_82

The most important polytropic processes run between the adiabatic and the isotherm functions, the polytropic index is between 1 and the adiabatic exponent (&quot;γ&quot; or &quot;κ&quot;).

===Dimensionless heat capacity===
The dimensionless heat capacity of a material is

formula_83

where
*formula_6 is the heat capacity of a body made of the material in question (J/K),
*&quot;n&quot; is the amount of substance in the body (mol),
*&quot;R&quot; is the gas constant (J/(K⋅mol)),
*&quot;N&quot; is the number of molecules in the body (dimensionless),
*&quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant (J/(K⋅molecule)).

In the ideal gas article, dimensionless heat capacity formula_85 is expressed as formula_86 and is related there directly to half the number of degrees of freedom per particle. This holds true for quadratic degrees of freedom, a consequence of the equipartition theorem.

More generally, the dimensionless heat capacity relates the logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the dimensionless entropy per particle formula_87, measured in nats.

formula_88

Alternatively, using base-2 logarithms, formula_85 relates the base-2 logarithmic increase in temperature to the increase in the dimensionless entropy measured in bits.

=== Heat capacity at absolute zero ===
From the definition of entropy

formula_90

the absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero to the final temperature &quot;T&quot;f:

formula_91

==Thermodynamic derivation==
In theory, the specific heat capacity of a substance can also be derived from its abstract thermodynamic modeling by an equation of state and an internal energy function.

===State of matter in a homogeneous sample===
To apply the theory, one considers the sample of the substance (solid, liquid, or gas) for which the specific heat capacity can be defined; in particular, that it has homogeneous composition and fixed mass formula_7. Assume that the evolution of the system is always slow enough for the internal pressure formula_93 and temperature formula_11 be considered uniform throughout. The pressure formula_93 would be equal to the pressure applied to it by the enclosure or some surrounding fluid, such as air.

The state of the material can then be specified by three parameters: its temperature formula_11, the pressure formula_93, and its specific volume formula_98, where formula_44 is the volume of the sample. (This quantity is the reciprocal formula_100 of the material&#x27;s density formula_101.) Like formula_11 and formula_93, the specific volume formula_104 is an intensive property of the material and its state, that does not depend on the amount of substance in the sample.

Those variables are not independent. The allowed states are defined by an equation of state relating those three variables: formula_105 The function formula_106 depends on the material under consideration. The specific internal energy stored internally in the sample, per unit of mass, will then be another function formula_107 of these state variables, that is also specific of the material. The total internal energy in the sample then will be formula_108.

For some simple materials, like an ideal gas, one can derive from basic theory the equation of state formula_109 and even the specific internal energy formula_110 In general, these functions must be determined experimentally for each substance.

===Conservation of energy===
The absolute value of this quantity is undefined, and (for the purposes of thermodynamics) the state of &quot;zero internal energy&quot; can be chosen arbitrarily. However, by the law of conservation of energy, any infinitesimal increase formula_111 in the total internal energy formula_112 must be matched by the net flow of heat energy formula_113 into the sample, plus any net mechanical energy provided to it by enclosure or surrounding medium on it. The latter is formula_114, where formula_115 is the change in the sample&#x27;s volume in that infinitesimal step. Therefore

formula_116

hence

formula_117

If the volume of the sample (hence the specific volume of the material) is kept constant during the injection of the heat amount formula_113, then the term formula_119 is zero (no mechanical work is done). Then, dividing by formula_10,

formula_121

where formula_122 is the change in temperature that resulted from the heat input. The left-hand side is the specific heat capacity at constant volume formula_2 of the material.

For the heat capacity at constant pressure, it is useful to define the specific enthalpy of the system as the sum formula_124. An infinitesimal change in the specific enthalpy will then be

formula_125

therefore

formula_126

If the pressure is kept constant, the second term on the left-hand side is zero, and

formula_127

The left-hand side is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure formula_128 of the material.

===Connection to equation of state===
In general, the infinitesimal quantities formula_129 are constrained by the equation of state and the specific internal energy function. Namely,

formula_130

Here formula_131 denotes the (partial) derivative of the state equation formula_106 with respect to its formula_11 argument, keeping the other two arguments fixed, evaluated at the state formula_134 in question. The other partial derivatives are defined in the same way. These two equations on the four infinitesimal increments normally constrain them to a two-dimensional linear subspace space of possible infinitesimal state changes, that depends on the material and on the state. The constant-volume and constant-pressure changes are only two particular directions in this space.

This analysis also holds no matter how the energy increment formula_113 is injected into the sample, namely by heat conduction, irradiation, electromagnetic induction, radioactive decay, etc.

===Relation between heat capacities===
For any specific volume formula_104, denote formula_137 the function that describes how the pressure varies with the temperature formula_11, as allowed by the equation of state, when the specific volume of the material is forcefully kept constant at formula_104. Analogously, for any pressure formula_93, let formula_141 be the function that describes how the specific volume varies with the temperature, when the pressure is kept constant at formula_93. Namely, those functions are such that

formula_143andformula_144

for any values of formula_145. In other words, the graphs of formula_137 and formula_141 are slices of the surface defined by the state equation, cut by planes of constant formula_104 and constant formula_93, respectively.

Then, from the fundamental thermodynamic relation it follows that

formula_150

This equation can be rewritten as

formula_151

where
*formula_152 is the coefficient of thermal expansion,
*formula_153 is the isothermal compressibility,
both depending on the state formula_154.

The heat capacity ratio, or adiabatic index, is the ratio formula_155 of the heat capacity at constant pressure to heat capacity at constant volume. It is sometimes also known as the isentropic expansion factor.
=== Calculation from first principles ===
The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of heat capacity, based on quantum dynamical principles. However, good approximations can be made for gases in many states using simpler methods outlined below. For many solids composed of relatively heavy atoms (atomic number &gt; iron), at non-cryogenic temperatures, the heat capacity at room temperature approaches 3&quot;R&quot; = 24.94 joules per kelvin per mole of atoms (Dulong–Petit law, &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant). Low temperature approximations for both gases and solids at temperatures less than their characteristic Einstein temperatures or Debye temperatures can be made by the methods of Einstein and Debye discussed below. However, attention should be made for the consistency of such ab-initio considerations when used along with an equation of state for the considered material.

==== Ideal gas ====
For an ideal gas, evaluating the partial derivatives above according to the equation of state, where &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant, for an ideal gas

formula_156

Substituting

formula_63

this equation reduces simply to Mayer&#x27;s relation:

formula_64

The differences in heat capacities as defined by the above Mayer relation is only exact for an ideal gas and would be different for any real gas.

<doc id="28422" wikidata="Q13672" url="?curid=28422" title="Slingshot">
<text>A slingshot or catapult is a small hand-powered projectile weapon. The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame, with two tubes or strips made from either a natural rubber or synthetic elastic material. These are attached to the upper two ends. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pouch that holds the projectile. One hand holds the frame, while the other hand grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectile—up to a full span of the arms with sufficiently long bands.

Other names include catapult (United Kingdom), peashooter (United States), gulel (India),  (South Africa), or ging, shanghai, pachoonga (Australia and New Zealand)

==Use and history==
Slingshots depend on strong elastic materials for their projectile firepower, typically vulcanized natural rubber or the equivalent such as silicone rubber tubing, and thus date no earlier than the invention of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear in 1839 (patented in 1844). By 1860, this &quot;new engine&quot; had established a reputation for use by juveniles in vandalism. For much of their early history, slingshots were a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; item, typically made from a forked branch to form the Y-shaped handle, with rubber strips sliced from items such as inner tubes or other sources of good vulcanized rubber, and using suitably sized stones.

While early slingshots were most associated with young vandals, they could be effective hunting arms in the hands of a skilled user. Firing projectiles, such as lead musket balls, buckshot, steel ball bearings, air gun pellets, or small nails, a slingshot was capable of taking game such as quail, pheasant, rabbit, dove, and squirrel. Placing multiple balls in the pouch produces a shotgun effect (even though not very accurate), such as firing a dozen BBs at a time for hunting small birds. With the addition of a suitable rest, the slingshot can also be used to shoot arrows, allowing the hunting of medium-sized game at short ranges.

While commercially made slingshots date from at latest 1918, with the introduction of the Zip-Zip, a cast iron model, it was not until the post–World War II years that slingshots saw a surge in popularity, and legitimacy. They were still primarily home-built; a 1946 &quot;Popular Science&quot; article details a slingshot builder and hunter using home-built slingshots made from forked dogwood sticks to take small game at ranges of up to with No. 0 lead buckshot ( diameter).

The Wham-O company, founded in 1948, produced the Wham-O slingshot. It was made of ash wood and used flat rubber bands. The Wham-O was suitable for hunting, with a draw weight of up to , and was available with an arrow rest.

The National Slingshot Association was founded in the 1940s, headquartered in San Marino, California. It organised slingshot clubs and competitions nationwide. Despite the slingshot&#x27;s reputation as a tool of juvenile delinquents, the NSA reported that 80% of slingshot sales were to men over 30 years old, many of them professionals. John Milligan, a part-time manufacturer of the aluminium-framed John Milligan Special, a hunting slingshot, reported that about a third of his customers were physicians.

Slingshots are also occasionally used in angling to disperse bait over an area of water, so that fish may be attracted.

A home-made derivative of a slingshot also exists, consisting of a rubber balloon cut in half and tied to a tubular object such as the neck of a plastic bottle, or a small pipe. The projectile is inserted through the tube and into the cut balloon, and the user stretches the balloon to launch the projectile. These so-called &quot;balloon guns&quot; are sometimes made as a substitute to ordinary slingshot, and are often used to create the &quot;shotgun&quot; effect with several projectiles fired at once.

In modern times the slingshot has been used by civilians against governments. Examples of this are Hong Kong during the 2019-2020 protests where they were used against the Hong Kong Police Force, by the Palestinians against Israeli forces. and by the Ukrainians during the Maidan Revolution in 2014.

==Military use==
Slingshots have been used as military weapons, but primarily by guerrilla forces due to the easily available resources and technology required to construct one. Such guerrilla groups included the Irish Republican Army; prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Saddam Hussein released a propaganda video demonstrating slingshots as a possible insurgency weapon for use against invading forces.

Slingshots have also been used by the military to launch unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Two crew members form the fork, with an elastic cord stretched between them to provide power to launch the small aircraft.

On the Battle of Marawi, the soldiers of the Philippine Army&#x27;s elite Scout Rangers were observed using slingshots with grenades as an improvised mortar to attack Maute and Abu Sayyaf forces.

== Sport ==
Slingshots, often recognized as tools or toys, are also utilized in various organized sports around the world. Competitive slingshot shooting, or catapult shooting, is gaining popularity, with events held in countries like Spain, Italy, and China. The Slingshot World Cup is one of the most prestigious competitions, attracting participants globally who demonstrate their accuracy and skill by aiming at various targets.

Competitions and Events

* Slingshot World Cup: This premier event draws competitors from across the globe, focusing on target shooting to earn points based on accuracy.

* National Championships: Many nations, including the USA, Spain, and Italy, host their own national championships, featuring various categories and age groups.

Types of Competitions

* Target Shooting: Participants aim at stationary or moving targets, which can vary in size and distance.

* Field Shooting: This involves shooting at targets set in natural environments, simulating real hunting scenarios.

Equipment

* Slingshots: Modern slingshots are crafted from high-quality materials such as aluminum and steel. Shooters often customize their equipment with different bands and pouches to match their preferences.

* Ammunition: Common types of ammunition include steel balls, marbles, and biodegradable pellets, which cater to eco-friendly practices.

Skills and Techniques

* Accuracy: Precision is paramount in slingshot sports, and participants dedicate time to improve their aim and consistency.

* Stance and Grip: Proper stance and grip are essential for stability and control, leading many shooters to develop unique styles.

Community and Culture

* Clubs and Associations: Numerous slingshot clubs and associations exist worldwide, providing enthusiasts with opportunities to share tips, participate in events, and promote the sport.

* Online Presence: The slingshot community is active online, with forums, social media groups, and YouTube channels dedicated to techniques, reviews, and competition highlights.

Overall, slingshot sports blend tradition with modernity, making them an engaging and accessible activity for people of all ages.

==Dangers==
One of the dangers inherent in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the fork end, however, send the band back towards the shooter&#x27;s face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. One method to minimize the chance of a fork end failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the fork end. Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter&#x27;s face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy &quot;Natural&quot; line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure. Another big danger is the fork breakage; some commercial slingshots made from cheap zinc alloy may break and severely injure shooters&#x27; eyes and face.

==Legal issues==
Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of arm-braced slingshots. For example, New York Penal law 265.01 defines it as a Class-4 misdemeanor, and in some states of Australia they are also a prohibited weapon.

<text>Starship Troopers is a military science fiction novel by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. Written in a few weeks in reaction to the US suspending nuclear tests, the story was first published as a two-part serial in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; as Starship Soldier, and published as a book by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons on November 5, 1959.

The story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government called the Terran Federation, dominated by a military elite. Under the Terran Federation, only veterans of Federal Service (including, but not limited to, military service) enjoy full citizenship, such as the right to vote. The first-person narrative follows Juan &quot;Johnny&quot; Rico, a young man of Filipino descent, through his military service in the Mobile Infantry. He progresses from recruit to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as &quot;Arachnids&quot; or &quot;Bugs&quot;. Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of suffrage, civic virtue, juvenile delinquency, and war; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein&#x27;s own political views. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has been identified with a tradition of militarism in US science fiction, and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the Cold War. A coming-of-age novel, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; also criticizes the US society of the 1950s, arguing that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and advocates corporal and capital punishment.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; brought to an end Heinlein&#x27;s series of juvenile novels. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and was praised by reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book&#x27;s intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The novel&#x27;s militarism, and the fact that government servicemost often military servicewas a prerequisite to the right to vote in the novel&#x27;s fictional society, led to it being frequently described as fascist. Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein&#x27;s depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers have said that the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.

Despite the controversy, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. Ken MacLeod stated that &quot;the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein&quot;. Science fiction critic Darko Suvin wrote that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is the &quot;ancestral text of US science fiction militarism&quot; and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years. The novel has been credited with popularizing the idea of powered armor, which has since become a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research. Heinlein&#x27;s depiction of a futuristic military was also influential. Later science fiction books, such as Joe Haldeman&#x27;s 1974 anti-war novel &quot;The Forever War&quot;, have been described as reactions to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. The story has been adapted several times, including in a 1997 film version directed by Paul Verhoeven with screenplay by Edward Neumeier that sought to satirize what the director saw as the fascist aspects of the novel.

==Writing and publication==
Robert Heinlein was among the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s, along with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke; they were known as the &quot;big three&quot; that dominated US science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War era in his writing. Heinlein served in the US Navy for five years after graduating from the United States Naval Academy in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction. At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and wrote &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. His motivation arose partially from his anger at US President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to suspend US nuclear tests, and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward. Writing in his 1980 volume &quot;Expanded Universe&quot;, Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of nuclear weapons testing by the United States sparked his desire to write &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Heinlein and his wife Virginia created the &quot;Patrick Henry League&quot; in an attempt to create support for the US nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.

Like many of Heinlein&#x27;s books, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by that publisher. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with that publisher completely, and to resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner&#x27;s rejection was based on ideological objections to the content of the novel, particularly in its treatment of military conflict.

&quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; first published &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in October and November 1959 as a two-part serial titled &quot;Starship Soldier&quot;. A senior editor at Putnam&#x27;s, Peter Israel, purchased the manuscript and approved revisions that made it more marketable to adults. Asked whether it was aimed at children or adults, he said at a sales conference &quot;Let&#x27;s let the readers decide who likes it.&quot; The novel was eventually published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons.

==Setting==
Set approximately 700 years in the future, the book depicts an Earth ruled by a world government run by military veterans. The society is depicted as affluent, and futuristic technology shown as coexisting with educational methods from the 20th century. The rights of a full citizen, to vote and hold public office, are not universally guaranteed, and rather must be earned through Federal Service. Those who do not perform this service (of which only military service has been described) retain the rights of free speech and assembly, but can neither vote nor hold public office. Those of either sex, above the age of 18, are permitted to enlist; only those who complete their service receive the right to vote. Important government jobs are reserved for federal service veterans. This structure arose &quot;ad hoc&quot; after the collapse of the &quot;20th century Western democracies&quot;, driven in part by an inability to control crime and juvenile delinquency, particularly in North America, and a war between an alliance of the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia, against the &quot;Chinese Hegemony&quot;.

Two extraterrestrial civilizations are depicted, respectively, as the &quot;Pseudo-Arachnids&quot; (or &quot;Bugs&quot;), and the &quot;Skinnies&quot;. The &quot;Bugs&quot; are described as communal beings originating from the planet of Klendathu, and consist of multiple castes; workers, warriors, brains, and queens, similar to those of ants and termites on Earth. The warriors are the only ones who fight, and are unable to surrender in battle. It also is implied that the Bugs are technologically advanced, possessing such technologies as spaceships. The &quot;Skinnies&quot; are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids, yet more so than humans. The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At the opening of the story, Earth is not at war, yet such a declaration has come when Rico has completed his training. The &quot;Skinnies&quot; are initially allies of the Pseudo-Arachnids, but switch to alliance with humans, midway through the novel. Faster-than-light travel exists in this future: spacecraft use the &quot;Cherenkov drive&quot;, and can travel &quot;Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks&quot;.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is narrated by the main protagonist Juan &quot;Johnny&quot; Rico, a member of the &quot;Mobile Infantry&quot;. It is one of the few Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear narrative structure with a series of flashbacks. These flashbacks are frequently to Rico&#x27;s &quot;History and Moral Philosophy&quot; course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society. Rico is depicted as a man of Filipino ancestry. He is from a wealthy family, whose members had never served in the military. Rico&#x27;s ancestry is depicted as inconsequential, society having finally abandoned racial and gender-based prejudice.

==Plot==
The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette transport &quot;Rodger Young&quot; (named after real life Medal of Honor recipient Rodger Wilton Young), serving with the platoon known as &quot;Rasczak&#x27;s Roughnecks&quot;. The platoon carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies. The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One of them, Dizzy Flores, is rescued by Rico but dies while returning to orbit. The narrative then flashes back to Rico&#x27;s graduation from high school. Rico and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father&#x27;s attitude towards the military. Rico makes his decision after discovering that his classmate Carmen Ibañez also intends to enlist.

Rico&#x27;s choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a sense of estrangement. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to general in World War I) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialed, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without ensuring that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Disheartened, Rico thinks of resigning when he receives a letter from Jean Dubois, who taught Rico History and Moral Philosophy. Dubois reveals that he was once a lieutenant colonel in the Mobile Infantry, which gives Rico the motivation not to resign. After further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2,009 who had begun training in that regiment.

The &quot;Bug War&quot; has changed from minor incidents to a full-scale war during Rico&#x27;s training. An Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires alerts civilians to the situation; Rico&#x27;s mother is killed in the attack. Rico participates in the Battle of Klendathu, an attack on the Arachnid&#x27;s home world, which turns into a disastrous defeat for the Terran Federation. Rico&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Valley Forge&quot;, is destroyed, and his unit is decimated; he is reassigned to the Roughnecks on board the &quot;Rodger Young,&quot; led by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal. The unit carries out several raids, and Rico is promoted to corporal by Jelal after Rasczak dies in combat.

One of his comrades in the Roughnecks suggests that Rico go to officer training school and try to become an officer. Rico ends up going to see Jelal, and finds that Jelal already had the paperwork ready. Rico enters Officer Candidate School for a second course of training, including further courses in &quot;History and Moral Philosophy&quot;. En route from the Roughnecks to the school Rico encounters his father who has also enlisted and is now a corporal, and the two reconcile. He is also visited in school by Carmen, now an ensign and ship&#x27;s pilot officer in the Navy, and the two discuss their friend Carl, who had been killed earlier in the war.

Rico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit. Under the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, his boot camp drill instructor Fleet Sergeant Zim, Rico commands a platoon during &quot;Operation Royalty,&quot; a raid to capture members of the Arachnid brain caste and queens. Rico then returns to the officer school to graduate.

The novel ends with him holding the rank of second lieutenant, in command of his old platoon in the &quot;Rodger Young&quot;, with his father as his platoon sergeant. The platoon has been renamed &quot;Rico&#x27;s Roughnecks&quot;, and is about to participate in an attack on Klendathu.

==Themes==
Commentators have written that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is not driven by its plot, though it contains scenes of military combat. Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas. In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an &quot;ideologically intense&quot; book. A 1997 review in &quot;Salon&quot; categorized it as a &quot;philosophical novel&quot;. Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein&#x27;s own political views. Some contend that the novel maintains a sense of irony that allows readers to draw their own conclusions; others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein&#x27;s militaristic philosophy.

===Militarism===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has been identified as being a part of a tradition in US science fiction that assumes that violent conflict and the militarization of society are inevitable and necessary. Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it is the heart of the army and the most honorable unit in it. In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; &quot;glorifies the military... Specifically the P.B.I., the Poor Bloody Infantry, the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war&#x27;s desolationbut is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored.&quot; The story is based on the social Darwinist idea of society as a struggle for survival based on military strength. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence can be an effective method of settling conflict. These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein&#x27;s view that in the 1950s the US government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.

Heinlein draws an analogy between the human society in the novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be vigilant against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and US society of the 1950s. Reviewers have suggested that the Arachnids are Heinlein&#x27;s analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, patriotism, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of US popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein&#x27;s portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to 1950s communist countries, aims to &quot;reinscribe the ideologies of America&#x27;s mythic frontier history&quot;. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.

===Coming of age===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has been referred to as a bildungsroman or &quot;coming-of-age&quot; story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the value of militarism, thus inviting the reader to learn it as well. This is especially true of the parts of his training that involve indoctrination, such as the claim by one of his instructors that rule by military veterans is the ideal form of government, because only they understand how to put collective well-being above the individual. The story traces Rico&#x27;s transformation from a boy into a soldier, while exploring issues of identity and motivation, and traces his overall moral and social development, in a manner identified by commentators as similar to many stories about German soldiers in World War I. Rico&#x27;s transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar H. Bruce Franklin. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is &quot;calculated sadism&quot; but is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side. The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico &quot;crossing the hump&quot; with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development. The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico&#x27;s adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that &quot;moral sense&quot; derives entirely from the will to survive. The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein&#x27;s novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile &quot;wilderness&quot; in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein&#x27;s earlier works as well. Rico&#x27;s coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey &quot;outward&quot; through the novel also contains a search for Rico&#x27;s childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.

===Moral decline===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; also critiques US society of the 1950s, suggesting that it led young people to be spoiled and undisciplined. These beliefs are expressed through the classroom lectures of Dubois, Rico&#x27;s teacher for History and Moral Philosophy. Dubois praises flogging and other types of corporal punishment as a means of addressing juvenile crimes. It has been suggested that Heinlein endorsed this view, although the fact that Dubois also compares raising children to training a puppy has been used to argue that Heinlein was making use of irony. The story is strongly in favor of corporal punishment and capital punishment, as a means of correcting juvenile delinquents, part of a trend in science fiction which examines technology and outer space in an innovative manner, but is reactionary with respect to human relationships. As with other books by Heinlein, traditional schools are denigrated, while learning &quot;on the spot&quot; is extolled: Rico is able to master the things required of him in military training without undue difficulty.

Dubois also ridicules the idea of inalienable rights, such as &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;, arguing that people have only the rights that they are willing to fight and die for to protect. The novel appeals to scientific authority to justify this position; Dubois repeatedly states that his argument is mathematically demonstrable, statements which have led scholars to label the novel &quot;hard science fiction&quot;, despite its social and political themes. The &quot;moral decline&quot; caused by this situation is depicted as having caused a global war between an alliance of the US, Britain, and Russia against the &quot;Chinese Hegemony&quot; in the year 1987. Despite the alliance between the US and Russia, this war has been described as demonstrating Heinlein&#x27;s anti-communist beliefs, which saw &quot;swarming hordes&quot; of Chinese as a bigger threat. The novel draws some comparisons between the Chinese and the Arachnids, and suggests that the lessons of one war could be applied to the other.

==Reception==
To Heinlein&#x27;s surprise, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960. It has been acknowledged as one of the best-known and most influential works of science fiction. The novel is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review as one of the ten best genre books of 1959, in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s, and as the best-known example of military science fiction. The novel has been described as marking Heinlein&#x27;s transition from writing juvenile fiction to a &quot;more mature phase&quot; as an author. Reviewing the book with others written for children, Floyd C. Gale of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; wrote in 1960 that &quot;Heinlein has penned a juvenile that &quot;really&quot; is not. This is a new and bitter and disillusioned Heinlein&quot;. Rating it 2.5 stars out of five for children, 4.5 stars for adults, and &quot;?&quot; for civilians, he believed that the novel would be &quot;of exceptional interest to veterans with battle experience... but youngsters will find it melancholy and verbose&quot;. Conversely, Michael Moorcock described it as Heinlein&#x27;s last &quot;straight&quot; science fiction, before he turned to more serious writing such as &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;.

By 1980, twenty years after its release, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; had been translated into eleven languages and was still selling strongly. Heinlein nevertheless complained that, despite this success, almost all the mail he received about it was negative and he only heard about it &quot;when someone wants to chew me out&quot;. The novel is highly contentious. Controversy surrounded its praise of the military and approval of violence, to the extent that it has frequently been described as fascist, and its implication that militarism is superior to traditional democracy. Heinlein&#x27;s peers were among those who argued over the book; a comparison between a quote in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; that &quot;the noblest fate that a man can endure is to place his own mortal body between his loved home and war&#x27;s desolation&quot; and the anti-war poem &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot; by Wilfred Owen began a two-year discussion in the &quot;Proceedings of the Institute for Twenty-First Century Studies&quot; from 1959 to 1961, with James Blish, Poul Anderson, Philip José Farmer, Anthony Boucher, John Brunner, Brian Aldiss, among those debating &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;″s quality of writing, philosophy, and morality.

The writing in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has received varied responses, with the scenes of military training and combat receiving praise. In a 2009 retrospective, science-fiction writer Jo Walton wrote that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was &quot;military SF done extremely well&quot;. She went on to argue that &quot;Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [tell the story] &#x27;backwards and in high heels&#x27; and get away with it.&quot; Others referred to it as very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein&#x27;s descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; praised the &quot;brilliantly written&quot; passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;undiminished talent for invention&quot;. Scholar George Slusser described the book in 1986 as the &quot;ultimately convincing space-war epic&quot;, praising in particular the &quot;precisely imagined&quot; weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the &quot;slickest&quot; of Heinlein&#x27;s juvenile books.

Criticism of the style of the book has centered on its political aspects. Heinlein&#x27;s discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as &quot;didactic&quot;, and the novel was derided for &quot;exposition [that was] inserted in large indigestible chunks&quot;. Author Ken MacLeod&#x27;s 2003 analysis of the political nature of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; stated that it was &quot;a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training far outweigh the thin and tensionless combat scenes&quot;. Scientist and author Brunner compared it to a &quot;Victorian children&#x27;s book&quot;, while the &quot;Science Fiction Handbook&quot; published in 2009 said that the novel provided &quot;compelling images of a futuristic military&quot; and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Boucher, founder of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had &quot;forgotten to insert a story&quot;. A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein&#x27;s vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem &quot;vibrantly appealing&quot;.

===Criticism of militarism===
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is generally considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a &quot;bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification&quot; of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it &quot;a book-length recruiting poster&quot;. In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it &quot;purports to show the life of a typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us.&quot; Panshin stated that there was no &quot;sustained human conflict&quot; in the book: instead, &quot;All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble.&quot; Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, &quot;Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do.&quot; Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as &quot;wrong-headed and retrogressive&quot;, argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete &quot;technological subjugation of nature&quot;, of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.

A 1997 review of the film in &quot;Salon&quot; stated that the novel could almost be described as propaganda, and was terrifying as a result, particularly in its belief that the boot camp had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This was described as a highly unusual utopian vision. Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: &quot;wars are inevitable, [and] that the army is always right&quot;. In discussing the book&#x27;s utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an &quot;unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature&quot;. In the words of science fiction scholar Darko Suvin, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; was an &quot;unsubtle but powerful black-and-white paean to combat life&quot;, and an example of agitprop in favor of military values.

Other writers defended Heinlein. George Price argued that &quot;[Heinlein] implies, first, that war is something endured, not enjoyed, and second, that war is so unpleasant, so desolate, that it must at all costs be kept away from one&#x27;s home.&quot; Poul Anderson also defended some of the novel&#x27;s positions, arguing &quot;Heinlein has recognized the problem of selective versus nonselective franchise, and his proposed solution does merit discussion.&quot; Complaints were made against Heinlein for the lack of conscription in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. When he wrote the novel, the military draft was still in effect in the US.

===Allegations of fascism===

The society within the book has frequently been described as fascist. According to the 2009 &quot;Science Fiction Handbook&quot;, it had the effect of giving Heinlein a reputation as a &quot;fanatical warmongering fascist&quot;. Scholar Jeffrey Cass has referred to the setting of the book as &quot;unremittingly grim fascism&quot;. He has stated that the novel made an analogy between its military conflict and those of the US after World War II, and that it justified American imperialism in the name of fighting another form of imperialism. Jasper Goss has referred to it as &quot;crypto-fascist&quot;. Suvin compares Heinlein&#x27;s suggestion that &quot;all wars arise from population pressure&quot; to the Nazi concept of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; or &quot;living space&quot; for a superior society that was used to justify territorial expansion.

Some reviewers have suggested that Heinlein was simply discussing the merits of a selective versus a nonselective franchise. Heinlein made a similar claim, over two decades after &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;&#x27;s publication, in his &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; and further claimed that 95 percent of &quot;veterans&quot; were not military personnel but members of the civil service. Heinlein&#x27;s own description has been disputed, even among the book&#x27;s defenders. Heinlein scholar James Gifford has argued that a number of quotes within the novel suggest that the characters within the book assume that the Federal Service is largely military. For instance, when Rico tells his father that he is interested in Federal Service, his father immediately explains his belief that Federal Service is a bad idea because there is no war in progress, indicating that he sees Federal Service as military in nature. Gifford states that although Heinlein&#x27;s intentions may have been that Federal Service be 95 percent non-military, in relation to the actual contents of the book, Heinlein &quot;is wrong on this point. Flatly so.&quot;

Dennis Showalter, writing in 1975, defended &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, stating that the society depicted in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to Bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter&#x27;s argument is based on a literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein&#x27;s books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein&#x27;s militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein&#x27;s other popular books of the period, such as &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966). This period of Heinlein&#x27;s writing has received more critical attention than any other, although he continued to write into the 1980s.

===Apparent utopianism===
The setting of the book is presented by Heinlein as utopian; its leaders are shown as good and wise, and the population as free and prosperous. Slusser wrote in 1987 that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; depicts a world that is &quot;hell for human beings&quot;, but nonetheless celebrates the ideology of its fictional society. The rulers are claimed to be the best in history, because they understand that human nature is to fight for power through the use of force. The suggestion of utopia is not explored in depth, as the lives of those outside the military are not shown in any detail. The novel suggests that the militarist philosophy espoused by many of the characters has a mathematical backing, though reviewers have commented that Heinlein does not present any basis for this.

Writers such as Farmer, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and Michael Moorcock have criticized the novel for being a hypothetical utopia, in the sense that while Heinlein&#x27;s ideas sound plausible, they have never been put to the test. Moorcock wrote an essay entitled &quot;Starship Stormtroopers&quot; in which he attacked Heinlein and other writers over similar &quot;Utopian fiction&quot;. Lowndes accused Heinlein of using straw man arguments, &quot;countering ingenuous half-truths with brilliant half-truths&quot;. Lowndes further argued that the Terran Federation could never be as idealistic as Heinlein portrays it to be because he never properly addressed &quot;whether or not [non-citizens] have at least as full a measure of civil redress against official injustice as we have today&quot;. Farmer agreed, arguing that a &quot;world ruled by veterans would be as mismanaged, graft-ridden, and insane as one ruled by men who had never gotten near the odor of blood and guts&quot;.

===Race and gender===
Authors and commentators have stated that the manner in which the extraterrestrial beings are portrayed in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; has racist aspects, arguing that the nicknames &quot;Bugs&quot; and &quot;Skinnies&quot; carry racial overtones. John Brunner compared them to calling Koreans &quot;gooks&quot;. Slusser argued that the term &quot;Bugs&quot; was an &quot;abusive and biologically inaccurate&quot; word that justified the violence against alien beings, a tendency which, according to Slusser, the book shared with other commercially successful science fiction.

Some of Heinlein&#x27;s other works have also been described as racist, though Franklin argues that this was not unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the US government of the time. Heinlein&#x27;s early novel &quot;Sixth Column&quot; was called a &quot;racist paean&quot; to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the Yellow Peril. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; &quot;set the pattern for Heinlein&#x27;s more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic&quot; stories. Robert Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein&#x27;s belief that man is a wild animal. According to this theory, if man lacks a moral compass beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.

The fact that all pilots in the novel are women (in contrast to the infantry, which is entirely male) has been cited as evidence of progressive gender politics within the story, although the idea expressed by Rico that women are the motivation for men to fight in the military is a counter-example to this. A 1996 science fiction encyclopedia said that like much of Heinlein&#x27;s fiction, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; exemplified &quot;macho male culture&quot;. The prosthetically enhanced soldiers in the novel, all of whom are men, have been described as an example of the &quot;hyper-masculinity&quot; brought on by the proximity of these men to technology. The story portrays the Arachnids as so alien that the only response to them can be war. Feminist scholars have described this reaction as a &quot;conventionally masculinist&quot; one. Steffen Hantke has described the mechanized suits in the novel, which make the wearer resemble a &quot;steel gorilla,&quot; as defining masculinity as &quot;something intensely physical, based on animal power, instinct, and aggression&quot;. He calls this form of masculinity &quot;all body, so to speak, and no brain&quot;. Thus, in Hantke&#x27;s reading, &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; expresses fears of how masculinity may be preserved in an environment of high technology. This fear is exacerbated by the motifs of pregnancy and birth that Heinlein uses when describing how the soldiers in suits are dropped from spaceships piloted by women. Though Rico says he finds women &quot;marvelous&quot;, he shows no desire for sexual activity; the war seems to have subsumed sex in this respect. A 1979 summary argued that despite the gestures towards women&#x27;s equality, women in the story were still objects, to be protected, and to fight wars over.

==Influence==
Heinlein&#x27;s books, and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in particular, had an enormous impact on political science fiction, to the extent that author Ken MacLeod has stated that &quot;the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein,&quot; although many participants in this dialogue disagree with Heinlein. Science fiction critic Darko Suvin states that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is the &quot;ancestral text of US science fiction militarism&quot; and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.

In addition to his political views, Heinlein&#x27;s ideas about a futuristic military as depicted in the novel were deeply influential among films, books, and television shows in later years. Roger Beaumont has suggested that &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; may some day be considered a manual for extraterrestrial warfare. Suvin refers to Juan Rico as the &quot;archetypal Space Soldier&quot;. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; included concepts in military engineering which have since been widely used in other fiction, and which have occasionally been paralleled by scientific research. The novel has been cited as the source of the idea of powered armor exoskeletons, which Heinlein describes in great detail. Such suits became a staple of military science fiction. Franchises that have employed this technology include &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Exo Squad&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;District 9&quot;, &quot;Elysium&quot;, and &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;. During the shooting of the science fiction film &quot;Aliens&quot;, director James Cameron required the actors playing space marines to read &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; to understand their parts, and also cited it as an influence for the space drop, terms like &quot;bug hunt&quot;, and the cargo-loader exoskeleton.

&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; had a direct influence on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Armor&quot; was, according to the author, born out of frustration with the small amount of actual combat in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The &quot;Mobile Suits&quot; from the 1979 Nippon Sunrise anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; were inspired by the powered armor from &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. The 1988 Gainax OVA series &quot;Gunbuster&quot; has plot elements similar to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein&#x27;s influence in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; to Heinlein&#x27;s prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.

Conversely, Joe Haldeman&#x27;s 1974 anti-war, Hugo- and Nebula-winning science fiction novel &quot;The Forever War&quot; is popularly thought to be a direct reply to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, and though Haldeman has stated that it is actually a result of his personal experiences in the Vietnam War, he has admitted to being influenced by &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Haldeman said that he disagreed with &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; because it &quot;glorifies war&quot;, but added that &quot;it&#x27;s a very well-crafted novel, and I believe Heinlein was honest with it&quot;. &quot;The Forever War&quot; contains several parallels to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, including its setting. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein&#x27;s novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. &quot;The Forever War&quot; does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real world context of the Vietnam War. Haldeman received a letter from Heinlein, congratulating him on his Nebula Award, which &quot;meant more than the award itself&quot;. According to author Spider Robinson, Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book &quot;may be the best future war story I&#x27;ve ever read!&quot;

Harry Harrison&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&quot; has also been described as a reaction to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, while Gordon R. Dickson&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;Naked to the Stars&quot; has been called &quot;an obvious rejoinder&quot; to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. &quot;Ring of Swords&quot;, written by Eleanor Arnason in 1993, also depicts a war between two highly aggressive species, of which humans are one. The story deliberately inverts several aspects of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;: the story is told from the point of view of diplomats seeking to prevent war, rather than soldiers fighting it, and the conflict is the result of the two species being extremely similar, rather than different.

==Adaptations==
===1997 film===

The film rights to the novel were licensed in the 1990s, several years after Heinlein&#x27;s death. The project was originally entitled &quot;Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine&quot;, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven (who found the book too boring to finish), and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to sex. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, to undermine the political ideology of the novel. The mechanized suits that featured prominently in the novel were absent from the film, due to budget constraints.

The film utilized fascist imagery throughout, including portraying the Terran Federation&#x27;s personnel wearing uniforms strongly reminiscent of those worn by the SS, the Nazi paramilitary. Verhoeven stated in 1997 that the first scene of the filman advertisement for the Mobile Infantrywas adapted shot-for-shot from a scene in Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935), specifically an outdoor rally for the Reichsarbeitsdienst. Other references to Nazism include the Albert Speer-style architecture and the propagandistic dialogue (&quot;Violence is the supreme authority!&quot;). According to Verhoeven, the references to Nazism reflected his own experience in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II.

The film reignited the debate over the nature of the Terran society in Heinlein&#x27;s world, and several critics accused Verhoeven of creating a fascist universe. Others, and Verhoeven himself, have stated that the film was intended to be ironic, and to critique fascism. The film has also been described as criticizing the jingoism of US foreign policy, the military industrial complex, and the society in the film, which elevates violence over sensitivity. It received several negative critical reviews, reviewers suggesting that it was unsophisticated and targeted a juvenile audience, although some scholars and critics have also supported its description as satirical. The absence of the powered armor technology drew criticism from fans. The success of the film&#x27;s endeavor to critique the ideology of the novel has been disputed.

Four sequels, &quot;Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation&quot; (2004), &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot; (2008), &quot;Starship Troopers: Invasion&quot; (2012) and &quot;Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars&quot; (2017) were released as straight-to-DVD films. In December 2011, Neal H. Moritz, producer of films such as the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; series and &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, announced plans for a remake of the film that he claims will be more faithful to the source material. In 2016 Mark Swift and Damian Shannon were reported to be writing the film.

===Animated series===
An animated TV series was also released Based both on the novel and 1997 film called , it follows the exploits of the Mobile Infantry squad, &quot;Razak&#x27;s Roughnecks&quot;, during the SICON–Bugs War between a newly united humanity and an extraterrestrial race, known as the &quot;Bugs,&quot; also sometimes referred to as Arachnids. The show focuses mainly on the Roughnecks&#x27; missions, rather than addressing the larger war. Paul Verhoeven served as an executive producer. The show ran for one season from August 1999 to April 2000.

===Other media===

From October to December 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual produced a six-episode Japanese original video animation locally titled &quot;Uchū no Senshi&quot; with mobile infantry power armor designs by Kazutaka Miyatake, based on &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. Dark Horse Comics, Mongoose Publishing and Markosia hold the license to produce comic books based on &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, written by authors including Warren Ellis, Gordon Rennie and Tony Lee. Avalon Hill published &quot;Robert Heinlein&#x27;s Starship Troopers&quot; in 1976, a map-and-counter board wargame featuring a number of scenarios as written in the novel. In 1998, Mythic Entertainment released &quot;Starship Troopers: Battlespace&quot;. The web-based interactive game, in which players battled each other in overhead space combat, allowed players to assume either Klendathu or Federation roles, was developed alongside the film adaptation. &quot;Starship Troopers: The Miniatures Game&quot; was released by Mongoose Publishing in 2005, a miniature wargame which used material from the novel, film, and animated TV series. Spectre Media released &quot;Starship Troopers: Invasion Mobile Infantry&quot;, a game for PCs, in 2012. Offworld Industries developed and published the 2023 game &quot;Starship Troopers: Extermination&quot;, a cooperative multiplayer FPS available for PC.

<text>A telephone switchboard is a device used to connect circuits of telephones to establish telephone calls between users or other switchboards. The switchboard is an essential component of a manual telephone exchange, and is operated by switchboard operators who use electrical cords or switches to establish the connections.

The switchboard saw the peak of its use in the 20th century before wider adoption of the electromechanical automatic telephone exchange. The automatic exchange, invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, has replaced most switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world.

Nevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into the second half of the 20th century in many enterprises. Some establishments, such as the White House, still operate a switchboard.

Electronic devices and computer technology have given exchange operators more features. For example, a private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console, or an auto-attendant function, which bypasses the operator.

==History==

Following the invention of the telephone in 1876, the first telephones were rented in pairs which were limited to conversation between the parties operating those two instruments. The use of a central exchange was soon found to be even more advantageous than in telegraphy.

In May 1877, the Holmes Burglar Alarm Company in Boston, Massachusetts, established by Edwin T. Holmes, installed the first central office and switchboard that served both as a security service at night for banks and businesses, as well as a telephone system. The switchboard operated telephone instruments manufactured by Charles Williams, a licensee of the Alexander Graham Bell company.

In January 1878 the Boston Telephone Dispatch company had started hiring boys as telephone operators. Boys had been very successful as telegraphy operators, but their attitude, lack of patience, and behavior was unacceptable for live telephone contact, so the company began hiring women operators instead. Thus, on September 1, 1878, Boston Telephone Dispatch hired Emma Nutt as the first woman operator. Small towns typically had the switchboard installed in the operator&#x27;s home so that he or she could answer calls on a 24-hour basis. In 1894, New England Telephone and Telegraph Company installed the first battery-operated switchboard on January 9 in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Early switchboards in large cities usually were mounted floor to ceiling in order to allow the operators to reach all the lines in the exchange. The operators were boys who would use a ladder to connect to the higher jacks. Late in the 1890s this measure failed to keep up with the increasing number of lines, and Milo G. Kellogg devised the Divided Multiple Switchboard for operators to work together, with a team on the &quot;A board&quot; and another on the &quot;B&quot;. These operators were almost always women until the early 1970s, when men were once again hired. Cord switchboards were often referred to as &quot;cordboards&quot; by telephone company personnel. Conversion to panel switch and other automated switching systems first eliminated the &quot;B&quot; operator and then, usually years later, the &quot;A&quot;. Rural and suburban switchboards for the most part remained small and simple. In many cases, customers knew their operator by name.

As telephone exchanges converted to automatic (dial) service, switchboards continued to serve specialized purposes. Before the advent of direct-dialed long-distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a toll call. In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.

The long-distance operator would record the name and city of the person to be called, and the operator would advise the calling party to hang up and wait for the call to be completed. Each toll center had only a limited number of trunks to distant cities, and if those circuits were busy, the operator would try alternate routings through intermediate cities. The operator would plug into a trunk for the destination city, and the inward operator would answer. The inward operator would obtain the number from the local information operator and ring the call. Once the called party answered, the originating operator would advise him or her to stand by for the calling party, whom she&#x27;d then ring back, and record the starting time once the conversation began.

In the 1940s, with the advent of dial pulse and multi-frequency operator dialing, the operator would plug into a tandem trunk and dial the NPA (area code) and operator code for the information operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.

In the 1960s, once most phone subscribers had direct long-distance dialing, a single type of operator began to serve both the local and long-distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from coin phones required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate &quot;all circuits busy,&quot; or a problem in the destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line to see if it was busy or out of order.

Cord switchboards used for these purposes were replaced in the 1970s and 1980s by Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) and similar systems, which greatly reduced operator involvement in calls. The customer would, instead of simply dialing &quot;0&quot; for the operator, dial 1+NPA+7digits, after which an operator would answer and provide the desired service (coin collection, obtaining acceptance on a collect call, etc.), and then release the call to be automatically handled by the TSPS.

Before the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was common for many smaller cities to have their own operators. An NPA (area code) would usually have its largest city as its primary toll center, with smaller toll centers serving the secondary cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber.

In the mid-1980s the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) opened their own Operator Services offices with a system called TOPS (Traffic Operator Position System) to act as local and intraLATA telephone operators. With this the BOCs took intraLATA call traffic from AT&amp;T as well as services which were once provided on a cordboard (Toll Stations, Mobile and Marine [Ship-to-Shore]). Operators from AT&amp;T returned to work for the BOC as the intraLATA traffic was cut to the BOC.

In the early 1990s AT&amp;T replaced TSPS with OSPS (Operator Service Position System). The OSPS position was a computer terminal which the AT&amp;T operator entered billing information. With the advent of OSPS a feature called Interflow allowed operators on a system to answer calls from anywhere within their region.

As technology changed, so did the application of Interflow. Interflow was implemented nationwide by AT&amp;T. This allowed AT&amp;T to close virtually every operator office throughout the US. the only AT&amp;T operator offices remaining were located in Houston, Texas, and Jacksonville, Florida.

==Operation==
The switchboard is usually designed to accommodate the operator, who sits facing it. It has a high back panel, which consists of rows of female jacks, each jack designated and wired as a local extension of the switchboard (which serves an individual subscriber) or as an incoming or outgoing trunk line. The jack is also associated with a lamp.

On the table or desk area in front of the operator are columns of 3-position toggle switches termed &quot;keys&quot;, lamps, and cords. Each column consists of a front key and a rear key, a front lamp and a rear lamp, followed by a front cord and a rear cord, making up together a cord circuit. The front key is the &quot;talk&quot; key allowing the operator to speak with that particular cord pair. The rear key on older &quot;manual&quot; boards and PBXs is used to ring a telephone physically. On newer boards, the back key is used to collect (retrieve) money from coin telephones. Each of the keys has three positions: back, normal and forward. When a key is in the normal position an electrical talk path connects the front and rear cords. A key in the forward position (front key) connects the operator to the cord pair, and a key in the back position sends a ring signal out on the cord (on older manual exchanges). Each cord has a three-wire TRS phone connector: tip and ring for testing, ringing and voice; and a sleeve wire for busy signals.

When a call is received, a jack lamp lights on the back panel and the operator responds by placing the rear cord into the corresponding jack and throwing the front key forward. The operator then converses with the caller, who informs the operator to whom he or she would like to speak. If it is another extension, the operator places the front cord in the associated jack and pulls the front key backwards to ring the called party. After connecting, the operator leaves both cords &quot;up&quot; with the keys in the normal position so the parties can converse. The supervision lamps light to alert the operator when the parties finish their conversation and go on-hook. Either party could &quot;flash&quot; the operator&#x27;s supervision lamps by depressing their switch hook for a second and releasing it, in case they needed assistance with a problem. When the operator pulls down a cord, a pulley weight behind the switchboard pulls it down to prevent it from tangling.

On a trunk, on-hook and off-hook signals must pass in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the originating or A board sends a short for off-hook, and an open for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This &quot;reverse battery&quot; signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.

Some areas used specialized switchboards to handle calls from payphones. In North America, these &quot;coin boards&quot; were gradually phased out after the introduction of the Automated Coin Toll System that was provided by the Traffic Service Position System. Dedicated coin boards were primarily used in large, densely populated areas such as New York City where the large local calling area required special billing arrangements to allow the rate for a local call to vary based on the distance called. In less densely populated regions, calls from payphones were handled by normal assistance operators without the use of dedicated coin boards.

<text>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.

While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.

The early era of space exploration was driven by a &quot;Space Race&quot; between the Soviet Union and the United States. A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War. After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air the focus. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. were racing to prove their superiority in technology through exploring space. In fact, the reason NASA was created was as a response to Sputnik I.

The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union&#x27;s Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard &quot;Vostok 1&quot;) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (&quot;Salyut 1&quot;) in 1971. After the first 20 years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS).

With the substantial completion of the ISS following STS-133 in March 2011, plans for space exploration by the U.S. remained in flux. The Constellation program aiming for a return to the Moon by 2020 was judged unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009. Constellation ultimately was replaced with the Artemis Program, of which the first mission occurred in 2022, with a planned crewed landing to occur with Artemis III. The rise of the private space industry also began in earnest in the 2010s with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules and satellite manufacturing.

In the 2000s, China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program while India launched the Chandrayaan programme, while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions. The two primary global programs gaining traction in the 2020s are the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the US-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp, each having its own set of international partners.

==History of exploration==

===First telescopes===
The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey, but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in 1609. In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope, the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope.

A string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next centuries: the mountains of the Moon, the phases of Venus, the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, the rings of Saturn, many comets, the asteroids, the new planets Uranus and Neptune, and many more satellites.

The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968, but the launching of Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billion light-years away.

===First outer space flights===

MW 18014 was a German V-2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at the Peenemünde Army Research Center in Peenemünde. It was the first human-made object to reach outer space, attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers, which is well above the Kármán line. It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight. In 1949, the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of , becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA.

===First object in orbit===
The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; (&quot;Satellite 1&quot;) mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about , and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about . It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted &quot;beeps&quot; that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid. &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958.

===First human outer space flight===
The first successful human spaceflight was &quot;Vostok 1&quot; (&quot;East 1&quot;), carrying the 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin&#x27;s flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight.

=== First astronomical body space explorations ===
The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959. The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966.

The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972.

The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun, launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4, 1973 for Jupiter by &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10, 1979 for Saturn by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, 1986 for Uranus by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, 1989 for Neptune by &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by &quot;Dawn&quot; and passed by &quot;New Horizons&quot;, respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System, the Sun, the Moon, and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets).

The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7, which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus. In 1975, Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft.

=== First space station ===
Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational.

===First interstellar space flight===
&quot;Voyager 1&quot; became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space.

===Farthest from Earth===
The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970.

 &quot;Voyager 1&quot; was at a distance of from Earth. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth.

==Targets of exploration==
Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun&#x27;s heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun&#x27;s solar wind.

===The Sun===
The Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth&#x27;s magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth&#x27;s surface. The Sun generates most space weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury.

===Mercury===
Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets. As of May 2013, the Mariner 10 and &quot;MESSENGER&quot; missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025, BepiColombo is to include two probes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10&#x27;s flybys.

Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable.

===Venus===

Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In 1967, Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970, Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9, some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere.

===Earth===

Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference.

For example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States&#x27; first artificial satellite, &quot;Explorer 1&quot;. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth&#x27;s magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify.

==== Moon ====
The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans.

In 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon&#x27;s surface; just four months later, &quot;Surveyor 1&quot; marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 in 2019 and Chang&#x27;e 6 in 2024 achieved the world&#x27;s first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon. India&#x27;s Chandrayaan-3 in 2023 achieved the world&#x27;s first landing on the lunar south pole region.

Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit. Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously.

===Mars===

The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth.

The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of &quot;The Great Galactic Ghoul&quot; which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the &quot;Mars Curse&quot;. In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India&#x27;s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 Crore (). The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission, it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named &quot;Hope Probe&quot; and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail.

==== Phobos ====

The Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit. It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a &quot;trans-shipment point&quot; for spaceships traveling to Mars.

===Asteroids===
Until the advent of space travel, objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was &quot;Galileo&quot;, which flew past two: 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed by 243 Ida in 1993. Both of these lay near enough to &quot;Galileo&quot;&#x27;s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; probe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object, 433 Eros. The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Dawn&quot; spacecraft, launched in 2007.

&quot;Hayabusa&quot; was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; studied the asteroid&#x27;s shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010.

===Jupiter===
The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been &quot;flybys&quot;, in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet&#x27;s orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded.

Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s, which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration.

Jupiter has 95 known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them.

===Saturn===

Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (&quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot;) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, in 1980 by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, in 1982 by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and an orbital mission by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017.

Saturn has at least 62 known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn&#x27;s rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe deployed by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft.

===Uranus===

The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; studied the planet&#x27;s unique atmosphere and magnetosphere. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons.

Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet&#x27;s unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active.

===Neptune===
The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby, the sole visit to the system as of 2025. The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought.

Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during &quot;Voyager 2&quot;″s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras, and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also examined Neptune&#x27;s ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring &quot;arcs&quot; around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune&#x27;s three previously known moons, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from &quot;Voyager 2&quot; supported the view that Neptune&#x27;s largest moon, Triton, is a captured Kuiper belt object.

===Pluto===
The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present). &quot;Voyager 1&quot; could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto.

After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed &quot;New Horizons&quot; was granted funding from the United States government in 2003. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter.

===Kuiper Belt Objects===
The &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth, in the Kuiper belt, in 2019. This was its first extended mission.

===Comets===

Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, the &quot;International Cometary Explorer&quot; conducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe smashed into 9P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the &quot;Stardust&quot; mission returned samples of another comet&#x27;s tail. The &quot;Philae&quot; lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission.

===Deep space exploration===

Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy, astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft.

Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter, nuclear power and beamed propulsion. Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.

==Future of space exploration==


=== Breakthrough Starshot ===

Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named &quot;StarChip&quot;, to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 4.37 light-years away. It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner, Stephen Hawking, and Mark Zuckerberg.

=== Asteroids ===

An article in the science magazine &quot;Nature&quot; suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, &quot;a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit&quot;; second, &quot;extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars&quot;; and finally, &quot;developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin&quot;. Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure.

=== Artemis program ===

The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as ESA, with the goal of landing &quot;the first woman and the next man&quot; on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.

In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1, using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion, the Lunar Gateway, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign. NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020, while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile which is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S. Congress. As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025. Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025–2027 timeframe. The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo 17.

==Rationales==

The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program. It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue. In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering. Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity&#x27;s knowledge.

Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I&#x27;m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.&quot; Author Arthur C. Clarke (1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph &quot;Interplanetary Flight&quot;. He argued that humanity&#x27;s choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death.

These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA, Wernher von Braun, and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to:

Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space.

Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective.

Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions.

Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases.

Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet.

Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun&#x27;s vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects. The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun&#x27;s Paradigm formed NASA&#x27;s drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe.

NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration.

Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is &quot;a good investment&quot;, compared to 21% who did not.

=== Human nature ===
Space advocacy and space policy regularly invokes exploration as a human nature.

==Topics==
===Spaceflight===
&quot;Spaceflight&quot; is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space.

Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories, reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites.

A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.

===Satellites===
Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites.

===Commercialization of space===

The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems, satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) and satellite radio. The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia. Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of &quot;passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles&quot;. Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure.

Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future.

===Alien life===

Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy, biology and geology. It is focused primarily on the study of the origin, distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: έξω, &quot;exo&quot;, &quot;outside&quot;). The term &quot;Xenobiology&quot; has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means &quot;biology of the foreigners&quot;. Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth. In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.

===Human spaceflight and habitation===
To date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for . Valeri Polyakov&#x27;s record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine. Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments. It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example, space motion sickness (SMS) – a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit. Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body&#x27;s natural biological clock (circadian rhythm); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion. Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass.

Radiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun&#x27;s radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, and dosimetry.

Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine. One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station (ISS) are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis. Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 24/7 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as 20 minutes – as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away.

Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a &quot;steppingstone&quot; to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024.

Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, , ratified by all spacefaring nations. Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars, using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization.

==== Human representation and participation ====
Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration. Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law, declaring space the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;, understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking. Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like the &quot;Justspace Alliance&quot; and IAU featured &quot;Inclusive Astronomy&quot; have been formed in recent years.

=====Women=====

The first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova. She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews. After the rule changed, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space, she was also from the Soviet Union. Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program.

Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir. They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026.

Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include:
* agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men, arguing that there may be unresearched additional risks for cancer.
* a lack of space suits sized appropriately for female astronauts.

===Art===
Artistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material like Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s selfie in space or the image The Blue Marble, over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artist Alexei Leonov, music videos like Chris Hadfield&#x27;s cover of Space Oddity on board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies like on the Moon.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview and topical guide to space science:

Space science – field that encompasses all of the scientific disciplines that involve space exploration and study natural phenomena and physical bodies occurring in outer space, such as space medicine and astrobiology.

== Branches of space sciences ==

=== Astronomy ===

See astronomical object for a list of specific types of entities which scientists study. See Earth&#x27;s location in the universe for an orientation.

* Subfields of astronomy:
** Astrophysics – branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe, including the physical properties of celestial objects, as well as their interactions and behavior. Among the objects studied are galaxies, stars, planets, exoplanets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background; and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. The subdisciplines of theoretical astrophysics are:
*** Computational astrophysics – The study of astrophysics using computational methods and tools to develop computational models.
*** Plasma astrophysics – studies properties of plasma in outer space.
*** Space physics – study of plasmas as they occur naturally in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere (aeronomy) and within the Solar System.
*** Solar physics – Sun and its interaction with the remainder of the Solar System and interstellar space.
*** Stellar astronomy – concerned with Star formation, physical properties, main sequence life span, variability, stellar evolution and extinction.
*** Galactic astronomy – deals with the structure and components of our galaxy and of other galaxies.
*** Extragalactic astronomy – study of objects (mainly galaxies) outside our galaxy, including Galaxy formation and evolution.
** Cosmology
*** Physical cosmology – origin and evolution of the universe as a whole. The study of cosmology is theoretical astrophysics at its largest scale.
*** Chemical cosmology - study of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the processes that led to those compositions.
*** Quantum cosmology – the study of cosmology through the use of quantum field theory to explain phenomena general relativity cannot due to limitations in its framework.
** Planetary Science – study of planets, moons, and planetary systems.
*** Atmospheric science – study of atmospheres and weather.
*** Planetary geology

<doc id="28435" wikidata="Q12002324" url="?curid=28435" title="Shepherd Neame Brewery">
<text>Shepherd Neame is an English independent brewery which has been based in the market town of Faversham, Kent, for over 300 years. While 1698 is the brewery&#x27;s official established date, town records show that commercial brewing has occurred on the site since 1573. Since the brewery&#x27;s formation in the 16th century, ownership has passed in unbroken succession through five families. The brewery produces a range of cask ales and filtered beers. Production is around 180,000 brewers&#x27; barrels a year (). It has 303 pubs and hotels in South East England, predominantly in Kent and London. The company exports to 44 countries, including India, Sweden, Italy, Brazil, and Canada.

==History==
The Neame family were relative latecomers in the overall development of the Shepherd Neame Brewery. Still, as substantial property owners in the district, Charles Neame of Harefield Court and John Neame of Selling Court were acknowledged to be among the most valuable hop growers in East Kent. Theo Barker explains in the official account of the brewery that it all began with a Captain Richard Marsh, who in 1678 is recorded in the Faversham &quot;Wardmote Books&quot; as contributing by far the largest of the &#x27;Brewers Fines&#x27; made at that date.

Shepherd Neame, as such, is reported as having been established in 1698 in an advertisement of the &quot;Kentish Gazette&quot; for 11 April 1865. Richard Marsh lived until 1727, when his brewery was bequeathed to his widow and then to his daughter, who sold the property to Samuel Shepherd around 1741. Samuel Shepherd was from Deal, Kent. He was interested in malting when he moved to Faversham around 1730 and established himself as a Brewer of Malt by 1734. Shepherd expanded on his interest by acquiring several public houses. However, his son, Julius Shepherd, extended this trend further upon his inheritance of the brewery in 1770 when the company held four such outlets. In 1789, he set about modernising the process of malt grinding and pumping, which had been previously worked with the employment of horses, by introducing what was reputed to be the first steam engine (Boulton and Watt) to be used for this purpose outside London. He was then able to describe his business as the &quot;Faversham Steam Brewery&quot;.

Henry, his second son, born in 1780, continued the family tradition and raised his son of the same name into the business. It was this Henry Shepherd (1816-77) who was to be the last of the Shepherds actively involved in the company. The death of Henry senior at the age of eighty-two occurred in 1862. Although his son was not a businessman of the same determination, the firm&#x27;s expansion continued adequately with John Mares, who had come to the financial assistance of the Shepherd Brewery during the recession of the mid-1840s and continued as the impetus behind &quot;Shepherd and Mares&quot; until Percy Beale Neame joined the brewery in 1864. Mares had seen the potential of the brewery&#x27;s growth with the arrival of the long-delayed railway service in 1858. He pressed the firm to prepare for such growth actively. Horse-drawn drays were used to carry the brewery&#x27;s ales throughout Kent, and malts were imported by barge at Faversham Creek at its wharf, which was also used as the means to deliver its product to London until the 1850s when steamboats were beginning to prove more expeditious to the task. The railways soon even outpaced and replaced the steamboats.

Mares&#x27;s unexpected death at the age of 45 in 1864 placed Percy Neame, at the age of 28, as the stronger partner with Henry Shepherd, and with the challenge left to him in Mares&#x27;s successful expansion programme he brought the Faversham Brewery well into the Neame family&#x27;s dominion. Jonathan Neame is the fifth generation of his family to run the business. His late father, Robert, was the company&#x27;s first-ever President.

Shepherd Neame has embraced 21st-century brewing techniques, for instance, using PDX Reactor Technology for the heat treatment of wort, rather than the traditional method, using a calandria. This has led to a reduction in energy consumption of 50%. Its cask, keg, and bottling lines are all equally high tech, utilising robotics and the latest SAP software to minimise the use of natural resources, while maximising beer quality. Its cardboard packaging is 100% recyclable, and the brewery uses lightweight glass for bottled beer. It also installed a new state-of-the-art Yeast Propagation Plant, which will reduce energy consumption. The brewery has repeatedly pioneered sustainable brewing methods. It recycles 97% of the grain and hops used in the brewing process as animal feed on local farms and holds a Feed Materials Assurance Scheme certificate. Waste is separated into recyclable elements, and the waste oil from its managed pubs and the brewery&#x27;s kitchens is collected and converted into biofuel. Its Water Recovery Plant, installed in 2014, allows the wastewater from brewing and cleaning to be recycled rather than sent to the drain.

Along with the Three Tuns Brewery in Shropshire, Shepherd Neame claims to be the oldest brewery in Great Britain. Three Tuns was licensed in 1642, 56 years earlier than Shepherd Neame. However, there is evidence that brewing has taken place on the Shepherd Neame site since at least 1573, over a century before the establishment of the current brewery.

==Brewing and product range ==

The brewery uses chalk-filtered mineral water from the brewery&#x27;s artesian well, deep below the brewery, and 93% of the hops used in its beers are grown in Kent. In 2016, the 100 year-old solid teak mash tuns were renovated.

As well as beer, it also brews Samuel Adams Boston Lager under licence and collaborates to produce Orchard View Apple Cider. The brewery distributes Thai Singha lager and Angry Orchard Crisp Apple cider.

Shepherd Neame beers are available in UK supermarkets.

==Pubs==

The brewery has 303 pubs and hotels throughout London and South East England. The brewery&#x27;s brands are typically given prominence in frontage with extensive branding. All fonts and pumps bear distinctive logos and branding, glasses are branded, and bar runners advertising house beers are commonplace.

<doc id="28436" wikidata="Q43115" url="?curid=28436" title="Saint">
<text>In Christian belief, a saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God. However, the use of the term &quot;saint&quot; depends on the context and denomination. In Anglican, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but a selected few are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation. Official ecclesiastical recognition, and veneration, is conferred on some denominational saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church after their approval. In many Protestant denominations &quot;saint&quot; refers broadly to any holy Christian, without special recognition or selection.

While the English word &quot;saint&quot; (deriving from the Latin ) originated in Christianity, historians of religion tend to use the appellation &quot;in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people&quot;, referring to the Jewish ḥasīd or tzadik, the Islamic walī/ fakir, the Hindu rishi, Sikh bhagat or guru, the Shintoist kami, the Taoist shengren, and the Buddhist arhat or bodhisattva also as saints. Depending on the religion, saints are recognized either by official declaration, as in the Catholic faith, or by popular acclamation (see folk saint).

== General characteristics ==
The English word &quot;saint&quot; comes from the Latin , with the Greek equivalent being (&quot;hagios&quot;) &#x27;holy&#x27;. The word appears 229 times in the Greek New Testament, and its English translation 60 times in the corresponding text of the King James Version of the Bible.

The word &quot;sanctus&quot; was originally a technical one in ancient Roman religion, but due to its globalized use in Christianity the modern word &quot;saint&quot; is now also used as a translation of comparable terms for persons &quot;worthy of veneration for their holiness or sanctity&quot; in other religions.

Many religions also use similar concepts (but different terminology) to venerate persons worthy of some honor. Author John A. Coleman of the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California, wrote that saints across various cultures and religions have the following family resemblances:

# exemplary model
# extraordinary teacher

The anthropologist Lawrence Babb, in an article about Indian guru Sathya Sai Baba, asks the question &quot;Who is a saint?&quot; and responds by saying that in the symbolic infrastructure of some religions, there is the image of a certain extraordinary spiritual person&#x27;s &quot;miraculous powers&quot;, to whom frequently a certain moral presence is attributed. These saintly figures, he asserts, are &quot;the focal points of spiritual force-fields&quot;. They exert &quot;powerful attractive influence on followers but touch the inner lives of others in transforming ways as well&quot;.

=== Catholic Church ===


According to the Catholic Church, a saint may be anyone in Heaven, whether recognized on Earth or not, who forms the &quot;great cloud of witnesses&quot; (Hebrews 12:1). These &quot;may include our own mothers, grandmothers or other loved ones (cf. 2 Tim 1:5)&quot; who may have not always lived perfect lives, but &quot;amid their faults and failings they kept moving forward and proved pleasing to the Lord&quot;. The title &quot;Saint&quot; denotes a person who has been formally canonized—that is, officially and authoritatively declared a saint, by the church as holder of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven by the grace of God. There are many persons that the church believes to be in Heaven who have not been formally canonized and who are otherwise titled saints because of the fame of their holiness. Sometimes the word saint also denotes living Christians.

According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, &quot;The patriarchs, prophets, and certain other Old Testament figures have been and always will be honored as saints in all the church&#x27;s liturgical traditions.&quot;

In his book &quot;Saint of the Day&quot;, editor Leonard Foley says this: the &quot;[Saints&#x27;] surrender to God&#x27;s love was so generous an approach to the total surrender of Jesus that the Church recognizes them as heroes and heroines worthy to be held up for our inspiration. They remind us that the Church is holy, can never stop being holy and is called to show the holiness of God by living the life of Christ.&quot;

The Catholic Church teaches that it does not &quot;make&quot; or &quot;create&quot; saints, but rather recognizes them. Proofs of heroic virtue required in the process of beatification will serve to illustrate in detail the general principles exposed above upon proof of their holiness or likeness to God.

On 3 January 993, Pope John XV became the first pope to proclaim a person a saint from outside the diocese of Rome: on the petition of the German ruler, he had canonized Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg. Before that time, the popular &quot;cults&quot;, or venerations, of saints had been local and spontaneous and were confirmed by the local bishop. Pope John XVIII subsequently permitted a cult of five Polish martyrs. Pope Benedict VIII later declared the Armenian hermit Simeon of Mantua to be a saint, but it was not until the pontificate of Pope Innocent III that the Popes reserved to themselves the exclusive authority to canonize saints, so that local bishops needed the confirmation of the Pope. Walter of Pontoise was the last person in Western Europe to be canonized by an authority other than the Pope: Hugh de Boves, the Archbishop of Rouen, canonized him in 1153. Thenceforth a decree of Pope Alexander III in 1170 reserved the prerogative of canonization to the Pope, insofar as the Latin Church was concerned.

Alban Butler published &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; in 1756, including a total of 1,486 saints. The latest revision of this book, edited by Herbert Thurston and Donald Attwater, contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Robert Sarno, an official of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See, expressed that it is impossible to give an exact number of saints.

The veneration of saints, in Latin &quot;cultus&quot;, or the &quot;cult of the Saints&quot;, describes a particular popular devotion or entrustment of one&#x27;s self to a particular saint or group of saints. Although the term &quot;worship&quot; is sometimes used, it is only used with the older English connotation of honoring or respecting (&quot;dulia&quot;) a person. According to the church, Divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to God (&quot;latria&quot;) and never to the saints. One is permitted to ask the saints to intercede or pray to God for persons still on Earth, just as one can ask someone on Earth to pray for him.

A saint may be designated as a patron saint of a particular cause, profession, or locale, or invoked as a protector against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official declarations of the church. Saints are not believed to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. Relics of saints are respected, or &quot;venerated&quot;, similar to the veneration of holy images and icons. The practice in past centuries of venerating relics of saints with the intention of obtaining healing from God through their intercession is taken from the early church. For example, an American deacon claimed in 2000 that John Henry Newman (then blessed) interceded with God to cure him of a physical illness. The deacon, Jack Sullivan, asserted that after addressing Newman he was cured of spinal stenosis in a matter of hours. In 2009, a panel of theologians concluded that Sullivan&#x27;s recovery was the result of his prayer to Newman. According to the church, to be deemed a miracle, &quot;a medical recovery must be instantaneous, not attributable to treatment, disappear for good.&quot;

Once a person has been canonized, the deceased body of the saint is considered holy as a relic. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints&#x27; personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a special symbol by tradition, e.g., Saint Lawrence, deacon and martyr, is identified by a gridiron because he is believed to have been burned to death on one. This symbol is found, for instance, in the Canadian heraldry of the office responsible for the St. Lawrence Seaway.

==== Stages of canonization ====
Formal canonization is a lengthy process, often of many years or even centuries. There are four major steps to become a saint. The first stage in this process is an investigation of the candidate&#x27;s life by an expert. After this, the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the pertinent diocese and more study is undertaken. The information is then sent to the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints of the Holy See for evaluation at the universal level of the church. If the application is approved the candidate may be granted the title &quot;Venerable&quot; (stage 2). Further investigation, step 3, may lead to the candidate&#x27;s beatification with the title &quot;Blessed&quot;, which is elevation to the class of the &quot;Beati&quot;. Next, and at a minimum, proof of two important miracles obtained from God through the intercession of the candidate are required for formal canonization as a saint. Finally, in the last stage, after all of these procedures are complete, the Pope may canonize the candidate as a saint for veneration by the universal church.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a saint is defined as anyone who is in Heaven, whether or not recognized here on Earth. By this definition, Adam and Eve, Moses, the various prophets, and archangels are all given the title of &quot;Saint&quot;. Sainthood in the Orthodox Church does not necessarily reflect a moral model, but communion with God: there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by humility and repentance, such as Mary of Egypt, Moses the Ethiopian, and Dysmas, the repentant thief who was crucified. Therefore, a more complete Eastern Orthodox definition of what a saint is, has to do with the way that saints, through their humility and their love of humankind, saved inside them the entire church, and loved all people.

Orthodox belief considers that God reveals saints through answered prayers and other miracles. Saints are usually recognized by a local community, often by people who directly knew them. As their popularity grows they are often then recognized by the entire church through the Holy Spirit. The word &quot;canonization&quot; means that a Christian has been found worthy to have his name placed in the canon (official list) of saints of the church. The formal process of recognition involves deliberation by a synod of bishops. The Orthodox Church does not require the manifestation of miracles; what is required is evidence of a virtuous life.

If the ecclesiastical review is successful, this is followed by a service of glorification in which the saint is given a day on the church calendar to be celebrated by the entire church. This does not, however, make the person a saint; the person already was a saint and the church ultimately recognized it.

As a general rule, only clergy will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession; however, in veneration the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint. The altar in an Orthodox Church usually contains relics of saints, often of martyrs. Church interiors are covered with the icons of saints. When an Orthodox Christian venerates icons of a saint he is venerating the image of God which he sees in the saint.
Because the church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead, as the saints are considered to be alive in Heaven, saints are referred to as if they are still alive, and are venerated, not worshipped. They are believed to be able to intercede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with God or by personal intervention.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the title , &quot;Hosios&quot; (f. Ὁσία &quot;Hosia&quot;) is also used. This is a title attributed to saints who had lived a monastic or eremitic life equivalent to the more usual title of &quot;Saint&quot;.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The Oriental Orthodox churches ‒ the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Tewahedo Church, Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church ‒ follow a canonization process unique to each church. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, for example, has the requirement that at least 50 years must pass following a prospective saint&#x27;s death before the Coptic Orthodox Church&#x27;s pope can canonize the saint.

=== Anglicanism ===
In the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been elevated by popular opinion as a pious and holy person. The saints are seen as models of holiness to be imitated, and as a &quot;cloud of witnesses&quot; that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey. The saints are seen as elder brothers and sisters in Christ. Official Anglican creeds recognize the existence of the saints in heaven.

In high-church contexts, such as Anglo-Catholicism, a saint is generally one to whom has been attributed (and who has generally demonstrated) a high level of holiness and sanctity. In this use, a saint is therefore not merely a believer, but one who has been transformed by virtue. In Catholicism, a saint is a special sign of God&#x27;s activity. The veneration of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship, in which case it is derisively termed &quot;hagiolatry&quot;.

So far as invocation of the saints is concerned, one of the Church of England&#x27;s Articles of Religion &quot;Of Purgatory&quot; condemns &quot;the Romish Doctrine concerning ...(the) Invocation of Saints&quot; as &quot;a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God&quot;. Anglo-Catholics in Anglican provinces using the Articles often make a distinction between a &quot;Romish&quot; and a &quot;Patristic&quot; doctrine concerning the invocation of saints, permitting the latter in accordance with Article XXII. Indeed, the theologian E. J. Bicknell stated that the Anglican view acknowledges that the term &quot;invocation may mean either of two things: the simple request to a saint for his prayers (intercession), &#x27;ora pro nobis&#x27;, or a request for some particular benefit. In medieval times the saints had come to be regarded as themselves the authors of blessings. Such a view was condemned but the former was affirmed.&quot;

Some Anglicans and Anglican churches, particularly Anglo-Catholics, personally ask prayers of the saints. However, such a practice is seldom found in any official Anglican liturgy. Unusual examples of it are found in The Korean Liturgy 1938, the liturgy of the Diocese of Guiana 1959 and The Melanesian English Prayer Book.

Anglicans believe that the only effective Mediator between the believer and God the Father, in terms of redemption and salvation, is God the Son, Jesus Christ. Historical Anglicanism has drawn a distinction between the intercession of the saints and the invocation of the saints. The former was generally accepted in Anglican doctrine, while the latter was generally rejected. There are some, however, in Anglicanism, who do beseech the saints&#x27; intercession. Those who beseech the saints to intercede on their behalf make a distinction between &quot;mediator&quot; and &quot;intercessor&quot;, and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living Christians. Anglican Catholics understand sainthood in a more Catholic or Orthodox way, often praying for intercessions from the saints and celebrating their feast days.

According to the Church of England, a saint is one who is sanctified, as it translates in the Authorized King James Version (1611) 2 Chronicles 6:41: 
Now therefore arise, O God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
=== Lutheranism ===

In the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in Heaven or on Earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors specific saints, including some of those recognized by the Catholic Church, but in a qualified way: according to the Augsburg Confession, the term &quot;saint&quot; is used in the manner of the Catholic Church only insofar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace, was sustained by faith, and whose good works are to be an example to any Christian. Traditional Lutheran belief accounts that prayers &quot;to&quot; the saints are prohibited, as they are not mediators of redemption. But, Lutherans do believe that saints pray for the Christian Church in general. Philip Melanchthon, the author of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, approved honoring the saints by saying they are honored in three ways:
:1. By thanking God for examples of His mercy;
:2. By using the saints as examples for strengthening our faith; and
:3. By imitating their faith and other virtues.

The Lutheran Churches also have liturgical calendars in which they honor individuals as saints.

The intercession of saints was criticized in the &quot;Augsburg Confession, Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints&quot;. This criticism was rebutted by the Catholic side in the &quot;Confutatio Augustana&quot;, which in turn was rebutted by the Lutheran side in the &quot;Apology to the Augsburg Confession&quot;.

=== Methodism ===
While Methodists as a whole do not venerate saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are &quot;saints&quot;, but mainly use the term to refer to biblical figures, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints—such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc.—although most are named after geographical locations associated with an early circuit or prominent location. Methodist congregations observe All Saints&#x27; Day. Many encourage the study of saints, that is, the biographies of holy people.

The 14th Article of Religion in the United Methodist &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; states:
The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God.

=== Other Protestantism ===

In many Protestant churches, the word &quot;saint&quot; is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar in usage to Paul&#x27;s numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this sense, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (i.e., a professing Christian) is a saint because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider intercessory prayers to the saints to be idolatry, since what they perceive to be an application of divine worship that should be given only to God himself is being given to other believers, dead or alive.

Within some Protestant traditions, &quot;saint&quot; is also used to refer to any born-again Christian. Many emphasize the traditional New Testament meaning of the word, preferring to write &quot;saint&quot; to refer to any believer, in continuity with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The use of &quot;saint&quot; within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is similar to the Protestant tradition. In the New Testament, saints are all those who have entered into the Christian covenant of baptism. The qualification &quot;latter-day&quot; refers to the doctrine that members are living in the latter days before the Second Coming of Christ, and is used to distinguish the members of the church, which considers itself the restoration of the ancient Christian church. Members are therefore often referred to as &quot;Latter-day Saints&quot; or &quot;LDS&quot;, and among themselves as &quot;saints&quot;.

== Other religions ==
In some theological literature, the use of the term &quot;saint&quot; tends to be used in non-Christian contexts as well. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching. In English, the term &quot;saint&quot; is often used to translate this idea from many world religions. The jewish &quot;ḥasīd&quot; or &quot;tsaddiq&quot;, the islamic &quot;qidees&quot;, the Zoroastrian F&quot;ravashi&quot;, the Hindu Shadhus&quot;,&quot; the Buddhist A&quot;rahant&quot; or B&quot;odhisattva,&quot; the Daoist S&quot;hengren,&quot; the Shinto K&quot;ami,&quot; and others have all been referred to as saints.

=== African diaspora ===
Cuban Santería, Haitian Vodou, Trinidad Orisha-Shango, Brazilian Umbanda, Candomblé, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshipped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name &quot;santería&quot; was originally a pejorative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.

=== Buddhism ===
Buddhists in both the Theravada and Mahayana traditions hold the &quot;Arhats&quot; in special esteem, as well as highly developed Bodhisattvas.

Tibetan Buddhists hold the &quot;tulkus&quot; (reincarnates of deceased eminent practitioners) as living saints on earth.

=== Druze faith ===
Due to the Christian influence on Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze&#x27;s favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druzes and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druzes appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and Saint Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.

=== Hinduism ===

Hindu saints are those recognized by Hindus as showing a great degree of holiness and sanctity. Hinduism has a long tradition of stories and poetry about saints. There is no formal canonization process in Hinduism, but over time, many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among Hindus in general. Unlike in Christianity, Hinduism does not canonize people as saints after death, but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime. Hindu saints have often renounced the world, and are variously called gurus, sadhus, rishis, devarishis, rajarshis, saptarishis, brahmarshis, swamis, pundits, purohits, pujaris, acharyas, pravaras, yogis, yoginis, and other names.

Some Hindu saints are given god-like status, being seen as incarnations of Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, and other aspects of the Divine—this can happen during their lifetimes, or sometimes many years after their deaths. This explains another common name for Hindu saints: godmen, is invention of western Abrahamic media to a Pagan Ideas.

=== Islam ===
Besides prophets, according to Islam, saints possess blessings (Arabic: بركة, &quot;baraka&quot;) and can perform miracles (Arabic: كرامات, &quot;Karāmāt&quot;). Saints rank lower than prophets. However, they can intercede for people on the Day of Judgment, but their intercession is limited compared to the intercession of the Prophet Muhammad. Both the tombs of prophets and saints are visited frequently &quot;(Ziyarat)&quot; as well as visiting modern-day living saints. People seek the advice of a saint in their quest for spiritual fulfilment. Unlike saints in Christianity, Muslim saints are said to be given their rank by God and some with public duties are officially acknowledged by their Sheikh with an &quot;ijaz&quot;a, a verbal and written permission to be a spiritual guide. Unlike prophets, women like Rabia of Basra were accepted as saints.

Saints are recognized as having specific traits they can be identified through. These include: floating lights appearing above their tomb, the body not decaying, a pleasant and miraculous odor coming from the body, appearing in the dreams of others who they pray on behalf of, appearing in two places at once, and having normally impossible knowledge.

Islam has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called &quot;wali&quot;, which literally means &#x27;Friend [of God]&#x27;), which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of Salafism. In Sunni Islam, the veneration of saints became a very common form of devotion early on, and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of &quot;special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.&quot; The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both &quot;loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.&quot; &quot;Belief in the miracles of saints (&quot;karāmāt al-awliyāʾ&quot;) ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],&quot; with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of grave visitation like Ibn Taymiyyah emphatically declaring: &quot;The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Quran has pointed to it in different places, &quot;&quot;A messenger who has instructed them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them.&quot; (Qur&#x27;an 2:129)&quot; and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators.&quot; The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the Sufis, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law.

Veneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the Salafi movement, whose various streams regard it as &quot;being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.&quot; In a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation, the specific traditional practices which Salafism has tried to curtail in both Sunni and Shia contexts include those of the veneration of saints, visiting their graves, seeking their intercession, and honoring their relics. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: &quot;[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints ... [Due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.&quot;

Despite attempts by the Salafis to minimise the importance of saints in Islam, there are many living saints with huge popularity, often with millions of followers, mainly found in the Sufi orders or &quot;tariqat&quot;. They follow the teachings of the Muhammad and are usually direct descendants of him. They are also scholars of the religion. Well-known modern-day saints include Sheikh Nazim al Haqqani, Sheikh Hisham Kabbani, Sheikh Mehmet al Rabbani of the Naqshbandi Sufi Order, Habib Umar bin Hafidz of the Ba&#x27;Alawi Tariqat, Sheikh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi of the Shadhili Tariqa.

Famous Islamic saints in history include Rumi, Ibn Arabi and Al Ghazzali.

=== Judaism ===
The term &quot;Tzadik&quot;, &#x27;righteous&#x27;, and its associated meanings developed in rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with &quot;Ḥasīd&quot;, &#x27;pious&#x27;, to its exploration in ethical literature, and its esoteric spiritualization in Kabbalah. In Ḥasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance, combining former elite mysticism with social movement for the first time.

In Muslim majority countries, particularly Morocco, Jewish saint veneration resembles local Muslim practices. However, the ideas and rituals in this specific context are still thoroughly situated within Judaism. The bodies of the saintly dead are treated like Torah scrolls, with their shrines being their ark, and pilgrimages taking on the ritual trappings of a Torah service. Icons of saints also are paralleled to Torah scrolls; both are manifestations of the sacred. They are also given frames made from velvet in the same style as Torah mantles, and are physically handled in similar ways. The stories and poems produced about saints match the conventions of other Rabbinic literature. Saints may be venerated by both Jews and Muslims, and are typically Torah scholars, miracle workers, and divine mediators. The similarities of Moroccan Jewish and Muslim practices, including saint veneration, were used by colonial powers to claim Morocco was unified and consisted of a distinct nation, but were not sufficiently united to resist imperialism. Today, these similarities are used to emphasize and display tolerance of religious minorities.

=== Sikhism ===

The concept of &quot;sant&quot; or &quot;bhagat&quot; is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism, most notably in Sri Guru Granth Sahib Jee . Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, and others are known as &quot;Sants&quot; or &quot;Bhagats&quot;. The term &quot;Sant&quot; is applied in the Sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through God realization and spiritual union with God via repeatedly reciting the name of God (Naam Japn). Countless names of God exist. In Sikhism, &quot;Naam&quot; (spiritual internalization of God&#x27;s name) is commonly attained through the name of Waheguru, which translates to &quot;Wondrous Guru&quot;.

Sikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a Sant (Sadh Sangat) or &quot;The Company of the Holy&quot;. &quot;Sants&quot; grace the Sadh Sangat with knowledge of the Divine God, and how to take greater steps towards obtaining spiritual enlightenment through &quot;Naam&quot;. &quot;Sants&quot; are to be distinguished from &quot;Guru&quot; (such as Guru Nanak) who have compiled the path to God enlightenment in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhism states however, that any beings that have become one with God are considered synonymous with God. As such, the fully realized Sant, Guru, and God are considered one.

=== New Religious Movements ===

Thelema is a new religious movement with a list of saints including individuals such as Roger Bacon.

<doc id="28437" wikidata="Q835975" url="?curid=28437" title="Simple harmonic motion">
<text>In mechanics and physics, simple harmonic motion (sometimes abbreviated as ) is a special type of periodic motion an object experiences by means of a restoring force whose magnitude is directly proportional to the distance of the object from an equilibrium position and acts towards the equilibrium position. It results in an oscillation that is described by a sinusoid which continues indefinitely (if uninhibited by friction or any other dissipation of energy).

Simple harmonic motion can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, but is typified by the oscillation of a mass on a spring when it is subject to the linear elastic restoring force given by Hooke&#x27;s law. The motion is sinusoidal in time and demonstrates a single resonant frequency. Other phenomena can be modeled by simple harmonic motion, including the motion of a simple pendulum, although for it to be an accurate model, the net force on the object at the end of the pendulum must be proportional to the displacement (and even so, it is only a good approximation when the angle of the swing is small; see small-angle approximation). Simple harmonic motion can also be used to model molecular vibration.

Simple harmonic motion provides a basis for the characterization of more complicated periodic motion through the techniques of Fourier analysis.

==Introduction==
The motion of a particle moving along a straight line with an acceleration whose direction is always toward a fixed point on the line and whose magnitude is proportional to the displacement from the fixed point is called simple harmonic motion.

In the diagram, a simple harmonic oscillator, consisting of a weight attached to one end of a spring, is shown. The other end of the spring is connected to a rigid support such as a wall. If the system is left at rest at the equilibrium position then there is no net force acting on the mass. However, if the mass is displaced from the equilibrium position, the spring exerts a restoring elastic force that obeys Hooke&#x27;s law.

Mathematically,
formula_1
where is the restoring elastic force exerted by the spring (in SI units: N), is the spring constant (N·m−1), and is the displacement from the equilibrium position (in metres).

For any simple mechanical harmonic oscillator:
*When the system is displaced from its equilibrium position, a restoring force that obeys Hooke&#x27;s law tends to restore the system to equilibrium.

Once the mass is displaced from its equilibrium position, it experiences a net restoring force. As a result, it accelerates and starts going back to the equilibrium position. When the mass moves closer to the equilibrium position, the restoring force decreases. At the equilibrium position, the net restoring force vanishes. However, at , the mass has momentum because of the acceleration that the restoring force has imparted. Therefore, the mass continues past the equilibrium position, compressing the spring. A net restoring force then slows it down until its velocity reaches zero, whereupon it is accelerated back to the equilibrium position again.

As long as the system has no energy loss, the mass continues to oscillate. Thus simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion. If energy is lost in the system, then the mass exhibits damped oscillation.

Note if the real space and phase space plot are not co-linear, the phase space motion becomes elliptical. The area enclosed depends on the amplitude and the maximum momentum.

==Dynamics==
In Newtonian mechanics, for one-dimensional simple harmonic motion, the equation of motion, which is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, can be obtained by means of Newton&#x27;s second law and Hooke&#x27;s law for a mass on a spring.

formula_2
where is the inertial mass of the oscillating body, is its displacement from the equilibrium (or mean) position, and is a constant (the spring constant for a mass on a spring).

Therefore,
formula_3

Solving the differential equation above produces a solution that is a sinusoidal function:
formula_4 where formula_5
The meaning of the constants formula_6 and formula_7 can be easily found: setting formula_8 on the equation above we see that formula_9, so that formula_6 is the initial position of the particle, formula_11; taking the derivative of that equation and evaluating at zero we get that formula_12, so that formula_7 is the initial speed of the particle divided by the angular frequency, formula_14. Thus we can write:
formula_15

This equation can also be written in the form:
formula_16
where
* formula_17
and, since where is the time period,
formula_18

These equations demonstrate that the simple harmonic motion is (the period and frequency are independent of the amplitude and the initial phase of the motion).

==Energy==
Substituting with , the kinetic energy of the system at time is
formula_19
and the potential energy is
formula_20
In the absence of friction and other energy loss, the total mechanical energy has a constant value
formula_21

==Examples==

The following physical systems are some examples of simple harmonic oscillator.

===Mass on a spring===
A mass attached to a spring of spring constant exhibits simple harmonic motion in closed space. The equation for describing the period:
formula_22
shows the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude, though in practice the amplitude should be small. The above equation is also valid in the case when an additional constant force is being applied on the mass, i.e. the additional constant force cannot change the period of oscillation.

===Uniform circular motion===
Simple harmonic motion can be considered the one-dimensional projection of uniform circular motion. If an object moves with angular speed around a circle of radius centered at the origin of the -plane, then its motion along each coordinate is simple harmonic motion with amplitude and angular frequency .

=== Oscillatory motion ===
The motion of a body in which it moves to and from a definite point is also called oscillatory motion or vibratory motion. The time period is able to be calculated by
formula_23
where l is the distance from rotation to the object&#x27;s center of mass undergoing SHM and g is gravitational acceleration. This is analogous to the mass-spring system.

===Mass of a simple pendulum===

In the small-angle approximation, the motion of a simple pendulum is approximated by simple harmonic motion. The period of a mass attached to a pendulum of length with gravitational acceleration formula_24 is given by
formula_25

This shows that the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude and mass of the pendulum but not of the acceleration due to gravity, formula_24, therefore a pendulum of the same length on the Moon would swing more slowly due to the Moon&#x27;s lower gravitational field strength. Because the value of formula_24 varies slightly over the surface of the earth, the time period will vary slightly from place to place and will also vary with height above sea level.

This approximation is accurate only for small angles because of the expression for angular acceleration being proportional to the sine of the displacement angle:
formula_28
where is the moment of inertia. When is small, and therefore the expression becomes
formula_29
which makes angular acceleration directly proportional and opposite to , satisfying the definition of simple harmonic motion (that net force is directly proportional to the displacement from the mean position and is directed towards the mean position).

===Scotch yoke===

A Scotch yoke mechanism can be used to convert between rotational motion and linear reciprocating motion. The linear motion can take various forms depending on the shape of the slot, but the basic yoke with a constant rotation speed produces a linear motion that is simple harmonic in form.

<doc id="28438" wikidata="Q3879259" url="?curid=28438" title="Skyclad (Neopaganism)">
<text>Skyclad refers to ritual nudity in Wicca and Modern Paganism. Some groups, or Traditions, perform most or all of their rituals skyclad. Whilst nudity and the practice of witchcraft have long been associated in the visual arts, this contemporary ritual nudity is typically attributed to either the influence of Gerald Gardner or to a passage from Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1899 book &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, and as such is mainly attributed to the Gardnerian and Aradian covens.
==Origins==
===Gardner===
Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft Today&quot; was published in 1954. The book claimed to report on the contemporary practice of Pagan religious witchcraft in England, which had supposedly survived as an underground religion for centuries. Ritual nudity was included as a regular part of Wiccan practice, but in the modern day it is mainly used by Alexandrian, Georgian, and Blue Star Wiccans. The &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, a part of Gardnerian ritual liturgy, does instruct Wiccans to practice ritual in the nude. Gardner spent several years in India, and may have picked up the concept from the Digambara Jains, a religious sect in which the monks may not wear clothing.

The term &quot;Digambara&quot; literally means &quot;sky-clad&quot;. England had close links with India at the time when Wicca first became public in England, so this usage could well have been familiar to English speakers with a knowledge of Far Eastern religions. In particular, Gerald Gardner, who first popularized Wicca in England, was a noted folklorist with an interest in Far Eastern culture who spent much of his adult life in Ceylon and Burma, so it&#x27;s plausible he was familiar with this Jain term.

Dr. Leo Ruickbie also notes that the traditional and artistic representation of witches cannot be overlooked as a source for nudity in Gardner&#x27;s system, citing artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Salvator Rosa.

===Aradia===
The origins of this instruction have been traced to &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;. The following speech by Aradia appears at the end of the book&#x27;s first chapter;

&lt;poem&gt;
And as the sign that ye are truly free,
Ye shall be naked in your rites, both men
And women also: this shall last until
The last of your oppressors shall be dead;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Doreen Valiente, one of Gardner&#x27;s priestesses, recalls Gardner&#x27;s surprise at Valiente&#x27;s recognition of material from &quot;Aradia&quot; in the original version of the &quot;Charge&quot; that she was given. Valiente later rewrote the &quot;Charge&quot;, preserving the lines from &quot;Aradia&quot;. Valiente&#x27;s version was then widely circulated and reprinted.

Accepting &quot;Aradia&quot; as the source of skyclad practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini translation of these lines, which read &quot;Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead.&quot; Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland&#x27;s mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause &quot;in your rites&quot;.

===Outside Wiccan traditions===
Ritual nudity is not exclusive to traditional Wicca. Amongst those groups that do, only some rituals may involve ritual nudity. The Arician tradition, as an example, practices skyclad for six months of the year, and performs their ceremonies in ritual robes for the other half of the year. Within, and especially outside of, specific areas of Wicca and Pagan, reasons other than tradition may be given to explain a preference for skyclad worship. Starhawk states in &quot;Spiral Dance&quot;, &quot;The naked body represents truth, the truth that goes deeper than social custom&quot; and &quot;is a sign that a Witch&#x27;s loyalty is to the truth before any ideology or any comforting illusions.&quot;

<text>Syracuse ( ; ; ) is a historic city on the Italian island of Sicily, the capital of the Italian province of Syracuse. The city is notable for its rich Greek and Roman history, culture, amphitheatres, architecture, and as the birthplace and home of the pre-eminent mathematician and engineer Archimedes. This 2,700-year-old city played a key role in ancient times, when it was one of the major powers of the Mediterranean world. Syracuse is located in the southeast corner of the island of Sicily, next to the Gulf of Syracuse beside the Ionian Sea. It is situated in a drastic rise of land with depths being close to the city offshore although the city itself is generally not so hilly in comparison.

The city was founded by Ancient Greek Corinthians and Teneans and became a very powerful city-state. Syracuse was allied with Sparta and Corinth and exerted influence over the entirety of Magna Graecia, of which it was the most important city. Described by Cicero as &quot;the greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all&quot;, it equaled Athens in size during the fifth century BC. It later became part of the Roman Republic and the Byzantine Empire. Under Emperor Constans II, it served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire (663–669). Palermo later overtook it in importance, as the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily. Eventually the kingdom would be united with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Two Sicilies until the Italian unification of 1860.

In the modern day, the city is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site along with the Necropolis of Pantalica. In the central area, the city itself has a population of around 125,000 people. Syracuse is mentioned in the Bible in the Acts of the Apostles book at 28:12 as Paul stayed there. The patron saint of the city is Saint Lucy; she was born in Syracuse and her feast day, Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, is celebrated on 13 December.

== History ==

=== Archaic period ===


Syracuse and its surrounding area have been inhabited since ancient times, as shown by the findings in the villages of Stentinello, Ognina, Plemmirio, Matrensa, Cozzo Pantano and &quot;Thapsos&quot;, which already had a relationship with Mycenaean Greece.

Syracuse was founded in 734 or 733 BC in Sicily by Greek settlers from Corinth and Tenea, led by the &quot;oecist&quot; (colonizer) Archias. There are many attested variants of the name of the city including &quot;Syrakousai&quot;, &quot;Syrakosai&quot; and &quot;Syrakō&quot;. One observation cited for the origin of the name is that the Phoenicians called it Sour-ha-Koussim, which means &quot;Stone of the seagulls&quot; from which would come the name of Syracuse. However, this etymology does not account for the name variant &quot;Syrakō&quot;. Another possible origin of the city&#x27;s name was given by Vibius Sequester citing first Stephanus Byzantius in that there was a Syracusian marsh () called &quot;Syrako&quot; and secondly Marcian&#x27;s &quot;Periegesis&quot; wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets &quot;Syrako&quot; (and thereby &quot;Syrakousai&quot; and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by Epicharmus. The settlement of Syracuse was a planned event, as a strong central leader, Arkhias the aristocrat, laid out how property would be divided up for the settlers, as well as plans for how the streets of the settlement should be arranged, and how wide they should be. The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of Ortygia. The settlers found the land fertile and the native tribes to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the Mediterranean. Colonies were founded at Akrai (664 BC), Kasmenai (643 BC), Akrillai (7th century BC), Helorus (7th century BC) and Kamarina (598 BC).

===Classical period===

The descendants of the first colonists, called &quot;Gamoroi&quot;, held power until they were expelled by the lower class of the city assisted by Cyllyrians, identified as enslaved natives similar in status to the helots of Sparta. The former, however, returned to power in 485 BC, thanks to the help of Gelo, ruler of Gela. Gelo himself became the despot of the city, and moved many inhabitants of Gela, Kamarina and Megara to Syracuse, building the new quarters of Tyche and Neapolis outside the walls. His program of new constructions included a new theatre, designed by Damocopos, which gave the city a flourishing cultural life: this in turn attracted personalities as Aeschylus, Ario of Methymna and Eumelos of Corinth. The enlarged power of Syracuse made unavoidable the clash against the Carthaginians, who ruled western Sicily. In the Battle of Himera, Gelo, who had allied with Theron of Agrigento, decisively defeated the African force led by Hamilcar. A temple dedicated to Athena (on the site of today&#x27;s Cathedral), was erected in the city to commemorate the event.

Syracuse grew considerably during this time. Its walls encircled in the fifth century, but as early as the 470s BC the inhabitants started building outside the walls. The complete population of its territory approximately numbered 250,000 in 415 BC and the population size of the city itself was probably similar to Athens.

Gelo was succeeded by his brother Hiero, who fought against the Etruscans at Cumae in 474 BC. His rule was eulogized by poets like Simonides of Ceos, Bacchylides and Pindar, who visited his court. A democratic regime was introduced by Thrasybulos (467 BC). The city continued to expand in Sicily, fighting against the rebellious Siculi, and on the Tyrrhenian Sea, making expeditions up to Corsica and Elba. In the late 5th century BC, Syracuse found itself at war with Athens, which sought more resources to fight the Peloponnesian War. The Syracusans enlisted the aid of a general from Sparta, Athens&#x27; foe in the war, to defeat the Athenians, destroy their ships, and leave them to starve on the island (see Sicilian Expedition). In 401 BC, Syracuse contributed a force of 300 hoplites and a general to Cyrus the Younger&#x27;s Army of the Ten Thousand.

Then in the early 4th century BC, the tyrant Dionysius the Elder was again at war against Carthage and, although losing Gela and Camarina, kept that power from capturing the whole of Sicily. After the end of the conflict Dionysius built a massive fortress on Ortygia and 22 km-long walls around all of Syracuse. Another period of expansion saw the destruction of Naxos, Catania and Lentini; then Syracuse entered again in war against Carthage (397 BC). After various changes of fortune, the Carthaginians managed to besiege Syracuse itself, but were eventually pushed back by a pestilence. A treaty in 392 BC allowed Syracuse to enlarge further its possessions, founding the cities of Adranon, Tyndarion and Tauromenos, and conquering Rhegion on the continent. In the Adriatic, to facilitate trade, Dionysius the Elder founded Ancona, Adria and Issa. Apart from his battle deeds, Dionysius was famous as a patron of art, and Plato himself visited Syracuse several times, where Dionysius, offended by Plato&#x27;s daring to disagree with the king, imprisoned the philosopher and sold him into slavery (according to some sources).

His successor was Dionysius the Younger, who was however expelled by Dion in 356 BC. But the latter&#x27;s despotic rule led in turn to his expulsion, and Dionysius reclaimed his throne in 347 BC. Dionysius was besieged in Syracuse by the Syracusan general Hicetas in 344 BC. The following year the Corinthian Timoleon installed a democratic regime in the city after he exiled Dionysius and defeated Hicetas. The long series of internal struggles had weakened Syracuse&#x27;s power on the island, and Timoleon tried to remedy this, defeating the Carthaginians in the Battle of the Crimissus (339 BC).

===Hellenistic period===

After Timoleon&#x27;s death the struggle among the city&#x27;s parties restarted and ended with the rise of another tyrant, Agathocles, who seized power with a coup in 317 BC. He resumed the war against Carthage, with alternate fortunes. He was besieged in Syracuse by the Carthaginians in 311 BC, but he escaped from the city with a small fleet. He scored a moral success, bringing the war to the Carthaginians&#x27; native African soil, inflicting heavy losses to the enemy. The defenders of Syracuse destroyed the Carthaginian army which besieged them. However, Agathocles was eventually defeated in Africa as well. The war ended with another treaty of peace which did not prevent the Carthaginians from interfering in the politics of Syracuse after the death of Agathocles (289 BC). They laid siege to Syracuse for the fourth and last time in 278 BC. They retreated at the arrival of king Pyrrhus of Epirus, whom Syracuse had asked for help. After a brief period under the rule of Epirus, Hiero II seized power in 275 BC.

Hiero inaugurated a period of 50 years of peace and prosperity, in which Syracuse became one of the most renowned capitals of Antiquity. He issued the so-called &quot;Lex Hieronica&quot;, which was later adopted by the Romans for their administration of Sicily; he also had the theatre enlarged and a new immense altar, the &quot;Hiero&#x27;s Ara&quot;, built. Under his rule lived the most famous Syracusan, the mathematician and natural philosopher Archimedes. Among his many inventions were various military engines including the claw of Archimedes, later used to resist the Roman siege of 214–212 BC. Literary figures included Theocritus and others.

Hiero&#x27;s successor, the young Hieronymus (ruled from 215 BC), broke the alliance with the Romans after their defeat at the Battle of Cannae and accepted Carthage&#x27;s support. The Romans, led by consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, besieged the city in 214 BC. The city held out for three years, but fell in 212 BC. The successes of the Syracusians in repelling the Roman siege had made them overconfident. In 212 BC, the Romans received information that the city&#x27;s inhabitants were to participate in the annual festival to their goddess Artemis. A small party of Roman soldiers approached the city under the cover of night and managed to scale the walls to get into the outer city and with reinforcements soon took control, killing Archimedes in the process, but the main fortress remained firm. After an eight-month siege and with parleys in progress, an Iberian captain named Moeriscus is believed to have let the Romans in near the Fountains of Arethusa. On the agreed signal, during a diversionary attack, he opened the gate. After setting guards on the houses of the pro-Roman faction, Marcellus gave Syracuse to plunder.

=== Imperial Roman and Byzantine period ===


Though declining slowly through the years, Syracuse maintained the status of capital of the Roman government of Sicily and seat of the praetor. It remained an important port for trade between the Eastern and the Western parts of the Empire. Christianity spread in the city through the efforts of Paul of Tarsus and Saint Marziano, the first bishop of the city, who made it one of the main centres of proselytism in the West. In the age of Christian persecutions massive catacombs were carved, whose size is second only to those of Rome.

After a period of Vandal rule, 469–477, Syracuse and the island was recovered for Italian rule under Odoacer (476–491) and Theodoric the Great (491–526), and then by Belisarius for the Byzantine Empire (31 December 535). From 663 to 668 Syracuse was the seat of the Greek-speaking Emperor Constans II, as well as a capital of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and metropolis of the whole Sicilian Church. Constans II was assassinated when his plans to permanently replace the Byzantine capital of Constantinople with Syracuse became suspected.

=== Emirate of Sicily ===

The city was besieged by the Aghlabids for almost a year in 827–828, but Byzantine reinforcements prevented its fall. It remained the center of Byzantine resistance to the gradual Muslim conquest of Sicily until it fell to the Aghlabids after another siege on 20/21 May 878. During the two centuries of Muslim rule, the capital of the Emirate of Sicily was moved from Syracuse to Palermo. The cathedral was converted into a mosque and the quarter on the Ortygia island was gradually rebuilt along Islamic styles. The city, nevertheless, maintained important trade relationships, and housed a relatively flourishing cultural and artistic life: several Arab poets, including Ibn Hamdis, the most important Sicilian Arab poet of the 12th century, flourished in the city.

=== Norman kingdom of Sicily ===

In 1038, the Byzantine general George Maniakes reconquered the city, sending the relics of St. Lucy to Constantinople. The eponymous castle on the cape of Ortygia bears his name, although it was built under the Hohenstaufen rule. In 1086, the Normans entered Syracuse, one of the last Arab strongholds, after siege lasting from May to October by Roger I of Sicily and his son Jordan of Hauteville, who was given the city as count. New quarters were built, and the cathedral was restored, as well as other churches.

=== High medieval period ===

In 1194, Emperor Henry VI occupied the Sicilian kingdom, including Syracuse. After a short period of Genoese rule (1205–1220) under the notorious admiral and pirate Alamanno da Costa, which favoured a rise of trades, royal authority was re-asserted in the city by Frederick II. He began the construction of the Castello Maniace, the Bishops&#x27; Palace and the Bellomo Palace. Frederick&#x27;s death brought a period of unrest and feudal anarchy. In the War of the Sicilian Vespers between the Angevin and Aragonese dynasties for control of Sicily, Syracuse sided with the Aragonese and expelled the Angevins in 1298, receiving from the Spanish sovereigns great privileges in reward. The preeminence of baronial families is also shown by the construction of the palaces of Abela, Chiaramonte, Nava, Montalto.

=== 16th–20th centuries ===

The city was struck by two ruinous earthquakes in 1542 and 1693, and a plague in 1729. The 17th century destruction changed the appearance of Syracuse forever, as well as the entire Val di Noto, whose cities were rebuilt along the typical lines of Sicilian Baroque, considered one of the most typical expressions of the architecture of Southern Italy. The spread of cholera in 1837 led to a revolt against the Bourbon government. The punishment was the move of the province capital seat to Noto, but the unrest had not been totally choked, as the Siracusani took part in the Sicilian revolution of 1848.

After the Unification of Italy of 1865, Syracuse regained its status of provincial capital. In the late 19th century, the walls (including Porta Ligny) were demolished and a bridge connecting the mainland to Ortygia island was built. In the following year a railway link was constructed.

=== Modern history ===
Allied bombings in 1943 caused heavy destruction during World War II. &quot;Operation Husky&quot;, the codename for the Allied invasion of Sicily, was launched on the night between 9–10 July 1943 with British forces attacking the southeast of the island. The plan was for the British 5th Infantry Division, part of General Sir Bernard Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army, to capture Syracuse on the first day of the invasion. This part of the operation went completely according to plan, and British forces captured Syracuse on the first night of the operation. The port was then used as a base for the British Royal Navy. To the west of the city is a Commonwealth War Graves cemetery where about 1,000 men are buried. After the end of the war the northern quarters of Syracuse experienced a heavy, often chaotic, expansion, favoured by the quick process of industrialization.

Syracuse today has about 125,000 inhabitants and numerous attractions for the visitor interested in historical sites (such as the Ear of Dionysius). A process of recovering and restoring the historical centre has been ongoing since the 1990s. Nearby places of note include Catania, Noto, Modica and Ragusa. 

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Syracuse experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Snow is infrequent; the last measurable snowfall in the city occurred in December 2014. Frosts are very rare, with the last one also happening in December 2014 when the temperature dropped to the all-time record low of 0 °C.

A temperature of was registered in Floridia, near Syracuse by the Sicilian Agrometeorological Information Service (SAIS) on 11 August 2021, and is recognized by the World Meteorological Organization as the official record highest temperature in Europe. Guido Guidi, lieutenant colonel of the Italian Meteorological Service, however, had stated the highest temperature registered in the organizations&#x27; stations during the heatwave was , at Naval Air Station Sigonella. Guidi underlines that the reported data by SAIS &quot;is produced directly by the stations and is not subject to any control and validation procedure, neither automatic nor manual. It can therefore report errors due to sensor malfunctions as well as maintenance interventions&quot;.

==Government==
== Demographics ==
In 2016, there were 122,051 people residing in Syracuse, located in the province of Syracuse, Sicily, of whom 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 18.9 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 16.9 percent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.1 percent (minors) and 19.9 percent (pensioners). The average age of Syracuse resident is 40 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Syracuse declined by 0.5 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.6 percent. The reason for decline is a population flight to the suburbs, and northern Italy. The current birth rate of Syracuse is 9.75 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

, 97.9% of the population was of Italian descent. The largest immigrant group came from other European nations (particularly those from Poland, and the United Kingdom): 0.6%, North Africa (mostly Tunisian): 0.5%, and South Asia: 0.4%.

== Tourism ==

Since 2005, the entire city of Syracuse, along with the Necropolis of Pantalica which falls within the province of Syracuse, has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This programme aims to catalogue, name, and conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humanity. The deciding committee which evaluates potential candidates described their reasons for choosing Syracuse because &quot;monuments and archeological sites situated in Syracuse are the finest example of outstanding architectural creation spanning several cultural aspects; Greek, Roman and Baroque&quot;, following on that Ancient Syracuse was &quot;directly linked to events, ideas and literary works of outstanding universal significance&quot;.

Only traces of the scene and the orchestra remain. The edifice (still used today) was modified by the Romans, who adapted it to their different style of spectacles, including also circus games. Near the theatre are the &quot;latomìe&quot;, stone quarries, also used as prisons in ancient times. The most famous &quot;latomìa&quot; is the &quot;Orecchio di Dionisio&quot; (&quot;Ear of Dionysius&quot;).

Syracuse is home to association football club A.S.D. Città di Siracusa, the latest reincarnation of several clubs dating back to 1924. The common feature is the azure shirts, hence the nickname &quot;Azzurri&quot;. Siracusa play at the Stadio Nicola De Simone with an approximate capacity between 5,000 and 6,000.

<text>In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.

Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
# The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
# The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Although some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest-performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.

== History and concepts ==
From the beginning of computing, the sorting problem has attracted a great deal of research, perhaps due to the complexity of solving it efficiently despite its simple, familiar statement. Among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was Betty Holberton, who worked on ENIAC and UNIVAC. Bubble sort was analyzed as early as 1956. Asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century new algorithms are still being invented, with the widely used Timsort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006.

Comparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of Ω(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) comparisons (some input sequences will require a multiple of &quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot; comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array to be sorted). Algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance.

Sorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes, where the abundance of algorithms for the problem provides a gentle introduction to a variety of core algorithm concepts, such as big O notation, divide-and-conquer algorithms, data structures such as heaps and binary trees, randomized algorithms, best, worst and average case analysis, time–space tradeoffs, and upper and lower bounds.

Sorting small arrays optimally (in the fewest comparisons and swaps) or fast (i.e. taking into account machine-specific details) is still an open research problem, with solutions only known for very small arrays (&lt;20 elements). Similarly optimal (by various definitions) sorting on a parallel machine is an open research topic.

== Classification ==
Sorting algorithms can be classified by:
* Computational complexity
** Best, worst and average case behavior in terms of the size of the list. For typical serial sorting algorithms, good behavior is O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), with parallel sort in O(log2 &quot;n&quot;), and bad behavior is O(&quot;n&quot;2). Ideal behavior for a serial sort is O(&quot;n&quot;), but this is not possible in the average case. Optimal parallel sorting is O(log &quot;n&quot;).
** Swaps for &quot;in-place&quot; algorithms.
* Memory usage (and use of other computer resources). In particular, some sorting algorithms are &quot;in-place&quot;. Strictly, an in-place sort needs only O(1) memory beyond the items being sorted; sometimes O(log &quot;n&quot;) additional memory is considered &quot;in-place&quot;.
* Recursion: Some algorithms are either recursive or non-recursive, while others may be both (e.g., merge sort).
* Stability: stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e., values).
* Whether or not they are a comparison sort. A comparison sort examines the data only by comparing two elements with a comparison operator.
* General method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging, &quot;etc.&quot; Exchange sorts include bubble sort and quicksort. Selection sorts include cycle sort and heapsort.
* Whether the algorithm is serial or parallel. The remainder of this discussion almost exclusively concentrates on serial algorithms and assumes serial operation.
* Adaptability: Whether or not the presortedness of the input affects the running time. Algorithms that take this into account are known to be adaptive.
* Online: An algorithm such as Insertion Sort that is online can sort a constant stream of input.

=== Stability ===
Stable sort algorithms sort equal elements in the same order that they appear in the input. For example, in the card sorting example to the right, the cards are being sorted by their rank, and their suit is being ignored. This allows the possibility of multiple different correctly sorted versions of the original list. Stable sorting algorithms choose one of these, according to the following rule: if two items compare as equal (like the two 5 cards), then their relative order will be preserved, i.e. if one comes before the other in the input, it will come before the other in the output.

Stability is important to preserve order over multiple sorts on the same data set. For example, say that student records consisting of name and class section are sorted dynamically, first by name, then by class section. If a stable sorting algorithm is used in both cases, the sort-by-class-section operation will not change the name order; with an unstable sort, it could be that sorting by section shuffles the name order, resulting in a nonalphabetical list of students.

More formally, the data being sorted can be represented as a record or tuple of values, and the part of the data that is used for sorting is called the &quot;key&quot;. In the card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and the key is the rank. A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.

When equal elements are indistinguishable, such as with integers, or more generally, any data where the entire element is the key, stability is not an issue. Stability is also not an issue if all keys are different.

Unstable sorting algorithms can be specially implemented to be stable. One way of doing this is to artificially extend the key comparison so that comparisons between two objects with otherwise equal keys are decided using the order of the entries in the original input list as a tie-breaker. Remembering this order, however, may require additional time and space.

One application for stable sorting algorithms is sorting a list using a primary and secondary key. For example, suppose we wish to sort a hand of cards such that the suits are in the order clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), spades (♠), and within each suit, the cards are sorted by rank. This can be done by first sorting the cards by rank (using any sort), and then doing a stable sort by suit:

Within each suit, the stable sort preserves the ordering by rank that was already done. This idea can be extended to any number of keys and is utilised by radix sort. The same effect can be achieved with an unstable sort by using a lexicographic key comparison, which, e.g., compares first by suit, and then compares by rank if the suits are the same.

== Comparison of algorithms ==
This analysis assumes that the length of each key is constant and that all comparisons, swaps and other operations can proceed in constant time.

Legend:
* is the number of records to be sorted.
* Comparison column has the following ranking classifications: &quot;Best&quot;, &quot;Average&quot; and &quot;Worst&quot; if the time complexity is given for each case. 
* &quot;Memory&quot; denotes the amount of additional storage required by the algorithm.
* The run times and the memory requirements listed are inside big O notation, hence the base of the logarithms does not matter.
* The notation means .

=== Comparison sorts ===
Below is a table of comparison sorts. Mathematical analysis demonstrates a comparison sort cannot perform better than on average.

=== Non-comparison sorts ===
The following table describes integer sorting algorithms and other sorting algorithms that are not comparison sorts. These algorithms are not limited to &quot;Ω&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) unless meet unit-cost random-access machine model as described below. 

* Complexities below assume items to be sorted, with keys of size , digit size , and the range of numbers to be sorted. 
* Many of them are based on the assumption that the key size is large enough that all entries have unique key values, and hence that , where ≪ means &quot;much less than&quot;. 
* In the unit-cost random-access machine model, algorithms with running time of formula_1, such as radix sort, still take time proportional to , because is limited to be not more than formula_2, and a larger number of elements to sort would require a bigger in order to store them in the memory.


Samplesort can be used to parallelize any of the non-comparison sorts, by efficiently distributing data into several buckets and then passing down sorting to several processors, with no need to merge as buckets are already sorted between each other.

=== Others ===
Some algorithms are slow compared to those discussed above, such as the bogosort with unbounded run time and the stooge sort which has &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2.7) run time. These sorts are usually described for educational purposes to demonstrate how the run time of algorithms is estimated. The following table describes some sorting algorithms that are impractical for real-life use in traditional software contexts due to extremely poor performance or specialized hardware requirements.
Theoretical computer scientists have detailed other sorting algorithms that provide better than &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time complexity assuming additional constraints, including:
* Thorup&#x27;s algorithm, a randomized algorithm for sorting keys from a domain of finite size, taking time and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space.
* A randomized integer sorting algorithm taking formula_3 expected time and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space.
* One of the authors of the previously mentioned algorithm also claims to have discovered an algorithm taking formula_4 time and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space, sorting real numbers. Further claiming that, without any added assumptions on the input, it can be modified to achieve formula_5 time and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) space.

== Popular sorting algorithms ==
While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate. Insertion sort is widely used for small data sets, while for large data sets an asymptotically efficient sort is used, primarily heapsort, merge sort, or quicksort. Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists at the bottom of a recursion. Highly tuned implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heapsort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in .NET.

For more restricted data, such as numbers in a fixed interval, distribution sorts such as counting sort or radix sort are widely used. Bubble sort and variants are rarely used in practice, but are commonly found in teaching and theoretical discussions.

When physically sorting objects (such as alphabetizing papers, tests or books) people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple bucketing allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects out on the floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance – locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heapsort or quicksort, are poorly suited for human use. Other algorithms, such as library sort, a variant of insertion sort that leaves spaces, are also practical for physical use.

=== Simple sorts ===
Two of the simplest sorts are insertion sort and selection sort, both of which are efficient on small data, due to low overhead, but not efficient on large data. Insertion sort is generally faster than selection sort in practice, due to fewer comparisons and good performance on almost-sorted data, and thus is preferred in practice, but selection sort uses fewer writes, and thus is used when write performance is a limiting factor.

==== Insertion sort ====

&quot;Insertion sort&quot; is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list similar to how one puts money in their wallet. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array&#x27;s space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. Shellsort is a variant of insertion sort that is more efficient for larger lists.

==== Selection sort ====

&quot;Selection sort&quot; is an in-place comparison sort. It has O(&quot;n&quot;2) complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and also has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations.

The algorithm finds the minimum value, swaps it with the value in the first position, and repeats these steps for the remainder of the list. It does no more than &quot;n&quot; swaps and thus is useful where swapping is very expensive.

=== Efficient sorts ===
Practical general sorting algorithms are almost always based on an algorithm with average time complexity (and generally worst-case complexity) O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), of which the most common are heapsort, merge sort, and quicksort. Each has advantages and drawbacks, with the most significant being that simple implementation of merge sort uses O(&quot;n&quot;) additional space, and simple implementation of quicksort has O(&quot;n&quot;2) worst-case complexity. These problems can be solved or ameliorated at the cost of a more complex algorithm.

While these algorithms are asymptotically efficient on random data, for practical efficiency on real-world data various modifications are used. First, the overhead of these algorithms becomes significant on smaller data, so often a hybrid algorithm is used, commonly switching to insertion sort once the data is small enough. Second, the algorithms often perform poorly on already sorted data or almost sorted data – these are common in real-world data and can be sorted in O(&quot;n&quot;) time by appropriate algorithms. Finally, they may also be unstable, and stability is often a desirable property in a sort. Thus more sophisticated algorithms are often employed, such as Timsort (based on merge sort) or introsort (based on quicksort, falling back to heapsort).

==== Merge sort ====

&quot;Merge sort&quot; takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list. It starts by comparing every two elements (i.e., 1 with 2, then 3 with 4...) and swapping them if the first should come after the second. It then merges each of the resulting lists of two into lists of four, then merges those lists of four, and so on; until at last two lists are merged into the final sorted list. Of the algorithms described here, this is the first that scales well to very large lists, because its worst-case running time is O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;). It is also easily applied to lists, not only arrays, as it only requires sequential access, not random access. However, it has additional O(&quot;n&quot;) space complexity and involves a large number of copies in simple implementations.

Merge sort has seen a relatively recent surge in popularity for practical implementations, due to its use in the sophisticated algorithm Timsort, which is used for the standard sort routine in the programming languages Python and Java (as of JDK7). Merge sort itself is the standard routine in Perl, among others, and has been used in Java at least since 2000 in JDK1.3.

==== Heapsort ====

&quot;Heapsort&quot; is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log &quot;n&quot;) time, instead of O(&quot;n&quot;) for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time, and this is also the worst-case complexity.

==== Quicksort ====

&quot;Quicksort&quot; is a divide-and-conquer algorithm which relies on a &quot;partition&quot; operation: to partition an array, an element called a &quot;pivot&quot; is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted. This yields an average time complexity of O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), with low overhead, and thus this is a popular algorithm. Efficient implementations of quicksort (with in-place partitioning) are typically unstable sorts and somewhat complex but are among the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. Together with its modest O(log &quot;n&quot;) space usage, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and is available in many standard programming libraries.

The important caveat about quicksort is that its worst-case performance is O(&quot;n&quot;2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(&quot;n&quot;2) performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(&quot;n&quot;) operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) performance.

If a guarantee of O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) performance is important, there is a simple modification to achieve that. The idea, due to Musser, is to set a limit on the maximum depth of recursion. If that limit is exceeded, then sorting is continued using the heapsort algorithm. Musser proposed that the limit should be formula_6, which is approximately twice the maximum recursion depth one would expect on average with a randomly ordered array.

==== Shellsort ====
&quot;Shellsort&quot; was invented by Donald Shell in 1959. It improves upon insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. The concept behind Shellsort is that insertion sort performs in time, where k is the greatest distance between two out-of-place elements. This means that generally, they perform in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2), but for data that is mostly sorted, with only a few elements out of place, they perform faster. So, by first sorting elements far away, and progressively shrinking the gap between the elements to sort, the final sort computes much faster. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort.

The worst-case time complexity of Shellsort is an open problem and depends on the gap sequence used, with known complexities ranging from &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;4/3) and Θ(&quot;n&quot; log2 &quot;n&quot;). This, combined with the fact that Shellsort is in-place, only needs a relatively small amount of code, and does not require use of the call stack, makes it is useful in situations where memory is at a premium, such as in embedded systems and operating system kernels.

=== Bubble sort and variants ===
Bubble sort, and variants such as the Comb sort and cocktail sort, are simple, highly inefficient sorting algorithms. They are frequently seen in introductory texts due to ease of analysis, but they are rarely used in practice.

==== Bubble sort ====

&quot;Bubble sort&quot; is a simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. This algorithm&#x27;s average time and worst-case performance is O(&quot;n&quot;2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort&#x27;s exchange will get them in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2&quot;n&quot; time.

==== Comb sort ====

&quot;Comb sort&quot; is a relatively simple sorting algorithm based on bubble sort and originally designed by Włodzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980. It was later rediscovered and popularized by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box with a &quot;Byte&quot; Magazine article published in April 1991. The basic idea is to eliminate &quot;turtles&quot;, or small values near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting down tremendously. (&quot;Rabbits&quot;, large values around the beginning of the list, do not pose a problem in bubble sort) It accomplishes this by initially swapping elements that are a certain distance from one another in the array, rather than only swapping elements if they are adjacent to one another, and then shrinking the chosen distance until it is operating as a normal bubble sort. Thus, if Shellsort can be thought of as a generalized version of insertion sort that swaps elements spaced a certain distance away from one another, comb sort can be thought of as the same generalization applied to bubble sort.

==== Exchange sort ====
&quot;Exchange sort&quot; is sometimes confused with bubble sort, although the algorithms are in fact distinct. Exchange sort works by comparing the first element with all elements above it, swapping where needed, thereby guaranteeing that the first element is correct for the final sort order; it then proceeds to do the same for the second element, and so on. It lacks the advantage that bubble sort has of detecting in one pass if the list is already sorted, but it can be faster than bubble sort by a constant factor (one less pass over the data to be sorted; half as many total comparisons) in worst-case situations. Like any simple O(&quot;n&quot;2) sort it can be reasonably fast over very small data sets, though in general insertion sort will be faster.

=== Distribution sorts ===

&quot;Distribution sort&quot; refers to any sorting algorithm where data is distributed from their input to multiple intermediate structures which are then gathered and placed on the output. For example, both bucket sort and flashsort are distribution-based sorting algorithms. Distribution sorting algorithms can be used on a single processor, or they can be a distributed algorithm, where individual subsets are separately sorted on different processors, then combined. This allows external sorting of data too large to fit into a single computer&#x27;s memory.

==== Counting sort ====

Counting sort is applicable when each input is known to belong to a particular set, &quot;S&quot;, of possibilities. The algorithm runs in O(|&quot;S&quot;| + &quot;n&quot;) time and O(|&quot;S&quot;|) memory where &quot;n&quot; is the length of the input. It works by creating an integer array of size |&quot;S&quot;| and using the &quot;i&quot;th bin to count the occurrences of the &quot;i&quot;th member of &quot;S&quot; in the input. Each input is then counted by incrementing the value of its corresponding bin. Afterward, the counting array is looped through to arrange all of the inputs in order. This sorting algorithm often cannot be used because &quot;S&quot; needs to be reasonably small for the algorithm to be efficient, but it is extremely fast and demonstrates great asymptotic behavior as &quot;n&quot; increases. It also can be modified to provide stable behavior.

==== Bucket sort ====

Bucket sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that generalizes counting sort by partitioning an array into a finite number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.

A bucket sort works best when the elements of the data set are evenly distributed across all buckets.

==== Radix sort ====

&quot;Radix sort&quot; is an algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. &quot;n&quot; numbers consisting of &quot;k&quot; digits each are sorted in O(&quot;n&quot; · &quot;k&quot;) time. Radix sort can process digits of each number either starting from the least significant digit (LSD) or starting from the most significant digit (MSD). The LSD algorithm first sorts the list by the least significant digit while preserving their relative order using a stable sort. Then it sorts them by the next digit, and so on from the least significant to the most significant, ending up with a sorted list. While the LSD radix sort requires the use of a stable sort, the MSD radix sort algorithm does not (unless stable sorting is desired). In-place MSD radix sort is not stable. It is common for the counting sort algorithm to be used internally by the radix sort. A hybrid sorting approach, such as using insertion sort for small bins, improves performance of radix sort significantly.

== Memory usage patterns and index sorting ==
When the size of the array to be sorted approaches or exceeds the available primary memory, so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the number of passes and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at system bus speed (or, with caching, even at CPU speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.

For example, the popular recursive quicksort algorithm provides quite reasonable performance with adequate RAM, but due to the recursive way that it copies portions of the array it becomes much less practical when the array does not fit in RAM, because it may cause a number of slow copy or move operations to and from disk. In that scenario, another algorithm may be preferable even if it requires more total comparisons.

One way to work around this problem, which works well when complex records (such as in a relational database) are being sorted by a relatively small key field, is to create an index into the array and then sort the index, rather than the entire array. (A sorted version of the entire array can then be produced with one pass, reading from the index, but often even that is unnecessary, as having the sorted index is adequate.) Because the index is much smaller than the entire array, it may fit easily in memory where the entire array would not, effectively eliminating the disk-swapping problem. This procedure is sometimes called &quot;tag sort&quot;.

Another technique for overcoming the memory-size problem is using external sorting, for example, one of the ways is to combine two algorithms in a way that takes advantage of the strength of each to improve overall performance. For instance, the array might be subdivided into chunks of a size that will fit in RAM, the contents of each chunk sorted using an efficient algorithm (such as quicksort), and the results merged using a &quot;k&quot;-way merge similar to that used in merge sort. This is faster than performing either merge sort or quicksort over the entire list.

Techniques can also be combined. For sorting very large sets of data that vastly exceed system memory, even the index may need to be sorted using an algorithm or combination of algorithms designed to perform reasonably with virtual memory, i.e., to reduce the amount of swapping required.

== Related algorithms ==
Related problems include approximate sorting (sorting a sequence to within a certain amount of the correct order), partial sorting (sorting only the &quot;k&quot; smallest elements of a list, or finding the &quot;k&quot; smallest elements, but unordered) and selection (computing the &quot;k&quot;th smallest element). These can be solved inefficiently by a total sort, but more efficient algorithms exist, often derived by generalizing a sorting algorithm. The most notable example is quickselect, which is related to quicksort. Conversely, some sorting algorithms can be derived by repeated application of a selection algorithm; quicksort and quickselect can be seen as the same pivoting move, differing only in whether one recurses on both sides (quicksort, divide-and-conquer) or one side (quickselect, decrease-and-conquer).

A kind of opposite of a sorting algorithm is a shuffling algorithm. These are fundamentally different because they require a source of random numbers. Shuffling can also be implemented by a sorting algorithm, namely by a random sort: assigning a random number to each element of the list and then sorting based on the random numbers. This is generally not done in practice, however, and there is a well-known simple and efficient algorithm for shuffling: the Fisher–Yates shuffle.

Sorting algorithms are ineffective for finding an order in many situations. Usually, when elements have no reliable comparison function (crowdsourced preferences like voting systems), comparisons are very costly (sports), or when it would be impossible to pairwise compare all elements for all criteria (search engines). In these cases, the problem is usually referred to as &quot;ranking&quot; and the goal is to find the &quot;best&quot; result for some criteria according to probabilities inferred from comparisons or rankings. A common example is in chess, where players are ranked with the Elo rating system, and rankings are determined by a tournament system instead of a sorting algorithm.
