<text>Silver is a chemical element; it has symbol Ag (, derived from Proto-Indo-European ) and atomic number 47. A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. Silver is found in the Earth&#x27;s crust in the pure, free elemental form (&quot;native silver&quot;), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is a naturally occurring element. It is found in the environment combined with other elements such as sulfide, chloride, and nitrate. Pure silver is “silver” colored, but silver nitrate and silver chloride are powdery white and silver sulfide and silver oxide are dark-gray to black. Silver is often found as a by-product during the retrieval of copper, lead, zinc, and gold ores.

Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as &quot;0.940 fine&quot;. As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.

Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term &quot;silverware&quot;), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialised mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialised confectionery. Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film. Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments.

==Characteristics==
Silver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in group 11 of the periodic table: copper, and gold. Its 47 electrons are arranged in the configuration [Kr]4d105s1, similarly to copper ([Ar]3d104s1) and gold ([Xe]4f145d106s1); group 11 is one of the few groups in the d-block which has a completely consistent set of electron configurations. This distinctive electron configuration, with a single electron in the highest occupied s subshell over a filled d subshell, accounts for many of the singular properties of metallic silver.

Silver is a relatively soft and extremely ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallises in a face-centred cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is delocalised, similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.

Silver has a brilliant, white, metallic luster that can take a high polish, and which is so characteristic that the name of the metal itself has become a color name. Protected silver has greater optical reflectivity than aluminium at all wavelengths longer than ~450 nm. At wavelengths shorter than 450 nm, silver&#x27;s reflectivity is inferior to that of aluminium and drops to zero near 310 nm.

Very high electrical and thermal conductivity are common to the elements in group 11, because their single s electron is free and does not interact with the filled d subshell, as such interactions (which occur in the preceding transition metals) lower electron mobility. The thermal conductivity of silver is among the highest of all materials, although the thermal conductivity of carbon (in the diamond allotrope) and superfluid helium-4 are higher. The electrical conductivity of silver is the highest of all metals, greater even than copper. Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal. Silver is rarely used for its electrical conductivity, due to its high cost, although an exception is in radio-frequency engineering, particularly at VHF and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors rather than through the interior. During World War II in the US, tons of silver were used for the electromagnets in calutrons for enriching uranium, mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper.

Silver readily forms alloys with copper, gold, and zinc. Zinc-silver alloys with low zinc concentration may be considered as face-centred cubic solid solutions of zinc in silver, as the structure of the silver is largely unchanged while the electron concentration rises as more zinc is added. Increasing the electron concentration further leads to body-centred cubic (electron concentration 1.5), complex cubic (1.615), and hexagonal close-packed phases (1.75).

===Isotopes===
Naturally occurring silver is composed of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because of the importance of silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).

Twenty-eight radioisotopes have been characterised, the most stable being 105Ag with a half-life of 41.29 days, 111Ag with a half-life of 7.45 days, and 112Ag with a half-life of 3.13 hours. Silver has numerous nuclear isomers, the most stable being 108mAg (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 418 years), 110mAg (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 249.79 days) and 106mAg (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 8.28 days). All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives of less than three minutes.

Isotopes of silver range in relative atomic mass from 92.950 u (93Ag) to 129.950 u (130Ag); the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope, 107Ag, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay. The primary decay products before 107Ag are palladium (element 46) isotopes, and the primary products after are cadmium (element 48) isotopes.

The palladium isotope 107Pd decays by beta emission to 107Ag with a half-life of 6.5 million years. Iron meteorites are the only objects with a high-enough palladium-to-silver ratio to yield measurable variations in 107Ag abundance. Radiogenic 107Ag was first discovered in the Santa Clara meteorite in 1978. 107Pd–107Ag correlations observed in bodies that have clearly been melted since the accretion of the Solar System must reflect the presence of unstable nuclides in the early Solar System.

==Chemistry==

Silver is a rather unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the electrochemical series (&quot;E&quot;0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799 V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionisation energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionisation energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilise. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, with silver this effect is swamped by its larger second ionisation energy. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidises water.

Most silver compounds have significant covalent character due to the small size and high first ionisation energy (730.8 kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver&#x27;s Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher than that of lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6 kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8 kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0 kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of π-acceptor ligands.

Silver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by alchemists as a noble metal, along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). While silver is not attacked by non-oxidising acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.

The three main forms of deterioration in historical silver artifacts are tarnishing, formation of silver chloride due to long-term immersion in salt water, as well as reaction with nitrate ions or oxygen. Fresh silver chloride is pale yellow, becoming purplish on exposure to light; it projects slightly from the surface of the artifact or coin. The precipitation of copper in ancient silver can be used to date artifacts, as copper is nearly always a constituent of silver alloys.

Silver metal is attacked by strong oxidant such as potassium permanganate () and potassium dichromate (), and in the presence of potassium bromide (). These compounds are used in photography to bleach silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with thiosulfate or redeveloped to intensify the original image. Silver forms cyanide complexes (silver cyanide) that are soluble in water in the presence of an excess of cyanide ions. Silver cyanide solutions are used in electroplating of silver.

The common oxidation states of silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and even very rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4). The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidising agent, krypton difluoride.

==Compounds==
===Oxides and chalcogenides===

Silver and gold have rather low chemical affinities for oxygen, lower than copper, and it is therefore expected that silver oxides are thermally quite unstable. Soluble silver(I) salts precipitate dark-brown silver(I) oxide, Ag2O, upon the addition of alkali. (The hydroxide AgOH exists only in solution; otherwise it spontaneously decomposes to the oxide.) Silver(I) oxide is very easily reduced to metallic silver, and decomposes to silver and oxygen above 160 °C. This and other silver(I) compounds may be oxidised by the strong oxidising agent peroxodisulfate to black AgO, a mixed silver(I,III) oxide of formula AgIAgIIIO2. Some other mixed oxides with silver in non-integral oxidation states, namely Ag2O3 and Ag3O4, are also known, as is Ag3O which behaves as a metallic conductor.

Silver(I) sulfide, Ag2S, is very readily formed from its constituent elements and is the cause of the black tarnish on some old silver objects. It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.

===Halides===
The only known dihalide of silver is the difluoride, AgF2, which can be obtained from the elements under heat. A strong yet thermally stable and therefore safe fluorinating agent, silver(II) fluoride is often used to synthesise hydrofluorocarbons.

In stark contrast to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic zinc blende structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the colour changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small that it has a considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography. The reaction involved is:
:X− + &quot;hν&quot; → X + e− (excitation of the halide ion, which gives up its extra electron into the conduction band)
:Ag+ + e− → Ag (liberation of a silver ion, which gains an electron to become a silver atom)

The process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site, so that the electron&#x27;s energy is lowered enough that it is &quot;trapped&quot;.

===Other inorganic compounds===
White silver nitrate, AgNO3, is a versatile precursor to many other silver compounds, especially the halides, and is much less sensitive to light. It was once called &quot;lunar caustic&quot; because silver was called &quot;luna&quot; by the ancient alchemists, who believed that silver was associated with the Moon. It is often used for gravimetric analysis, exploiting the insolubility of the heavier silver halides which it is a common precursor to. Silver nitrate is used in many ways in organic synthesis, e.g. for deprotection and oxidations. Ag+ binds alkenes reversibly, and silver nitrate has been used to separate mixtures of alkenes by selective absorption. The resulting adduct can be decomposed with ammonia to release the free alkene.

Yellow silver carbonate, Ag2CO3 can be easily prepared by reacting aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate with a deficiency of silver nitrate. Its principal use is for the production of silver powder for use in microelectronics. It is reduced with formaldehyde, producing silver free of alkali metals:
:Ag2CO3 + CH2O → 2 Ag + 2 CO2 + H2

Silver carbonate is also used as a reagent in organic synthesis such as the Koenigs–Knorr reaction. In the Fétizon oxidation, silver carbonate on celite acts as an oxidising agent to form lactones from diols. It is also employed to convert alkyl bromides into alcohols.

Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive explosive used in percussion caps, is made by reaction of silver metal with nitric acid in the presence of ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.

===Coordination compounds===

Silver complexes tend to be similar to those of its lighter homologue copper. Silver(III) complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate [Ag(IO5OH)2]5− and tellurate [Ag{TeO4(OH)2}2]5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic [AgF4]− is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.

Silver(II) complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilised in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as [Ag(py)4]2+ and [Ag(bipy)2]2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. [AgF4]2− is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with &quot;N&quot;- or &quot;O&quot;-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.

By far the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarised such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion [Ag(H2O)4]+ is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form [Ag(NH3)2]+; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex [Ag(S2O3)2]3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex [Ag(CN)2]−. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag–C≡N→Ag–C≡N→}; silver thiocyanate has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp3-hybridized sulfur atom. Chelating ligands are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral diphosphine and diarsine complexes [Ag(L–L)2]+.

===Organometallic===

Under standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag–C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6–15 K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)3, which dimerises at 25–30 K, probably by forming Ag–Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [Ag(CO)] [B(OTeF5)4] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with alkenes and alkynes are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the platinum complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak &quot;π&quot; bonding in group 11. Ag–C &quot;σ&quot; bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (−50 °C) and CuMe (−15 °C) as well as those of PhAg (74 °C) and PhCu (100 °C).

The C–Ag bond is stabilised by perfluoroalkyl ligands, for example in AgCF(CF3)2. Alkenylsilver compounds are also more stable than their alkylsilver counterparts. Silver-NHC complexes are easily prepared, and are commonly used to prepare other NHC complexes by displacing labile ligands. For example, the reaction of the bis(NHC)silver(I) complex with bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride or chlorido(dimethyl sulfide)gold(I):

===Intermetallic===

Silver forms alloys with most other elements on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with silver in the condensed phase and form intermetallic compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry comes from the fact that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).

Most other binary alloys are of little use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental amalgams are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys are very important in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in hot water.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;silver&quot; appears in Old English in various spellings, such as and . It is cognate with Old High German ; Gothic ; or Old Norse , all ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic &quot;*silubra&quot;. The Balto-Slavic words for silver are rather similar to the Germanic ones (e.g. Russian [], Polish , Lithuanian ), as is the Celtiberian form &quot;silabur&quot;. They may have a common Indo-European origin, although their morphology rather suggest a non-Indo-European &quot;Wanderwort&quot;. Some scholars have thus proposed a Paleo-Hispanic origin, pointing to the Basque form as an evidence.

The chemical symbol Ag is from the Latin word for &quot;silver&quot;, &quot;&quot; (compare Ancient Greek , ), from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;h₂erǵ-&quot; (formerly reconstructed as &quot;*arǵ-&quot;), meaning or . This was the usual Proto-Indo-European word for the metal, whose reflexes are missing in Germanic and Balto-Slavic.

==History==
Silver was known in prehistoric times: the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering. Unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy, on account of its low structural strength; it was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.

The situation changed with the discovery of cupellation, a technique that allowed silver metal to be extracted from its ores. While slag heaps found in Asia Minor and on the islands of the Aegean Sea indicate that silver was being separated from lead as early as the 4th millennium BC, and one of the earliest silver extraction centres in Europe was Sardinia in the early Chalcolithic period, these techniques did not spread widely until later,
when it spread throughout the region and beyond. The origins of silver production in India, China, and Japan were almost certainly equally ancient, but are not well-documented due to their great age.
When the Phoenicians first came to what is now Spain, they obtained so much silver that they could not fit it all on their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead. By the time of the Greek and Roman civilisations, silver coins were a staple of the economy: the Greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the 7th century BC, and the rise of Athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at Laurium, from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC. The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver stock of 10,000 tonnes circulated in the Roman economy in the middle of the second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate around AD 800. The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of Charlemagne: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.

Central Europe became the centre of silver production during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. Silver mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Schwaz, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in silver and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native silver were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, but a few of them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of silver was around a meagre 50 tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilisations as early as AD 60–120; silver deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.

With the discovery of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around the beginning of the 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. The silver trade gave way to a global network of exchange. As one historian put it, silver &quot;went round the world and made the world go round.&quot; Much of this silver ended up in the hands of the Chinese. A Portuguese merchant in 1621 noted that silver &quot;wanders throughout all the world... before flocking to China, where it remains as if at its natural centre&quot;. Still, much of it went to Spain, allowing Spanish rulers to pursue military and political ambitions in both Europe and the Americas. &quot;New World mines&quot;, concluded several historians, &quot;supported the Spanish empire.&quot;

In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after the discovery of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.

==Symbolic role==

Silver plays a certain role in mythology and has found various usage as a metaphor and in folklore. The Greek poet Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; (lines 109–201) lists different ages of man named after metals like gold, silver, bronze and iron to account for successive ages of humanity. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; contains another retelling of the story, containing an illustration of silver&#x27;s metaphorical use of signifying the second-best in a series, better than bronze but worse than gold:

In folklore, silver was commonly thought to have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper &quot;No Silver Bullet.&quot; Other powers attributed to silver include detection of poison and facilitation of passage into the mythical realm of fairies.

Silver production has also inspired figurative language. Clear references to cupellation occur throughout the Old Testament of the Bible, such as in Jeremiah&#x27;s rebuke to Judah: &quot;The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.&quot; (Jeremiah 6:19–20) Jeremiah was also aware of sheet silver, exemplifying the malleability and ductility of the metal: &quot;Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.&quot; (Jeremiah 10:9)

Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas. Ethically, silver also symbolizes greed and degradation of consciousness; this is the negative aspect, the perverting of its value.

==Occurrence and production==
The abundance of silver in the Earth&#x27;s crust is 0.08 parts per million, almost exactly the same as that of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales. Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary period vulcanism.

The principal sources of silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, and are still major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada). In Central Asia, Tajikistan is known to have some of the largest silver deposits in the world.

Silver is usually found in nature combined with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally in the form of sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327 °C, lead oxide at 888 °C and silver melts at 960 °C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960 °C to 1000 °C in an oxidising environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.
: (s) + 2(s) + (g) → 2(absorbed) + Ag(l)

Today, silver metal is primarily produced instead as a secondary byproduct of electrolytic refining of copper, lead, and zinc, and by application of the Parkes process on lead bullion from ore that also contains silver. In such processes, silver follows the non-ferrous metal in question through its concentration and smelting, and is later purified out. For example, in copper production, purified copper is electrolytically deposited on the cathode, while the less reactive precious metals such as silver and gold collect under the anode as the so-called &quot;anode slime&quot;. This is then separated and purified of base metals by treatment with hot aerated dilute sulfuric acid and heating with lime or silica flux, before the silver is purified to over 99.9% purity via electrolysis in nitrate solution.

Commercial-grade fine silver is at least 99.9% pure, and purities greater than 99.999% are available. In 2022, Mexico was the top producer of silver (6,300 tonnes or 24.2% of the world&#x27;s total of 26,000 t), followed by China (3,600 t) and Peru (3,100 t).

Silver concentration is low in seawater (pmol/L). Levels vary by depth and between water bodies. Dissolved silver concentrations range from 0.3 pmol/L in coastal surface waters to 22.8 pmol/L in pelagic deep waters. Analysing the presence and dynamics of silver in marine environments is difficult due to these particularly low concentrations and complex interactions in the environment. Although a rare trace metal, concentrations are greatly impacted by fluvial, aeolian, atmospheric, and upwelling inputs, as well as anthropogenic inputs via discharge, waste disposal, and emissions from industrial companies. Other internal processes such as decomposition of organic matter may be a source of dissolved silver in deeper waters, which feeds into some surface waters through upwelling and vertical mixing.

In the Atlantic and Pacific, silver concentrations are minimal at the surface but rise in deeper waters. Silver is taken up by plankton in the photic zone, remobilized with depth, and enriched in deep waters. Silver is transported from the Atlantic to the other oceanic water masses. In North Pacific waters, silver is remobilised at a slower rate and increasingly enriched compared to deep Atlantic waters. Silver has increasing concentrations that follow the major oceanic conveyor belt that cycles water and nutrients from the North Atlantic to the South Atlantic to the North Pacific.

There is not an extensive amount of data focused on how marine life is affected by silver despite the likely deleterious effects it could have on organisms through bioaccumulation, association with particulate matters, and sorption. Not until about 1984 did scientists begin to understand the chemical characteristics of silver and the potential toxicity. In fact, mercury is the only other trace metal that surpasses the toxic effects of silver; the full silver toxicity extent is not expected in oceanic conditions because of its tendency to transfer into nonreactive biological compounds.

In one study, the presence of excess ionic silver and silver nanoparticles caused bioaccumulation effects on zebrafish organs and altered the chemical pathways within their gills. In addition, very early experimental studies demonstrated how the toxic effects of silver fluctuate with salinity and other parameters, as well as between life stages and different species such as finfish, molluscs, and crustaceans. Another study found raised concentrations of silver in the muscles and liver of dolphins and whales, indicating pollution of this metal within recent decades. Silver is not an easy metal for an organism to eliminate and elevated concentrations can cause death.

==Monetary use==

The earliest known coins were minted in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor around 600 BC. The coins of Lydia were made of electrum, which is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, that was available within the territory of Lydia. Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century. Notable silver coins through the centuries include the Greek drachma, the Roman denarius, the Islamic dirham, the karshapana from ancient India and rupee from the time of the Mughal Empire (grouped with copper and gold coins to create a trimetallic standard), and the Spanish dollar.

The ratio between the amount of silver used for coinage and that used for other purposes has fluctuated greatly over time; for example, in wartime, more silver tends to have been used for coinage to finance the war.

Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 currency code XAG, one of only four precious metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.

===Price===
Silver prices are normally quoted in troy ounces. One troy ounce is equal to . The London silver fix is published every working day at noon London time. This price is determined by several major international banks and is used by London bullion market members for trading that day. Prices are most commonly shown as the United States dollar (USD), the Pound sterling (GBP), and the Euro (EUR).

==Applications==

===Jewellery and silverware===

The major use of silver besides coinage throughout most of history was in the manufacture of jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its antibacterial properties. Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.

Because pure silver is very soft, most silver used for these purposes is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of silver in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure silver plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.

===Medicine===
In medicine, silver is incorporated into wound dressings and used as an antibiotic coating in medical devices. Wound dressings containing silver sulfadiazine or silver nanomaterials are used to treat external infections. Silver is also used in some medical applications, such as urinary catheters (where tentative evidence indicates it reduces catheter-related urinary tract infections) and in endotracheal breathing tubes (where evidence suggests it reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia). The silver ion is bioactive and in sufficient concentration readily kills bacteria &quot;in vitro&quot;. Silver ions interfere with enzymes in the bacteria that transport nutrients, form structures, and synthesise cell walls; these ions also bond with the bacteria&#x27;s genetic material. Silver and silver nanoparticles are used as an antimicrobial in a variety of industrial, healthcare, and domestic application: for example, infusing clothing with nanosilver particles thus allows them to stay odourless for longer. Bacteria can develop resistance to the antimicrobial action of silver. Silver compounds are taken up by the body like mercury compounds, but lack the toxicity of the latter. Silver and its alloys are used in cranial surgery to replace bone, and silver–tin–mercury amalgams are used in dentistry. Silver diammine fluoride, the fluoride salt of a coordination complex with the formula [Ag(NH3)2]F, is a topical medicament (drug) used to treat and prevent dental caries (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.

===Electronics===

Silver is very important in electronics for conductors and electrodes on account of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, and continue to be used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.

===Brazing alloys===
Silver-containing brazing alloys are used for brazing metallic materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased workability and corrosion resistance during usage.

===Chemical equipment===
Silver is useful in the manufacture of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at red heat) are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.

===Catalysis===
Silver metal is a good catalyst for oxidation reactions; in fact it is somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a catalyst for the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270 °C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720 °C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.

===Photography===
Before the advent of digital photography, which is now dominant, the photosensitivity of silver halides was exploited for use in traditional film photography. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and .

Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.

The market for silver nitrate and silver halides for photography has rapidly declined with the rise of digital cameras. From the peak global demand for photographic silver in 1999 (267,000,000 troy ounces or 8,304.6 tonnes) the market contracted almost 70% by 2013.

===Nanoparticles===
Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100 nanometres in size, are used in many applications. They are used in conductive inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals in much the same way as larger silver particles. In addition, according to the European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON), silver nanoparticles are used both in pigments, as well as cosmetics.

===Miscellanea===

Pure silver metal is used as a food colouring. It has the E174 designation and is approved in the European Union. Traditional Indian and Pakistani dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as &quot;vark&quot;, and in various other cultures, silver &quot;dragée&quot; are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items.

Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that ultraviolet light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films are used in radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it has the advantage of not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.

The Texas Legislature designated silver the official precious metal of Texas in 2007.

==Precautions==

Silver compounds have low toxicity compared to those of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. Silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, or respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts and those of the other precious metals; in most situations, silver is not a serious environmental hazard.

In large doses, silver and compounds containing it can be absorbed into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, which results in a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person&#x27;s health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis, a blue tint on skin, caused by lack of oxygen.

Metallic silver, like copper, is an antibacterial agent, which was known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1 milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due to the formation of silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.

Some silver compounds are very explosive, such as the nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.

<text>The Sorbian languages (, ) are the Upper Sorbian language and Lower Sorbian language, two closely related and partially mutually intelligible languages spoken by the Sorbs, a West Slavic ethno-cultural minority in the Lusatia region of Eastern Germany. They are classified under the West Slavic branch of the Indo-European languages and are therefore closely related to the other two West Slavic subgroups: Lechitic and Czech–Slovak. Historically, the languages have also been known as Wendish (named after the Wends, the earliest Slavic people in modern Poland and Germany) or Lusatian. Their collective ISO 639-2 code is .

The two Sorbian languages, each having its own literary standard, are Upper Sorbian (), spoken by about 20,000–25,000 people in Saxony, and Lower Sorbian (), spoken by about 7,000 people in Brandenburg. The area where the two languages are spoken is known as Lusatia ( in Upper Sorbian, in Lower Sorbian, or in German).

==History==

After the settlement of the formerly Germanic territories (the part largely corresponding to the former East Germany) by the Slavic ancestors of the Sorbs in the 5th and 6th centuries CE, the Sorbian language (or its predecessors) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of Eastern Germany for several centuries. The language still had its stronghold in (Upper and Lower) Lusatia, where it enjoys national protection and fostering to the present day. For people living in the medieval Northern Holy Roman Empire and its precursors, especially for the Saxons, the Wends (&quot;Wende&quot;) were heterogeneous groups and tribes of Slavic peoples living near Germanic settlement areas, in the area west of the River Oder, an area later entitled &quot;Germania Slavica&quot;, settled by the Polabian Slav tribes in the north and by others, such as the Sorbs and the Milceni, further south (see Sorbian March).

The exact origin of the Sorbian language is uncertain. While some linguists consider it to be a transitory language between Lechitic and other non-Lechitic languages of West Slavic languages, others like Heinz Schuster-Šewc consider it a separate dialectical group of Proto-Slavic which is a mixture of Proto-Lechitic and South Slavic languages. According to him, &quot;Sorbian spoken today in Upper and Lower Lusatia is what remains of an earlier extensive Old Sorbian dialect area between the Elbe/Saale rivers in the west and the Bober/Queis rivers in the east&quot;. 

Furthermore, while some consider it a single language which later diverged to two major dialects, others consider these dialects two separate languages. There exist significant differences in phonology, morphology, and lexicon between them. Several characteristics in Upper Sorbian language indicate a close proximity to Czech language which again are absent in Lower Sorbian language. The Upper Sorbian is considered as representative of the old &quot;Sorbian proper&quot;, while the Lower Sorbian would be a transitional hybrid language more akin to the Lechitic languages. According to some researchers the archaeological data cannot confirm the thesis about a single linguistic group yet supports the claim about two separated ethno-cultural groups with different ancestry whose respective territories correspond to Tornow-type ceramics (Lower Sorbian language) and Leipzig-type ceramics (Upper Sorbian language), both derivations of Prague culture.

Outside Lusatia, the Sorbian language has been superseded by German. From the 13th century on, the language suffered official discrimination. Bible translations into Sorbian provided the foundations for its writing system.

==Geographic distribution==
In Germany, Upper and Lower Sorbian are officially recognized and protected as minority languages. In the officially defined Sorbian settlement area, both languages are recognized as second official languages next to German.

The city of Bautzen in Upper Lusatia is the centre of Upper Sorbian culture. Bilingual signs can be seen around the city, including the name of the city, &quot;Bautzen/&quot;.
To the north, the city of Cottbus/Chóśebuz is considered the cultural centre of Lower Sorbian; there, too, bilingual signs are found.

Sorbian was also spoken in the small Sorbian (&quot;Wendish&quot;) settlement of Serbin in Lee County, Texas, however no speakers remain there. Until 1949, newspapers were published in Sorbian. The local dialect was heavily influenced by surrounding speakers of German and English.

The German terms &quot;Wends&quot; (&quot;Wenden&quot;) and &quot;Wendish&quot; (&quot;wendisch/Wendisch&quot;) once denoted &quot;Slav(ic)&quot; generally; they are today mostly replaced by &quot;Sorbs&quot; (&quot;Sorben&quot;) and &quot;Sorbian&quot; (&quot;sorbisch/Sorbisch&quot;) with reference to Sorbian communities in Germany.

===Endangered status===
The use of Sorbian languages has been contracting for a number of years. The loss of Sorbian language use in emigrant communities, such as in Serbin, Texas, has not been surprising. But within the Sorbian homelands, there has also been a decrease in Sorbian identity and language use. In 2008, Sorbs protested three kinds of pressures against Sorbs: &quot;(1.) the destruction of Sorbian and German-Sorbian villages as a result of lignite mining; (2.) the cuts in the network of Sorbian schools in Saxony; (3.) the reduction of financial resources for the Sorbian institutions by central government.&quot;

A study of Upper Sorbian found a number of trends that go against language vitality. There are policies that have led to &quot;unstable diglossia&quot;. There has been a loss of language domains in which speakers have the option to use either language, and there is a disruption of the patterns by which the Sorbian language has traditionally been transmitted to the next generation. Also, there is no strong written tradition and there is not a broadly accepted formal standardized form of the language(s). There is a perception of the loss of language rights, and there are negative attitudes towards the languages and their speakers.

==Linguistic features==
Both Upper and Lower Sorbian have the dual for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs; very few living Indo-European languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar. For example, the word is used for one hand, for two hands, and for more than two hands. As with most Slavic languages, Sorbian uses no articles.

===Grammar===
The Sorbian languages are declined in six or seven cases:
#Nominative
#Accusative
#Genitive
#Dative
#Locative
#Instrumental
#Vocative (Upper Sorbian only)

<doc id="27121" wikidata="Q1819" url="?curid=27121" title="Samarium">
<text>Samarium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sm and atomic number 62. It is a moderately hard silvery metal that slowly oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, samarium usually has the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide.

Discovered in 1879 by French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, samarium was named after the mineral samarskite from which it was isolated. The mineral itself was named after a Russian mine official, Colonel Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets, who thus became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, though the name was indirect.

Samarium occurs in concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including cerite, gadolinite, samarskite, monazite and bastnäsite, the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production.

The main commercial use of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization second only to neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their permanent magnetic properties. The radioisotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and so is added to control rods of nuclear reactors. It also forms as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other uses of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and X-ray lasers. Samarium(II) iodide, in particular, is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis.

Samarium has no biological role; some samarium salts are slightly toxic.

==Physical properties==
Samarium is a rare earth element with a hardness and density similar to zinc. With a boiling point of , samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after ytterbium and europium and comparable in this respect to lead and barium; this helps separation of samarium from its ores. When freshly prepared, samarium has a silvery lustre, and takes on a duller appearance when oxidized in air. Samarium is calculated to have one of the largest atomic radii of the elements; with a radius of 238 pm, only potassium, praseodymium, barium, rubidium and caesium are larger.

In ambient conditions, samarium has a rhombohedral structure (α form). Upon heating to , its crystal symmetry changes to hexagonal close-packed (&quot;hcp&quot;),; it has actual transition temperature depending on metal purity. Further heating to transforms the metal into a body-centered cubic (&quot;bcc&quot;) phase. Heating to plus compression to 40 kbar results in a double-hexagonally close-packed structure (&quot;dhcp&quot;). Higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a tetragonal phase appearing at about 900 kbar. In one study, the &quot;dhcp&quot; phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about and , confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the &quot;hcp&quot; or &quot;dhcp&quot; phases in ambient conditions.

Samarium and its sesquioxide are paramagnetic at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2 bohr magnetons, are the third-lowest among lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 14.8 K. Individual samarium atoms can be isolated by encapsulating them into fullerene molecules. They can also be intercalated into the interstices of the bulk C60 to form a solid solution of nominal composition Sm3C60, which is superconductive at a temperature of 8 K. Samarium doping of iron-based superconductors – a class of high-temperature superconductor – increases their transition to normal conductivity temperature up to 56 K, the highest value achieved so far in this series.

== Chemical properties ==

In air, samarium slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at . Even when stored under mineral oil, samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the oxide-hydroxide mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as argon.

Samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and rapidly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide:

Samarium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the yellow to pale green Sm(III) ions, which exist as complexes:

Samarium is one of the few lanthanides with a relatively accessible +2 oxidation state, alongside Eu and Yb. ions are blood-red in aqueous solution.

==Compounds==


===Oxides===
The most stable oxide of samarium is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. Like many samarium compounds, it exists in several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is high (2345 °C), so it is usually melted not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.

Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm2O3 with samarium metal at high temperature (1000 °C) and a pressure above 50 kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in incomplete reaction. SmO has cubic rock-salt lattice structure.

===Chalcogenides===

Samarium forms a trivalent sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with a cubic rock-salt crystal structure are known. These chalcogenides convert from a semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30 kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5 kbar. This effect results in a spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change the lattice symmetry, but there is a sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It exhibits hysteresis, i.e., when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at a much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.

===Halides===

Samarium metal reacts with all the halogens, forming trihalides:
:2 Sm (s) + 3 X2 (g) → 2 SmX3 (s) (X = F, Cl, Br or I)

Their further reduction with samarium, lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures (about 700–900 °C) yields the dihalides. The diiodide can also be prepared by heating SmI3, or by reacting the metal with 1,2-diiodoethane in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at room temperature:
:Sm (s) + ICH2-CH2I → SmI2 + CH2=CH2.

In addition to dihalides, the reduction also produces many non-stoichiometric samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm3F7, Sm14F33, Sm27F64, Sm11Br24, Sm5Br11 and Sm6Br13.

Samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide anion is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).

===Borides===
Sintering powders of samarium oxide and boron, in a vacuum, yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases; the ratio between these phases can be controlled through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of samarium borides using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580 °C), SmB4 (about 2300 °C) and SmB66 (2150 °C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240 °C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formation of SmB6.

====Samarium hexaboride====
Samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate-valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm2+ and Sm3+ ions in a 3:7 ratio. It belongs to a class of Kondo insulators; at temperatures above 50 K, its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at lower temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4–14 meV. The cooling-induced metal-insulator transition in SmB6 is accompanied by a sharp increase in the thermal conductivity, peaking at about 15 K. The reason for this increase is that electrons themselves do not contribute to the thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is dominated by phonons, but the decrease in electron concentration reduces the rate of electron-phonon scattering.

===Other inorganic compounds===

Samarium carbides are prepared by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and need to be studied under an inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.10 eV, the same as in silicon, and electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1 °C/min. A similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at .

Numerous crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group 14, 15, or 16 elements X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. They are all prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements. Many of the resulting compounds are non-stoichiometric and have nominal compositions SmaXb, where the b/a ratio varies between 0.5 and 3.

===Organometallic compounds===
Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide and its chloroderivatives and . They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides, in some rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium, thus creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative has a dimer structure, which is more accurately expressed as . There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.

The ()− ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide ()− or cyclooctatetraenide ()2− ring, resulting in or . The latter compound has a structure similar to uranocene. There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium, a solid that sublimates at about . Contrary to ferrocene, the rings in are not parallel but are tilted by 40°.

A metathesis reaction in tetrahydrofuran or ether gives alkyls and aryls of samarium:
:

Here R is a hydrocarbon group and Me = methyl.

==Isotopes==

Naturally occurring samarium is composed of five stable isotopes: 144Sm, 149Sm, 150Sm, 152Sm and 154Sm, and two extremely long-lived radioisotopes, 147Sm (half-life &quot;t&quot;1/2 = 1.06 years) and 148Sm (7 years), with 152Sm being the most abundant (26.75%). 149Sm is listed by various sources as being stable, but some sources state that it is radioactive, with a lower bound for its half-life given as years. Some observationally stable samarium isotopes are predicted to decay to isotopes of neodymium. The long-lived isotopes 146Sm, 147Sm, and 148Sm undergo alpha decay to neodymium isotopes. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium mainly decay by electron capture to promethium, while heavier ones beta decay to europium. The known isotopes range from 129Sm to 168Sm. The half-lives of 151Sm and 145Sm are 90 years and 340 days, respectively. All remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than 2 days, and most these have half-life less than 48 seconds. Samarium also has twelve known nuclear isomers, the most stable of which are 141mSm (half-life 22.6 minutes), 143m1Sm (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 66 seconds), and 139mSm (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 10.7 seconds). Natural samarium has a radioactivity of 127 Bq/g, mostly due to 147Sm, which alpha decays to 143Nd with a half-life of 1.06 years and is used in samarium–neodymium dating. 146Sm is an extinct radionuclide, with the half-life of 9.20 years. There have been searches of samarium-146 as a primordial nuclide, because its half-life is long enough such that minute quantities of the element should persist today. It can be used in radiometric dating.

Samarium-149 is an observationally stable isotope of samarium (predicted to decay, but no decays have ever been observed, giving it a half-life at least several orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe), and a product of the decay chain from the fission product 149Nd (yield 1.0888%). 149Sm is a decay product and neutron-absorber in nuclear reactors, with a neutron poison effect that is second in importance for reactor design and operation only to 135Xe. Its neutron cross section is 41000 barns for thermal neutrons. Because samarium-149 is not radioactive and is not removed by decay, it presents problems somewhat different from those encountered with xenon-135. The equilibrium concentration (and thus the poisoning effect) builds to an equilibrium value during reactor operations in about 500 hours (about three weeks), and since samarium-149 is stable, its concentration remains essentially constant during reactor operation.
Samarium-153 is a beta emitter with a half-life of 46.3 hours. It is used to kill cancer cells in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.

==History==
Detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century; however, most sources give priority to French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran. Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and/or hydroxide in Paris in 1879 from the mineral samarskite ) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines. Swiss chemist Marc Delafontaine announced a new element &quot;decipium&quot; (from meaning &quot;deceptive, misleading&quot;) in 1878, but later in 1880–1881 demonstrated that it was a mix of several elements, one being identical to Boisbaudran&#x27;s samarium. Though samarskite was first found in the Ural Mountains in Russia, by the late 1870s it had been found in other places, making it available to many researchers. In particular, it was found that the samarium isolated by Boisbaudran was also impure and had a comparable amount of europium. The pure samarium(III) oxide was produced only in 1901 by Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, and in 1903 Wilhelm Muthmann isolated the element.

Boisbaudran named his element &quot;samarium&quot; after the mineral samarskite, which in turn honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the brothers Gustav and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. Samarium was thus the first chemical element to be named after a person. The word &quot;samaria&quot; is sometimes used to mean samarium(III) oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol &quot;Sm&quot; was suggested for samarium, but an alternative &quot;Sa&quot; was often used instead until the 1920s.

Before the advent of ion-exchange separation technology in the 1950s, pure samarium had no commercial uses. However, a by-product of fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mix of samarium and gadolinium that got the name &quot;Lindsay Mix&quot; after the company that made it, and was used for nuclear control rods in some early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name &quot;samarium-europium-gadolinium&quot; (SEG) concentrate. It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed lanthanides isolated from bastnäsite (or monazite). Since heavier lanthanides have more affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare-earth producers who process bastnäsite do so on a large enough scale to continue by separating the components of SEG, which typically makes up only 12% of the original ore. Such producers therefore make SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium in the ore is rescued for use in making phosphor. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. , being in oversupply, samarium oxide is cheaper on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.

==Occurrence and production==

Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23 ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5–0.8 parts per trillion. The median value for its abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust used by the CRC Handbook is 7 parts per million (ppm) and is the 40th most abundant element. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.

Samarium is not found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including monazite, bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it is followed by the US (about 5,000 tonnes) and India (2,700 tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about US$30/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794 °C) and lanthanum (b.p. 3464 °C).

Very few minerals have samarium being the most dominant element. Minerals with essential (dominant) samarium include monazite-(Sm) and florencite-(Sm). These minerals are very rare and are usually found containing other elements, usually cerium or neodymium. It is also made by neutron capture by samarium-149, which is added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. Therefore, Sm is present in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.

==Applications==
===Magnets===
An important use of samarium is samarium–cobalt magnets, which are nominally or . They have high permanent magnetization, about 10,000 times that of iron and second only to neodymium magnets. However, samarium magnets resist demagnetization better; they are stable to temperatures above (cf. 300–400 °C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.

===Chemical reagent===
Samarium and its compounds are important as catalysts and chemical reagents. Samarium catalysts help the decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), as well as dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate , that is , is one of the most efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.

In its usual oxidized form, samarium is added to ceramics and glasses where it increases absorption of infrared light. As a (minor) part of mischmetal, samarium is found in the &quot;flint&quot; ignition devices of many lighters and torches.

===Neutron absorber===
Samarium-149 has a high cross section for neutron capture (41,000 barns) and so is used in control rods of nuclear reactors. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption – most of the fusion products of Sm are other isotopes of samarium that are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross section of samarium-151 is 15,000 barns, it is on the order of hundreds of barns for Sm, Sm, and Sm, and 6,800 barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium.

===Lasers===
Samarium-doped calcium fluoride crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first solid-state lasers designed and built by Peter Sorokin (co-inventor of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser gave pulses of red light at 708.5 nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and so did not find practical applications. Another samarium-based laser became the first saturated X-ray laser operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It gave 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8 nm suitable for uses in holography, high-resolution microscopy of biological specimens, deflectometry, interferometry, and radiography of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and astrophysics. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3 mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared (wavelength ~1.05 μm).

===Storage phosphor===
In 2007 it was shown that nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm as prepared by co-precipitation can serve as a very efficient X-ray storage phosphor. The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100–200 nm in size and their sensitivity as X-ray storage phosphors is increased a remarkable ~500,000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centers in comparison with microcrystalline samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on reduction of Sm to Sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The D–F f–f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f→4f5d transition at ~417 nm. The latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue-violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense (400 L/(mol⋅cm)).
The phosphor has potential applications in personal dosimetry, dosimetry and imaging in radiotherapy, and medical imaging.

===Non-commercial and potential uses===

* The change in electrical resistivity in samarium monochalcogenides can be used in a pressure sensor or in a memory device triggered between a low-resistance and high-resistance state by external pressure, and such devices are being developed commercially. Samarium monosulfide also generates electric voltage upon moderate heating to about that can be applied in thermoelectric power converters.
* Analysis of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes Sm, Nd, and Nd allows determination of the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium–neodymium dating. Both elements are lanthanides and are very similar physically and chemically. Thus, Sm–Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geologic processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of said elements.
* The Sm ion is a potential activator for use in warm-white light emitting diodes. It offers high luminous efficacy due to narrow emission bands; but the generally low quantum efficiency and too little absorption in the UV-A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application.
* Samarium is used for ionosphere testing. A rocket spreads samarium monoxide as a red vapor at high altitude, and researchers test how the atmosphere disperses it and how it impacts radio transmissions.
* Samarium hexaboride, , has recently been shown to be a topological insulator with potential uses in quantum computing.

== Biological role and precautions ==

Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it is unclear whether this is from samarium or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50 μg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with ~8 μg/L being dissolved in blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and so is normally not part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic. When ingested, only 0.05% of samarium salts are absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder are excreted. From the blood, 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for 10 years; the remaining 10% is excreted.

<text>The Sámi ( ; also spelled Sami or Saami) are the traditionally Sámi-speaking indigenous people inhabiting the region of Sápmi, which today encompasses large northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and of the Kola Peninsula in Russia. The region of Sápmi was formerly known as Lapland, and the Sámi have historically been known in English as Lapps or Laplanders, but these terms are regarded as offensive by the Sámi, who prefer their own endonym, e.g. Northern Sámi . Their traditional languages are the Sámi languages, which are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.

Traditionally, the Sámi have pursued a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, fur trapping, and sheep herding. Their best-known means of livelihood is semi-nomadic reindeer herding. about 10% of the Sámi were connected to reindeer herding, which provides them with meat, fur, and transportation; around 2,800 Sámi people were actively involved in reindeer herding on a full-time basis in Norway. For traditional, environmental, cultural, and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved for only Sámi in some regions of the Nordic countries.
==Etymologies==

===Sámi===
Speakers of Northern Sámi refer to themselves as (the Sámis) or (of Sámi kin), the word being inflected into various grammatical forms. Other Sámi languages use cognate words. As of around 2014, the current consensus among specialists was that the word &quot;Sámi&quot; was borrowed from the Proto-Baltic word , meaning &#x27;land&#x27; (cognate with Slavic (), of the same meaning).

The word &quot;Sámi&quot; has at least one cognate word in Finnish: Proto-Baltic was also borrowed into Proto-Finnic, as . This word became modern Finnish (Finnish for the region of Tavastia; the second &quot;ä&quot; of is still found in the adjective ). The Finnish word for Finland, , is also thought probably to derive ultimately from Proto-Baltic , though the precise route is debated and proposals usually involve complex processes of borrowing and reborrowing. and its adjectival form must come from &#x27;/&#x27;. In one proposal, this Finnish word comes from a Proto-Germanic word , itself from Proto-Baltic , in turn borrowed from Proto-Finnic , which was borrowed from .

The Sámi institutions—notably the parliaments, radio and TV stations, theatres, etc.—all use the term &quot;Sámi&quot;, including when addressing outsiders in Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or English. In Norwegian and Swedish, the Sámi are today referred to by the localized form .

===&quot;Finn&quot;===
The first probable historical mention of the Sámi, naming them , was by Tacitus, about AD 98. Variants of &quot;Finn&quot; or were in wide use in ancient times, judging from the names and () in classical Roman and Greek works. &quot;Finn&quot; (or variants, such as , &#x27;skiing Finn&#x27;) was the name originally used by Norse speakers (and their proto-Norse speaking ancestors) to refer to the Sámi, as attested in the Icelandic Eddas and Norse sagas (11th to 14th centuries).

The etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the consensus seems to be that it is related to Old Norse , from proto-Germanic (&#x27;to find&#x27;), the logic being that the Sámi, as hunter-gatherers &quot;found&quot; their food, rather than grew it. This etymology has superseded older speculations that the word might be related to &quot;fen&quot;.

As Old Norse gradually developed into the separate Scandinavian languages, Swedes apparently took to using &quot;Finn&quot; to refer to inhabitants of what is now Finland, while the Sámi came to be called &quot;Lapps&quot;. In Norway, however, Sámi were still called &quot;Finns&quot; at least until the modern era (reflected in toponyms like , , and ), and some northern Norwegians will still occasionally use &quot;Finn&quot; to refer to Sámi people, although the Sámi themselves now consider this to be an inappropriate term. Finnish immigrants to Northern Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries were referred to as Kvens to distinguish them from the Sámi &quot;Finns&quot;. Ethnic Finns () are a group related to the Sámi, but distinct from them.

===&quot;Lapp&quot;===

The word &quot;Lapp&quot; can be traced to Old Swedish , Icelandic (plural) perhaps of Finnish origin; compare Finnish &quot;Lapp&quot;, &quot;Lapland&quot; (possibly meaning &quot;wilderness in the north&quot;), the original meaning being unknown. It is unknown how the word &quot;Lapp&quot; came into the Norse language, but one of the first written mentions of the term is in the by the twelfth-century Danish historian , who referred to &#x27;the two Lappias&#x27;, although he still referred to the Sámi as s. In fact, Saxo never explicitly connects the Sámi with the &quot;two Laplands&quot;. The term &quot;Lapp&quot; was popularized and became the standard terminology by the work of , (1673).

The Sámi are often known in other languages by the exonyms &quot;Lap&quot;, &quot;Lapp&quot;, or &quot;Laplanders&quot;, although these are considered derogatory terms by some, while others accept at least the name &quot;Lappland&quot;. Variants of the name &quot;Lapp&quot; were originally used in Sweden and Finland and, through Swedish, adopted by many major European languages: ; German, ; ; (); ; ; ; ; ; ; . In Russian the corresponding term is () and in Ukrainian ().

In Finland and Sweden, &quot;Lapp&quot; is common in place names, such as (), (South Karelia) and (North Savo) in Finland; and (Stockholm County), () and () in Sweden. As already mentioned, &quot;Finn&quot; is a common element in Norwegian (particularly Northern Norwegian) place names, whereas &quot;Lapp&quot; is exceedingly rare.

Terminological issues in Finnish are somewhat different. Finns living in Finnish Lapland generally call themselves , whereas the similar word for the Sámi people is . This can be confusing for foreign visitors because of the similar lives Finns and Sámi people live today in Lapland. is also a common family name in Finland. In Finnish, is the most commonly used word nowadays, especially in official contexts.

==History==

The western Uralic languages are believed to have spread from the original Proto-Uralic homeland along the Volga, which is the longest river in Europe. The speakers of Finnic and Sámi languages have their roots in the middle and upper Volga region in the Corded Ware culture. These groups presumably started to move to the northwest from the homeland of the early Uralic peoples in the second and third quarters of the 2nd millennium BC. On their journey, they used the ancient river routes of what is now northern Russia. Some of these peoples, who may have originally spoken the same western Uralic language, stopped and stayed in the regions between Karelia, Ladoga and Lake Ilmen, and even further to the east and to the southeast. The groups of these peoples that ended up in the Finnish Lakeland from 1600 to 1500 BC later &quot;became&quot; the Sámi. The Sámi people arrived in their current homeland some time during the Bronze Age or early Iron Age.

The Sámi language first developed on the southern side of Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga and spread from there. When the speakers of this language extended to the area of modern-day Finland, they encountered groups of peoples who spoke a number of smaller ancient languages (Paleo-Laplandic languages), which later became extinct. However, these languages left traces in the Sámi language (Pre-Finnic substrate). As the language spread further, it became segmented into dialects. The geographical distribution of the Sámi has evolved over the course of history. From the Bronze Age, the Sámi occupied the area along the coast of Finnmark and the Kola Peninsula. This coincides with the arrival of the Siberian genome to Estonia and Finland, which may correspond with the introduction of the Finno-Ugric languages in the region.

Petroglyphs and archeological findings such as settlements, dating from about 10,000 BC can be found in Lapland and Finnmark, although these have not been demonstrated to be related to the Sámi people. These hunter-gatherers of the late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic were named Komsa by the researchers.

===Relationship between the Sámi and the Scandinavians===
The Sámi have a complex relationship with the Scandinavians (known as Norse people in the medieval era), the dominant peoples of Scandinavia, who speak Scandinavian languages and who founded and thus dominated the kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. The migration of Germanic-speaking peoples to Southern Scandinavia happened independently and separately from the Sámi migrations into the northern regions. For centuries, the Sámi and the Scandinavians had relatively little contact; the Sámi primarily lived in the inland of northern Fennoscandia, while Scandinavians lived in southern Scandinavia and gradually colonised the Norwegian coast; from the 18th and especially the 19th century, the governments of Norway and Sweden started to assert sovereignty more aggressively in the north, and targeted the Sámi with Scandinavization policies aimed at forced assimilation from the 19th century.

Before the era of forced Scandinavization policies, the Norwegian and Swedish authorities had largely ignored the Sámi and did not interfere much in their way of life. While Norwegians moved north to gradually colonise the coast of modern-day Troms and Finnmark to engage in an export-driven fisheries industry prior to the 19th century, they showed little interest in the harsh and non-arable inland populated by reindeer-herding Sámi. Unlike the Norwegians on the coast who were strongly dependent on their trade with the south, the Sámi in the inland lived off the land. From the 19th century Norwegian and Swedish authorities started to regard the Sámi as a &quot;backward&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; people in need of being &quot;civilized&quot;, imposing the Scandinavian languages as the only valid languages of the kingdoms and effectively banning Sámi language and culture in many contexts, particularly schools.

===Southern limits of Sámi settlement in the past===

How far south the Sámi extended in the past has been debated among historians and archeologists for many years. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen, commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle contemporary questions of Sámi land rights, concluded that the Sámi had lived no farther south than Lierne Municipality in Trøndelag county until around 1500, when they started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femund in the 18th century. This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In recent years, several archaeological finds indicate a Sámi presence in southern Norway in the Middle Ages, and in southern Sweden, including finds in Lesja Municipality, in Vang Municipality, in Valdres and in Hol Municipality and Ål Municipality in Hallingdal. Proponents of the Sámi interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and Sámi people in the mountainous areas of southern Norway in the Middle Ages.

In Finland, a 2022 study said that Sámi habitation was found in the entirety of continental Finland at least until the 14th century. Toponyms of Sámi origin are common in the southernmost provinces of Finland Proper and Uusimaa, e.g. Aurajoki ~ &quot;Oarrijohka&quot; &quot;Squirrel River&quot;. The Sámi coexisted with Finns and Swedes and traded squirrel furs with them. The division was based on occupation: unlike Finns and Swedes, the Sámi did not engage in significant agriculture, relying on fishing, hunting, gathering and fur trapping instead. Complete colonization of the two provinces by Finns and Swedes led to the assimilation and disappearance of a distinct Sámi population by the 14th century.

===Origins of the Norwegian Sea Sámi===
====Bubonic plague====

Until the arrival of bubonic plague in northern Norway in 1349, the Sámi and the Norwegians occupied very separate economic niches. The Sámi hunted reindeer and fished for their livelihood. The Norwegians, who were concentrated on the outer islands and near the mouths of the fjords, had access to the major European trade routes so that, in addition to marginal farming in the Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark counties, they were able to establish commerce, trading fish for products from the south. According to old Nordic texts, the Sea Sámi and the Mountain Sámi are two classes of the same people and not two different ethnic groups, as had been erroneously believed.

This socioeconomic balance greatly changed when bubonic plague came to northern Norway in December 1349. The Norwegians were closely connected to the greater European trade routes, along which the plague traveled; consequently, they were infected and died at a far higher rate than Sámi in the interior. Of all the states in the region, Norway suffered the most from this plague. Depending on the parish, 60 to 76 percent of northern Norwegian farms were abandoned following the plague, while land-rents, another measure of population, dropped to 9–28% of pre-plague levels. Although the population of northern Norway is sparse compared to southern Europe, the disease spread just as fast. The spread of the plague-carrying flea (&quot;Xenopsylla cheopsis&quot;) from the south was facilitated by the transport of wooden barrels holding wheat, rye, or wool, where the fleas were able to live, and even reproduce, for several months at a time. The Sámi lived on fish and reindeer meat, and did not eat wheat or rye. They lived in communities detached from the Norwegians; being only loosely connected to the European trade routes, they fared far better than the Norwegians.

====Fishing industry====
Fishing has always been the main livelihood for the many Sámi living permanently in coastal areas. Archeological research shows that the Sámi have lived along the coast and once lived much farther south in the past, and they were also involved in work other than reindeer herding (e.g., fishing, agriculture, iron work). The fishing along the north Norwegian coast, especially in the Lofoten and Vesterålen islands, is quite productive, with a variety of fish; during medieval times, it was a major source of income for both the fishermen and the Norwegian monarchy. With such massive population drops caused by the Black Death, the tax revenues from this industry greatly diminished. Because of the huge profits that could be had from these fisheries, the local authorities offered incentives to the Sámi—faced with their own population pressures—to settle on the newly vacant farms. This started the economic division between the Sea Sámi (), who fished extensively off the coast, and the Mountain Sámi (), who continued to hunt reindeer and small-game animals. They later herded reindeer.

Even as late as the early 18th century, there were many Sámi who were still settling on these farms left abandoned from the 1350s. After many years of continuous migration, these Sea Sámi became far more numerous than the reindeer-herding mountain Sámi, who today only make up 10% of all Sámi. In contemporary times, there are also ongoing consultations between the Government of Norway and the Sámi Parliament regarding the right of the coastal Sámi to fish in the seas on the basis of historical use and international law. State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of charge to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sámi districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.

====Mountain Sámi====
As the Sea Sámi settled along Norway&#x27;s fjords and inland waterways, pursuing a combination of farming, cattle raising, trapping and fishing, the minority Mountain Sámi continued to hunt wild reindeer. Around 1500, they started to tame these animals into herding groups, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, often portrayed by outsiders as following the traditional Sámi lifestyle. The Mountain Sámi had to pay taxes to three states, Norway, Sweden and Russia, as they crossed each border while following the annual reindeer migrations; this caused much resentment over the years. Between 1635 and 1659, the Swedish crown forced Swedish conscripts and Sámi cart drivers to work in the Nasa silver mine, causing many Sámis to emigrate from the area to avoid forced labour. As a result, the population of Pite- and Lule-speaking Sámi decreased greatly.

===Post-1800s===
For long periods of time, the Sámi lifestyle thrived because of its adaptation to the Arctic environment. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sámi cultural element was strengthened, since the Sámi were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.

During the 19th century, the pressure of Christianization of the Sámi increased, with some Sámi adopting Laestadianism. With the introduction of seven compulsory years of school in 1889, the Sámi language and traditional way of life came increasingly under pressure from forced cultural normalization. Strong economic development of the north also ensued, giving Norwegian culture and language higher status.

On the Swedish and Finnish sides, the authorities were less militant, although the Sámi language was forbidden in schools and strong economic development in the north led to weakened cultural and economic status for the Sámi. From 1913 to 1920, the Swedish race-segregation political movement created a race-based biological institute that collected research material from living people and graves. Throughout history, Swedish settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights, tax allowances, and military exemptions.

The strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to assimilate Sámi culture. Anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in Finnmark had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This partly caused the dislocation of Sámi people in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sámi groups (something still present today) that sometimes has the character of an internal Sámi ethnic conflict. Another example of forced displacement occurred between 1919 and 1920 in Norway and Sweden. This has been the topic of a recent work of journalism by Sámi author Elin Anna Labba, translated into English in 2023 under the title &quot;The Rocks Will Echo Our Sorrow: The Forced Displacement of the Northern Sámi&quot;.

In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on &quot;native act land&quot; to allocate the best and most useful lands to Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the scorched earth policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy war destruction in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944–45, destroying all existing houses, or &quot;kota&quot;, and visible traces of Sámi culture. After World War II, the pressure was relaxed, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house Sámi people were allowed to build. 

The controversy over the construction of the hydro-electric power station in Alta Municipality in 1979 brought Sámi rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (&quot;Sámi soga lávlla&quot;) and flag (Sámi flag) of the Sámi people were created. In 1989, the first Sámi parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the Finnmark Act was passed in the Norwegian parliament giving the Sámi parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sámi, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sámi or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.

===Contemporary issues===
The Indigenous Sámi population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high Arctic. The Sámi are still coping with the cultural consequences of language and culture loss caused by generations of Sámi children being taken to missionary or state-run boarding schools and the legacy of laws that were created to deny the Sámi rights (e.g., to their beliefs, language, land and to the practice of traditional livelihoods). The Sámi are experiencing cultural and environmental threats, including: oil exploration, mining, dam building, logging, climate change, military bombing ranges, tourism and commercial development.
====Natural resource extraction====
Sápmi is rich in precious metals, oil, and natural gas. Mining activities and prospecting to extract these resources from the region often interfere with reindeer grazing and calving areas and other aspects of traditional Sámi life. Some active mining locations include ancient Sámi spaces that are designated as ecologically protected areas, such as the Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve. The Sámi Parliament has opposed and rejected mining projects in the Finnmark area, and demanded that resources and mineral exploration benefit local Sámi communities and populations, as the proposed mines are in Sámi lands and will affect their ability to maintain their traditional livelihood. In Kallak (Sámi: &quot;Gállok&quot;) a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists protested against the UK-based mining company Beowulf which operated a drilling program in lands used for grazing reindeer during the winter. There is often local opposition to new mining projects where environmental impacts are perceived to be very large, as very few plans for mine reclamation have been made. In Sweden, taxes on minerals are intentionally low in an effort to increase mineral exploration for economic benefit, though this policy is at the expense of Sámi populations. ILO Convention No. 169 would grant rights to the Sámi people to their land and give them power in matters that affect their future.

In Russia&#x27;s Kola Peninsula, vast areas have already been destroyed by mining and smelting activities, and further development is imminent. This includes oil and natural gas exploration in the Barents Sea. Oil spills affect fishing and the construction of roads. There is a gas pipeline that stretches across the Kola Peninsula, and power lines cut off access to reindeer calving grounds and sacred sites.

In northern Finland, there has been a longstanding dispute over the destruction of forests, which prevents reindeer from migrating between seasonal feeding grounds and destroys supplies of lichen that grow on the upper branches of older trees. This lichen is the reindeer&#x27;s only source of sustenance during the winter months, when snow is deep. The logging has been under the control of the state-run forest system. Greenpeace, reindeer herders, and Sámi organisations carried out a historic joint campaign, and in 2010, Sámi reindeer herders won some time as a result of these court cases. Industrial logging has now been pushed back from the most important forest areas either permanently or for the next 20 years, though there are still threats, such as mining and construction plans of holiday resorts on the protected shorelines of Lake Inari.

====Land rights====

The Swedish government has allowed the world&#x27;s largest onshore wind farm to be built in Piteå, in the Arctic region where the Eastern Kikkejaure village has its winter reindeer pastures. The wind farm will consist of more than 1,000 wind turbines and an extensive road infrastructure, which means that the feasibility of using the area for winter grazing in practice is impossible. Sweden has received strong international criticism, including by the UN Racial Discrimination Committee and the Human Rights Committee, that Sweden violates Sámi &quot;landrättigheter&quot; (land rights), including by not regulating industry. In Norway some Sámi politicians (for example—Aili Keskitalo) suggest giving the Sámi Parliament a special veto right on planned mining projects.

Government authorities and NATO have built bombing-practice ranges in Sámi areas in northern Norway and Sweden. These regions have served as reindeer calving and summer grounds for thousands of years, and contain many ancient Sámi sacred sites.

====Water rights====
State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sámi districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.

The Sámi recently stopped a water-prospecting venture that threatened to turn an ancient sacred site and natural spring called Suttesaja into a large-scale water-bottling plant for the world market—without notification or consultation with the local Sámi people, who make up 70 percent of the population. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities has registered the area as a heritage site of cultural and historical significance, and the stream itself is part of the Deatnu/Tana watershed, which is home to Europe&#x27;s largest salmon river, an important source of Sámi livelihood.

In Norway, government plans for the construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Alta river in Finnmark in northern Norway led to a political controversy and the rallying of the Sámi popular movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a result, the opposition in the Alta controversy brought attention to not only environmental issues but also the issue of Sámi rights.

====Climate change and the environment====

Reindeer have major cultural and economic significance for Indigenous peoples of the North. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and ecosystem and the characteristic ways of life of Indigenous Arctic peoples.

The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster caused nuclear fallout in the sensitive Arctic ecosystems and poisoned fish, meat and berries. Lichens and mosses are two of the main forms of vegetation in the Arctic and are highly susceptible to airborne pollutants and heavy metals. Since many do not have roots, they absorb nutrients, and toxic compounds, through their leaves. The lichens accumulated airborne radiation, and 73,000 reindeer had to be killed as &quot;unfit&quot; for human consumption in Sweden alone. The government promised Sámi indemnification but has not followed through on this promise.

Radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel have been stored in the waters off the Kola Peninsula, including locations that are only &quot;two kilometers&quot; from places where Sámi live. There are a minimum of five &quot;dumps&quot; where spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste are being deposited in the Kola Peninsula, often with little concern for the surrounding environment or population.

====Tourism====
The tourism industry in Finland has been criticized for turning Sámi culture into a marketing tool by promoting opportunities to experience &quot;authentic&quot; Sámi ceremonies and lifestyle. At many tourist locales, non-Sámi dress in inaccurate replicas of Sámi traditional clothing, and gift shops sell crude reproductions of Sámi handicraft. One popular &quot;ceremony&quot;, crossing the Arctic Circle, actually has no significance in Sámi spirituality. To some Sámi, this is an insulting display of cultural exploitation.

==Discrimination against the Sámi==
The Sámi have for centuries, even today, been the subject of discrimination and abuse by the dominant cultures in the nations they have historically inhabited. They have never been a single community in a single region of Sápmi, which until recently was considered only a cultural region.

Norway has been criticized internationally for the politics of Norwegianization of and discrimination against the Sámi. On 8 April 2011, recommendations from the UN Racial Discrimination Committee were delivered to Norway, addressing many issues related to the legacy of Norwegianization policies, including the need for more Sámi language education, interpreters, and cultural support. One committee recommendation was that discrimination against someone based upon their language be added to Article 1 of the Norwegian Discrimination and Accessibility Act. A new present status report was to have been ready by the end of 2012. In 2018, The Storting commissioned The Truth and Reconciliation Commission to lay the foundation for recognition of the experiences of the Sámi subject to Norwegianization and the subsequent consequences.

Sweden has faced similar criticism for its Swedification policies, which began in the 1800s and lasted until the 1970s. In 2020, Sweden funded the establishment of an independent truth commission to examine and document past abuse of Sámi by the Swedish state. In 2021, the Church of Sweden made a formal apology to Sweden&#x27;s Sámi population for its role in forced conversions and Swedification efforts, outlining a multiyear reconciliation plan.

In Finland, where Sámi children, like all Finnish children, are entitled to day care and language instruction in their own language, the Finnish government has denied funding for these rights in most of the country, including in Rovaniemi, the largest municipality in Finnish Lapland. Sámi activists have pushed for nationwide application of these basic rights. The city of Rovaniemi offers day care and preschool education in the Sámi language, and then as basic education first as supplementary native language education starting from the first grade and as a voluntary subject on its own starting from the fourth grade.

As in the other countries claiming sovereignty over Sámi lands, Sámi activists&#x27; efforts in Finland in the 20th century achieved limited government recognition of the Sámis&#x27; rights as a recognized minority, but the Finnish government has maintained its legally enforced premise that the Sámi must prove their land ownership, an idea incompatible with and antithetical to the traditional reindeer-herding Sámi way of life. This has effectively allowed the Finnish government to take without compensation, motivated by economic gain, land occupied by the Sámi for centuries. Non-Sámi Finns began to move to Lapland in the 1550s.

==Government==
===Official Sámi policies===
====Norway====

The Sámi have been recognized as an Indigenous people in Norway (1990 according to ILO convention 169 as described below), and therefore, according to international law, the Sámi people in Norway are entitled special protection and rights. The legal foundation of the Sámi policy is:

* Article 108 of the Norwegian Constitution.
* The Sámi Act (12 June 1987, No. 56).

The constitutional amendment states: &quot;It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions enabling the Sámi people to preserve and develop its language, culture and way of life.&quot; This provides a legal and political protection of the Sámi language, culture and society. In addition the &quot;amendment implies a legal, political and moral obligation for Norwegian authorities to create an environment conducive to the Sámis themselves influencing on the development of the Sámi community&quot;.

The Sámi Act provides special rights for the Sámi people:
* &quot;the Sámis shall have their own national Sámi Parliament elected by and amongst the Sámis&quot; (Chapter 1–2).
* The Sámi people shall decide the area of activity of the Norwegian Sámi Parliament.
* The Sámi and Norwegian languages have equal standing in Norway (section 15; Chapter 3 contains details with regards to the use of the Sámi language).
The Norwegian Sámi Parliament also elects 50% of the members to the board of the Finnmark Estate, which controls 95% of the land in the county of Finnmark.

In addition, the Sámi have special rights to reindeer husbandry. In 2007, the Norwegian Parliament passed the new Reindeer Herding Act acknowledging siida as the basic institution regarding land rights, organization, and daily herding management.

Norway has also accepted international conventions, declarations and agreements applicable to the Sámi as a minority and Indigenous people including:

* The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). Article 27 protects minorities, and Indigenous peoples, against discrimination: &quot;In those states in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities, shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or use their own language.&quot;
* ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989). The convention states that rights for the Indigenous peoples to land and natural resources are recognized as central for their material and cultural survival. In addition, Indigenous peoples should be entitled to exercise control over, and manage, their own institutions, ways of life and economic development in order to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the states in which they live.
* The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965).
* The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989).
* The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979).
* The Council of Europe&#x27;s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (1995).
* The Council of Europe&#x27;s Charter for Regional and Minority Languages (1992).
* The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007).

====Sweden====

Sweden recognised the existence of the &quot;Sámi nation&quot; in 1989, but the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169 has not been adopted. The Sametingslag was established as the Swedish Sámi Parliament on 1 January 1993. In 1998, Sweden formally apologized for the wrongs committed against the Sámi.

Sámi is one of five national minority languages recognized by Swedish law. The Compulsory School Ordinance states that Sámi pupils are entitled to be taught in their native language; however, a municipality is only obliged to arrange mother-tongue teaching in Sámi if a suitable teacher is available and the pupil has a basic knowledge of Sámi.

In 2010, after 15 years of negotiation, Laponiatjuottjudus, an association with Sámi majority control, will govern the UNESCO World Heritage Site Laponia. The reindeer-herding law will apply in the area as well.

====Finland====

The act establishing the Finnish Sámi Parliament (Finnish: Saamelaiskäräjät) was passed on 9 November 1973. Sámi people have had very little representation in Finnish national politics. In fact, in 2007, Janne Seurujärvi, a Finnish Centre Party representative, became the first Sámi ever to be elected to the Finnish Parliament.
Finland ratified the 1966 UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights though several cases have been brought before the UN Human Rights Committee. Of those, 36 cases involved a determination of the rights of individual Sámi in Finland and Sweden. The committee decisions clarify that Sámi are members of a minority within the meaning of Article 27 and that deprivation or erosion of their rights to practice traditional activities that are an essential element of their culture do come within the scope of Article 27. Finland recognized the Sámi as a &quot;people&quot; in 1995, but has yet to ratify ILO Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.

Sámi in Finland have had access to Sámi language instruction in some schools since the 1970s, and language rights were established in 1992. There are three Sámi languages spoken in Finland: North Sámi, Skolt Sámi and Inari Sámi. Of these languages, Inari Sámi, which is spoken by about 350 speakers, is the only one that is used entirely within the borders of Finland, mainly in the municipality of Inari.

The case of J. Lansman versus Finland concerned a challenge by Sámi reindeer herders in northern Finland to the Finnish Central Forestry Board&#x27;s plans to approve logging and construction of roads in an area used by the herdsmen as winter pasture and spring calving grounds. Finland has denied any aboriginal rights or land rights to the Sámi people; in Finland, non-Sámi can herd reindeer.

====Russia====
The 1822 Statute of Administration of Non-Russians in Siberia asserted state ownership over all the land in Siberia and then &quot;granted&quot; possessory rights to the natives. Governance of Indigenous groups, and especially collection of taxes from them, necessitated protection of Indigenous peoples against exploitation by traders and settlers. During the Soviet era, the inhabitants of the Kola tundra were forcibly relocated to kolkhozes (collective communities) by the state; most Sámi were settled at Lujávri (Lovozero).

The 1993 Constitution, Article 69 states, &quot;The Russian Federation guarantees the rights of small indigenous peoples in accordance with the generally accepted principles and standards of international law and international treaties of the Russian Federation.&quot; For the first time in Russia, the rights of Indigenous minorities were established in the 1993 Constitution.

The Russian Federation ratified the 1966 UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Section 2 explicitly forbids depriving a people of &quot;its own means of subsistence&quot;. The Russian Duma has adopted partial measures to implement it. The Russian Federation lists distinct Indigenous peoples as having special rights and protections under the Constitution and federal laws and decrees. These rights are linked to the category known since Soviet times as the (&quot;small-numbered peoples&quot;), a term that is often translated as &quot;Indigenous minorities&quot;, which include Arctic peoples such as the Sámi, Nenets, Evenki, and Chukchi.

In April 1999, the Russian Duma passed a law that guarantees socioeconomic and cultural development to all Indigenous minorities, protecting traditional living places and acknowledging some form of limited ownership of territories that have traditionally been used for hunting, herding, fishing, and gathering activities. The law, however, does not anticipate the transfer of title in fee simply to Indigenous minorities. The law does not recognize development rights, some proprietary rights including compensation for damage to the property, and limited exclusionary rights. It is not clear, however, whether protection of nature in the traditional places of inhabitation implies a right to exclude conflicting uses that are destructive to nature or whether they have the right to veto development.
The Russian Federation&#x27;s Land Code reinforces the rights of numerically small peoples (&quot;Indigenous minorities&quot;) to use places they inhabit and to continue traditional economic activities without being charged rent. Such lands cannot be allocated for unrelated activities (which might include oil, gas, and mineral development or tourism) without the consent of the Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, Indigenous minorities and ethnic groups are allowed to use environmentally protected lands and lands set aside as nature preserves to engage in their traditional modes of land use.

Regional law, Code of the Murmansk Oblast, calls on the organs of state power of the oblast to facilitate the native peoples of the Kola North, specifically naming the Sámi, &quot;in realization of their rights for preservation and development of their native language, national culture, traditions and customs.&quot; The third section of Article 21 states: &quot;In historically established areas of habitation, Sámi enjoy the rights for traditional use of nature and [traditional] activities.&quot;

Throughout the Russian North, Indigenous and local people have difficulties with exercising control over resources upon which they and their ancestors have depended for centuries. The failure to protect Indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities, (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy. The life ways and economy of Indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps. These groups depend upon different types of environment at differing times of the year, rather than upon exploiting a single commodity to exhaustion. Throughout northwestern Siberia, oil and gas development has disturbed pastureland and undermined the ability of Indigenous peoples to continue hunting, fishing, trapping, and herding activities. Roads constructed in connection with oil and gas exploration and development destroy and degrade pastureland, ancestral burial grounds, and sacred sites and increase hunting by oil workers on the territory used by Indigenous peoples.
In the Sámi homeland on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, regional authorities closed a fifty-mile (eighty-kilometer) stretch of the Ponoi River (and other rivers) to local fishing and granted exclusive fishing rights to a commercial company offering catch-and-release fishing to sport fishers largely from abroad. This deprived the local Sámi (see Article 21 of the Code of the Murmansk Oblast) of food for their families and community and of their traditional economic livelihood. Thus, closing the fishery to locals may have violated the test articulated by the U.N. Human Rights Committee and disregarded the Land Code, other legislative acts, and the 1992 Presidential decree. Sámi are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of Indigenous peoples leads to &quot;criminalization&quot; of local Indigenous populations who cannot survive without &quot;poaching&quot; resources that should be accessible to them legally.

Although Indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted Indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of Indigenous group rights to ownership of land. Russia has not adopted the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169.

====Nordic Sámi Convention====
On 16 November 2005 in Helsinki, a group of experts, led by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway Professor Carsten Smith, submitted a proposal for a Nordic Sámi Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for Sámi affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three Sámi Parliaments from the respective countries. This convention recognizes the Sámi as one Indigenous people residing across national borders in all three countries. A set of minimum standards is proposed for the rights of developing the Sámi language and culture and rights to land and water, livelihoods and society. The convention has not yet been ratified in the Nordic countries.

===Organization===
Sápmi demonstrates a distinct semi-national identity that transcends the borders between Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. There is no movement for sovereign state, but they do seek greater autonomy in respective nation states.

====Sámi Parliaments====
The Sámi Parliaments (&quot;Sámediggi&quot; in Northern Sámi, &quot;Sämitigge&quot; in Inari Sámi, &quot;Sää&#x27;mte&#x27;ǧǧ&quot; in Skolt Sámi) founded in Finland (1973), Norway (1989) and Sweden (1993) are the representative bodies for peoples of Sámi heritage. Russia has not recognized the Sámi as a minority and, as a result, recognizes no Sámi parliament, even if the Sámi people there have formed an unrecognised Sámi Parliament of Russia. There is no single, unified Sámi parliament that spans across the Nordic countries. Rather, each of the aforementioned three countries has set up its own separate legislatures for Sámi people, even though the three Sámi Parliaments often work together on cross-border issues. In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the Indigenous Sámi people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians whose mission is to work for the Sámi people and culture. Candidates&#x27; election promises often conflict with the institutions&#x27; submission to their governments, but as authorities, they do have some influence over the government.

In contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a &quot;siida&quot; (&quot;paliskunta&quot; in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of EEA countries, i.e., the European Union and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, are allowed to join a &quot;paliskunta&quot;.

====Russian organizations====
In 2010, the Sámi Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Peoples aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the Nordic countries, with particular focus on Indigenous peoples and minorities.

====Border conflicts====

Sápmi, the Sámi traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day Sápmi. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern Sápmi but areas that are beyond today&#x27;s Sápmi that reflect older territories. Today&#x27;s &quot;borders&quot; originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sámi groups themselves and more southern immigrants.

Owning land within the borders or being a member of a &quot;siida&quot; (Sámi corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with skepticism and anger amongst the &quot;siidas&quot;.

Court proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sámi viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one &quot;siida&quot; has introduced a sponsorship &quot;Reindeer Godfather&quot; concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These &quot;internal conflicts&quot; are usually conflicts between non-Sámi land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sámi ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the Sámi in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.

The question whether the fjeld&#x27;s territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the Sámi population is not answered.

From an Indigenous perspective, people &quot;belong to the land&quot;, the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.

==Culture==
To make up for past suppression, the authorities of Norway, Sweden and Finland now make an effort to build up Sámi cultural institutions and promote Sámi culture and language.

===Sámi identity symbols===
Although the Sámi have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of Sápmi, a Sámi nation, first gained acceptance among the Sámi in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a Sámi flag was created, a Sámi anthem was written, and the date of a national day was established.

====Sámi flag====
The Sámi flag was inaugurated during the Sámi Conference in Åre, Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist Astrid Båhl from Skibotn, Norway.

The motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman&#x27;s drum and the poem &quot;Päiven Pārne (&quot;Sons of the Sun&quot;) by the South Sámi Anders Fjellner describing the Sámi as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sámi colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).

====Sámi People&#x27;s Day====

The Sámi National Day falls on 6 February as this date was when the first Sámi congress was held in 1917 in Trondheim, Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sámi came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sámi congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized 6 February as Sámi National Day.

====&quot;Song of the Sámi People&quot;====

&quot;&quot; (&quot;Song of the Sámi People&quot;, ) was originally a poem written by Isak Saba that was published in the newspaper &quot;Saǥai Muittalægje&quot; for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the Sámi anthem. Arne Sørli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sámi Conference in Helsinki in 1992. &quot;&quot; has been translated into all of the Sámi languages.

===Religion===
Many Sámi people continued to practice their religion up until the 18th century. Most Sámi today belong to the state-run Lutheran churches of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Some Sámi in Russia belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, and similarly, some Skolt Sámi resettled in Finland are also part of an Eastern Orthodox congregation, with an additional small population in Norway.

====Indigenous Sámi religion====
Indigenous Sámi religion is a type of polytheism. (See Sámi deities.) There is some diversity due to the wide area that is Sápmi, allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The beliefs are closely connected to the land, animism, and the supernatural. Sámi spirituality is often characterized by pantheism, a strong emphasis on the importance of personal spirituality and its interconnectivity with one&#x27;s own daily life, and a deep connection between the natural and spiritual &quot;worlds&quot;. Among other roles, the Noaidi, or Sámi shaman, enables ritual communication with the supernatural through the use of tools such as drums, Joik, Fadno, chants, sacred objects, and fly agaric. Some practices within the Sámi religion include natural sacred sites such as mountains, springs, land formations, Sieidi, as well as human-made ones such as petroglyphs and labyrinths.

Sámi cosmology divides the universe into three worlds. The upper world is related to the South, warmth, life, and the color white. It is also the dwelling of the gods. The middle world is like the Norse Midgard, it is the dwelling of humans and it is associated with the color red. The third world is the underworld and it is associated with the color black, it represents the north, the cold and it is inhabited by otters, loons, and seals and mythical animals.

Sámi religion shares some elements with Norse mythology, possibly from early contacts with trading Vikings (or vice versa). They were the last worshippers of Thor, as late as the 18th century according to contemporary ethnographers. Through a mainly French initiative from Joseph Paul Gaimard as part of his La Recherche Expedition, Lars Levi Læstadius began research on Sámi mythology. His work resulted in &quot;Fragments of Lappish Mythology&quot;, since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed &quot;Theory of Gods&quot;, &quot;Theory of Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic&quot; and &quot;Sami sagas&quot;. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sámi groups. The mythology has common elements with other Indigenous religions as well—such as those of Indigenous peoples in Siberia and North America.

====Christian mission====
The term &quot;Sámi religion&quot; usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most Sámi until approximately the 18th century. Christianity was introduced by Roman Catholic missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the Protestant Reformation, and rune drums were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sámi practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sámi were considered to possess &quot;witchcraft&quot; powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.

In Norway, a major effort to convert the Sámi was made around 1720, when Thomas von Westen, the &quot;Apostle of the Sámi&quot;, burned drums, burned sacred objects, and converted people. Out of the estimated thousands of drums before this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe. Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), álda and sáivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.

In the far east of the Sámi area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sámi in the 16th century. Today, St. George&#x27;s chapel in Neiden, Norway (1565), testifies to this effort.

====Laestadius====
Around 1840 Swedish Sámi Lutheran pastor and administrator Lars Levi Laestadius initiated among the Sámi a puritanical pietist movement emphasizing complete abstinence from alcohol. This movement is still very dominant in Sámi-speaking areas. Laestadius spoke many languages, and he became fluent and preached in Finnish and Northern Sámi in addition to his native Southern Sámi and Swedish, the language he used for scholarly publications.

Two great challenges Laestadius had faced since his early days as a church minister were the indifference of his Sámi parishioners, who had been forced by the Swedish government to convert from their shamanistic religion to Lutheranism, and the misery alcoholism caused them. The spiritual understanding Laestadius acquired and shared in his new sermons &quot;filled with vivid metaphors from the lives of the Sámi that they could understand, ... about a God who cared about the lives of the people&quot; had a profound positive effect on both problems. One account from a Sámi cultural perspective recalls a new desire among the Sámi to learn to read and a &quot;bustle and energy in the church, with people confessing their sins, crying and praying for forgiveness ... [Alcohol abuse] and the theft of [the Sámis&#x27;] reindeer diminished, which had a positive influence on the Sámi&#x27;s relationships, finances and family life.&quot;

====Neo-shamanism and traditional healing====
Today there are a number of Sámi who seek to return to the traditional Pagan values of their ancestors. There are also some Sámi who claim to be &quot;noaidi&quot; and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in New Age arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a religion based on that of their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan prejudice has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sámi religious tradition. Traditional Sámi beliefs are composed of three intertwining elements: animism, shamanism, and polytheism. Sámi animism is manifested in the Sámi&#x27;s belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul; and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional Sámi beliefs include a multitude of spirits. Many contemporary practitioners are compared to practitioners of neo-paganism, as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations, but others feel they are attempting to revive or reconstruct Indigenous Sámi religions as found in historic, folkloric sources and oral traditions.

In 2012, County Governor of Troms approved Shamanic Association of Tromsø as a new religion.

A very different religious idea is represented by the numerous &quot;wise men&quot; and &quot;wise women&quot; found throughout the Sámi area. They often offer to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional elements, such as older Sámi teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that Christian missionaries taught their ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.

===Duodji (craft)===


Duodji, the Sámi handicraft, originates from the time when the Sámis were self-supporting nomads, believing therefore that an object should first and foremost serve a purpose rather than being primarily decorative. Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled scrimshawed Sámi knives, drums, and guksi (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as gákti (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.

===Clothing===

Gákti are the traditional clothing worn by the Sámi people. The gákti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.

Traditionally, the gákti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women&#x27;s gákti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1–3 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Sámi boots (or &quot;nutukas&quot;) can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern Sámi boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different gákti for women and men; men&#x27;s gákti have a shorter &quot;jacket-skirt&quot; than a women&#x27;s long dress. Traditional gákti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho (luhkka) and rope/lasso.

The colours, patterns and the jewellery of the gákti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqués in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern Sámi have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by sex, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sápmi.

The gákti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassels, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved or scrimshawed antler-handled knife. Some Eastern Sámi also have a hooded jumper (малиц) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.

===Media and literature===
* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern Sámi on national TV in Norway, Sweden and Finland. Children&#x27;s television shows in Sámi are also frequently made. There is also a radio station for Northern Sámi, which has some news programs in the other Sámi languages.
* A single daily newspaper is published in Northern Sámi, &quot;Ávvir&quot;, along with a few magazines.
* There is a Sámi theatre, Beaivvaš, in Kautokeino on the Norwegian side, as well as in Kiruna on the Swedish side. Both tour the entire Sámi area with drama written by Sámi authors or international translations.
* A number of novels and poetry collections are published every year in Northern Sámi, and sometimes in the other Sámi languages as well. The largest Sámi publishing house is Davvi Girji.
* The first secular book published in a Sámi language was Johan Turi&#x27;s &quot;Muitalus sámiid birra&quot; (An Account of the Sámi), released in 1910 with text in Northern Sámi and Danish.
*In 2023 Sámi author Ann-Helén Laestadius wrote &quot;Stolen&quot;, a novel of the Sámi in Sweden. It was adapted into a Netflix film of the same name in 2024.

===Music===
A characteristic feature of Sámi musical tradition is the singing of &quot;joik&quot;. Joiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung &quot;a cappella&quot;, usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Joiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany joiks. The only traditional Sámi instruments that were sometimes used to accompany joik are the &quot;fadno&quot; flute (made from reed-like &quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).

===Education===
* Education with Sámi as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the Sámi area.
* Sámi University College is located in Kautokeino. Sámi language is studied in several universities in all countries, most notably the University of Tromsø, which considers Sámi a mother tongue, not a foreign language.

===Festivals===
* Numerous Sámi festivals throughout the Sápmi area celebrate different aspects of the Sámi culture. The best known on the Norwegian side is Riddu Riđđu, though there are others, such as in Inari. Among the most festive are the Easter festivals taking place in Kautokeino Municipality and Karasjok Municipality before the springtime reindeer migration to the coast. These festivals combine traditional culture with modern phenomena such as snowmobile races. They celebrated the new year known as Ođđajagemánnu. Shamanic culture is celebrated at the Isogaisa Festival in Tennevoll, Norway.

===Visual arts===
In addition to Duodji (Sámi handicraft), there is a developing area of contemporary Sámi visual art. Galleries such as Sámi Dáiddaguovddáš (Sami Center for Contemporary Art) are being established.

===Dance===
Unlike many other Indigenous peoples, traditional dance is generally not a visible manifestation of Sámi identity. This has led to a common misconception that Sámi, at least in western Sápmi, have no traditional dance culture.

The Sámi modern dance company Kompani Nomad looked to old descriptions of shamanistic rituals and behaviors to identify &quot;lost&quot; Sámi dances and reimagine them through contemporary dance. An example is the &quot;lihkadus&quot; (ecstasy dance) described in sources from the 16th and 17th centuries, but which was adapted by Swedish–Sámi priest Lars Levi Laestadius, who brought it and other Sámi traditions into the Church of Sweden as part of the Laestadianism movement.

Partner and group dancing have been a part of Skolt Sámi culture and among Sámi on the Kola Peninsula since at least the second half of the 1800s. These square dances, couple dances, circle dances, and singing games are influenced by Karelian and Northern Russian dance cultures, likely under the influence of Russian traders, military service under the tsar, and the Russian Orthodox Church. This eastern Sápmi dance tradition has been more continuous and has been adapted by modern Sámi dance companies such as Johtti Kompani.

===Reindeer husbandry===

Reindeer husbandry has been and still is an important aspect of Sámi culture. Traditionally the Sámi lived and worked in reindeer herding groups called &quot;siidat&quot;, which consist of several families and their herds. Members of the &quot;siida&quot; helped each other with the management and husbandry of the herds. During the years of forced assimilation, the areas in which reindeer herding was an important livelihood were among the few where the Sámi culture and language survived.

Today in Norway and Sweden, reindeer husbandry is legally protected as an exclusive Sámi livelihood, such that only persons of Sámi descent with a linkage to a reindeer herding family can own, and hence make a living off, reindeer. Presently, about 2,800 people are engaged in reindeer herding in Norway. In Finland, reindeer husbandry is not exclusive and is also practiced to a limited degree by ethnic Finns. Legally, it is restricted to EU/EEA nationals resident in the area. In the north (Lapland), it plays a major role in the local economy, while its economic impact is lesser in the southern parts of the area (Province of Oulu).

Among the reindeer herders in Sámi villages, the women usually have a higher level of formal education in the area.

===Games===
The Sámi have traditionally played both card games and board games, but few Sámi games have survived, because Christian missionaries and Laestadianists considered such games sinful. The rules of only three Sámi board games have been preserved into modern times. &quot;Sáhkku&quot; is a running-fight board game where each player controls a set of soldiers (referred to as &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot;) that race across a board in a loop, attempting to eliminate the other player&#x27;s soldiers. The game is related to South Scandinavian daldøs, Arabian tâb and Indian tablan. Sáhkku differs from these games in several respects, most notably the addition of a piece – &quot;the king&quot; – that changes gameplay radically. &quot;Tablut&quot; is a pure strategy game in the tafl family. The game features &quot;Swedes&quot; and a &quot;Swedish king&quot; whose goal is to escape, and an army of &quot;Muscovites&quot; whose goal is to capture the king. Tablut is the only tafl game where a relatively intact set of rules have survived into our time. Hence, all modern versions of tafl (commonly called &quot;Hnefatafl&quot; and marketed exclusively as &quot;Norse&quot; or &quot;Viking&quot; games) are based on the Sámi game of tablut. &quot;Dablot Prejjesne&quot; is a game related to alquerque which differs from most such games (e.g. draughts) by having pieces of three different ranks. The game&#x27;s two sides are referred to as &quot;Sámi&quot; (king, prince, warriors) and &quot;Finlenders&quot; (landowners, landowner&#x27;s son, farmers).

==Cultural region==

Sápmi is located in Northern Europe, includes the northern parts of Fennoscandia and spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Non-Sámi and many regional maps have often called this same region &quot;Lapland&quot; as there is considerable regional overlap between Sápmi and the provinces of Lappland in Sweden and Lapland in Finland. Much of Sápmi falls outside of those provinces. Despite the terms use in tourism, &quot;Lapland&quot; can be either misleading or offensive, or both, to Sámi, depending on the context and where this word is used. Among the Sámi people, &quot;Sápmi&quot; is strictly used and acceptable.

===Extent===
There is no official geographic definition for the boundaries of Sápmi. However, the following counties and provinces are usually included:
* Finnmark county in Norway
* Jämtland county in Sweden
* Lapland region in Finland
* Murmansk oblast in Russia
* Nord-Trøndelag county in Norway
* Nordland county in Norway
* Norrbotten county in Sweden
* Troms county in Norway
* Västerbotten county in Sweden

The municipalities of Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Arjeplog in Swedish Lappland were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 as a &quot;Laponian Area&quot;.

The Sámi Domicile Area in Finland consists of the municipalities of Enontekiö, Utsjoki and Inari as well as a part of the municipality of Sodankylä. About 3,000 of Finland&#x27;s about 10,000 people speak Sámi as their mother tongue. Today, a considerable part of the Finnish Sámi live outside the Sápmi region, for example in Helsinki there is a relatively large and active Sámi minority. According to the Sámi Parliament, the Sámi live in 230 municipalities out of a total of 336 municipalities in Finland. 75% of Sámi under the age of 10 live outside the Sápmi region.

===Important Sámi settlements===

The following municipalities have a significant Sámi population or host Sámi institutions (Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish or Russian name in parentheses):
* Aanaar, Anár, or Aanar (Inari), is the location of the Finnish Sámi Parliament, Sajos Sámi Cultural Centre, SAKK – (Sámi Education Institute), Anarâškielâ servi (Inari Sámi Language Association), and the Inari Sámi Siida Museum.
* Aarborte (Hattfjelldal) is a southern Sámi center with a Southern Sámi-language school and a Sámi culture center.
* Árjepluovve (Arjeplog) is the Pite Saami center in Sweden.
* Deatnu (Tana) has a significant Sámi population.
* Divtasvuodna (Tysfjord) is a center for the Lule-Sámi population. The Árran Lule-Sámi center is located here.
* Gáivuotna Municipality (Kåfjord, Troms) is an important center for the Sea-Sámi culture. Each summer the Riddu Riđđu festival is held in Gáivuotna. The municipality has a Sámi-language center and hosts the Ája Sámi Center. The opposition against Sámi language and culture revitalization in Gáivuotna was infamous in the late 1990s and included Sámi-language road signs being shot to pieces repeatedly.
* Giron (Kiruna), proposed seat of the Swedish Sámi Parliament.
* Guovdageaidnu (Kautokeino) is perhaps the cultural capital of the Sámi. About 90% of the population speaks Sámi. Several Sámi institutions are located in Kautokeino including: Beaivváš Sámi Theatre, a Sámi secondary school and reindeer-herding School, the Sámi University College, the Nordic Sámi Research Institute, the Sámi Language Board, the Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous People, and the International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry. In addition, several Sámi media are located in Kautokeino including the Sámi-language &quot;Áššu&quot; newspaper, and the DAT Sámi publishing house and record company. Kautokeino also hosts the Sami Easter Festival, which includes the Sámi Grand Prix 2010 (Sámi Musicfestival) and the Reindeer Racing World Cup. The Kautokeino rebellion in 1852 is one of the few Sámi rebellions against the Norwegian government&#x27;s oppression against the Sámi.
* Iänudâh, or Eanodat (Enontekiö).
* Jiellevárri, or Váhčir (Gällivare)
* Jåhkåmåhkke (Jokkmokk) holds a Sámi market on the first weekend of every February and has a Sámi school for language and traditional knowledge called Samij Åhpadusguovdásj.
* Kárášjohka (Karasjok) is the seat of the Norwegian Sámi Parliament. Other important Sámi institutions are located in Kárášjohka, including NRK Sámi Radio, the Sámi Collections museum, the Sámi Art Centre, the Sámi Specialist Library, the Mid-Finnmark legal office, a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic – one of few on a national level approved for providing full specialist training. Other significant institutions include a Sámi Specialist Medical Centre, and the Sámi Health Research Institute. In addition, the Sápmi cultural park is in the township, and the Sámi-language &quot;Min Áigi&quot; newspaper is published here.
* Leavdnja (Lakselv) in Porsáŋgu (Porsanger) municipality is the location of the Finnmark Estate and the &quot;Ságat&quot; Sámi newspaper. The Finnmarkseiendommen organization owns and manages about 95% of the land in Finnmark, and 50% of its board members are elected by the Norwegian Sámi Parliament.
* Луя̄ввьр (Lovozero)
* Staare (Östersund) is the center for the Southern Sámi people living in Sweden. It is the site for Gaaltije – centre for South Sámi culture – a living source of knowledge for South Sámi culture, history and business. Staare also hosts the Sámi Information Centre and one of the offices to the Sámi Parliament in Sweden.
* Njauddâm is the center for the Skolt Sámi of Norway, which have their own museum Äʹvv in the town.
* Ohcejohka (Utsjoki).
* Snåase (Snåsa) is a center for the Southern Sámi language and the only municipality in Norway where Southern Sámi is an official language. The Saemien Sijte Southern Sámi museum is located in Snåase.
* Unjárga (Nesseby) is an important center for the Sea Sámi culture. It is also the site for the Várjjat Sámi Museum and the Norwegian Sámi Parliament&#x27;s department of culture and environment. The first Sámi to be elected into the Norwegian Parliament, Isak Saba, was born there.
* Árviesjávrrie (Arvidsjaur). New settlers from the south of Sweden did not arrive until the second half of the 18th century. Because of that, Sámi tradition and culture has been well preserved. Sámi people living in the south of Norrbotten, Sweden, use the city for Reindeer herding during the summer. During winter they move the Reindeers to the coast, to Piteå.

==Demographics==
In the geographical area of Sápmi, the Sámi are a small population. According to some, the estimated total Sámi population is about 70,000. One problem when attempting to count the population of the Sámi is that there are few common criteria of what &quot;being a Sámi&quot; constitutes. In addition, there are several Sámi languages and additional dialects, and there are several areas in Sapmi where few of the Sámi speak their native language due to the forced cultural assimilation, but still consider themselves Sámi. Other identity markers are kinship (which can be said to, at some level or other, be of high importance for all Sámi), the geographical region of Sápmi where their family came from, or protecting or preserving certain aspects of Sámi culture.

All the Nordic Sámi Parliaments have included as the &quot;core&quot; criterion for registering as a Sámi the identity in itself—one must declare that one truly considers oneself a Sámi. Objective criteria vary, but are generally related to kinship or language.

Still, due to the cultural assimilation of the Sámi people that had occurred in the four countries over the centuries, population estimates are difficult to measure precisely. The population has been estimated to be between 80,000 and 135,000 across the whole Nordic region, including urban areas such as Oslo, Norway, traditionally considered outside Sápmi. The Norwegian state recognizes any Norwegian as Sámi if he or she has one great-grandparent whose home language was Sámi, but there is not, and has never been, any registration of the home language spoken by Norwegian people.

Roughly half of all Sámi live in Norway, but many live in Sweden, with smaller groups living in the far north of Finland and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sámi in Russia were forced by the Soviet authorities to relocate to a collective called Lovozero/Lujávri, in the central part of the Kola Peninsula.

===Language===
There is no single Sámi language, but a group of ten distinct Sámi languages. Six of these languages have their own written standards. The Sámi languages are relatively closely related, but not mutually intelligible; for instance, speakers of Southern Sámi cannot understand Northern Sámi. Especially earlier, these distinct languages were referred to as &quot;dialects&quot;, but today, this is considered misleading due to the deep differences between the varieties. Most Sámi languages are spoken in several countries, because linguistic borders do not correspond to national borders.

All Sámi languages are at some degree of endangerment, ranging from what UNESCO defines as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; to &quot;extinct&quot;. This is due in part to historic laws prohibiting the use of Sámi languages in schools and at home in Sweden and Norway. Sámi languages, and Sámi song-chants, called joiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to Sámi instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the Sámi into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, controlled by the government. For example, in Russia, Sámi children were taken away when aged 1–2 and returned when aged 15–17 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all Sámi viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking Sámi has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.

The Sámi languages belong to the Uralic language family, linguistically related to Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. Due to prolonged contact and import of items foreign to Sámi culture from neighboring Scandinavians, there are a number of Germanic loanwords in Sámi, particularly for &quot;urban&quot; objects. The majority of the Sámi now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of Sámi languages among Sámi and persons of Sámi origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists. Many older Sámi still refuse to speak Sámi. In addition, Sámi parents still feel alienated from schools and hence do not participate as much as they could in shaping school curricula and policy.

In Norway, the name of the language is &quot;samisk&quot;, and the name of the people is &quot;Same&quot;; in Finland, the name of the language is spelled &quot;saame&quot; and the name of the people &quot;saamelainen&quot;.

American scientist Michael E. Krauss published in 1997 an estimate of Sámi population and their languages.

Kemi Sámi language became extinct in the 19th century.

Many Sámi do not speak any of the Sámi languages any more due to historical assimilation policies, so the number of Sámi living in each area is much higher.

===Division by geography===
Sápmi is traditionally divided into:
* Eastern Sápmi (Inari, Skolt, Akkala, Kildin and Teri Sámi in Kola peninsula (Russia) and Inari (Finland, formerly also in eastern Norway)
* Northern Sápmi (Northern, Lule and Pite Sámi in most of northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland)
* Southern Sápmi (Ume and Southern Sámi in central parts of Sweden and Norway)

It should also be noted that many Sámi now live outside Sápmi, in large cities such as Oslo in Norway.

===Division by occupation===
A division often used in Northern Sámi is based on occupation and the area of living. This division is also used in many historical texts:
* Reindeer Sámi or Mountain Sámi (in Northern Sámi boazosapmelash or badjeolmmosh). Previously nomadic Sámi living as reindeer herders. Now most have a permanent residence in the Sámi core areas. Some 10% of Sámi practice reindeer herding, which is seen as a fundamental part of a Sámi culture and, in some parts of the Nordic countries, can be practiced by Sámis only.
* Sea Sámi (in Northern Sámi &quot;mearasapmelash&quot;). These lived traditionally by combining fishing and small-scale farming. Today, often used for all Sámi from the coast regardless of their occupation.
* Forest Sámi who traditionally lived by combining fishing in inland rivers and lakes with small-scale reindeer-herding.
* City Sámi who are now probably the largest group of Sámi.

===Division by country===
According to the Norwegian Sámi Parliament, the Sámi population of Norway is 40,000. If all people who speak Sámi or have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who speaks or spoke Sámi are included, the number reaches 70,000. As of 2021, 20,545 people were registered to vote in the election for the Sámi Parliament in Norway. The bulk of the Sámi live in Finnmark and Northern Troms, but there are also Sámi populations in Southern Troms, Nordland and Trøndelag. Due to recent migration, it has also been claimed that Oslo is the municipality with the largest Sámi population. The Sámi are in a majority only in Guovdageaidnu Municipality, Kárášjohka Municipality, Porsáŋgu Municipality, Deatnu Municipality and Unjárga Municipality in Finnmark, and Gáivuotna Municipality in Northern Troms. This area is also known as the Sámi core area, and Sámi and Norwegian are co-equal administrative languages here.

According to the Swedish Sámi Parliament, estimates of the size of the Sámi population of Sweden ranges from 20,000 to 40,000. As of 2021, 9,226 people were registered to vote in elections to the Swedish Sámi Parliament.

According to the Finnish Population Registry Center and the Finnish Sámi Parliament, the Sámi population living in Finland was 10,753 in 2019. As of 31 December 2021, only 2,023 people were registered as speaking a Sámi language as their mother tongue.

According to the 2010 All-Russia Census, the Sámi population of Russia was 1,771.

===Sámi diaspora outside of Sápmi===

There are an estimated 30,000 people living in North America who are either Sámi, or descendants of Sámi. Most have settled in areas that are known to have Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish immigrants. Some of the concentrated areas of Sámi Americans are Minnesota, North Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Illinois, California, Washington, Utah and Alaska; and throughout Canada, including Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Northern Ontario, and the Canadian territories of the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut.

Descendants of these Sámi immigrants typically know little of their heritage because their ancestors purposely hid their Indigenous culture to avoid discrimination from the dominating Scandinavian or Nordic culture. Some of these Sámi are part of a diaspora that moved to North America in order to escape assimilation policies in their home countries. There were also several Sámi families that were brought to North America with herds of reindeer by the U.S. and Canadian governments as part of the Alaska Reindeer Service designed to teach the Inuit about reindeer herding.

Some of these Sámi immigrants and descendants of immigrants are members of the Sami Siida of North America.

==Genetic studies==
Anthropologists have been studying the Sámi people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans. Recent genetic studies have indicated that the two most frequent maternal lineages of the Sámi people are the haplogroups V (Neolithic in Europe and not found in Finland 1500 years ago) and U5b (ancient in Europe). Y-chromosome haplogroup N-VL29 makes up 20%, came from Siberia 3500 years ago. Y-chromosome N-Z1936 makes up similarly about 20%, and likely came from Siberia with the Sámi language, but slightly later than N-VL29. This tallies with archeological evidence suggesting that several different cultural groups made their way to the core area of Sámi from 8000 to 6000 BC, presumably including some of the ancestors of present-day Sámi.

The Sámi have been found to be genetically unrelated to people of the Pitted Ware culture. The Pitted Ware culture are in turn genetically continuous with the original Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers.

===History of scientific research carried out on the Sámi===

The genetic makeup of Sámi people has been extensively studied for as long as such research has been in existence. Ethnographic photography of the Sámi began with the invention of the camera in the 19th century. This continued on into the 1920s and 1930s, when Sámi were photographed naked and anatomically measured by scientists, with the help of the local police—sometimes at gunpoint—to collect data that would justify their own racial theories. Thus, there is a degree of distrust by some in the Sámi community towards genetic research.

Sámi graves were plundered to provide research materials, of which their remains and artifacts from this period from across Sápmi can still be found in various state collections. In the late 19th century, colonial fascination with Arctic peoples led to human beings exhibited in human zoos. Sámi people were exhibited with their traditional lavvu tents, weapons, and sleds, beside a group of reindeer at Tierpark Hagenbeck and other zoos across the globe.

<doc id="27123" wikidata="Q1201" url="?curid=27123" title="Saarland">
<text>Saarland (, ; ) is a state of Germany in the southwest of the country. With an area of and population of 990,509 in 2018, it is the smallest German state in area apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg, and the smallest in population apart from Bremen. Saarbrücken is the state capital and largest city; other cities include Neunkirchen and Saarlouis. Saarland is mainly surrounded by the department of Moselle (Grand Est) in France to the west and south and the neighboring state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany to the north and east; it also shares a small border about long with the canton of Remich in Luxembourg to the northwest.

Having long been a relatively small part of the long-contested territories along the Franco-German linguistic border, Saarland first gained specific economic and strategic importance in the nineteenth century due to the wealth of its coal deposits and the heavy industrialization that grew as a result. Saarland was first established as a distinct political entity in 1920 after World War I as the Territory of the Saar Basin, which was occupied and governed by France under a League of Nations mandate.

Saarland was returned to Nazi Germany in the 1935 Saar status referendum. Following World War II in Europe, the territory was occupied by France then became the Saar Protectorate on 17 December 1947. After the 1955 Saar Statute referendum, it joined the Federal Republic of Germany as a state on 1 January 1957. Saarland used its own currency, the Saar franc, and postage stamps issued specially for the territory until 1959.

== History ==
=== Before World War I ===
The region of the Saarland was settled by the Celtic tribes of Treveri and Mediomatrici. The most impressive relic of their time is the remains of a fortress of refuge at Otzenhausen in the north of the Saarland. In the 1st century BC, the Roman Empire made the region part of its province of Belgica, and the Celtic population mixed with the Roman conquerors. The region became wealthy, which can still be seen in the remains of Roman villas and villages.

Roman rule ended in the 5th century, when the Franks conquered the territory. For the next 1,300 years the region shared the history of the Kingdom of the Franks, the Carolingian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. The region of the Saarland was divided into several small territories, some of which were ruled by sovereigns of adjoining regions. Most important of the local rulers were the counts of Nassau-Saarbrücken. Within the Holy Roman Empire these territories gained a wide range of independence, threatened, however, by the French kings, who sought from the 17th century onwards to incorporate all the territories on the western side of the river Rhine. They invaded the area in 1635, 1676, 1679, and 1734, extending their realm to the river Saar and establishing the city and stronghold of Saarlouis in 1680.

It was not the king of France but the armies of the French Revolution who terminated the independence of the states in the region of the Saarland. After 1792 they conquered the region and made it part of the French Republic. While a strip in the west belonged to the Moselle department, the centre in 1798 became part of the Sarre department, and the east became part of the Mont-Tonnerre department. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the region was divided again. Most of it became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. Another part in the east, corresponding to the present Saarpfalz district, was allocated to the Kingdom of Bavaria. A small part in the northeast was ruled by the Duke of Oldenburg.

On 31 July 1870, the French Emperor Napoleon III ordered an invasion across the River Saar to seize Saarbrücken. The first shots of the Franco-Prussian War of 187071 were fired on the heights of Spichern during the Battle of Spicheren, south of Saarbrücken. The Saar region became part of the German Empire which came into existence on 18 January 1871, during the course of the war.

=== Interwar history ===

In 1921, the Saargebiet was occupied by Britain and France under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The occupied area included portions of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate. In practice the region was administered by France. In 1920, this was formalized by a 15-year mandate by the League of Nations.

In 1933, a considerable number of communists and other political opponents of Nazism fled to the Saar, as it was the only part of Germany that remained outside national administration following the First World War. As a result, anti-Nazi groups agitated for the Saarland to remain under French administration. However, with most of the population being ethnically German, such views were considered suspect or even treasonous, and therefore found little support.

When the original 15-year term was over, a plebiscite was held in the territory on 13 January 1935 in which 90.8 percent of those voting favoured rejoining Germany.

=== Nazi period ===
Following the referendum Josef Bürckel was appointed on 1 March 1935 as the German Reich&#x27;s commissioner for reintegration (). Once the reincorporation was accomplished, on 17 June 1936 his title was changed to (Reich Commissioner for the Saarland). In September 1939, in response to the German invasion of Poland, French forces invaded the Saarland in a half-hearted offensive, occupying some villages and meeting little resistance, before withdrawing. After 8 April 1940 Bürckel&#x27;s title was changed again to (Reich Commissioner for the Saar Palatinate); finally, after 11 March 1941, Bürckel was made (Reich Governor of the Western Borderland). He died on 28 September 1944 and was succeeded by Willi Stöhr, who remained in office until the region fell to advancing American forces in March 1945.

=== History after World War II ===

After World War II, the Saarland came under French occupation again and became the Saar Protectorate. France did not annex the Saar or expel the local German population, in contrast to the fate of the territories which were merged by Poland and the USSR. In his speech &quot;Restatement of Policy on Germany&quot;, made in Stuttgart on 6 September 1946, United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes stated the U.S. position on detaching the Saar from Germany: &quot;The United States does not feel that it can deny to France, which has been invaded three times by Germany in 70 years, its claim to the Saar territory&quot;.

The Saar and Ruhr areas were historically a central location for coal mining. This attracted the steel industry, which is essential for the production of munitions. The Treaty of Paris (1951) established the European Coal and Steel Community, which led to the termination of the International Authority for the Ruhr (whose purpose was to regulate Ruhr coal and steel production and distribution). However, the Treaty sidestepped the issue of the Saar protectorate: an attached protocol stated Germany and France agreed the Treaty would have no bearing on their views of the status of the Saar.

In 1948, the French government established Saarland University under the auspices of the University of Nancy. It is the principal university in the state, the other being (HTW Saar).

The Saarland was headed by a military governor from 30 August 1945: Gilbert Yves Edmond Grandval (1904–1981), who remained, on 1 January 1948, as High Commissioner, and from January 1952 – June 1955 as the first of two French ambassadors, his successor being Éric de Carbonnel (1910–1965) until 1956.
Saarland, however, was allowed a regional administration very early, consecutively headed by:
* a president of the Government:
** 31 July 1945 – 8 June 1946: Hans Neureuther, non-partisan
* a chairman of the (until 15 December 1947, Provisional) Administration Commission:
** 8 June 1946 – 20 December 1947: Erwin Müller (1906–1968), non-partisan
* Minister-presidents (as in any state):
** 20 December 1947 – 29 October 1955: Johannes Hoffmann (1890–1967), CVP
** 29 October 1955 – 10 January 1956 Heinrich Welsch (1888–1976), non-partisan
** 10 January 1956 – 4 June 1957: Hubert Ney (1892–1984), CDU

In 1954, France and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) developed a detailed plan called the (Saar Statute) to establish an independent Saarland. It was signed as an agreement between the two countries on 23 October 1954 as one of the Paris Pacts, but a plebiscite held on 23 October 1955 rejected it by 67.7%.

On 27 October 1956, the Saar Treaty declared that Saarland should be allowed to join West Germany, which it did on 1 January 1957. This was the last significant international border change in Europe until the fall of Communism over 30 years later.

The Saarland&#x27;s unification with West Germany was sometimes referred to as the (&#x27;little reunification&#x27;, in contrast with the post-Cold War reunification with the GDR). After unification, the Saar franc remained as the territory&#x27;s currency until West Germany&#x27;s Deutsche Mark replaced it on 7 July 1959. The Saar Treaty established that French, not English as in the rest of West Germany, should remain the first foreign language taught in Saarland schools; this provision was still largely followed after it was no longer binding.

Since 1971, Saarland has been a member of SaarLorLux, a euroregion created from Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland Palatinate, and Wallonia.

The state borders France (department of Moselle, which forms part of the region of Grand Est) to the south and west, Luxembourg (Grevenmacher District) to the west and Rhineland-Palatinate to the north and the east. It is named after the river Saar, a tributary of the Moselle (itself a tributary of the Rhine), which runs through the state from the south to the northwest.

Saarland is about the same size as neighboring Luxembourg with Luxembourg being 2,586sq km (998 sq mi) and Saarland at 2,570sq km (990sq mi). Within Germany, it is slightly larger than the combined area of the three city-states (Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg) but is by far the smallest of the &quot;Flächenländer&quot; (&quot;area-states&quot;). It is less than one sixth the size of Schleswig-Holstein, the next smallest German state. One third of the land area of the Saarland is covered by forest, one of the highest percentages in Germany. The state is generally hilly; the highest mountain is the Dollberg with a height of .
Most inhabitants live in a city agglomeration on the French border, surrounding the capital of Saarbrücken.

===Religion===
Saarland is the most religious state in Germany. The adherents of the Catholic Church comprise 56.8% of the population, organised in the two dioceses of Trier (comprising the formerly Prussian part of Saarland) and Speyer (for the smaller eastern formerly Palatine part). 17.5% of the Saarlandic population adhere to the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD), organised in the two Landeskirchen named Evangelical Church in the Rhineland and Evangelical Church of the Palatinate, both following the same former territorial partition. 25.7% are not affiliated with one of these churches.

Saarland has the highest concentration of Roman Catholics of any German state, and is the only state in which Catholics form an absolute majority (over 50%).


==Politics==

Except for the periods between 1985 and 1999, as well as since 2022 – when the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has held a majority of seats in the Landtag (state diet) – the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has governed the Saarland, either alone or in coalition, since the accession of the state to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957.

After the 2022 state elections the previous Grand Coalition between the CDU and SPD, the two largest parties in the Landtag, was replaced by an SPD majority government, the only single-party majority government of any German state, led by minister-president Anke Rehlinger.

===Current government of the Saarland===

==Economy==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was €35.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 1.1% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €32,800 or 109% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 93% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the second lowest of all states in West Germany.

Important income sources are the automobile industry, steel industry, ceramic industry and computer science and information systems industry. In the past, coal mining was an important branch of industry. However, the last coal mine in Saarland closed in 2012, ending 250 years of coal mining history in the region. The decision to close the mines was motivated by safety concerns about earthquakes in the region.

The unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in October 2018 and was higher than the national average but below the EU28 average.
== Education ==

Saarland is home to the Saarland University and the administrative headquarters of the Franco-German University.

==Culture==

===Local dialect===

People in the Saarland speak Rhine Franconian (in the southeast, very similar to that dialect spoken in the western part of the Palatinate) and Moselle Franconian (in the northwest, very similar to that dialect spoken along the river Moselle and the cities of Trier or even in Luxembourg). Outside of the Saarland, specifically the Rhine-Franconian variant spoken in the state capital Saarbrücken is generally considered to be &quot;the&quot; Saarland dialect. The two dialect regions are mainly separated by the / isogloss; in the northwestern portion of the state, including cities such as Saarlouis, standard German is pronounced with a final instead of an .

In general, both dialects are an integral part of Saarland identity.

Both dialects, particularly in their respective Saarland flavour, share many characteristic features, some of which will be explained below.

Women and girls are often referred to using the neuter pronoun , with the pronunciation being something like : (″it told me so&#x27;, instead of ″she told me so&#x27;; vs. High German: ). This stems from the word (girl) being neuter ( is correct when referring to words like but would not be used by itself in reference to a woman).

The subjunctive in Rhine Franconian is normally composed with the words (High German = &quot;would do&quot;) or (&quot;would go&quot;) as auxiliary verbs: (&quot;I would say that...&quot;) instead of the High German .

Declension is rather different:
*The genitive case does not exist at all and is entirely replaced by constructs with the dative case.
*In most instances, words are not altered when in the dative case. Exceptions are mostly pronouns.
*The same holds for the accusative case. It is accepted practice to use the nominative case instead of the accusative.

Diphthongs are less common than in Standard German. This is because the Standard German diphthongs &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;au&quot; are each the result of a merger of two Middle High German vowels – however, these mergers did not take place in the Saarland, and only one of the two merged vowels is pronounced as a diphthong. The front rounded vowels &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot;, and &quot;eu&quot; are replaced by &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;ei&quot; respectively.

Both the Rhine Franconian and Moselle Franconian dialects (and Luxembourgish) have merged the palatal fricative sound as in with the post-alveolar fricative as in &#x27;fresh&#x27;, causing High German minimal pairs such as &#x27;church&#x27; and &#x27;cherry&#x27; to be pronounced in the same way.

French has had a considerable influence on the vocabulary, although the pronunciation of imported French words is usually quite different from their originals. Popular examples include (from ), (from ), and the imperative or greeting (from ).

The English sentence &quot;My house is green&quot; is pronounced almost the same in the Rhine Franconian variant: . The main difference lies in the pronunciation of the sound.

Regional beer brewer Karlsberg has taken advantage of the Saarlandish dialect to create clever advertising for its staple product, UrPils. Examples include a trio of men enjoying a beer, flanked by baby carriages, the slogan reading (meaning &quot;Mum&#x27;s at work&quot; in Saarlandish, but plays on the High German word &#x27;motherhood&#x27;); another depicts a trio of men at a bar, with one realizing his beer has been drunk by one of the others, the slogan reading (meaning &quot;It was no one&quot; [] in Saarlandish, but playing on the High German word &#x27;connoisseur&#x27;, translating to &quot;It was a connoisseur&quot;); a third shows an empty beer crate in outer space, the text reading (meaning &quot;empty&quot; in Saarlandish, but playing on the same High German word meaning &quot;outer space&quot;).

===French===
The French language has a special standing in Saarland due to its geographical proximity to France. Today, a part of the population is able to speak French, and it is compulsory at many schools. Saarbrücken is also home to a bilingual (German-French high school). In January 2014 the Saarland state government announced its aim of making the region fully bilingual in German and French by 2043.

==Sports==
The Saar competed in the qualifying section of the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but failed after coming second to West Germany but ahead of Norway. It also competed as Saar in the 1952 Summer Olympics and the field handball world championships in the beginning of the 1950s.

<text>Schleswig-Holstein (; ; ; ; ; occasionally in English &quot;Sleswick-Holsatia&quot;) is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical Duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. It covers an area of , making it the 5th smallest German federal state by area (including the city-states). Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig; now part of the Region of Southern Denmark) in Denmark. 

Schleswig was under Danish control during the Viking Age, but in the 12th century it became a duchy within Denmark. It bordered Holstein, which was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Beginning in 1460, the King of Denmark ruled both Schleswig and Holstein as their duke. Schleswig was still part of Denmark, while Holstein remained part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 19th century, Danes and Germans each believed they had a claim to Schleswig-Holstein, the population of which was majority ethnic German. The resulting long-term political and territorial dispute was known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. In 1848, Denmark tried to formally annex the area. Prussia responded by invading, thus beginning the First Schleswig War, which ended in a victory for Denmark. But in the Second Schleswig War (1864), Prussia and Austria won and the territory was absorbed into Prussia in 1867. After the German defeat in World War I, the Allies required that the question of sovereignty over the territory be submitted to plebiscites (the 1920 Schleswig plebiscites), which resulted in the return of some of the territory to Denmark. After World War II, Schleswig-Holstein took in over a million refugees.

Today, Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s economy is known for its agriculture, such as its Holstein cows. Its position on the Atlantic Ocean makes it a major trade point and shipbuilding site; it is also the location of the Kiel Canal. Its offshore oil wells and wind farms produce significant amounts of energy. Fishing is a major industry and the basis of its distinctive unique local cuisine. It is a popular tourist destination for Germans and visitors from across the globe.

==History==

The term &quot;Holstein&quot; derives from Old Saxon &quot;Holseta Land,&quot; (&quot;Holz&quot; means wood in modern Standardized German; &quot;holt&quot; is a now-archaic English word for woods.) Originally, the term referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: &quot;Tedmarsgoi&quot; (Dithmarschen), Holstein and &quot;Sturmarii&quot; (Stormarn). The area inhabited by the tribe of the Holsts lay between the Stör River and Hamburg; after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne&#x27;s Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Beginning in 811, the northern border of Holstein (and thus of the Empire) was the River Eider.

The term &quot;Schleswig&quot; originally referred to the city of Schleswig. The word Schleswig is a German transliteration of the Danish word Slesvig, which consists of two words: Schlei and vig. The Schlei refers to the river at which the city lies, and vig means &quot;inlet&quot; or bay. Schleswig therefore means (in Danish): &quot;The bay at the river Schlei&quot;.
The Schlei is known as Slien in Danish and is believed to have been used only for the inner Slien (the Great and Little Bay near the city of Schleswig). The word is thought to be related to Slæ, which means reeds and aquatic plants found in this area.

The Duchy of Schleswig, or Southern Jutland, was originally an integral part of Denmark, but in medieval times was established as a fief under the control of the Kingdom of Denmark, having the same relationship with the Danish Crown as, for example, Brandenburg or Bavaria had with the Holy Roman Emperor. Around 1100, the Duchy of Saxony gave Holstein to Count Adolf I of Schauenburg.

===The Migration Period===
During the Migration Period, the Jutland peninsula was home to several tribes. The Jutes inhabitted the most northern part of the peninsula from Grenen to . This dyke, dating back to around the first century, served as the boundary between the Jutes in the north and the Angles in the south. This dyke lost its relevance in the 200s when the Angles expanded northward, leading to the establishment of a new dyke called the . The southern border of the Angles was marked by the marshes surrounding the Eider, that combined with the dense old-growth forrest to the south of the river, formed a natural barrier. South of the forest lay the region now known as Holstein, which was divided between the Germanic Saxons, who inhabited the western part, and the Slavic Wagri, who lived in the eastern part. In the 8th century, the Wagri would become part of the Slavic tribal confederation known as the Obotrites. (Also known as the Wends by the Danes and Saxons).

During the 4th and early 5th centuries, a significant migration saw the Jutes, Angles, and Saxons depart from their homelands to settle in the British Isles. This mass exodus left much of the Jutland Peninsula sparsely populated, allowing the Danes from southern Scandinavia and the islands of Zealand, Funen, and other smaller Danish isles to migrate into the peninsula. They gradually settled the region, integrating the remaining Jutes and Angles who had not left for Britain. By the mid 5th century, the Danes had established settlements from Grenen in the north to just north of the Eider River and its marshes. Their southernmost settlements being around Schwansen, Hedeby and Husum, mirroring the same southern border as their Angle predecessors. As raiding was a frequent practice among the Danes, Saxons, and Wagrians, the borderlands was a hostile and unsafe area to inhabit. In response to these threats, the Danes began constructing the Danevirke. Originally built as a dyke, it was gradually expanded into a 30-kilometer earthwork with a palisade fortification, forming a barrier between the Danes and their southern neighbors. The Danevirke was strategically positioned at the most narrow point of the peninsula, with its eastern end beginning at the Treene River and extending to the Schlei Bay. This fortification served to deter Saxon and Wagrian raids while enabling the Danes to launch their own raids into southern territories. It would remain in use until 1864, being expanded and adapted to the changing military needs of the Danes multiple times.

The establishment of the Danevirke not only helped to prevent Saxon and Wagrian raids into Danish territory but also served as a toll station. Danish chieftains would collect fees from traders, merchants, and peasants traveling along the Hærvejen (Heerweg/Armyway), the main trade route running through the peninsula. Saxons, Wagrians, and Danes alike used the Hærvejen to trade goods such as honey, furs, amber, glass, metalwork, and other commodities, such as livestock, with cattle and oxen being particularly important. Especially the Danes developed a thriving livestock breeding industry, driving large herds along the Hærvejen to sell on the continent. This trade gave the route its alternative names, such as &quot;Studevejen&quot; (Cattle Way) in Danish and &quot;Ochsenweg&quot; (Oxen Way) in German. Therefore control of the Danevirke, through which the Hærvejen ran, was of immense financial significance. Whoever controlled the gates of Danevirke also controlled the trade along the Hærvejen, giving them access to substantial wealth.

===The Early Middle Ages===
After approximately 350 to 400 years of Danes being the sole inhabitants north of the Eider, the Frisians arrived in two waves, the first of which occurred in the 800s. They came from Frisia and initially settled on the islands of Heligoland, Sylt, Föhr and Amrum in the southwestern part of Jutland. Later, they expanded to Eiderstedt and the Jutish coastline. These areas eventually became known as North Frisia, though historically, the region was referred to as Uthlande (Outland). In these settlements, the Frisians established fishing and trading stations. The local Danes soon became a minority and, over time, assimilated into the Frisian population. The Frisians contributed to the broader Hærvejen trade network, with sea routes extending along the Frisian and Dutch coasts, supplying high-quality salt, fish, and other maritime goods. Moreover, they were particularly active in trade with East Anglia in England, where pottery was exchanged in large quantities. 
====Saxon Wars====
Normalcy in the area vanished with the expansion of the Frankish Empire into Saxony from 772 to 804, triggering a generational war on an unprecedented scale for the region. Prior to this, the Franks had spent nearly 20 years, from the late 600s to the early 700s, subjugating and converting the Frisian Kingdom. Their primary opponent was the formidable Frisian king Redbad, who fiercely resisted the Franks until his death. Now, the Frisians&#x27; neighbors, the Saxons, faced Frankish expansion. The &quot;casus belli&quot; was a Saxon raid on the church in Deventer in January of 772. This conflict, fueled by Charlemagne&#x27;s desire to conquer the Saxons and convert them from their belief in the Germanic pantheon to Christianity, used the Deventer raid as a pretext to wage a war that would ultimately reshape the political and cultural landscape of what would later become Holstein forever. Over the course of 18 campaigns, carried out in three phases over 32 years, Charlemagne aimed to subdue the Saxons and forcibly convert them to Christianity, in what became known as the Saxon Wars. In retaliation for the raid on the church in Deventer, Charlemagne ordered his troops to destroy the holy pillar Irminsul, near Paderborn in either 772 or 773—a notorious act that sent shockwaves throughout the Germanic pagan world. It has been postulated that Irminsul symbolised Yggdrasil Ash - the world tree. Charlemagne then destroyed all Saxon settlements up to the Wesser river. After defeating the Saxons and securing hostages, he turned his attention to northern Italy. 

For centuries, the Danes and Saxons had regarded each other as kindred peoples, sharing the same belief in the Germanic pantheon and frequently intermarrying, especially among the elite. Thus, the defeated Saxon warleader Widukind sought refuge with his father-in-law, Danish king Sigfred. The &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; mention that Widukind received substantial aid from Sigfred, though the exact nature of this aid is not explicitly stated. However, the chronicles do note that Sigfred and Charlemagne brokered a peace agreement some years later, indicating that Sigfred, upon hearing Widukind&#x27;s plea, may have mustered his army and joined the war on the side of the Saxons. In response to the Danes&#x27; involvement in the war, Charlemagne seems to have recruited the Obotrites by promising them the Saxon portion of Holstein. This alliance with Charlemagne shifted the balance of power in the region. In 782, after another defeat of the Saxons, Charlemagne ordered the mass execution of 4,500 Saxons, an atrocity that became known as the Massacre of Verden. Following this brutal act, Charlemagne was nicknamed the &quot;Butcher of Saxons&quot; or &quot;Saxonslaughterer.&quot;

In 796, despite Saxony being fully under Frankish rule, the Saxons rose up once more, supported by the Danes. The rebellion was triggered by forced conscription of Saxons for the Frankish wars against the Avars. Moreover, Charlemagne, in alliance with the Obotrites, planned to subjugate the Danes, now led by King Gudfred Sigfredson. However, Gudfred struck first. He expanded the Danevirke, assembled a fleet, mustered an army, and launched attacks on the Obotrites and later Frankish Frisia. But he was slain, either by one of his huscarls or possibly his own illegitimate son, on the Frisian campaign. The new Danish king, Hemming, Gudfred&#x27;s nephew, initiated peace talks, which resulted in the Treaty of Heiligen in 810. The treaty established the Danish border at the Eider River. Charlemagne retained Saxony, including Holstein, and established the Limes Saxoniae as a border with the Obotrites. This agreement established firm boundaries between the Franks, Obotrites, and Danes, securing peace in the region.
===Duchies in the Danish realm===
Between 500 and 1200, Schleswig was an integral part of Denmark, but during the 12th century, Duke Abel of Schlewig came into conflict with his brother King Eric IV. Abel managed to gain autonomy from his brother, making Schleswig an autonomous duchy. Later, Abel had Eric assassinated and seized the throne. Despite this, Schleswig remained an autonomous duchy within the Kingdom, setting the stage for future conflicts.
Beginning in 1460, both the Duchy of Schleswig and Duchy of Holstein, were ruled together by the Danish king, who acted as the duke of both regions. Holstein being a duchy within the Holy Roman Empire created a situation where the Danish king was sovereign of Denmark but also a duke within the Holy Roman Empire. Both were ruled for several centuries by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united into a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig: consequently, Schleswig would always follow the order of succession that applied in the Kingdom of Denmark. 

Following the Protestant Reformation, German was established as the language of commerce, administration, education, and clergy in Schleswig despite the population being ethnically Danish. This was because Schleswig were managed by the German Chancellery, in Kiel, which was later renamed the Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery in 1806. Therefore, Danes were sent to Kiel for their education instead of Copenhagen, where they received their education in German rather than their native Danish. As a result, Danish students, future administrators, clergy, and educators were taught in German and continued to use the language throughout their professional lives.

In 1814, mandatory schooling was instituted, and was taught in German. This created generations of Danish children who learned German from an early age. Their schooling was conducted in German, they heard sermons in German, and when they grew up, their interactions with the administration and business were conducted in German. Additionally, if Danes didn&#x27;t learn German, they couldn&#x27;t communicate with the administration, which often cared little if the citizens were able to understand them. Therefore, if the Danes weren&#x27;t able to speak German, they were effectively frozen out of any official matters. As a result, a language shift slowly began forming in South Schleswig and gradually spread north, which alarmed Copenhagen. The Danish authorities started taking countermeasures to halt the language shift by banning German in all official matters in Schleswig, which only served to create tensions between Danes and Germans. This language strife significantly contributed to shaping the inhabitants&#x27; national sentiments during a time of national unrest in Europe. It is also during this period that we see surname changes, such as from Jørgensen to Jürgensen or Nielsen to Nilsen, in South Schleswig.
By the time of the First Schleswig War, one-third of Schleswig and half of South Schleswig spoke German as their first language. By the time of the Second Schleswig War in 1864, half of Schleswig and the vast majority of South Schleswig spoke German as their first language.

===Schleswig-Holstein Question===

In the 19th century, fueled by nationalism both Danes and Germans claimed Schleswig-Holstein. The Germans wanted both Schleswig and Holstein to separate from Denmark and join the German Confederation, invoking the Treaty of Ribe stating that the two duchies should stay &quot;Forever Undivided&quot;. The Danes on the other hand, furthered the Eider Policy (:da:Ejderpolitikken), stating that the natural Danish border was the Eider (river) as first recognised in the Treaty of Heiligen. Therefore, the Danes sought to reintegrate Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark, reversing the separation created by King Abel, while also granting Holstein independence to join the German Confederation as a sovereign entity. The resulting long-term political and territorial dispute was known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Holstein was entirely German-speaking, while Schleswig was predominantly Danish-speaking until the late 1700 and early 1800s. During this period, a linguistic shift began in southern Schleswig, transitioning from Danish to German. This meant that Schleswig was linguistically divided with a Danish-speaking north and a German-speaking south.

In 1848, King Frederick VII of Denmark declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal of the Danish national movement was to ensure that this constitution would give rights to all Danes, i.e. not only to those in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded protection for the Danish language in Schleswig (the dominant language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the 19th century). A liberal constitution for Holstein was not seriously considered in Copenhagen, since it was well known that the political élite of Holstein were more conservative than Copenhagen&#x27;s. Representatives of German-minded Schleswig-Holsteiners demanded that Schleswig and Holstein be unified and allowed its own constitution and that Schleswig join Holstein as a member of the German Confederation. These demands were rejected by the Danish government in 1848, and the Germans of Holstein and Southern Schleswig rebelled. 
====First Schleswig War====
This began the First Schleswig War (1848–51). Against unbelievable odds, Denmark emerged victorious, managing to politically outmaneuver the German alliance by garnering support from the British Empire, the Russian Empire and the Second French Empire while defeating the Germans at the Battles of Bov, the Dybbøl, the Fredericia and Isted. However, under pressure from the Great Powers, led by Tsar Alexander III, who had forced Prussia and Austria out of Denmark, the Danes were not permitted to reintegrate Schleswig into Denmark. Alexander thereby sought to preserve the existing European order,in accordance with the principles established by the Concert of Europe. This led to the signing of the 1852 London Protocol, which failed to provide a solution to the issue and merely upheld the status quo. 
====Second Schleswig War====
In 1863, conflict broke out again when Frederick VII died without legitimate issue. According to the order of succession of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg, who became Christian IX. The transmission of the duchy of Holstein to the head of the (German-oriented) branch of the Danish royal family, the House of Augustenborg, was more controversial. The separation of the two duchies was challenged by the Augustenborg heir, who claimed, as in 1848, to be rightful heir of both Schleswig and Holstein. A common constitution for Denmark and Schleswig was promulgated in November 1863, which was a breach of the 1852 London Protocol. This left Denmark politically isolated and led to the Second Schleswig War, with Prussia and Austria invading once again. This was the Second War of Schleswig. Denmark achieved some initial victories at the Battles of Mysunde, and Sankelmark, but these successes were short-lived. The Austrians defeated the Danes at the Königshügel and Vejle. However, it was the Prussians who decided the war by decisively winning the pivotal Battles of Dybbøl and Als. 

British attempts to mediate in the London Conference of 1864 failed. With the peace Treaty of Vienna (1864), Denmark was forced to cede Schleswig to Prussia and Holstein to Austria. The two victors divided the duchies despite their &quot;casus belli&quot; being the defence of the German-speaking Schleswig-Holsteiners&#x27; wish to remain unified. But the division did not last long, since Prussia annexed Holstein in 1867, after its victory in the Austro-Prussian War.

===Province of Prussia===

Contrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, section five of the Peace of Prague stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a referendum on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the German Empire, authorities attempted a Germanisation policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important Imperial German Navy locations. The northernmost part and west coast of the province saw a wave of emigration to America, while some Danes of North Schleswig emigrated to Denmark.

===Plebiscite in 1920===
Following the defeat of Germany in World War I, the Allied powers arranged a plebiscite in northern and central Schleswig. The plebiscite was conducted under the auspices of an international commission which designated two voting zones to cover the northern and south-central parts of Schleswig. Steps were taken to also create a third zone covering a southern area, but zone III was cancelled again and never voted, as the Danish government asked the commission not to expand the plebiscite to this area.

In zone I covering Northern Schleswig (10 February 1920), 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In zone II covering central Schleswig (14 March 1920), the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark. Only minor areas on the island of Föhr showed a Danish majority, and the rest of the Danish vote was primarily in the town of Flensburg. On 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. The Danish/German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I that was never challenged by Adolf Hitler.

In 1937, the Nazis passed the so-called Greater Hamburg Act (&quot;Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz&quot;), where the nearby Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was expanded, to encompass towns that had formerly belonged to the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. To compensate Prussia for these losses (and partly because Hitler had a personal dislike for Lübeck), the 711-year-long independence of the Hansestadt Lübeck came to an end, and almost all its territory was incorporated into Schleswig-Holstein.

===State of Federal Germany===
After World War II, the Prussian province Schleswig-Holstein came under British occupation. On 23 August 1946, the military government abolished the province and reconstituted it as a separate &quot;Land&quot;.

On 9 September 1946, the British and Soviets offered Denmark South Schleswig, in the . In this note, they gave Denmark carte blanche on how to deal with the German-speaking South Schleswigers, whether to integrate them into the Danish state or to forcibly expel them from South Schleswig, as was being done to Germans in Eastern Europe. Denmark&#x27;s then Prime Minister, the Liberal Party&#x27;s Knud Kristensen, enthusiastically accepted the offer of South Schleswig reunification with Denmark. A survey showed that 75% of the Danish population supported the incorporation, 500,000 signatures had been collected in support of it and the Danish South Schleswig Association had sent the government a formal request for incorporation. However, the dominating Social Liberal Party feared that Denmark might again face destructive wars like the two Schleswig Wars once Germany recovered from World War II. Given that the Germans had conquered Denmark in six hours during the German invasion of Denmark, they believed Denmark would not stand a chance in such a scenario. Therefore, they pressured the Prime Minister to call for new elections, where the Liberal Party did not secure enough votes to form a government. The Social Democrats won the election with a minority government and could not gather a strong enough mandate for the incorporation of South Schleswig. This outcome created outrage within the Danish population and was considered a scandal. 

Due to the forced migrations of Germans between 1944 and 1950, Schleswig-Holstein took in almost a million refugees after the war, increasing its population by 33%. 

A pro-Danish political movement arose in Schleswig, with transfer of the area to Denmark as an ultimate goal. This was supported neither by the British occupation administration nor the Danish government. In 1955, the German and Danish governments issued the Bonn-Copenhagen Declarations confirming the rights of the ethnic minorities on both sides of the border. Conditions between the nationalities have since been stable and generally respectful.

==Geography==

Schleswig-Holstein lies on the base of Jutland Peninsula between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Strictly speaking, &quot;Schleswig&quot; refers to the German Southern Schleswig ( or &quot;Landesteil Schleswig&quot;, ), whereas Northern Schleswig is in Denmark (South Jutland County, Region of Southern Denmark). The state of Schleswig-Holstein further consists of Holstein, as well as Lauenburg and the formerly independent city of Lübeck.

Schleswig-Holstein borders Denmark (Southern Denmark) to the north, the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, and the German states of Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the south.

In the western part of the state, the lowlands have virtually no hills. The North Frisian Islands, as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s North Sea coast, form the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park (&quot;Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer&quot;) which is the largest national park in Central Europe.

The Baltic Sea coast in the east of Schleswig-Holstein is marked by bays, fjords, and cliff lines. Rolling hills (the highest elevation is the Bungsberg at ) and many lakes are found, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the Holstein Switzerland and the former Duchy of Lauenburg (&quot;Herzogtum Lauenburg&quot;). The longest river besides the Elbe is the Eider.

Schleswig-Holstein has the lowest quota of forest covered area, it is only 11.0% (national average 32.0%), which is even lower than in the city-states of Hamburg and Bremen.

The German Islands of Sylt, Föhr, Pellworm, Amrum, Heligoland and Fehmarn are part of Schleswig-Holstein, with the latter being the largest and the only Island of Schleswig-Holstein located on the east coast. Heligoland is Germany&#x27;s only high-sea island.

==Culture==

Schleswig-Holstein combines Danish, Frisian and German aspects of culture. The castles and manors in the countryside are the best example for this tradition; some dishes like Rødgrød (, literal English &quot;red grits&quot; or &quot;red groats&quot;) are also shared, as well as surnames such as Hansen.

The most important festivals are the Kiel Week, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, an annual classic music festival all over the state, and the Lübeck Nordic Film Days, an annual film festival for movies from Scandinavian countries, held in Lübeck. The Kiel Week is an annual event, except for 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID19-Pandemic. It took place again in June 2022.

The annual Wacken Open Air festival is considered to be the largest heavy metal rock festival in the world.

===Symbols===
The coat of arms shows the symbols of the two duchies united in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e., the two lions for Schleswig and the leaf of nettle for Holstein. Supposedly, Otto von Bismarck decreed that the two lions were to face the nettle because of the discomfort to their bottoms which would have resulted if the lions faced away from it.

Government agencies of Schleswig-Holsteins are using a logo showing a stylized version of the Schleswig Lions and the Holstein nettle combined with the abbreviation of Schleswig-Holstein &quot;SH&quot;. Written either below or to the right of the lion and the nettle is &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; below which either the Name of the agency using the logo is shown or the motto &quot;Der echte Norden&quot; (Germany&#x27;s true North).

The motto of Schleswig-Holstein is &quot;Up ewich ungedeelt&quot; (Middle Low German: &quot;Forever undivided&quot;, modern High German: &quot;Auf ewig ungeteilt&quot;). It goes back to the Treaty of Ribe (Danish: Ribe Håndfæstning German: Handfeste von Ripen) in 1460. Ripen (Ribe) is a historical small town in Northern Schleswig, nowadays Denmark.

The anthem from 1844 is called &quot;Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t falter, my fatherland&quot;), but it is usually referred to with its first line &quot;Schleswig-Holstein meerumschlungen&quot; (i.e., &quot;Schleswig-Holstein embraced by the seas&quot;) or &quot;Schleswig-Holstein-Lied&quot; (Schleswig-Holstein song).

The old city of Lübeck is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Food and drink===

Distinctive point of the cuisine is combination of sweetness with a taste contrast like sour or salty. These combinations are also described as &quot;broken sweetness&quot; is especially present in dishes which are sweet-sour.

Typical dishes are:

* Birnen, Bohnen und Speck consist of pears, beans, savory, parsley, bacon and potatoes
* Holsteiner Sauerfleisch is sour aspic
* Holsteiner Katenschinken is ham with traditional cold-smoking method
* Different using of Nordseekrabben in soup, porrenpann, with toast or scrambled eggs
* Famous is smoked Kieler Sprotten
* Other fish also is popular: Flatfish or Herring
* Grünkohl. In the Schleswig-Holstein there is a real cult around this vegetable. In the autumn and winter months groups of friends or colleagues go on a cabbage ride and choose their cabbage king, often combined with the typical regional sports of Boßeln and Klootschießen. The most popular dish is Grünkohl with Mettenden, but also possible other combination like Grünkohl with Kassler and &#x27;Schweinebacke&#x27;. The Dithmarsch marshland is particularly suitable for growing cabbage. The soils are fertile, so that a good yield can still be achieved even in bad years. Due to the constant sea wind, there are far fewer pests in the area
* Lübecker Marzipan is a sweet made from ground almonds, sugar and added flavorings
* Lakritz confection flavored with extract of the roots of the liquorice plant (sweet, salt, salmiak and choco)
* Lübecker Rotspon, Bordeaux wine, which is delivered in oak barrels to Lübeck to be aged
* Flensburger Rum-Verschnitt, brown mix of imported rum, water and neutral alcohol (typically 40–42%)

===Languages===
The official language of Schleswig-Holstein is German. In addition, Low German, Danish and North Frisian are recognized minority languages.

Historically, Low German (in Holstein and Southern Schleswig), Danish (in Schleswig), and North Frisian (in Western Schleswig) were widely spoken in Schleswig-Holstein. During the language change in the 19th century some Danish and North Frisian dialects in Southern Schleswig were replaced by Standard German.

Low German is still used in many parts of the state. Missingsch, a Low German dialect with heavy High German (Standard German) influence, is commonly spoken informally throughout the state, while a mixed language Petuh (mixture of High German and Danish) is used in and around Flensburg. Danish is used by the Danish minority in Southern Schleswig, and North Frisian is spoken by the North Frisians of the North Sea Coast and the Northern Frisian Islands in Southern Schleswig. The North Frisian dialect called Heligolandic (&quot;Halunder&quot;) is spoken on the island of Heligoland.

As is the case throughout Germany, High German, introduced in the 16th century, has come to steadily replace local dialects for official purposes, and is today the predominant language of media, law and legislature. It is spoken by virtually all inhabitants in formal situations. Since the end of World War II and widespread adoption of TV, radio and other mass media, it has gradually come to supplant local dialects in urban areas as well.

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,400 euros or 101% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the lowest of all states in West Germany. In 2017, Schleswig-Holstein had an export surplus for the first time since 1989: export 22.6 billion euros/ import 20.8 billion euros.

===Energy===
Schleswig-Holstein is a leader in the country&#x27;s growing renewable energy industry. In 2014, Schleswig-Holstein became the first German state to cover 100% of its electric power demand with renewable energy sources (chiefly wind 70%, solar 3.8%, and biomass 8.3%). By 2023, according to Schleswig-Holstein Netz, renewable energy sources were providing 204% of Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s electricity demand (the 104% surplus are exports).

The largest German oil field Mittelplate is located in the North Sea off the Dithmarsch coast and connected with refinery in Hemmingstedt and chemical plants in Brunsbüttel via pipeline. It produce ca. 1.4 million tonnes of oil annually.

==== Nuclear power ====
There were three nuclear power plants in Schleswig-Holstein: Krümmel, Brunsbüttel, and Brokdorf. The last operating plant in Schleswig-Holstein, the Brokdorf-plant was shut down on new-years eve 2021.

There is also a nuclear research center known &quot;Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht&quot; (rebranded as Hereon) with 2 research reactors, located right next to the Krümmel plant.

During the 1990s, ten more cases of leukemia among children than was expected were identified in Elbmarsch, near the Krümmel plant. Anti-nuclear activists believed it was due to the nuclear plant, which led to several investigations. The reported discovery of small spherical beads of nuclear material in the area led to further concern, as well as the presence of minute amounts of plutonium in the Elbe. The origins of the nuclear material were disputed, with one report determining them to not be that of the Krümmel plant. Another report claimed that they may have come from an undisclosed fire in 1986, however this theory has been questioned as it would have required a substantial government coverup. The Chernobyl disaster has also been suggested as a source, though is considered unlikely. The probable source of the material, especially in the Elbe, is nuclear reprocessing plants in France. A 2010 report exonerated the nuclear power plants on the Elbe as the cause of contamination. Further doubt was cast on the nature of the supposed beads of nuclear material, with a Federal commission chastising the original commission that claimed to have discovered the beads. The exact cause of the increased leukemia cases remains unknown, and could be due to other environmental factors, or even by chance.

The nuclear plants have further been questioned as a source of the cases due to comparison to the Savannah River Site in the United States. Despite release of radiation at the Savannah River Site, there is no increase in cases of leukemia around it. Alternative hypotheses for the cause of the cases have included electromagnetic fields, parental radiation exposure prior to conception, other carcinogens, and benzene exposure; however, none have been supported by the existing evidence. Intriguingly, a larger case-control study in Lower Saxony found a correlation between the &quot;untrained immune system&quot; (as judged as contact with other children, vaccinations, etc.) and leukemia risk, suggested that an immature immune system that has not been challenged is at greater risk for developing malignancy, possibly secondary to an undetermined environment factor.

===Tourism===
Located between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, Schleswig-Holstein is also a popular tourist destination in Germany. Its islands, beaches and cities attract millions of tourists every year. It has the second highest tourism intensity per local among the German states, after Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, but in absolute value it is rank 6th and only 1/3 of top destination Bavaria. According to a ruling by the Federal Administrative Court, everyone has the right to free access to the beach. Nevertheless, most of the seaside resorts kept cashing in (2-€3 /day/person).

===Agriculture===

63% of land in Schleswig-Holstein (990 403 ha) is used for agriculture (national average 47%).

Cultivated crops:

* Wheat, 208 000 ha
* Maize for silage, 176 000 ha
* Winter rapeseed, 112 000 ha
* Sugar beet, 7 500 ha
* Potatoes, 5 500 ha

There are some special cultivation regions:
* Elbmarschen, west of Hamburg for fruits cultivation
* Ditmarschen for cabbage
* Between Mölln and Lübeck for asparagus
* Pinneberg for tree nurseries and flower garden (especially, roses of Rosen Tantau and W. Kordes&#x27; Söhne), 2 931 ha. These 2 companies have over 50% of the world cut roses market. There is a German Nurseries Museum (&quot;Deutsches Baumschulmuseum&quot;).

===Animal husbandry===

The dairy and cattle farming in connection with fodder cultivation is mainly concentrated on the marshland and the bordering Geest areas. In 2020, around 1 million cattle including 360,000 dairy cows were counted in Schleswig-Holstein, rank 4th of German states. Livestock is continuously declining.

Schleswig-Holstein is home of the most productive dairy cattle: Holsteins, which produce an average of per year of milk. It is now the main dairy cow around the world.

Pig breeding is mainly found in the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands. In principle, Schleswig-Holstein is one of the regions with relatively few pigs (a total of around 1.6 million; in comparison Lower Saxony: over 8 million). Poultry and sheep are also of little importance in animal husbandry.

Schleswig-Holstein had Europe&#x27;s largest snake farm in Uetersen with over 600 venomous reptiles, but it closed in 2019.

===Fishing and Aquaculture===

Total production from fishing in North and Baltic Seas was 40 780 tonnes in 2019, ca. 1/3 German production.

In the Baltic Sea total production amounted to 10377 tonnes (2019), of which 5432 tonnes of sprat, 2568 tonnes of flatfish and 1190 tonnes of cod.

In the North Sea the numbers were 19,487 tonnes of mussels, 3560 tonnes of North Sea shrimp, 1166 tonnes of herring and 7062 other fishes.

The one important aquaculture product is mussels, 16864 tonnes.

Inland fishing and aquaculture is not significant with 221 and 250 tonnes in 2019 respectively.

* Shipbuilding. Ca. 20% of German shipbuilding. The biggest ship yard ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems situated in Kiel and build submarines of 212 and 214 types. In Flensburg FSG yard build ferries. Famous luxury megayachts are built by Lürssen-Kröger Werft, Schacht-Audorf, and Nobiskrug, Rendsburg. Shipyards in Lübeck and Caterpillar-MaK marine engine plant were closed. Raytheon Anschütz deliveries navigation equipment, autopilots, and radars to shipyards.

* Locomotive. Vossloh Locomotives (owned by Chinese CRRC) manufactures three models of diesel-hydraulic (G6, G12, G18) and two models of diesel-electric (DE12, DE18) locomotives. Other manufacturer was Voith Turbo Lokomotivtechnik, but closed in 2014 year. Both firms are in Kiel.

* Industrial equipment. Fish and poultry processing machinery from Baader, Lübeck, bottle washers and pasteurizers from Krones, Flensburg, grinding machine tools from Peter Wolters, Rendsburg, machinery to manufacture human-made fibers, and non-woven textile from Oerlikon Neumag and Oerlikon Nonwoven, Neumünster.
* Medical and labor equipment. Drägerwerk, Lübeck manufacture breathing equipment, medical ventilators and monitors, anesthetic machines, neonatal incubators, gas detectors, drug testing equipment, diving equipment, rebreathers, and breathalyzer. The company delivery breathing devices for reanimation COVID-19 patients. Euroimmun, Lübeck, produces test systems with which antibodies can be determined in the serum of patients and thus autoimmune and infectious diseases (including COVID-19) as well as allergies.
* Chemical. Almost all chemical industry concentrate around Brunsbüttel. Covestro, with 650 employee, produced annually 400,000 tonnes methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, which using in synthesis of polyurethane. Yara (214 empl.) produce nitrogen fertilizers, but, with special process, instead of using natural gas, it use heavy oil, which allow also manufacture as byproduct vanadium oxide and sulphur. Heavy oil is source material to produce bitumen by Total Bitumen (130 empl.). Other plant is Sasol (520 empl.), which produce fatty and Guerbet alcohols, paraffin and high-purity aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide and triethylaluminium. Other important location of chemical industry is Neumünster with EMS-Griltech, which manufacture technical fibers from polyamides and polyesters, adhesives, and powder coatings.

==Transport==
===Kiel Canal===

The most important transport way in Schleswig-Holstein is Kiel Canal, which connect Brunsbüttel on North Sea with Kiel on Baltic Sea. Total cargo of ships reach peaks in 2007 and 2012, after that it continuous decline with 73.8 million tonnes in 2020.

===Ports===
The state has a total of 46 public ports and landing stages, four of which fulfill international transit functions: Kiel, Lübeck / Travemünde and Puttgarden on the Baltic Sea, Brunsbüttel on the North Sea. Kiel and Lübeck are also important for freight traffic to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Lübeck-Travemünde and Kiel are also important ferry and cruise ports. Puttgarden is the German port of the Vogelfluglinie to Denmark. Brunsbüttel is an important port for bulk goods and also serves as the basis for the offshore wind energy industry.

==Education==

=== General Education ===
In Schleswig-Holstein, the school education system begins with a four-year primary school, called &quot;Grundschule&quot;. Compulsory education applies to all children who turn six years old by June 30th of the current calendar year. In addition to the four-year primary school, the secondary level (grades 5 to 10), equivalent to middle school, consists of a two-tier school system comprising &quot;Gemeinschaftsschulen&quot; and &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. At all &quot;Gemeinschaftsschulen&quot;, Mittlere Reife can be obtained. Currently, 44 comprehensive schools also offer three additional years of highschool-education, where students can complete the Abitur (higher education entrance qualification) after a total of 13 school years.

Most &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Schleswig-Holstein offer a nine-year educational track, with only one &quot;Gymnasium&quot; leading to the Abitur in eight years. Three of the Gymnasien offer both three-year and two-year pathways for the Abitur.

The third option to obtain the Abitur is through the `&quot;Berufliches Gymnasium&quot;&#x27; (vocational gymnasium). At the 28 &quot;berufliches Gymnasium&quot; in Schleswig-Holstein, students – unlike in the profile upper stage of regular &quot;Gymnasium&quot; and &quot;Gemeinschaftsschulen&quot; – have the opportunity to choose a specific subject area. The offered disciplines include agricultural economics, nutrition, technology, economics, as well as health and social care. Admission requirements for the &quot;berufliches Gymnasium&quot; include above-average completion of the &quot;Mittlere Reife&quot;.Currently, around one fifth of the high school graduates in Schleswig-Holstein graduate from &quot;berufliches Gymnasium&quot;.

<doc id="27127" wikidata="Q682" url="?curid=27127" title="Sulfur">
<text>Sulfur (also spelled sulphur in British English) is a chemical element; it has symbol S and atomic number 16. It is abundant, multivalent and nonmetallic. Under normal conditions, sulfur atoms form cyclic octatomic molecules with the chemical formula S8. Elemental sulfur is a bright yellow, crystalline solid at room temperature.

Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element by mass in the universe and the fifth most common on Earth. Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient India, ancient Greece, China, and ancient Egypt. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called brimstone, which means &quot;burning stone&quot;. Almost all elemental sulfur is produced as a byproduct of removing sulfur-containing contaminants from natural gas and petroleum. The greatest commercial use of the element is the production of sulfuric acid for sulfate and phosphate fertilizers, and other chemical processes. Sulfur is used in matches, insecticides, and fungicides. Many sulfur compounds are odoriferous, and the smells of odorized natural gas, skunk scent, bad breath, grapefruit, and garlic are due to organosulfur compounds. Hydrogen sulfide gives the characteristic odor to rotting eggs and other biological processes.

Sulfur is an essential element for all life, almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides. Amino acids (two proteinogenic: cysteine and methionine, and many other non-coded: cystine, taurine, etc.) and two vitamins (biotin and thiamine) are organosulfur compounds crucial for life. Many cofactors also contain sulfur, including glutathione, and iron–sulfur proteins. Disulfides, S–S bonds, confer mechanical strength and insolubility of the (among others) protein keratin, found in outer skin, hair, and feathers. Sulfur is one of the core chemical elements needed for biochemical functioning and is an elemental macronutrient for all living organisms.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Sulfur forms several polyatomic molecules. The best-known allotrope is octasulfur, cyclo-S8. The point group of cyclo-S8 is D4d and its dipole moment is 0 D. Octasulfur is a soft, bright-yellow solid that is odorless. It melts at , and boils at . At , below its melting temperature, cyclo-octasulfur begins slowly changing from α-octasulfur to the β-polymorph. The structure of the S8 ring is virtually unchanged by this phase transition, which affects the intermolecular interactions. Cooling molten sulfur freezes at , as it predominantly consists of the β-S8 molecules. Between its melting and boiling temperatures, octasulfur changes its allotrope again, turning from β-octasulfur to γ-sulfur, again accompanied by a lower density but increased viscosity due to the formation of polymers. At higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases as depolymerization occurs. Molten sulfur assumes a dark red color above . The density of sulfur is about 2 g/cm3, depending on the allotrope; all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators.

Sulfur sublimes more or less between and .

Sulfur is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as benzene and toluene.

===Chemical properties===
Under normal conditions, sulfur hydrolyzes very slowly to mainly form hydrogen sulfide and sulfuric acid:

The reaction involves adsorption of protons onto clusters, followed by disproportionation into the reaction products.

The second, fourth and sixth ionization energies of sulfur are 2252 kJ/mol, 4556 kJ/mol and 8495.8 kJ/mol, respectively. The composition of reaction products of sulfur with oxidants (and its oxidation state) depends on whether releasing of reaction energy overcomes these thresholds. Applying catalysts and/or supply of external energy may vary sulfur&#x27;s oxidation state and the composition of reaction products. While reaction between sulfur and oxygen under normal conditions gives sulfur dioxide (oxidation state +4), formation of sulfur trioxide (oxidation state +6) requires a temperature of and presence of a catalyst.

In reactions with elements of lesser electronegativity, it reacts as an oxidant and forms sulfides, where it has oxidation state −2.

Sulfur reacts with nearly all other elements except noble gases, even with the notoriously unreactive metal iridium (yielding iridium disulfide). Some of those reactions require elevated temperatures.

===Allotropes===
Sulfur forms over 30 solid allotropes, more than any other element. Besides S8, several other rings are known. Removing one atom from the crown gives S7, which is of a deeper yellow than S8. HPLC analysis of &quot;elemental sulfur&quot; reveals an equilibrium mixture of mainly S8, but with S7 and small amounts of S6. Larger rings have been prepared, including S12 and S18.

Amorphous or &quot;plastic&quot; sulfur is produced by rapid cooling of molten sulfur—for example, by pouring it into cold water. X-ray crystallography studies show that the amorphous form may have a helical structure with eight atoms per turn. The long coiled polymeric molecules make the brownish substance elastic, and in bulk it has the feel of crude rubber. This form is metastable at room temperature and gradually reverts to the crystalline molecular allotrope, which is no longer elastic. This process happens over a matter of hours to days, but can be rapidly catalyzed.
===Isotopes===

Sulfur has 23 known isotopes, four of which are stable: 32S (), 33S (), 34S (), and 36S (). Other than 35S, with a half-life of 87 days, the radioactive isotopes of sulfur have half-lives less than 3 hours.

The preponderance of 32S is explained by its production in the so-called alpha-process (one of the main classes of nuclear fusion reactions) in exploding stars. Other stable sulfur isotopes are produced in the bypass processes related with 34Ar, and their composition depends on a type of a stellar explosion. For example, proportionally more 33S comes from novae than from supernovae.

On the planet Earth the sulfur isotopic composition was determined by the Sun. Though it was assumed that the distribution of different sulfur isotopes would be more or less equal, it has been found that proportions of the two most abundant sulfur isotopes 32S and 34S varies in different samples. Assaying of the isotope ratio (δ34S) in the samples suggests their chemical history, and with support of other methods, it allows to age-date the samples, estimate temperature of equilibrium between ore and water, determine pH and oxygen fugacity, identify the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the time of formation of the sample, or suggest the main sources of sulfur in ecosystems. However, there are ongoing discussions over the real reason for the δ34S shifts, biological activity or postdeposit alteration.

For example, when sulfide minerals are precipitated, isotopic equilibration among solids and liquid may cause small differences in the δ34S values of co-genetic minerals. The differences between minerals can be used to estimate the temperature of equilibration. The δ13C and δ34S of coexisting carbonate minerals and sulfides can be used to determine the pH and oxygen fugacity of the ore-bearing fluid during ore formation.

Scientists measure the sulfur isotopes of minerals in rocks and sediments to study the redox conditions in past oceans. Sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine sediment fractionate sulfur isotopes as they take in sulfate and produce sulfide. Prior to the 2010s, it was thought that sulfate reduction could fractionate sulfur isotopes up to 46 permil and fractionation larger than 46 permil recorded in sediments must be due to disproportionation of sulfur compounds in the sediment. This view has changed since the 2010s as experiments showed that sulfate-reducing bacteria can fractionate to 66 permil. As substrates for disproportionation are limited by the product of sulfate reduction, the isotopic effect of disproportionation should be less than 16 permil in most sedimentary settings.

In forest ecosystems, sulfate is derived mostly from the atmosphere; weathering of ore minerals and evaporites contribute some sulfur. Sulfur with a distinctive isotopic composition has been used to identify pollution sources, and enriched sulfur has been added as a tracer in hydrologic studies. Differences in the natural abundances can be used in systems where there is sufficient variation in the 34S of ecosystem components. Rocky Mountain lakes thought to be dominated by atmospheric sources of sulfate have been found to have measurably different 34S values than lakes believed to be dominated by watershed sources of sulfate.

The radioactive 35S is formed in cosmic ray spallation of the atmospheric 40Ar. This fact may be used to verify the presence of recent (up to 1 year) atmospheric sediments in various materials. This isotope may be obtained artificially by different ways. In practice, the reaction 35Cl + n → 35S + p is used by irradiating potassium chloride with neutrons. The isotope 35S is used in various sulfur-containing compounds as a radioactive tracer for many biological studies, for example, the Hershey-Chase experiment.

Because of the weak beta activity of 35S, its compounds are relatively safe as long as they are not ingested or absorbed by the body.

===Natural occurrence===


32S is created inside massive stars, at a depth where the temperature exceeds 2.5×109 K, by the fusion of one nucleus of silicon plus one nucleus of helium. As this nuclear reaction is part of the alpha process that produces elements in abundance, sulfur is the 10th most common element in the universe.

Sulfur, usually as sulfide, is present in many types of meteorites. Ordinary chondrites contain on average 2.1% sulfur, and carbonaceous chondrites may contain as much as 6.6%. It is normally present as troilite (FeS), but there are exceptions, with carbonaceous chondrites containing free sulfur, sulfates and other sulfur compounds. The distinctive colors of Jupiter&#x27;s volcanic moon Io are attributed to various forms of molten, solid, and gaseous sulfur. In July 2024, elemental sulfur was accidentally discovered to exist on Mars after the Curiosity rover drove over and crushed a rock, revealing sulfur crystals inside it.

Sulfur is the fifth most common element by mass in the Earth. Elemental sulfur can be found near hot springs and volcanic regions in many parts of the world, especially along the Pacific Ring of Fire; such volcanic deposits are mined in Indonesia, Chile, and Japan. These deposits are polycrystalline, with the largest documented single crystal measuring . Historically, Sicily was a major source of sulfur in the Industrial Revolution. Lakes of molten sulfur up to about in diameter have been found on the sea floor, associated with submarine volcanoes, at depths where the boiling point of water is higher than the melting point of sulfur.

Native sulfur is synthesized by anaerobic bacteria acting on sulfate minerals such as gypsum in salt domes. Significant deposits in salt domes occur along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and in evaporites in eastern Europe and western Asia. Native sulfur may be produced by geological processes alone. Fossil-based sulfur deposits from salt domes were once the basis for commercial production in the United States, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. Such sources have become of secondary commercial importance, and most are no longer worked but commercial production is still carried out in the Osiek mine in Poland.

Common naturally occurring sulfur compounds include the sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (iron sulfide), cinnabar (mercury sulfide), galena (lead sulfide), sphalerite (zinc sulfide), and stibnite (antimony sulfide); and the sulfate minerals, such as gypsum (calcium sulfate), alunite (potassium aluminium sulfate), and barite (barium sulfate). On Earth, just as upon Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io, elemental sulfur occurs naturally in volcanic emissions, including emissions from hydrothermal vents.

The main industrial source of sulfur has become petroleum and natural gas.

==Compounds==

Common oxidation states of sulfur range from −2 to +6. Sulfur forms stable compounds with all elements except the noble gases.

===Electron transfer reactions===
Sulfur polycations, , and are produced when sulfur is reacted with oxidizing agents in a strongly acidic solution. The colored solutions produced by dissolving sulfur in oleum were first reported as early as 1804 by C. F. Bucholz, but the cause of the color and the structure of the polycations involved was only determined in the late 1960s. is deep blue, is yellow and is red.

Reduction of sulfur gives various polysulfides with the formula , many of which have been obtained in crystalline form. Illustrative is the production of sodium tetrasulfide:

Some of these dianions dissociate to give radical anions, such as gives the blue color of the rock lapis lazuli.
This reaction highlights a distinctive property of sulfur: its ability to catenate (bind to itself by formation of chains). Protonation of these polysulfide anions produces the polysulfanes, H2S&quot;x&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; = 2, 3, and 4. Ultimately, reduction of sulfur produces sulfide salts:

The interconversion of these species is exploited in the sodium–sulfur battery.

===Hydrogenation===
Treatment of sulfur with hydrogen gives hydrogen sulfide. When dissolved in water, hydrogen sulfide is mildly acidic:

Hydrogen sulfide gas and the hydrosulfide anion are extremely toxic to mammals, due to their inhibition of the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and certain cytochromes in a manner analogous to cyanide and azide (see below, under &quot;precautions&quot;).

===Combustion===
The two principal sulfur oxides are obtained by burning sulfur:


Many other sulfur oxides are observed including the sulfur-rich oxides include sulfur monoxide, disulfur monoxide, disulfur dioxides, and higher oxides containing peroxo groups.

===Halogenation===
Sulfur reacts with fluorine to give the highly reactive sulfur tetrafluoride and the highly inert sulfur hexafluoride. Whereas fluorine gives S(IV) and S(VI) compounds, chlorine gives S(II) and S(I) derivatives. Thus, sulfur dichloride, disulfur dichloride, and higher chlorosulfanes arise from the chlorination of sulfur. Sulfuryl chloride and chlorosulfuric acid are derivatives of sulfuric acid; thionyl chloride (SOCl2) is a common reagent in organic synthesis. Bromine also oxidizes sulfur to form sulfur dibromide and disulfur dibromide.

===Pseudohalides===
Sulfur oxidizes cyanide and sulfite to give thiocyanate and thiosulfate, respectively.

===Metal sulfides===
Sulfur reacts with many metals. Electropositive metals give polysulfide salts. Copper, zinc, and silver are attacked by sulfur; see tarnishing. Although many metal sulfides are known, most are prepared by high temperature reactions of the elements. Geoscientists also study the isotopes of metal sulfides in rocks and sediment to study environmental conditions in the Earth&#x27;s past.

===Organic compounds===

Some of the main classes of sulfur-containing organic compounds include the following:
* Thiols or mercaptans (so called because they capture mercury as chelators) are the sulfur analogs of alcohols; treatment of thiols with base gives thiolate ions.
* Thioethers are the sulfur analogs of ethers.
* Sulfonium ions have three groups attached to a cationic sulfur center. Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is one such compound, important in the marine organic sulfur cycle.
* Sulfoxides and sulfones are thioethers with one and two oxygen atoms attached to the sulfur atom, respectively. The simplest sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfoxide, is a common solvent; a common sulfone is sulfolane.
* Sulfonic acids are used in many detergents.

Compounds with carbon–sulfur multiple bonds are uncommon, an exception being carbon disulfide, a volatile colorless liquid that is structurally similar to carbon dioxide. It is used as a reagent to make the polymer rayon and many organosulfur compounds. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulfide is stable only as an extremely dilute gas, found between solar systems.

Organosulfur compounds are responsible for some of the unpleasant odors of decaying organic matter. They are widely known as the odorant in domestic natural gas, garlic odor, and skunk spray, as well as a component of bad breath odor. Not all organic sulfur compounds smell unpleasant at all concentrations: the sulfur-containing monoterpenoid grapefruit mercaptan in small concentrations is the characteristic scent of grapefruit, but has a generic thiol odor at larger concentrations. Sulfur mustard, a potent vesicant, was used in World War I as a disabling agent.

Sulfur–sulfur bonds are a structural component used to stiffen rubber, similar to the disulfide bridges that rigidify proteins (see biological below). In the most common type of industrial &quot;curing&quot; or hardening and strengthening of natural rubber, elemental sulfur is heated with the rubber to the point that chemical reactions form disulfide bridges between isoprene units of the polymer. This process, patented in 1843, made rubber a major industrial product, especially in automobile tires. Because of the heat and sulfur, the process was named vulcanization, after the Roman god of the forge and volcanism.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the Torah (Genesis). English translations of the Christian Bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as &quot;brimstone&quot;, giving rise to the term &quot;fire-and-brimstone&quot; sermons, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. It is from this part of the Bible that Hell is implied to &quot;smell of sulfur&quot; (likely due to its association with volcanic activity). According to the Ebers Papyrus, a sulfur ointment was used in ancient Egypt to treat granular eyelids. Sulfur was used for fumigation in preclassical Greece; this is mentioned in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Pliny the Elder discusses sulfur in book 35 of his &quot;Natural History&quot;, saying that its best-known source is the island of Melos. He mentions its use for fumigation, medicine, and bleaching cloth.

A natural form of sulfur known as () was known in China since the 6th century BC and found in Hanzhong. By the 3rd century, the Chinese had discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite. Chinese Daoists were interested in sulfur&#x27;s flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional Chinese medicine. The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; of 1044 AD described various formulas for Chinese black powder, which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (), charcoal, and sulfur.
Indian alchemists, practitioners of the &quot;science of chemicals&quot; (), wrote extensively about the use of sulfur in alchemical operations with mercury, from the eighth century AD onwards. In the  tradition, sulfur is called &quot;the smelly&quot; (, ).

Early European alchemists gave sulfur a unique alchemical symbol, a triangle atop a cross (🜍). (This is sometimes confused with the astronomical crossed-spear symbol ⚴ for 2 Pallas.) The variation known as brimstone has a symbol combining a two-barred cross atop a lemniscate (🜏). In traditional skin treatment, elemental sulfur was used (mainly in creams) to alleviate such conditions as scabies, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema, and acne. The mechanism of action is unknown—though elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid, which is (through the action of sulfite) a mild reducing and antibacterial agent.

===Modern times===

Sulfur appears in a column of fixed (non-acidic) alkali in a chemical table of 1718. Antoine Lavoisier used sulfur in combustion experiments, writing of some of these in 1777.

Sulfur deposits in Sicily were the dominant source for more than a century. By the late 18th century, about 2,000 tonnes per year of sulfur were imported into Marseille, France, for the production of sulfuric acid for use in the Leblanc process. In industrializing Britain, with the repeal of tariffs on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily&#x27;s backward and impoverished economy, led to the Sulfur Crisis of 1840, when King Ferdinand II gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.

In 1867, elemental sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The highly successful Frasch process was developed to extract this resource.

In the late 18th century, furniture makers used molten sulfur to produce decorative inlays. Molten sulfur is sometimes still used for setting steel bolts into drilled concrete holes where high shock resistance is desired for floor-mounted equipment attachment points. Pure powdered sulfur was used as a medicinal tonic and laxative.

Since the advent of the contact process, the majority of sulfur is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.

In recent times, the main source of sulfur has become petroleum and natural gas. This is due to the requirement to remove sulfur from fuels in order to prevent acid rain, and has resulted in a surplus of sulfur.

===Spelling and etymology===
&quot;Sulfur&quot; is derived from the Latin word &#x27;, which was Hellenized to &#x27; in the erroneous belief that the Latin word came from Greek. This spelling was later reinterpreted as representing an /f/ sound and resulted in the spelling &quot;&quot;, which appears in Latin toward the end of the Classical period. The true Ancient Greek word for sulfur, , &quot;theîon&quot; (from earlier , &quot;théeion&quot;), is the source of the international chemical prefix &quot;thio-&quot;. The Modern Standard Greek word for sulfur is θείο, &quot;theío&quot;.

In 12th-century Anglo-French, it was &#x27;. In the 14th century, the erroneously Hellenized Latin &#x27; was restored in Middle English &quot;&quot;. By the 15th century, both full Latin spelling variants &quot;sulfur&quot; and &quot;sulphur&quot; became common in English. The parallel &quot;f~ph&quot; spellings continued in Britain until the 19th century, when the word was standardized as &quot;sulphur&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;sulfur&quot; was the form eventually chosen in the United States, though multiple place names (such as White Sulphur Springs) use &quot;-ph-&quot;. Canada uses both spellings.

IUPAC adopted the spelling &quot;sulfur&quot; in 1990 as did the Nomenclature Committee of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1992, restoring the spelling &quot;sulfur&quot; to Britain. Oxford Dictionaries note that &quot;in chemistry and other technical uses ... the &quot;-f-&quot; spelling is now the standard form for this and related words in British as well as US contexts, and is increasingly used in general contexts as well.&quot;

==Production==
Sulfur may be found by itself and historically was usually obtained in this form; pyrite has also been a source of sulfur. In volcanic regions in Sicily, in ancient times, it was found on the surface of the Earth, and the &quot;Sicilian process&quot; was used: sulfur deposits were piled and stacked in brick kilns built on sloping hillsides, with airspaces between them. Then, some sulfur was pulverized, spread over the stacked ore and ignited, causing the free sulfur to melt down the hills. Eventually the surface-borne deposits played out, and miners excavated veins that ultimately dotted the Sicilian landscape with labyrinthine mines. Mining was unmechanized and labor-intensive, with pickmen freeing the ore from the rock, and mine-boys or &quot;carusi&quot; carrying baskets of ore to the surface, often through a mile or more of tunnels. Once the ore was at the surface, it was reduced and extracted in smelting ovens. The conditions in Sicilian sulfur mines were horrific, prompting Booker T. Washington to write &quot;I am not prepared just now to say to what extent I believe in a physical hell in the next world, but a sulfur mine in Sicily is about the nearest thing to hell that I expect to see in this life.&quot; Sulfur is still mined from surface deposits in poorer nations with volcanoes, such as Indonesia, and problems with working conditions still exist.

Elemental sulfur was extracted from salt domes (where it sometimes occurs in nearly pure form) until the late 20th century, when it became a side product of other industrial processes such as in oil refining, in which sulfur is undesirable. As a mineral, native sulfur under salt domes is thought to be a fossil mineral resource, produced by the action of anaerobic bacteria on sulfate deposits. It was removed from such salt-dome mines mainly by the Frasch process. In this method, superheated water was pumped into a native sulfur deposit to melt the sulfur, and then compressed air returned the 99.5% pure melted product to the surface. Throughout the 20th century this procedure produced elemental sulfur that required no further purification. Due to a limited number of such sulfur deposits and the high cost of working them, this process for mining sulfur has not had significant use anywhere in the world since 2002.
Since then, sulfur has typically been produced from petroleum, natural gas, and related fossil resources, from which it is obtained mainly as hydrogen sulfide. Organosulfur compounds, undesirable impurities in petroleum, may be upgraded by subjecting them to hydrodesulfurization, which cleaves the C–S bonds:

The resulting hydrogen sulfide from this process, and also as it occurs in natural gas, is converted into elemental sulfur by the Claus process, which entails oxidation of some hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide and then the comproportionation of the two:

Due to the high sulfur content of the Athabasca Oil Sands, stockpiles of elemental sulfur from this process exist throughout Alberta, Canada. Another way of storing sulfur is as a binder for concrete, the resulting product having some desirable properties (see sulfur concrete).

The world production of sulfur in 2011 amounted to 69 million tonnes (Mt), with more than 15 countries contributing more than 1 Mt each. Countries producing more than 5 Mt are China (9.6), the United States (8.8), Canada (7.1) and Russia (7.1). Production has been slowly increasing from 1900 to 2010; the price was unstable in the 1980s and around 2010.

==Applications==

===Sulfuric acid===
Elemental sulfur is used mainly as a precursor to other chemicals. Approximately 85% (1989) is converted to sulfuric acid (H2SO4):


In 2010, the United States produced more sulfuric acid than any other inorganic industrial chemical. The principal use for the acid is the extraction of phosphate ores for the production of fertilizer manufacturing. Other applications of sulfuric acid include oil refining, wastewater processing, and mineral extraction.

===Other important sulfur chemistry===
Sulfur reacts directly with methane to give carbon disulfide, which is used to manufacture cellophane and rayon. One of the uses of elemental sulfur is in vulcanization of rubber, where polysulfide chains crosslink organic polymers. Large quantities of sulfites are used to bleach paper and to preserve dried fruit. Many surfactants and detergents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate) are sulfate derivatives. Calcium sulfate, gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) is mined on the scale of 100 million tonnes each year for use in Portland cement and fertilizers.

When silver-based photography was widespread, sodium and ammonium thiosulfate were widely used as &quot;fixing agents&quot;. Sulfur is a component of gunpowder (&quot;black powder&quot;).

===Fertilizer===
Amino acids synthesized by living organisms such as methionine and cysteine contain organosulfur groups (thioester and thiol respectively). The antioxidant glutathione protecting many living organisms against free radicals and oxidative stress also contains organic sulfur. Some crops such as onion and garlic also produce different organosulfur compounds such as &quot;syn&quot;-propanethial-&quot;S&quot;-oxide responsible of lacrymal irritation (onions), or diallyl disulfide and allicin (garlic). Sulfates, commonly found in soils and groundwaters are often a sufficient natural source of sulfur for plants and bacteria. Atmospheric deposition of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is also a common artificial source (coal combustion) of sulfur for the soils. Under normal circumstances, in most agricultural soils, sulfur is not a limiting nutrient for plants and microorganisms (see Liebig&#x27;s barrel). However, in some circumstances, soils can be depleted in sulfate, e.g. if this later is leached by meteoric water (rain) or if the requirements in sulfur for some types of crops are high. This explains that sulfur is increasingly recognized and used as a component of fertilizers. The most important form of sulfur for fertilizer is calcium sulfate, commonly found in nature as the mineral gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). Elemental sulfur is hydrophobic (not soluble in water) and cannot be used directly by plants. Elemental sulfur (ES) is sometimes mixed with bentonite to amend depleted soils for crops with high requirement in organo-sulfur. Over time, oxidation abiotic processes with atmospheric oxygen and soil bacteria can oxidize and convert elemental sulfur to soluble derivatives, which can then be used by microorganisms and plants. Sulfur improves the efficiency of other essential plant nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. Biologically produced sulfur particles are naturally hydrophilic due to a biopolymer coating and are easier to disperse over the land in a spray of diluted slurry, resulting in a faster uptake by plants.

The plants requirement for sulfur equals or exceeds the requirement for phosphorus. It is an essential nutrient for plant growth, root nodule formation of legumes, and immunity and defense systems. Sulfur deficiency has become widespread in many countries in Europe. Because atmospheric inputs of sulfur continue to decrease, the deficit in the sulfur input/output is likely to increase unless sulfur fertilizers are used. Atmospheric inputs of sulfur decrease because of actions taken to limit acid rains.

===Fungicide and pesticide===

Elemental sulfur is one of the oldest fungicides and pesticides. &quot;Dusting sulfur&quot;, elemental sulfur in powdered form, is a common fungicide for grapes, strawberry, many vegetables and several other crops. It has a good efficacy against a wide range of powdery mildew diseases as well as black spot. In organic production, sulfur is the most important fungicide. It is the only fungicide used in organically farmed apple production against the main disease apple scab under colder conditions. Biosulfur (biologically produced elemental sulfur with hydrophilic characteristics) can also be used for these applications.

Standard-formulation dusting sulfur is applied to crops with a sulfur duster or from a dusting plane. Wettable sulfur is the commercial name for dusting sulfur formulated with additional ingredients to make it water miscible. It has similar applications and is used as a fungicide against mildew and other mold-related problems with plants and soil.

Elemental sulfur powder is used as an &quot;organic&quot; (i.e., &quot;green&quot;) insecticide (actually an acaricide) against ticks and mites. A common method of application is dusting the clothing or limbs with sulfur powder.

A diluted solution of lime sulfur (made by combining calcium hydroxide with elemental sulfur in water) is used as a dip for pets to destroy ringworm (fungus), mange, and other dermatoses and parasites.

Sulfur candles of almost pure sulfur were burned to fumigate structures and wine barrels, but are now considered too toxic for residences.

===Pharmaceuticals===

Sulfur (specifically octasulfur, S8) is used in pharmaceutical skin preparations for the treatment of acne and other conditions. It acts as a keratolytic agent and also kills bacteria, fungi, scabies mites, and other parasites. Precipitated sulfur and colloidal sulfur are used, in form of lotions, creams, powders, soaps, and bath additives, for the treatment of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and seborrhoeic dermatitis.

Many drugs contain sulfur. Early examples include antibacterial sulfonamides, known as &quot;sulfa drugs&quot;. A more recent example is mucolytic acetylcysteine. Sulfur is a part of many bacterial defense molecules. Most β-lactam antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams contain sulfur.

=== Batteries ===
Due to their high energy density and the availability of sulfur, there is ongoing research in creating rechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries. Until now, carbonate electrolytes have caused failures in such batteries after a single cycle. In February 2022, researchers at Drexel University have not only created a prototypical battery that lasted 4000 recharge cycles, but also found the first monoclinic gamma sulfur that remained stable below 95 degrees Celsius.

==Biological role==
Sulfur is an essential component of all living cells. It is the eighth most abundant element in the human body by weight, about equal in abundance to potassium, and slightly greater than sodium and chlorine. A human body contains about of sulfur. The main dietary source of sulfur for humans is sulfur-containing amino-acids, which can be found in plant and animal proteins.

=== Transferring sulfur between inorganic and biomolecules ===
In the 1880s, while studying &quot;Beggiatoa&quot; (a bacterium living in a sulfur rich environment), Sergei Winogradsky found that it oxidized hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as an energy source, forming intracellular sulfur droplets. Winogradsky referred to this form of metabolism as inorgoxidation (oxidation of inorganic compounds). Another contributor, who continued to study it was Selman Waksman. Primitive bacteria that live around deep ocean volcanic vents oxidize hydrogen sulfide for their nutrition, as discovered by Robert Ballard.

Sulfur oxidizers can use as energy sources reduced sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, sulfite, thiosulfate, and various polythionates (e.g., tetrathionate). They depend on enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase and sulfite oxidase to oxidize sulfur to sulfate. Some lithotrophs can even use the energy contained in sulfur compounds to produce sugars, a process known as chemosynthesis. Some bacteria and archaea use hydrogen sulfide in place of water as the electron donor in chemosynthesis, a process similar to photosynthesis that produces sugars and uses oxygen as the electron acceptor. Sulfur-based chemosynthesis may be simplifiedly compared with photosynthesis:


There are bacteria combining these two ways of nutrition: green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria. Also sulfur-oxidizing bacteria can go into symbiosis with larger organisms, enabling the later to use hydrogen sulfide as food to be oxidized. Example: the giant tube worm.

There are sulfate-reducing bacteria, that, by contrast, &quot;breathe sulfate&quot; instead of oxygen. They use organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as the energy source. They use sulfur as the electron acceptor, and reduce various oxidized sulfur compounds back into sulfide, often into hydrogen sulfide. They can grow on other partially oxidized sulfur compounds (e.g. thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites).

There are studies pointing that many deposits of native sulfur in places that were the bottom of the ancient oceans have biological origin. These studies indicate that this native sulfur have been obtained through biological activity, but what is responsible for that (sulfur-oxidizing bacteria or sulfate-reducing bacteria) is still unknown for sure.

Sulfur is absorbed by plants roots from soil as sulfate and transported as a phosphate ester. Sulfate is reduced to sulfide via sulfite before it is incorporated into cysteine and other organosulfur compounds.

While the plants&#x27; role in transferring sulfur to animals by food chains is more or less understood, the role of sulfur bacteria is just getting investigated.

===Protein and organic metabolites===
In all forms of life, most of the sulfur is contained in two proteinogenic amino acids (cysteine and methionine), thus the element is present in all proteins that contain these amino acids, as well as in respective peptides. Some of the sulfur is comprised in certain metabolites—many of which are cofactors—and sulfated polysaccharides of connective tissue (chondroitin sulfates, heparin).

Proteins, to execute their biological function, need to have specific space geometry. Formation of this geometry is performed in a process called protein folding, and is provided by intra- and inter-molecular bonds. The process has several stages. While at premier stages a polypeptide chain folds due to hydrogen bonds, at later stages folding is provided (apart from hydrogen bonds) by covalent bonds between two sulfur atoms of two cysteine residues (so called disulfide bridges) at different places of a chain (tertiary protein structure) as well as between two cysteine residues in two separated protein subunits (quaternary protein structure). Both structures easily may be seen in insulin. As the bond energy of a covalent disulfide bridge is higher than the energy of a coordinate bond or hydrophobic interaction, higher disulfide bridges content leads to higher energy needed for protein denaturation. In general disulfide bonds are necessary in proteins functioning outside cellular space, and they do not change proteins&#x27; conformation (geometry), but serve as its stabilizers. Within cytoplasm cysteine residues of proteins are saved in reduced state (i.e. in -SH form) by thioredoxins.

This property manifests in following examples. Lysozyme is stable enough to be applied as a drug. Feathers and hair have relative strength, and consisting in them keratin is considered indigestible by most organisms. However, there are fungi and bacteria containing keratinase, and are able to destruct keratin.

Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with -SH moieties to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and alpha-lipoic acid. Cysteine-related metabolites homocysteine and taurine are other sulfur-containing amino acids that are similar in structure, but not coded by DNA, and are not part of the primary structure of proteins, take part in various locations of mammalian physiology. Two of the 13 classical vitamins, biotin and thiamine, contain sulfur, and serve as cofactors to several enzymes.
In intracellular chemistry, sulfur operates as a carrier of reducing hydrogen and its electrons for cellular repair of oxidation. Reduced glutathione, a sulfur-containing tripeptide, is a reducing agent through its sulfhydryl (–SH) moiety derived from cysteine.

Methanogenesis, the route to most of the world&#x27;s methane, is a multistep biochemical transformation of carbon dioxide. This conversion requires several organosulfur cofactors. These include coenzyme M, , the immediate precursor to methane.

===Metalloproteins and inorganic cofactors===
Metalloproteins—in which the active site is a transition metal ion (or metal-sulfide cluster) often coordinated by sulfur atoms of cysteine residues—are essential components of enzymes involved in electron transfer processes. Examples include plastocyanin (Cu2+) and nitrous oxide reductase (Cu–S). The function of these enzymes is dependent on the fact that the transition metal ion can undergo redox reactions. Other examples include many zinc proteins, as well as iron–sulfur clusters. Most pervasive are the ferrodoxins, which serve as electron shuttles in cells. In bacteria, the important nitrogenase enzymes contain an Fe–Mo–S cluster and is a catalyst that performs the important function of nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia that can be used by microorganisms and plants to make proteins, DNA, RNA, alkaloids, and the other organic nitrogen compounds necessary for life.

Sulfur is also present in molybdenum cofactor.

===Sulfate===
===Deficiency===
In humans methionine is an essential amino acid; cysteine is conditionally essential and may be synthesized from non-essential serine (sulfur donor would be methionine in this case). Dietary deficiency rarely happens in common conditions. 

Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare, fatal genetic disease preventing production of sulfite oxidase, needed to metabolize sulfites to sulfates.

==Precautions==
Though elemental sulfur is only minimally absorbed through the skin and is of low toxicity to humans, inhalation of sulfur dust or contact with eyes or skin may cause irritation. Excessive ingestion of sulfur can cause a burning sensation or diarrhea, and cases of life-threatening metabolic acidosis have been reported after patients deliberately consumed sulfur as a folk remedy.

===Toxicity of sulfur compounds===
When sulfur burns in air, it produces sulfur dioxide. In water, this gas produces sulfurous acid and sulfites; sulfites are antioxidants that inhibit growth of aerobic bacteria and a useful food additive in small amounts. At high concentrations these acids harm the lungs, eyes, or other tissues. In organisms without lungs such as insects, sulfite in high concentration prevents respiration.

Sulfur trioxide (made by catalysis from sulfur dioxide) and sulfuric acid are similarly highly acidic and corrosive in the presence of water. Concentrated sulfuric acid is a strong dehydrating agent that can strip available water molecules and water components from sugar and organic tissue.

The burning of coal and/or petroleum by industry and power plants generates sulfur dioxide (SO2) that reacts with atmospheric water and oxygen to produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3). These acids are components of acid rain, lowering the pH of soil and freshwater bodies, sometimes resulting in substantial damage to the environment and chemical weathering of statues and structures. Fuel standards increasingly require that fuel producers extract sulfur from fossil fuels to prevent acid rain formation. This extracted and refined sulfur represents a large portion of sulfur production. In coal-fired power plants, flue gases are sometimes purified. More modern power plants that use synthesis gas extract the sulfur before they burn the gas.

Hydrogen sulfide is about one-half as toxic as hydrogen cyanide, and intoxicates by the same mechanism (inhibition of the respiratory enzyme cytochrome oxidase), though hydrogen sulfide is less likely to cause sudden poisonings from small inhaled amounts (near its permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 20 ppm) because of its disagreeable odor. However, its presence in ambient air at concentration over 100–150 ppm quickly deadens the sense of smell, and a victim may breathe increasing quantities without noticing until severe symptoms cause death. Dissolved sulfide and hydrosulfide salts are toxic by the same mechanism.

<doc id="27129" wikidata="Q588064" url="?curid=27129" title="SAMPA">
<text>The Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA) is a computer-readable phonetic script using 7-bit printable ASCII characters, based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). It was originally developed in the late 1980s for six European languages by the EEC ESPRIT information technology research and development program. As many symbols as possible have been taken over from the IPA; where this is not possible, other signs that are available are used, e.g. [codice_1] for schwa (IPA ), [codice_2] for the vowel sound found in French &quot;deux&quot; &#x27;two&#x27; (IPA ), and [codice_3] for the vowel sound found in French &quot;neuf&quot; &#x27;nine&#x27; (IPA ).

Today, officially, SAMPA has been developed for all the sounds of the following languages:

* Arabic
* Bulgarian
* Cantonese
* Czech
* Danish
* Dutch
* English
* Estonian
* French
* German
* Greek
* Hebrew
* Hungarian
* Italian
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Scots
* Serbo-Croatian
* Slovak
* Slovenian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Thai
* Turkish

The characters [codice_4] represent the pronunciation of the name SAMPA in English, with the initial symbol [&quot;] indicating primary stress. Like IPA, SAMPA is usually enclosed in square brackets or slashes, which are not part of the alphabet proper and merely signify that it is phonetic as opposed to regular text.

==Features==
SAMPA was developed in the late 1980s in the European Commission-funded ESPRIT project 2589 &quot;Speech Assessment Methods&quot; (SAM)—hence &quot;SAM Phonetic Alphabet&quot;—in order to facilitate email data exchange and computational processing of transcriptions in phonetics and speech technology.

SAMPA is a partial encoding of the IPA. The first version of SAMPA was the union of the sets of phoneme codes for Danish, Dutch, English, French, German and Italian; later versions extended SAMPA to cover other European languages. Since SAMPA is based on phoneme inventories, each SAMPA table is valid only in the language it was created for. In order to make this IPA encoding technique universally applicable, X-SAMPA was created, which provides &quot;one single table&quot; without language-specific differences.

SAMPA was devised as a hack to work around the inability of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Consequently, as Unicode support for IPA symbols becomes more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA in ASCII decreases. However, text input relies on specific keyboard encodings or input devices. For this reason, SAMPA and X-SAMPA are still widely used in computational phonetics and in speech technology.

<doc id="27152" wikidata="Q200586" url="?curid=27152" title="Sheryl Crow">
<text>Sheryl Suzanne Crow (born February 11, 1962) is an American singer, musician, songwriter, and actress. She is noted for her optimistic and idealistic subject matter, and incorporation of genres including rock, pop, country, folk, and blues. She has released twelve studio albums, five compilations, and three live albums, and contributed to several film soundtracks. Her most popular songs include &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; (1994), &quot;Strong Enough&quot; (1994), &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot; (1996), &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot; (1996), &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot; (1998), &quot;Picture&quot; (2002, duet with Kid Rock), and &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; (2002).

Crow has sold more than 50 million albums worldwide and won nine Grammy Awards from 32 nominations. In her acting career, Crow has appeared on the television series &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Cop Rock&quot;, &quot;GCB&quot;, &quot;Cougar Town&quot;, Jon Stewart&#x27;s and Stephen Colbert&#x27;s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Crow was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

== Early life and education==
Crow was born on February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri, the daughter of Bernice (née Cain), a piano teacher, and Wendell Wyatt Crow, a lawyer and trumpet player. Her great-grandfather was Congressman Charles A. Crow (1873–1938). She has two older sisters, Kathy and Karen, and a younger brother, Steven.

While studying at Kennett High School, Crow was a majorette and an all-state track athlete, winning medals in the 75-meter low hurdles. She also joined the pep club, the National Honor Society, and the National FFA Organization, and was crowned Paperdoll Queen in a celebrity-judged beauty contest during her senior year.

She then enrolled at the University of Missouri in Columbia and in 1984 received a BS Ed degree in music education. While at the university, she sang in the local band Cashmere. She was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, Sigma Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity for Women, and the Omicron Delta Kappa Society, as well as working as a summer welcome orientation leader.

==Career==

===1987–1991: Early career===
After graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at Kellison Elementary School in Fenton, Missouri. Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer Jay Oliver. He had a studio in the basement of his parents&#x27; home in St. Louis and helped her by using her in advertising jingles. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr. Soon after, she sang in commercial jingles for McDonald&#x27;s and Toyota. She was quoted in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment as saying she made $40,000 on the McDonald&#x27;s ad alone.

Crow toured with Michael Jackson as a backing vocalist during his Bad World Tour 1987–1989, and often performed with Jackson on &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;. She also recorded background vocals for Stevie Wonder, Belinda Carlisle, Jimmy Buffett, Kevin Gilbert and Don Henley.

In 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the Neal Schon track &quot;Smoke of the Revolution&quot; from his album &quot;Late Nite&quot;.

Crow also sang in the short-lived Steven Bochco drama &quot;Cop Rock&quot; series finale in 1990 and her song &quot;Heal Somebody&quot; appeared in the film &quot;Bright Angel&quot;. In 1991, her recording of &quot;Welcome to the Real Life&quot; featured on the soundtrack to the Brian Bosworth action film &quot;Stone Cold&quot;. Later that year, her performance of &quot;Hundreds of Tears&quot; was included on the &quot;Point Break&quot; soundtrack and she sang a duet with Kenny Loggins on the track &quot;I Would Do Anything&quot;, from his album &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;.

===1992: Scrapped debut album===
In 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with Sting&#x27;s record producer Hugh Padgham. The self-titled debut album was due to be released in September 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as &quot;too produced&quot; and &quot;slick&quot;. However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via file sharing networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow&#x27;s songs were recorded by major artists such as Celine Dion, Tina Turner and Wynonna Judd.

===1994–1997: International success===
Crow began dating Kevin Gilbert and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the &quot;Tuesday Music Club&quot;. The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow, but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. Group members Gilbert, David Baerwald, and David Ricketts (both formerly of David &amp; David), Bill Bottrell, Brian MacLeod, and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, released in 1993. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits. &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; featured many of the songs written by Crow&#x27;s friends, including the second single, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. The album was slow to garner attention, until &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; became an unexpected smash hit in October 1994. The singles &quot;Strong Enough&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry Anymore&quot; were also released, with the first song (&quot;Strong Enough&quot;) charting at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry Anymore&quot; hitting the Top 40. &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the US and UK during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammys at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
Crow performed at the 1994 Woodstock Festival and appeared in the &quot;New Faces&quot; section of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1994. She also supplied background vocals to the song &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; from Don Henley&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Actual Miles: Henley&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

In 1996, Crow released her self-titled second album. She produced the album herself and also played a variety of instruments, from various guitars, bass or pedal steel to various organs and piano. The debut single, &quot;If It Makes You Happy&quot;, became a radio success and netted her two Grammys for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Album at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards in 1997. Other singles included &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot;. The album was banned from sale at Walmart, because in the lyrics to &quot;Love Is a Good Thing&quot; Crow says that Walmart sells guns to children. The album also features a protest song called &quot;Redemption Day&quot;, which was covered by Johnny Cash on his posthumous album &quot;American VI: Ain&#x27;t No Grave&quot;.

Crow performed at Another Roadside Attraction in 1997. Also in 1997, Crow contributed the theme song to the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. Her song &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; was nominated for a Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards and Best Original Song at the 55th Golden Globe Awards. 
===1998–1999: &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; and live album===

Crow collaborated on Scott Weiland&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;12 Bar Blues&quot;. Also in 1998, Crow released &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;. During this period, she discussed in interviews having gone through a deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with Eric Clapton. The debut single from this album, &quot;My Favorite Mistake&quot;, was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend. Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine on the release of her album, &quot;Oh, there will be just so much speculation, and because of that there&#x27;s great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I&#x27;m the only person who will ever really know. I&#x27;m really private about who I&#x27;ve had relationships with, and I don&#x27;t talk about them in the press. I don&#x27;t even really talk about them with the people around me.&quot; Despite the difficulties in recording the album, Crow told the BBC in 2005 that, &quot;My favorite single is &#x27;My Favorite Mistake&#x27;. It was a lot of fun to record and it&#x27;s still a lot of fun to play.&quot; The album won Best Rock Album at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards in 1999. It was re-released in 1999, with a bonus track, Crow&#x27;s cover of the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. The song won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000. Other singles included &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;, &quot;Anything but Down&quot;, and &quot;The Difficult Kind&quot;. Crow&#x27;s live recording of &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; won a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001. &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, achieving US sales of 2 million as of January 2008. Later in 1998, Crow took part in a live concert in tribute to Burt Bacharach, contributing vocals on &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot;.

In 1999, Crow also made her acting debut as an ill-fated drifter in the suspense/drama &quot;The Minus Man&quot;, which starred her then-boyfriend Owen Wilson as a serial killer. Also in 1999, she appeared in Prince&#x27;s album &quot;Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;, singing backing vocals in the song &quot;Baby Knows&quot;. Prince included a cover of her &quot;Everyday Is a Winding Road&quot; in the album. She also appeared in Zucchero Fornaciari&#x27;s collection &quot;Overdose d&#x27;amore/The Ballads&quot; featuring the song &quot;Blue&quot; (co-written by Bono).

She also released a live album called &quot;Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live From Central Park&quot;. The record featured Crow singing many of her hit singles with new musical spins and guest appearances by many other musicians including Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, the Dixie Chicks, Keith Richards, and Eric Clapton. It included her Grammy winning performance of &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot;.

===2002–2004: &quot;C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon&quot; and &quot;The Very Best of Sheryl Crow&quot;===

Crow has been involved with the Scleroderma Research Foundation (SRF) since the late 1990s, performing at fund-raisers and befriending Sharon Monsky. In 2002, as a result of her friend Kent Sexton dying from scleroderma, she interrupted work on her new album &quot;C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon&quot; to record the traditional hymn &quot;Be Still, My Soul&quot;, to be played at his funeral. In November of that year it was released as a single, with the proceeds going to SRF.

Her fourth studio album, &quot;C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon&quot;, was released in 2002, spawning the hit single &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;. The second single, &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;, won the Female Rock Vocal Performance Grammy at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003.

Crow opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wearing a shirt that read &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in your war, Mr. Bush!&quot; during a performance on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and posting an open letter explaining her opposition on her website. At a performance with Kid Rock at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, she wore a large peace sign and a guitar strap with the words &quot;No War&quot;. She showed support for injured soldiers in 2003 by playing her guitar and singing to individual patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

She recorded the song &quot;Kiss That Girl&quot; for the film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. She also recorded a cover version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot; for the film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;. Crow sang a duet with rock artist Kid Rock on the crossover hit single &quot;Picture&quot;, from Kid Rock&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Cocky&quot;. She also assisted him on the track &quot;Run Off to LA&quot;.

Crow collaborated with Michelle Branch on the song &quot;Love Me Like That&quot; for Branch&#x27;s second album, &quot;Hotel Paper&quot;, released in 2003.

She was featured on the Johnny Cash album &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; on the song &quot;Field of Diamonds&quot; as a background vocalist, and also played the accordion for the songs &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot; and &quot;Mary of the Wild Moor&quot;.

In 2003, a greatest hits compilation called &quot;The Very Best of Sheryl Crow&quot; was released. It featured many of her hit singles, as well as some new tracks. Among them was the 1960s pop song, &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; by Cat Stevens, which became her biggest radio hit since &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;. She also released the single &quot;Light in Your Eyes&quot;, which received limited airplay. &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; earned her two awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist at the American Music Awards of 2004.

In 2004, Crow appeared as a musical theater performer in the Cole Porter biographical film &quot;De-Lovely&quot;.

===2005–2007: &quot;Wildflower&quot;===

Her fifth studio album, &quot;Wildflower&quot;, was released in September 2005. Although the album debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, it received mixed reviews and was not as commercially successful as her previous albums. In December 2005, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while Crow was nominated for a Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Grammy for the first single &quot;Good Is Good&quot; at the 48th Grammy Awards. However, she ultimately lost in both categories to Kelly Clarkson. The album got a new boost in 2006 when the second single was announced as &quot;Always on Your Side&quot;, re-recorded with British musician Sting and sent off to radio, where it was quickly embraced on Adult Top 40. The collaboration with Sting resulted in a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals at the 49th Grammy Awards. As of January 2008, &quot;Wildflower&quot; has sold 949,000 units in the United States.

Also in 2005, Crow contributed &quot;Real Gone&quot;, the opening track to the soundtrack for Disney and Pixar&#x27;s 2006 animated film &quot;Cars&quot;. Crow was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in mid-February 2006, her doctors stating that, &quot;Prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.&quot;

Crow&#x27;s first concert after her cancer diagnosis was on May 18 of that year in Orlando, Florida, where she played to over 10,000 information technology professionals at the SAP Sapphire Convention. Her first public appearance was on June 12, when she performed at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis, Indiana. She also appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on CNN on August 23, 2006. In this show, she talked about her comeback, her breakup with Lance Armstrong, her past job as Michael Jackson&#x27;s backup singer, and her experience as a breast cancer survivor.

In late 2006, Crow was nominated for a Best Original Song Golden Globe Award for the song &quot;Try Not To Remember&quot; from the film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; at the 64th Golden Globe Awards.

In early 2007, Crow was scheduled to sing at an annual benefit concert for the Cardinal Glennon Children&#x27;s Hospital that sportscaster Bob Costas hosts every year. Her performance was opposed by Catholic Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke due to her position on abortion. Burke resigned as chair of the medical center&#x27;s board of governors when Crow&#x27;s appearance was confirmed.

Crow wrote a foreword for the book &quot;Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips&quot;, a book written by Kris Carr that was based on her 2007 documentary film &quot;Crazy Sexy Cancer&quot;. Crow contributed her cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on the soundtrack for the DreamWorks animated film &quot;Bee Movie&quot; in November 2007. She contributed background vocals to Ryan Adams&#x27;s song &quot;Two&quot; from his album &quot;Easy Tiger&quot;.

===2008–2009: &quot;Detours&quot;===
Crow returned with her sixth studio album &quot;Detours&quot;, which was released on February 5, 2008. &quot;Detours&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart selling close to 92,000 copies in its first week and an additional 52,000 copies in its second week. In support of the new album, Crow launched a 25-date tour with James Blunt, and the lineup included reggae group Toots and the Maytals after being handpicked by Crow who said they are one of her favorite bands.

&quot;Detours&quot; was recorded at Crow&#x27;s Nashville, Tennessee farm. Her son, Wyatt, makes an appearance on the song &quot;Lullaby for Wyatt&quot;, which is featured in the movie &quot;Grace Is Gone&quot;.

&quot;Shine Over Babylon&quot; was the first promotional single from the album (download only). The first official single released from the album was &quot;Love Is Free&quot;, followed by &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;. As of 2010, &quot;Detours&quot; had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide.
Crow endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election and later performed on the fourth and last day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

Crow also recorded a studio version of &quot;So Glad We Made It&quot; for the &quot;AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack&quot;, in conjunction with the 2008 US Olympic team sponsors, AT&amp;T.

A&amp;M Records re-released Crow&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;, as a deluxe version 2CD/DVD set on November 17, 2009. The released included the single &quot;Killer Life&quot;, which charted moderately in adult album alternative radio. The bonus CD contains unreleased songs and B-sides, and a new mix of &quot;I Shall Believe&quot;. The DVD features music videos for each of the album&#x27;s singles.

In August 2008, Crow (in partnership with Western Glove Works) launched a jeans brand, Bootheel Trading Company.

On April 4, 2009, Crow, who practices Transcendental Meditation, took part in a benefit concert at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City organized by the David Lynch Foundation supporting the Foundation&#x27;s goal of teaching one million at-risk students to meditate. She and Ben Harper performed George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. Other performers at the concert included Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Mike Love, Moby, Eddie Vedder and Donovan.

===2010–2012: &quot;100 Miles from Memphis&quot;===

In 2010, Crow contributed the original spoken-word track &quot;My Name Is Mwamaroyi&quot; to the Enough Project and Downtown Records&#x27; &quot;Raise Hope for Congo&quot; compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo&#x27;s women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in Congo.

A&amp;M Records released Crow&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;100 Miles from Memphis&quot;, on July 20, 2010. The album had a Memphis soul sound and featured the lead single &quot;Summer Day&quot;.

Later that year, she joined Loretta Lynn and country singer Miranda Lambert on an update of Lynn&#x27;s song &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; for the 2010 album &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn&quot;. They later performed the song at the 2010 Country Music Association Awards in November.

In July 2011, Crow performed at the opening night of the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo. Animal welfare campaigners had urged her not to, alleging animal cruelty at the event. Almost 13,000 people signed a petition calling on Crow not to perform.

On September 20, 2011, it was announced that Crow will write the music and lyrics for &quot;Diner&quot;, a new musical inspired by the critically acclaimed 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot;. The show initially had an intended run on Broadway planned for the fall of 2012 though it eventually opened in Arlington County, Virginia in 2014 and was directed and choreographed by Tony Award winner Kathleen Marshall.

On October 11, 2011, William Shatner released the album &quot;Seeking Major Tom&quot;, on which Crow sang the track &quot;Mrs. Major Tom&quot; by electronic music artist KIA, released in 2003 on the album &quot;Adieu Shinjuku Zulu&quot;.

On September 21, 2012, Mailboat Records released &quot;Mark Twain: Words &amp; Music&quot;, an Americana double-CD that tells the life of fellow Missourian Mark Twain in spoken word and song. The project was a benefit for the Mark Twain Boyhood Home &amp; Museum in Hannibal, Missouri. Crow sang the only period piece song on the project, Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;. The song was sung a cappella and accompanied the narrative describing the early days of Mark Twain&#x27;s young family in Hartford, Connecticut. Other performers that joined the project, produced by Carl Jackson, included Jimmy Buffett, Clint Eastwood, Garrison Keillor, Brad Paisley, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, and others. AirPlay Direct reported the project as its most downloaded Americana album.

In September 2012, Crow was featured in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs/30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s book.

Crow was invited by journalist Katie Couric to write the theme song for her new talk-show, &quot;Katie&quot;. The song, titled &quot;This Day&quot;, was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Original Song.

On November 1, 2012, Crow released an original song she called &quot;Woman in the White House&quot; that was made available for a free download. As the title suggests, the country-flavored tune defends the idea of a woman president. Mixed reviews from critics ranged from &quot;sort of patronizing and gender essentialist&quot; to &quot;good-natured and well-intentioned&quot;. The song, praised for its tongue-in-cheek lyrics, was commented on by country singer Brad Paisley, who characterized it as &quot;all in good fun&quot;. The song was later released for digital download on iTunes and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the American Red Cross to aid in the recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

Also in 2012, VH1 ranked Crow at No. 25 as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot;.

===2013–2015: &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;===
In 2011, Crow separated from her label, A&amp;M Records. The singer followed Nashville neighbor Brad Paisley&#x27;s advice and, after being introduced to producer Justin Niebank and several Nashville-based songwriters such as Chris DuBois, Luke Laird and Chris Stapleton, in 2013 she started her first country music project.

In 2013, Crow signed a recording contract with Warner Music Nashville and, a few months later, released &quot;Easy&quot;, the first single from the upcoming album, which became her first top twenty country radio hit and her highest charting lead single since 2005. &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; was released on September 10, 2013, and debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of over 36,000 copies, becoming Crow&#x27;s ninth top ten album.

Crow was one of the opening acts for George Strait&#x27;s 2014 leg of &quot;The Cowboy Rides Away Tour&quot;. Along with Stevie Nicks, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris and Carrie Underwood, she made an appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, paying tribute to Linda Ronstadt, who was one of the inductees of 2014. Crow, along with country band Gloriana, joined Rascal Flatts on their &quot;Rewind Tour&quot;, which kicked off May 16, 2014.

The 40th anniversary celebration benefit concert of the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; television show was held on June 26, 2014, and televised later that year. Crow hosted the event along with Jeff Bridges and performed with Kris Kristofferson, Gary Clark Jr., Alabama Shakes, as well as her former guitarist Doyle Bramhall II. Crow sang on a rendition of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; that appeared on Darius Rucker&#x27;s Christmas album, &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;. In December 2015, she covered &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; at the John Lennon 75th Birthday Concert, and performed &quot;Two More Bottles of Wine&quot; with Vince Gill at another tribute concert: &quot;The Life &amp; Songs of Emmylou Harris&quot;.

===2017–2022: &quot;Be Myself&quot;, &quot;Threads&quot; and &quot;Sheryl&quot;===
Crow duets with Americana artist Rodney Crowell on the track &quot;I&#x27;m Tied To Ya&quot; from his album &quot;Close Ties&quot; which was released in March 2017. Crow&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Be Myself&quot;, was released on April 21, 2017. It was co-produced by Crow, Jeff Trott and Tchad Blake, and is the first time the latter has appeared on one of Crow&#x27;s studio albums since &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot; in 1998. &quot;Be Myself&quot; was described by Crow as a return to the sound of her nineties work, and intentionally eschews the country-influenced sound of her previous album. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Crow said that she did not enjoy the country radio promotional process: &quot;It was more political than I expected... You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that&#x27;s just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain. I&#x27;m too old to allow that for myself, and to spend any night away from my kid for that is not justified.&quot;

Crow&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Threads&quot; features contributions from, among others, Don Henley, Joe Walsh, Sting, Stevie Nicks, Willie Nelson, and Keith Richards. While promoting her UK tour, Crow released &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Wanna Be Like You&quot; featuring St. Vincent and revealed that she intended for &quot;Threads&quot; to be her final album, citing the impossibility of releasing something that could follow-up such a gathering of artists. She added that she would continue to write and tour and would potentially release short-form music akin to extended plays.

In 2019, it was reported that Crow was among hundreds of artists whose material had been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Crow had initially told BBC News that the master and safety back-ups for her first seven albums were lost in the fire. However, in a 2022 interview with &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot;, Crow revealed that her masters had in fact not been lost, stating that &quot;luckily, they found most of mine in a different area.&quot; In 2022, &quot;Sheryl&quot;, a Showtime documentary film directed by Amy Scott chronicling her career, premiered at the South by Southwest film festival.

===2023–present: &quot;Evolution&quot;===
Crow announced that she recorded a new studio album, her twelfth, &quot;Evolution&quot;, on November 3, 2023. The news arrived just ahead of her induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that same day. The album was released March 29, 2024. It was preceded by the single &quot;Alarm Clock&quot;. Also in 2024, she contributed guitar to a re-release of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. On October 25, 2024, she released the single &quot;Light A Candle&quot;, proceeds of which would be donated to the American Red Cross, supporting communities affected by hurricanes and tropical storms in 2024, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

==Instruments and signature model guitars==
Early in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 Gibson Country Western guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked Gibson to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model. In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition &quot;Sheryl Crow Southern Jumbo&quot;, a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Crow has had several high-profile romantic relationships. In the late 1990s, she dated musician Eric Clapton and actor Owen Wilson. The song &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; on the album &quot;C&#x27;mon, C&#x27;mon&quot; was dedicated to Wilson and, according to the album&#x27;s liner notes, was an account of their relationship. Crow began dating cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2003. The couple announced their engagement in September 2005, but jointly announced they had split on February 3, 2006. According to Crow, she has been engaged two other times but never married.

In May 2007, Crow announced on her website that she had adopted a boy who was born the month before. In June 2010, Crow announced that she had adopted another boy born the previous April. She and her sons live in West Nashville, Tennessee. She also owns a home in Destin, Florida. She owned a loft apartment in the NoHo neighborhood of Lower Manhattan from 1998 to 2017.

Crow and her son Levi are diehard Milwaukee Bucks fans, and went to several of their post-season games in 2021 en route to Milwaukee&#x27;s 2021 NBA Finals victory. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton are her favorite players.

===Health===
After being diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive form of breast cancer, Crow underwent a lumpectomy at a Los Angeles facility on February 22, 2006, followed by seven weeks of radiation therapy. In August 2010, Crow partnered with her surgeon, Kristi Funk, to open the Sheryl Crow Imaging Center at Funk&#x27;s Pink Lotus Breast Center. Crow had also suffered from depression.

In November 2011, Crow was diagnosed with a meningioma, the most common kind of brain tumour, usually benign, for which she continued to have regular follow-up exams.

===Views===
Crow was raised Presbyterian, but she moved towards a more general affiliation and now describes herself as Christian. She is known for her liberal political point of view, opposing the invasion of Iraq in 2003, supporting gun control measures, opposing military intervention in Syria, and supporting efforts to reduce climate change.

===Awards===
Crow has been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Missouri (her alma mater) and Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau.

In 2006, Crow was a recipient of the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member Steven Spielberg at a ceremony in Los Angeles.

On November 3, 2023, Crow was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Structuralist film theory is a branch of film theory that is rooted in structuralism, itself based on structural linguistics.

==Overview==
Structuralist film theory emphasizes how films convey meaning through the use of codes and conventions not dissimilar to the way languages are used to construct meaning in communication. However, structuralist film theory differs from linguistic theory in that its codifications include a more apparent temporal aspect. In other words, the site of the study (the film) is moving in time and must be analyzed in a framework which can consider its temporality. To that end, structuralist film theory is dependent on a new kind of sign, first proposed by the Prague linguistic circle, dubbed the ostensive sign.

== Theoreticians ==
Film theorists associated with structuralism include Peter Wollen, Sol Worth, Calvin Pryluck, Christian Metz. and Will Wright.

<text>A seizure is a sudden change in behavior, movement or consciousness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can look different in different people. It can be uncontrolled shaking of the whole body (tonic-clonic seizures) or a person spacing out for a few seconds (absence seizures). Most seizures last less than two minutes. They are then followed by confusion/drowsiness before the person returns to normal. If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, it is a medical emergency (status epilepticus) and needs immediate treatment.

Seizures can be classified as provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures have a cause that can be fixed, such as low blood sugar, alcohol withdrawal, high fever, recent stroke, and recent head trauma. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause or fixable cause. Examples include past strokes, brain tumors, brain vessel malformations, and genetic disorders. If no cause is found, it is called an idiopathic seizure. After a first unprovoked seizure, the chance of experiencing a second one is about 40% within 2 years. People with repeated unprovoked seizures are diagnosed with epilepsy.

Doctors assess a seizure by first ruling out other conditions that look similar to seizures, such as fainting and strokes. This includes taking a detailed history and ordering blood tests. They may also order an electroencephalogram (EEG) and brain imaging (CT, MRI or both). If it is a person&#x27;s first seizure and it was &quot;provoked&quot;, or caused by another condition, treatment of the cause is usually enough to treat the seizure. If the seizure is &quot;unprovoked&quot;, brain imaging is abnormal, and/or EEG is abnormal, starting anti-seizure medications is generally recommended.

==Signs and symptoms==

A seizure can last from a few seconds to 5 minutes. Once it reaches and passes 5 minutes, it is known as status epilepticus. Accidental urination (urinary incontinence), stool leaking (fecal incontinence), tongue biting, foaming of the mouth, and turning blue due to inability to breathe commonly are seen in seizures.

A period of confusion typically follows the seizure that lasts from seconds to hours before a person returns to normal. This period is called a postictal period. Other symptoms during this period include drowsiness, headache, difficulty speaking, psychosis, and weakness.

Observable signs and symptoms of seizures vary depending on the type. Seizures can be classified into generalized seizures and focal seizures, depending on what part of the brain is involved.

===Focal seizures===
Focal seizures affect a specific area of the brain, not both sides. It may turn into a generalized seizure if the seizure spreads through the brain. Consciousness may or may not be impaired. The signs and symptoms of these seizures depends on the location of the brain that is affected. Focal seizures usually consist of motor symptoms or sensory symptoms.

* Sensory symptoms: Auras are subjective sensations that occur before focal seizures. Auras include changes in vision, hearing, or smell (an example is smelling rubber). Feelings of deja-vu or abdominal discomfort are also examples of auras. A person who experiences focal weakness of a limb may also have just experienced a focal seizure. This is known as Todd&#x27;s paralysis.
* Motor symptoms: Head turning and eyes moving to one side, with contraction of limbs on one side is a common presentation. Automatisms are also an indicator that a seizure is focal. These are repetitive movements. It can be lip smacking, chewing, swallowing, eyelid fluttering, feet shuffling, or picking movements. Jacksonian March is also a motor presentation of a focal seizure, with contractions spreading from one muscle to the next on one side of the body.

===Generalized seizures===
Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and typically involve both sides of the body. They all involve a loss of consciousness and usually happen without warning. There are six main types of generalized seizures: tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic, myoclonic, absence, and atonic seizures.
* Tonic-clonic seizures, also known as Grand Mal seizures, present with continuous stiffening of the body for 10–20 seconds followed by rhythmic jerking. It may be accompanied by an increase in blood pressure, increase in heart rate, or urinary incontinence. The person may turn blue if breathing is impaired. Shoulder dislocation and tongue biting are also possible.
* Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles. The body stiffens for a prolonged period of time. The muscles most commonly affected are the neck, shoulders, hips, and trunk. 
* Clonic seizures involve jerking of the muscles rhythmically.
* Myoclonic seizures involve short contractions of muscles in either a few areas of the body or through the whole body. They are not typically rhythmic.
* Absence seizures last 10–15 seconds usually. It is characterized by a sudden, brief episode where a person is unaware of what is happening and does not respond. The person stops in the middle of activity. The person often does not fall over. They may return to normal right after the seizure ends, with no postictal state. The person is usually unaware of what just happened.
* Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity causing a person to drop abruptly with their muscles limp. This is called a drop attack.

==Causes==

Seizures have a number of causes. Seizures can be classified into provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures have a cause that is temporary and reversible. They are also known as Acute Symptomatic Seizures as they occur closely after the injury. Unprovoked seizures do not have a known cause or the cause is not reversible. Unprovoked seizures are typically considered epilepsy and treated as epilepsy. Of those who have a seizure, about 25% have epilepsy. Those with epilepsy may have certain triggers that they know cause seizures to occur, including emotional stress, sleep deprivation, and flickering lights.

=== Causes of provoked seizures ===
==== Metabolic ====
Dehydration can trigger epileptic seizures by changing electrolyte balances. Low blood sugar, low blood sodium, high blood sugar, high blood sodium, low blood calcium, high blood urea, and low blood magnesium levels may cause seizures.

==== Medications ====
Up to 9% of status epilepticus cases occur due to drug intoxication. Common drugs involved include antidepressants, stimulants (cocaine), and antihistamines. Withdrawal seizures commonly occur after prolonged alcohol or sedative use. In people who are at risk of developing epileptic seizures, common herbal medicines such as ephedra, ginkgo biloba and wormwood can provoke seizures.

==== Acute infections ====
Systemic infection with high fever is a common cause of seizures, especially in children. These are called febrile seizures and occur in 2–5% of children between the ages of six months and five years. Acute infection of the brain, such as encephalitis or meningitis are also causes of seizures.

==== Acute brain trauma ====
Acute stroke or brain bleed may lead to seizures. Stroke is the most common cause of seizures in the elderly population. Post-stroke seizures occur in 5-7% of those with ischemic strokes. It is higher in those who experienced brain bleeds, with 10-16% risk in those patients. Recent traumatic brain injury may also lead to seizures. 1 to 5 of every 10 people who have had traumatic brain injury have experienced at least one seizure. Seizures may occur within 7 days of the injury (early posttraumatic seizure) or after 7 days have passed (late posttraumatic seizure).

=== Causes of unprovoked seizures ===
==== Structural ====
Space-occupying lesions in the brain (abscesses, tumours) are one cause of unprovoked seizures. In people with brain tumours, the frequency of epilepsy depends on the location of the tumor in the cortical region. Abnormalities in blood vessels of the brain (Arteriovenous malformation) can also cause epilepsy. In babies and children, congenital brain abnormalities, such as lissencephaly or polymicrogyria, will also result in epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborns will also predispose the newborn to epilepsy.

==== Prior brain trauma ====
Strokes, brain bleeds, and traumatic brain injury can all also lead to epilepsy if seizures re-occur. If the first seizure occurs more than 7 days following a stroke, there is a higher chance of the person developing epilepsy. Post-stroke epilepsy accounts for 30%-50% of new epilepsy cases. This is also the case for traumatic brain injury, with 80% of people with late posttraumatic seizures having another seizure occur, classifying it as epilepsy.

==== Prior brain infections ====
Infections of newborns that occur while before or during birth, such as herpes simplex virus, rubella, and cytomegalovirus, all carry a risk of causing epilepsy. Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can cause neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Meningitis and encephalitis also carry the risk of causing long-term epilepsy as well.

==== Genetic epilepsy syndromes ====
During childhood, well-defined epilepsy syndromes are generally seen. Examples include Dravet syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

== Mechanism ==

Neurons function by either being excited or inhibited. Excited neurons fire electrical charges while inhibited neurons are prevented from firing. The balance of the two maintains our central nervous system. In those with seizures, neurons are both hyperexcitable and hypersynchronous, where many neurons fire numerously at the same time. This may be due to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition of neurons.

γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Glutamate are chemicals called neurotransmitters that work by opening or closing ion channels on neurons to cause inhibition or excitability. GABA serves to inhibit neurons from firing. It has been found to be decreased in epilepsy patients. This may explain the lack of inhibition of neurons resulting in seizures. Glutamate serves to excite neurons into firing when appropriate. It was found to be increased in those with epilepsy. This is a possible mechanism for why there is hyper-excitability of neurons in seizures.

Seizures that occur after brain injury may be due to the brain adapting to injury (neuroplasticity). This process is known as epileptogenesis. There is loss of inhibitory neurons because they die due to the injury. The brain may also adapt and make new neuron connections that may be hyper-excitatory.

Brief seizures, such as absence seizures lasting 5–10 seconds, do not cause observable brain damage. More prolonged seizures have a higher risk of neuronal death. Prolonged and recurrent seizures, such as status epilepticus, typically cause brain damage. Scarring of brain tissue (gliosis), neuronal death, and shrinking of areas of the brain (atrophy) are linked to recurrent seizures. These changes may lead to the development of epilepsy.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of seizures involve gathering history, doing a physical exam, and ordering tests. These are done to classify the seizure and determine if the seizure is provoked or unprovoked.

=== History and physical examination ===
Events leading up to the seizure and what movements occurred during the seizure are important in classifying the type of seizure. The person&#x27;s memory of what happened before and during the seizure is also important. However, since most people that experience seizures do not remember what happened, it is best to get history from a witness when possible. Video recording of the seizure is also helpful in diagnosis of seizures. Events that occurred after the seizure are also an important part of the history. Past medical history, such as past head trauma, past strokes, past febrile seizures, or past infections, are helpful. In babies and children, information about developmental milestones, birth history, and previous illnesses are important as potential epilepsy risk factors. Family history of seizures is also important in evaluating risk for epilepsy. History regarding medication use, substance use, and alcohol use is important in determining a cause of the seizure.

Most people are in a postictal state (drowsy or confused) following a seizure. A bite mark on the side of the tongue or bleeding from the mouth strongly indicates a seizure happened. But only a third of people who have had a seizure have such a bite. Weakness of one limb or asymmetric reflexes are also signs a seizure just occurred. Presence of urinary incontinence or fecal incontinence also strongly suggests a seizure occurred. However, most people who have had a seizure will have a normal physical exam.

===Tests===
Blood tests can determine if there are any reversible causes of the seizure (provoked seizures). This includes a complete blood count that may show infection. A comprehensive metabolic panel is ordered to rule out abnormal sugar levels (hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia) or electrolyte abnormalities (such as hyponatremia) as a cause. A lumbar puncture is mainly done if there is reason to believe infection or inflammation of the nervous system is occurring. Toxicology screening is also mainly done if history is suggestive.

Brain imaging by CT scan and MRI is recommended after a first seizure, especially if no provoking factors are discovered. It is done to detect structural problems inside the brain, such as tumors. MRI is generally the better imaging test, but CT scan is preferred when intracranial bleeding is suspected. Imaging may be done at a later point in time in those who return to their normal selves while in the emergency room.

An electroencephalography (EEG) measures the brain&#x27;s electrical activity. It is used in cases of first seizures that have no provoking factor, normal head imaging, and no prior history of head trauma. It will help determine the type of seizure or epilepsy syndrome present, as well as where the seizures are coming from if focal. It is also used when a person has not returned to baseline after a seizure for a prolonged time.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other conditions that commonly get mistaken for a seizure include syncope, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, migraine headaches, and stroke/transient ischemic attacks.

==Prevention==
There are times when a person has never had a seizure but anti-seizure medications are started to prevent seizures in those at risk. Following traumatic brain injury, anti-seizure medications decrease the risk of early seizures but not late seizures. However, there is no clear evidence that anti-seizure medications are effective at preventing seizures following brain surgery (craniotomy), a brain bleed, or after a stroke.

Prevention of seizures from re-occurring after a first seizure depends on many factors. If it was an unprovoked seizure with abnormal brain imaging or abnormal EEG, then it is recommended to start anti-seizure medication. If a person has an unprovoked seizure, but physical exam is normal, EEG is normal, and brain imaging is normal, then anti-seizure medication may not be needed. The decision to start anti-seizure medications should be made after a discussion between the patient and doctor.

In children with one simple febrile seizure, starting anti-seizure medications is not recommended. While both fever medications (antipyretics) and anti-seizure medications reduce reoccurrence, the harmless nature of febrile seizures outweighs the risks of these medications. However, if it was a complex febrile seizure, EEG should be done. If EEG is abnormal, starting prophylactic anti-seizure medications is recommended.

==Management==
During an active seizure, the person seizing should be slowly laid on the floor. Witnesses should not try to stop the convulsions or other movements. Potentially sharp or dangerous objects should be moved from the area around a person experiencing a seizure so that the individual is not hurt. Nothing should be placed in the person&#x27;s mouth as it is a choking hazard. After the seizure, if the person is not fully conscious and alert, they should be turned to their side to prevent choking. This is called recovery position. Timing of the seizure is also important. If a seizure is longer than five minutes, or there are two or more seizures occurring in five minutes, it is a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. Emergency services should be called.

===Medication===
The first line medication for an actively seizing person is a benzodiazepine, with most guidelines recommending lorazepam. Diazepam and midazolam are alternatives. It may be given in IV if emergency services are present. Rectal and intranasal forms also exist if a child has had seizures previously and was prescribed the rescue medication. If seizures continue, second-line therapy includes phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and phenobarbital. Levetiracetam or valproate may also be used.

Starting anti-seizure medications is not typically recommended if it was a provoked seizure that can be corrected. Examples of causes of provoked seizures that can be corrected include low blood sugar, low blood sodium, febrile seizures in children, and substance/medication use. Starting anti-seizure medications is usually for those with medium to high risk of seizures re-occurring. This includes people with unprovoked seizures with abnormal brain imaging or abnormal EEG. It also includes those who have had more than one unprovoked seizure more than 24 hours apart.

It is recommended to start with one anti-seizure medication. Another may be added if one is not enough to control the seizure occurrence. Approximately 70% of people can obtain full control with continuous use of medication. The type of medication used is based on the type of seizure.

Anti-seizure medications may be slowly stopped after a period of time if a person has just experienced one seizure and has not had any more. The decision to stop anti-seizure medications should be discussed between the doctor and patient, weighing the benefits and risks.

===Surgery===
In severe cases where seizures are uncontrolled by at least two anti-seizure medications, brain surgery can be a treatment option. Epilepsy surgery is especially useful for those with focal seizures where the seizures are coming from a specific part of the brain. The amount of brain removed during the surgery depends on the extent of the brain involved in the seizures. It can range from just removing one lobe of the brain (temporal lobectomy) to disconnecting an entire side of the brain (hemispherectomy). The procedure can be curative, where seizures are eliminated. However, if it is not curative, it can be palliative, reducing the frequency of seizures but not eliminating them.

=== Other ===
Helmets may be used to provide protection to the head during a seizure. Some claim that seizure response dogs, a form of service dog, can predict seizures. Evidence for this, however, is poor. Cannabis has also been used for the management of seizures that do not respond to anti-seizure medications. Research on its effectiveness is ongoing, but current research shows that it does reduce seizure frequency. A ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet may help in those who have epilepsy who do not improve following typical treatments, with evidence for its effectiveness growing.

=== Precautions ===
Following a person&#x27;s first seizure, they are legally not allowed to drive until they are seizure-free for a period of time. This period of time varies between states, but is usually between 6 and 12 months. They are also cautioned against working at heights and swimming alone in case a seizure occurs.

==Prognosis==
Following a first unprovoked seizure, the risk of more seizures in the next two years is around 40%. Starting anti-seizure medications reduces recurrence of seizures by 35% within the first two years. The greatest predictors of more seizures are problems either on the EEG or on imaging of the brain. Those with normal EEG and normal physical exam following a first unprovoked seizure had less risk of recurrence in the next two years, with a risk of 25%. In adults, after 6 months of being seizure-free after a first seizure, the risk of a subsequent seizure in the next year is less than 20% regardless of treatment. Those who have a seizure that is provoked have a low risk of re-occurrence, but have a higher risk of death compared to those with epilepsy.

==Epidemiology==
Approximately 8–10% of people will experience an epileptic seizure during their lifetime. In adults, the risk of seizure recurrence within the five years following a new-onset seizure is 35%; the risk rises to 75% in persons who have had a second seizure. In children, the risk of seizure recurrence within the five years following a single unprovoked seizure is about 50%; the risk rises to about 80% after two unprovoked seizures. In the United States in 2011, seizures resulted in an estimated 1.6 million emergency department visits; approximately 400,000 of these visits were for new-onset seizures.

==History==
Epileptic seizures were first described in an Akkadian text from 2000 B.C. Early reports of epilepsy often saw seizures and convulsions as the work of &quot;evil spirits&quot;. The perception of epilepsy, however, began to change in the time of Ancient Greek medicine. The term &quot;epilepsy&quot; itself is a Greek word, which is derived from the verb &quot;epilambanein&quot;, meaning &quot;to seize, possess, or afflict&quot;. Although the Ancient Greeks referred to epilepsy as the &quot;sacred disease&quot;, this perception of epilepsy as a &quot;spiritual&quot; disease was challenged by Hippocrates in his work &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot;, who proposed that the source of epilepsy was from natural causes rather than supernatural ones.

Early surgical treatment of epilepsy was primitive in Ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian medicine. The 19th century saw the rise of targeted surgery for the treatment of epileptic seizures, beginning in 1886 with localized resections performed by Sir Victor Horsley, a neurosurgeon in London. Another advancement was that of the development by the Montreal procedure by Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, which involved use of electrical stimulation among conscious patients to more accurately identify and resect the epileptic areas in the brain.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===

Seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy results in economic costs in Europe of around €15.5 billion in 2004. In India, epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7 billion or 0.5% of the GDP. They make up about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.

==Research==
Scientific work into the prediction of epileptic seizures began in the 1970s. Several techniques and methods have been proposed, but evidence regarding their usefulness is still lacking.

Two promising areas include: (1) gene therapy, and (2) seizure detection and seizure prediction.

Gene therapy for epilepsy consists of employing vectors to deliver pieces of genetic material to areas of the brain involved in seizure onset.

Seizure prediction is a special case of seizure detection in which the developed systems are able to issue a warning before the clinical onset of the epileptic seizure.

Computational neuroscience has been able to bring a new point of view on the seizures by considering the dynamical aspects.

<text>Svenska Akademiens ordlista (, &quot;Word list of the Swedish Academy&quot;), abbreviated SAOL, is a spelling dictionary published every few years by the Swedish Academy. It is a single volume that is considered the final arbiter of Swedish spelling. Traditionally it carries the motto of the Swedish Academy, &quot;Snille och Smak&quot; (&quot;Talent and Taste&quot;), on its blue cloth cover.

Whenever a new edition comes out lively discussions about new and changed entries erupt around the country. In some instances the Academy has been ahead of its times and has later had to change entries back to older spellings. &quot;Jos&quot; – &quot;juice&quot; is probably the most well-known instance. In 2015, the fourteenth edition (containing entries) was published.

== History ==
The history of SAOL is the history of orthography of the Swedish language. While Swedish spelling was an entirely personal business in the Catholic Middle Ages, its gradual standardization (known as Modern Swedish) started in 1526 with the translation of the New testament of the Bible (&quot;Gustav Vasa Bible&quot;), as part of the Lutheran reformation. The edition was revised in 1703, known as the Swedish Bible of Carolus XII. The Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 with the task of caring for Swedish literature and language, including the publication of a grand dictionary. Spelling evolved slowly in the 18th century and was largely based on etymology: for instance, because of its historic relationship to English &quot;heart&quot; and German &quot;Herz&quot;, &quot;hjärta&quot; was spelled &quot;hjerta&quot; in Swedish even though it&#x27;s pronounced ; the word for &quot;woman&quot; (now &quot;kvinna&quot;) was spelled &quot;qvinna&quot;, similar to English &quot;queen&quot;; the question words &quot;hvad&quot;, &quot;hvar&quot;, &quot;hvilken&quot; had a silent H, like English &quot;what&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, &quot;which&quot; still have in most accents. In 1801 the Academy published an official orthography (Carl Gustaf af Leopold, &quot;Afhandling om svenska stafsättet&quot;, 266 pages). A shorter version for schools was published by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, &quot;Svensk Rättstafnings-Lära&quot; in 1829.

Already in the 1750s, voices had been raised to adapt spelling to pronunciation, but this didn&#x27;t resonate with the conservatively minded Academy. Public schools were made mandatory in Sweden by law in 1842 and the influence of school teachers increased, as did the pressure to reform Swedish spelling. The most radical reformists wanted to do away with all silent letters and change the remaining ones to a smaller subset of the alphabet. A similar reform movement for Danish, which at this time was the written language also in Norway, was led by Rasmus Rask (1787–1832) and his follower Niels Matthias Petersen (1791–1862). In 1869 a pan-Scandinavian orthography congress (&quot;Nordiska rättstavningsmötet&quot;) gathered in Stockholm. Secretary for the Swedish section was Artur Hazelius, who in 1871 published the proceedings of the conference. The Academy was not pleased, and as a countermeasure Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800–1877) published the first edition of SAOL in 1874, based on the orthography in Leopold&#x27;s work of 1801. A second edition followed in the same year and new ones in 1875, 1880 and the 5th edition in 1883, without much change.

To further reform, a Swedish orthographic society (&quot;Svenska rättstavningssällskapet&quot;) was formed on November 28, 1885, chaired by linguist Adolf Noreen (1854–1925), and published a journal &quot;Nystavaren. Tidskrift för rättskrivningsfrågor&quot; (4 volumes, 1886–1898, edited by Otto Hoppe). There was continued opposition, not least from Academy member Esaias Tegnér Jr. (1843–1928). However, many of the proposed changes, albeit far from all, were introduced in the 6th edition of SAOL in 1889. Many words spelled with E were changed to Ä (&quot;elf&quot; → &quot;älf&quot;, &quot;hjerta&quot; → &quot;hjärta&quot;, &quot;jern&quot; → &quot;järn&quot;), and under Q it was stated that Q may at will be replaced with K. By a government resolution on November 16, 1889, the spelling used in this edition of SAOL was to be used for teaching in Swedish high schools (&quot;allmänna läroverk&quot;) and teacher colleges (&quot;seminarier&quot;). This was a direct blow against the society&#x27;s own dictionary published in 1886, and reform movement lost much of its momentum. In the 7th edition of SAOL in 1900, many of the old optional forms with Q were dropped.

In 1898, school teachers started to sign mass petitions for further reform. In 1903, the association of Swedish public school teachers (&quot;Sveriges allmänna folkskollärarförening&quot;) requested a government ruling that it &quot;would no longer be considered wrong&quot; (&quot;ej måtte betraktas som fel&quot;) to write TT instead of DT and V instead of F, FV and HV. More associations joined this petition in 1905. A government proposal to this effect was signed on April 7, 1906, by education minister Fridtjuv Berg (1851–1916), and put before the parliament of 1907. A protest against the reform signed by 40,000 concerned citizens was handed to the government in 1908, but had no effect. The liberal Fridtjuv Berg was a former school teacher and one of the founding members of the orthographic society.

The reform of 1906 was the most radical in the history of Swedish orthography. Spelling with dt, fv and hv is now commonly known as &quot;old spelling&quot; (&quot;gammalstavning&quot;). The new spelling was adopted in schools starting in 1907. It was used from the first edition of Selma Lagerlöf&#x27;s geography textbook &quot;Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige&quot; (1906, &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;). The proceedings of the Swedish parliament adopted the new spelling from the year 1913. After endless discussions through the 19th century, a new Swedish Bible translation was finally adopted in 1917, using the new spelling. Sweden&#x27;s largest printed encyclopedia of all times, the 2nd edition of &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; was started in 1904 and used the old spelling through all 38 volumes until 1926. The Academy introduced the new spelling in the 8th edition of SAOL in 1923. The 9th edition appeared in 1950.

In the 10th edition in 1973, the Academy tried to launch new alternative spellings such as &quot;jos&quot; (&quot;juice&quot;), without attracting any significant number of followers. The 11th edition of SAOL appeared in 1986 and the 12th edition in 1998. While the letter Q in the 8th edition only listed the letter Q itself, the 11th edition also listed &quot;quantum satis&quot;, &quot;quenell&quot;, &quot;quilt&quot; and &quot;quisling&quot;.

From the beginning of times, W had in Swedish been considered as a mere decoration of V. In Swedish typography, blackletter (&quot;fraktur&quot;) used W where antiqua used V. With orthographic standardization and spelling reform, W was abandoned except for some proper names and a few loan words such as &quot;whisky&quot;, &quot;wobbler&quot; (also spelled &quot;visky&quot; and &quot;vobbler&quot;), &quot;whist&quot; and &quot;wienerbröd&quot;. In Swedish dictionaries and telephone books, V and W have been sorted as one letter. In the 13th edition of SAOL in 2006, the Academy broke with this tradition, listing W as a letter of its own. This change was sparked by a new influx of loan words such as &quot;webb&quot; (&quot;World Wide Web&quot;).

== History ==
The banker Knut Agathon Wallenberg donated 100 000 SEK in 1903 (Equivalent to around 7 million SEK in 2023) to lobby for founding a business school in Stockholm. Wallenberg considered that &quot;It was important to raise the social status of the merchant class&quot;. Lobbying was necessary because the classical tradition in western thought has a long-standing disdain for commerce, dating back to the ancient Greeks. This disdain was also evident during the Middle Ages, when trade was considered equivalent to theft and seen as a dirty and vulgar occupation. During this time, merchants were known in swedish as: &quot;Krämare&quot;, from the greek chrema (money), were socially scorned, even by the upper class, and were perceived as unproductive individuals solely interested in &quot;making money.&quot;. 

Continuing the lobbying the Wallenberg family also financed a study trip where the doctor in philosophy Helmer Keys set out to travel through Europe to collect data that could motivate the decision to establish a business school. This resulted in the report called &quot;on the centrality of trade-schools (Swedish: Om betydelsen av handelshögskolor&quot;, where Key presented the founding of a business school as both positive and necessary. The report was subsequently used to propagate for the centrality of founding a business school in Stockholm. 

Later on, a circular letter was written where people from the Stockholm Bourgeoisie was offered to pay 400 SEK per year to become initiating members of the school of business association (Handelshögskoleföreningen). In an appendix to a deed of foundation published by the school of business Association, the founding members up to 28 February 1907 are listed. The founders consisted of 109 merchants, 47 bank directors or similar, 26 mill owners or similar, 9 engineers, 16 other city councillors, barons or similar, and three companies. Most of the members were men, but one person was female. Two families were overrepresented, namely the Söderberg and Wallenberg families. The founders were predominantly based in Stockholm, Djursholm, or Saltsjöbaden. However, the academic background among the school&#x27;s founders was almost entirely nonexistent. 

The name &quot;handelshögskola&quot; (roughly &quot;college of commerce&quot;) was a parallel to the German term &quot;Handelshochschule&quot;, used by a number of German institutions started in the years before, commencing with Handelshochschule Leipzig in 1898. The term &quot;högskola&quot; was at this time also established for specialised higher educational institutions outside the universities, such as the Royal Institute of Technology, &quot;(Kungl.) Tekniska högskolan&quot;, which bore that name from 1877. The Stockholm School of Economics was formally founded in 1909 on private initiative as a response to rapid industrialization and a growing need for educated businessmen and company managers and has maintained close ties with the business community ever since.

While founded as a business school, the subject of economics featured prominently in the research and curriculum of the school from the beginning.

The most well known scholars of the Stockholm School of Economics are arguably the economists Eli Heckscher (professor of economics and statistics 1909–1929, professor of economic history 1929–1945), and Bertil Ohlin (professors of economics). Heckscher is also known as the founder of economic history as an independent academic discipline and his work &quot;Svenskt Arbete och Liv&quot; is a fundamental work within this subject.

Ohlin was also a leading figure within the school of doctrine with the same name, the so-called Stockholm school; a group of leading Scandinavian economists influenced by Knut Wicksell, most of them active in Stockholm, either at the Stockholm School of Economics or the Stockholm University College. This school of doctrine was to have a profound influence on post-WWII Swedish economic policy and the development of the modern Scandinavian welfare state. Heckscher and Ohlin jointly developed the so-called &quot;Heckscher–Ohlin theory&quot;, the standard international mathematical model of international trade. Bertil Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1977 (shared with British economist James Meade). Other prominent members of the Stockholm school were the Stockholm University professor Gustav Cassel, who developed standard economic theory of Purchasing power parity and economist Dag Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York City, United States.

== Academics ==

=== Admission ===
For Master programmes, applicants have to have a GMAT score of over 600 and a TOEFL iBT score of over 100 in order to be considered suitable for applying.
In the academic year 2012/2013 the university received 3261 applications for the four Masters programmes which it offered at the time. Therefore, the according acceptance rate would have been low.

=== Grading ===
SSE uses a 5-grading scale which includes the following, Excellent (5.0), Very Good (4.0), Good (3.5), Pass (3.0) and Fail (0.0). A Grade Point Average (GPA) is giving between 3.0 and 5.0. There is also a possibility to obtain an award, Outstanding Achievement, which implies that the student gets at least Excellent as final grade, and that it&#x27;s the first time the student are taking the course. The person responsible for the course have the opportunity to award up to 10% of the students with Outstanding Achievement. The award does not impact the calculation of the student&#x27;s Grade Point Average (GPA). Furthermore, the 10 percent of students with the highest GPA in the BSc programmes who complete the studies on time, that is, no later than three years after they were enrolled, receive the President&#x27;s list award. Completion of studies on time entails having completed all courses in connection with the examination retake period in August at the latest.

== Alumni ==
Stockholm School of Economics (SSE) alumni are defined as previous students that have graduated from one of SSE&#x27;s degree programs. Today, there are some 14 000 alumni in this network. In addition to the alumni are the so-called &quot;SSE IFL Networkers,&quot; previous participants at IFL open or custom programs, these sum up to an additional 10 000.

SSE maintains contacts with its alumni in a number of different ways; both through direct and indirect contacts and through various types of communication channels. Contacts are administered through the &quot;SSE Alumni Office&quot;.

Today, many alumni are involved in the school&#x27;s advisory board, the alumni association&#x27;s board, the Student Association &quot;et al.&quot;, all aligned to SSE activities. Even more alumni return to the School as guest lectures, or sponsors of course projects, as suppliers of internship opportunities, or as recruiters from large companies.

Currently, if an alumnus wishes to connect with another SSE graduate, they have five primary options:
1. Attending the alumni events arranged by SSE Alumni Office
2. Networking through the &quot;SSE Alumninet,&quot; a web portal open to holders of an SSE diploma. Alumninet had some 14 000 members as of January 2013, or through the official LinkedIn groups maintained by SSE
3. Membership in &quot;the Alumni Association of the Stockholm School of Economics&quot; – an alumni association sponsored and organized by alumni for Swedish-speaking graduates of SSE – or by joining &quot;the American Friends of SSE&quot; – an affiliated alumni group, based in the US.
4. Joining any of the unofficial alumni groups and networks, maintained by the alumni themselves, e.g. in the UK.

<text>Stockholm University (SU) () is a public research university in Stockholm, Sweden, founded as a college in 1878, with university status since 1960. With over 33,000 students at four different faculties: law, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, it is one of the largest universities in Scandinavia. 

Stockholm University was granted university status in 1960, making it the fourth oldest Swedish university. As with other public universities in Sweden, Stockholm University&#x27;s mission includes teaching and research anchored in society at large.

==History==
The initiative for the formation of Stockholm University was taken by the Stockholm City Council. The process was completed after a decision in December 1865 regarding the establishment of a fund and a committee to &quot;establish a higher education institution in the capital&quot;. The nine members of the committee were respected and prominent citizens whose work had helped the evolution of science and society.

The next important step was taken in October 1869, when the Stockholm University College Association was established. Several members of the committee became members of the association – including Professor Pehr Henrik Malmsten. The association&#x27;s mission was to establish a college in Stockholm and would &quot;not be dissolved until the college came into being and its future could be considered secure.&quot; The memorandum of the Stockholm University College was adopted in May 1877, and in the autumn semester of the following year, actual operations began.

In 1878, the university college &quot;Stockholms högskola&quot; started its operations with a series of lectures on natural sciences, open to curious citizens (a tradition still upheld by yearly publicly open lectures). Notable in the university&#x27;s early history is the appointment of Sofia Kovalevskaya to hold a chair in the mathematics department in 1889, making her the third female professor in Europe. In 1904 the college became an official degree-granting institution.
In 1960, the college was granted university status, becoming Sweden&#x27;s fourth state university. The university premises were situated in central Stockholm at &quot;Observatorielunden&quot; but increased enrollment resulted in a lack of space, which required the university campus to be shifted to a bigger facility. Since 1970 most of the university operations are located at the main campus at Frescati north of the city center, the former Experimentalfältet, previously used by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry.

==Organisation==
Stockholm University is a state agency and is governed by decisions taken by the government and parliament. The university has the right, within the limits the government provides, to decide on many issues such as their internal organization, educational provision and the admission of students.

===Intra-university bodies===
* &quot;The University Board &quot;is the university&#x27;s highest governing body. The board is responsible for the university&#x27;s mission as a government agency and for following the requirements of laws and regulations. The board reports to the government. It consists of eight external members (including the chairman and vice-chairman), four business representatives from the university with two group deputies and three student representatives (one graduate student representative) with one deputy. The University Board is above the rector who is the head of the agency and has operational responsibility for all operations. The rector has a pro rector to replace him/her if necessary.
* There are two area boards at the university, the &quot;Area board of science&quot; and the &quot;Area board of humanities, law and social sciences&quot;. They are headed by a &quot;vice rector&quot;. The area boards are responsible for strategic planning of education and research, coordination of faculty teaching, research and internal and external collaboration.
* After the area boards, the &quot;faculty boards&quot; are the highest decision-making bodies at the faculty level. The faculty boards consists of the dean, the assistant dean, other business representatives and student representatives. The deans are appointed by the president after proposal by choice within the faculty.
* After faculties, decisions are taken at the departmental level, where each department has a department head who manages and makes decisions together with the &quot;departmental board&quot;.
* The &quot;University administration&quot; is the preparation and service organization for the University Board, rector and other decision-making bodies, and it is led by the executive director. The university administration has a number of units, for example, finance department, IT department, HR department and the student section. There are also units for strategy, planning and communications.
* The &quot;Executive Director&quot; is the most senior official at Stockholm University and decides on matters including the university administration&#x27;s organization and finances.

==Departments, institutes and centers==
Education and research at Stockholm University is carried out within the natural sciences and the humanities/social sciences. Within these fields, there are four faculties with 56 departments, institutes and centers within the humanities, law, natural sciences and social sciences. Research and training also takes place at a number of centers and institutes with a separate governing board, but that organisationally belong to a department.

==Courses and programmes==
 Stockholm University offers courses at both undergraduate and advanced level. There are 190 study programmes in total, including 75 master&#x27;s programmes taught in English, and 1,700 courses to choose from within human science and science. Students can choose between studying one or more free-standing courses, that each may last between five weeks and one semester, or apply for a full study programme. Stockholm university offers 4 Bachelor Programmes taught in English, which are the Bachelor´s Programme in Business, Ethics and Sustainability; Bachelor Programme in Latin America Studies; Bachelor´s Programme in International Business and Politics and the Bachelor´s Programme in Earth Science, Distance Learning.
Besides the programmes themselves, the university also offers opportunities for foreign exchange studies during the third year of a bachelor’s degree programme. The university has cooperative agreements with more than 100 universities worldwide. 

==Research==
The university&#x27;s researchers engage in governmental investigations, are active in the media, provide responses to proposed legislation and are included in several Nobel committees and international expert bodies.

==Field stations==
;Askö Laboratory
Stockholm University Marine Research center (SMF) provides &quot;Askö Laboratory&quot;, where Research on ecosystems, ecology and the impact of human interference is carried out. The field station was built in 1961 by Professor Lars Silén, Head of the Department of Zoology, and is now established as a renowned marine research center.

;Tarfala
Tarfala research station belongs to the Department of Physical Geography. The station is located 1135 meters above sea level in Tarfaladalen, on the east side of Kebnekaise in arctic / alpine surroundings and conducts glaciological, hydrological, meteorological and climatological research. The station has the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 25 people and the staff consists of 2–5 people.

;Tovetorp
Tovetorp Zoological Research Station belongs to the Department of Zoology, and is located about 95 km southwest of Stockholm. It conducts research and training activities in ecology and ethology. Every year Tovetorp is visited by up to 600 students who live and study between 2–10 days on the station. On the research side, over 20 people work today with different research projects. The number of employees are currently 6 people.

==Student unions==
Prior to 2008, Stockholm University had only one student union called Stockholm University Student Union &quot;(Stockholm universitets studentkår, SUS)&quot;. However, since 2008 the computer and system science students and the teacher students have their own, independent, student unions called DISK and &quot;The Teacher&#x27;s College&#x27;s Student Union&quot; &quot;(Lärarhögskolans studentkår)&quot;. The law students also have their own student union, as do journalism students (&quot;Studentkåren vid JMK&quot;).

The future of the Teacher&#x27;s College&#x27;s Student Union is however not entirely safe, as Stockholm University&#x27;s Student Union has declared it will begin talks with the Teacher&#x27;s College&#x27;s Student Union on transferring its members to it, as it already has a teacher&#x27;s division. In contrast to common belief, DISK is not an abbreviation.

Within Frescati, the areas Albano, the Bergius Botanical Garden, Frescati Backe, Frescati Hage, Kräftriket, Lilla Frescati and Sveaplan are located. The names of many of these areas have a history dating back to the late 1700s. After Gustav III&#x27;s trip to Italy in 1783–84, several places at Brunnsviken were given Italian names. Stockholm University has another campus in Kista, which houses the Department of computer and systems sciences.

<text>Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, the territorial police force responsible for policing Greater London&#x27;s 32 boroughs. Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had its main public entrance on the Westminster street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance, and over time &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; came to be used not only as the common name of the headquarters building, but also as a metonym for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) itself and police officers, especially detectives, who serve in it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York&#x27;s financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London.

The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name &quot;New Scotland Yard&quot; was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967 the MPS consolidated its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed &quot;New Scotland Yard&quot; building on Broadway in nearby Victoria. In 2013, it was announced that the force would move again to the Victoria Embankment at Westminster&#x27;s Curtis Green Building, which following tradition was renamed &quot;New Scotland Yard&quot;. This move to the latest New Scotland Yard was completed in 2016.

==History==
The Metropolitan Police Service is responsible for law enforcement within Greater London, excluding the square mile of the City of London, which is covered by the City of London Police, and also excluding the London Underground and National Rail networks, which are the responsibility of the British Transport Police.

===4 Whitehall Place===
The Metropolitan Police was formed by Robert Peel with the implementation of the Metropolitan Police Act, passed by Parliament in 1829. Peel, with the help of Eugène-François Vidocq, selected the original site on Whitehall Place for the new police headquarters. The first two commissioners, Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, along with various police officers and staff, occupied the building. Previously a private house, 4 Whitehall Place () backed onto a street called Great Scotland Yard.

This building was acquired by hypermarkets operator Lulu Group International in 2015 and redeveloped into a luxury hotel, operated by Hyatt, which opened in December 2019.

===Victoria Embankment===

By 1887, the Metropolitan Police headquarters had expanded from 4 Whitehall Place into several neighbouring addresses, including 3, 5, 21 and 22 Whitehall Place; 8 and 9 Great Scotland Yard, and several stables. Eventually, the service outgrew its original site, and new headquarters designed by architect Richard Norman Shaw were built () on the Victoria Embankment, overlooking the River Thames, south of what is now the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s headquarters. In 1888, during the construction of the new building, workers discovered the dismembered torso of a female; the case, known as the &#x27;Whitehall Mystery&#x27;, was never solved. In 1890, police headquarters moved to the new location, which was named New Scotland Yard. By this time, the Metropolitan Police had grown from its initial 1,000 officers to about 13,000 and needed more administrative staff and a bigger headquarters. Further increases in the size and responsibilities of the force required even more administrators and space. Therefore, new buildings were constructed and completed in 1906 and 1940, so that New Scotland Yard became a three-building complex. (). The first two buildings are now a Grade I listed structure known as the Norman Shaw Buildings.

The original building at 4 Whitehall Place still has a rear entrance on Great Scotland Yard. Stables for some of the mounted branch still stand at 7 Great Scotland Yard, across the street from the first headquarters.

===10 Broadway===

The headquarters of the Metropolitan Police were moved to 8–10 Broadway in 1967, in a new building constructed on a site that also bordered onto Victoria Street.

In 2008, the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) bought the freehold of 10 Broadway for around £120 million.

10 Broadway was sold to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group in December 2014 for £370 million, and redevelopment plans for a six-building, mixed-use development were approved in February 2016. Ownership was officially passed from the MPA to the Abu Dhabi Financial Group when the relocation was completed on 31 October 2016; the building began demolition later that year.

===Current location===
In May 2013, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that the New Scotland Yard building on Broadway would be sold and the force&#x27;s headquarters would be moved back to the Curtis Green Building on the Victoria Embankment. A competition was announced for architects to redesign the building prior to the Metropolitan Police moving to it in 2015. This building previously housed the Territorial Policing headquarters and is adjacent to the original New Scotland Yard (Norman Shaw North Building).
In December 2015, construction work on the exterior of the Curtis Green building was completed. On 31 October 2016, the Metropolitan Police staff left the building at 10 Broadway and moved to their new headquarters. The new New Scotland Yard building was to have been opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 23 March 2017, but that same day it was announced that the Royal opening would be postponed, due to the preceding day&#x27;s terrorist attack at Westminster. The opening was re-arranged for 13 July 2017. Like all three of its predecessors it houses the Met&#x27;s Crime Museum (formerly known as the Black Museum), founded in 1874, a collection of criminal memorabilia not open to the public.

==Popular culture==
Scotland Yard has appeared in books, films, and television since the Victorian era when it featured in the Jack the Ripper cases and the stories of Sherlock Holmes. Wilkie Collins&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), a tale of a Scotland Yard Detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the police procedural genre. In Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s gothic novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), Inspector Newcomen, a Scotland Yard Detective, explores Hyde&#x27;s loft in Soho and discovers evidence of his depraved life.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1929 thriller film &quot;Blackmail&quot; (widely considered the first British &quot;talkie&quot;) features a Scotland Yard Detective Frank Webber (played by John Longden). 

Scotland Yard appears in the 1972 episode of Columbo, &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;. Columbo visits Scotland Yard to study the investigative techniques they use in London before becoming involved as a consultant for a murder case.

In Monty Python&#x27;s 1969 comedy sketch &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot;, Graham Chapman plays a Scotland Yard Inspector who leaves the house with the joke in hand before dying from laughter.

Scotland Yard as also appeared in the Professor Layton series as supporting characters, which Layton helped them in solving many cases. Inspector Chelmey and Constable Barton are the most appearing of Scotland Yard&#x27;s members.

New Scotland Yard has also appeared in the movie &quot;V For Vendetta&quot; and the video game &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot; as the primary hub for the private military police force, Albion.

Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s &quot;William Warwick&quot; series, starting with &quot;Nothing Ventured&quot; in 2019, follows William Warwick, the protagonist&#x27;s rise from a detective constable to senior ranks within Scotland Yard.

<doc id="27159" wikidata="Q4653" url="?curid=27159" title="Sherlock Holmes">
<text>Sherlock Holmes () is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. Referring to himself as a &quot;consulting detective&quot; in his stories, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.

The character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887&#x27;s &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;. His popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, beginning with &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes&#x27;s friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.

Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best-known. By the 1990s, over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions, and publications had featured the detective, and &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists him as the most portrayed human literary character in film and television history. Holmes&#x27;s popularity and fame are such that many have believed him to be not a fictional character but an actual individual; numerous literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories helped create the modern practice of fandom. The character and stories have had a profound and lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales, as well as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle, being adapted into stage and radio plays, television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years.

==Inspiration for the character==
Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction and served as the prototype for many later characters, including Holmes. Conan Doyle once wrote, &quot;Each [of Poe&#x27;s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed ... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?&quot; Similarly, the stories of Émile Gaboriau&#x27;s Monsieur Lecoq were extremely popular at the time Conan Doyle began writing Holmes, and Holmes&#x27;s speech and behaviour sometimes follow those of Lecoq. Doyle has his main characters discuss these literary antecedents near the beginning of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, which is set soon after Watson is first introduced to Holmes. Watson attempts to compliment Holmes by comparing him to Dupin, to which Holmes replies that he found Dupin to be &quot;a very inferior fellow&quot; and Lecoq to be &quot;a miserable bungler&quot;.

Conan Doyle repeatedly said that Holmes was inspired by the real-life figure of Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, whom Conan Doyle met in 1877 and had worked for as a clerk. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing broad conclusions from minute observations. However, he later wrote to Conan Doyle: &quot;You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it&quot;. Sir Henry Littlejohn, Chair of Medical Jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, is also cited as an inspiration for Holmes. Littlejohn, who was also Police Surgeon and Medical Officer of Health in Edinburgh, provided Conan Doyle with a link between medical investigation and the detection of crime.

Other possible inspirations have been proposed, though never acknowledged by Doyle, such as &quot;Maximilien Heller&quot;, by French author Henry Cauvain. In this 1871 novel (sixteen years before the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes), Henry Cauvain imagined a depressed, anti-social, opium-smoking polymath detective, operating in Paris. It is not known if Conan Doyle read the novel, but he was fluent in French. 

== Biography ==

===Family and early life===
Details of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; life in Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories are scarce and often vague. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.

A statement of Holmes&#x27; age in &quot;His Last Bow&quot; places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned, although Holmes mentions that his &quot;ancestors&quot; were &quot;country squires&quot;. In &quot;The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter&quot;, he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes&#x27; brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. Sherlock describes his brother as the more intelligent of the two, but notes that Mycroft lacks any interest in physical investigation, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.

Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from his fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate&#x27;s father led him to adopt detection as a profession.

===Life with Watson===
In the first Holmes tale, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London. Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs. Hudson. Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen of those years. Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson&#x27;s point of view, as summaries of the detective&#x27;s most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson&#x27;s records of Holmes&#x27;s cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report the &quot;science&quot; of his craft:

Nevertheless, when Holmes recorded a case himself, he was forced to concede that he could more easily understand the need to write it in a manner that would appeal to the public rather than his intention to focus on his own technical skill.

Holmes&#x27;s friendship with Watson is his most significant relationship. When Watson is injured by a bullet, although the wound turns out to be &quot;quite superficial&quot;, Watson is moved by Holmes&#x27;s reaction:

After confirming Watson&#x27;s assessment of the wound, Holmes makes it clear to their opponent that the man would not have left the room alive if he genuinely had killed Watson.

=== Practice ===
Holmes&#x27; clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select professional circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard. However, his continued work and the publication of Watson&#x27;s stories raise Holmes&#x27;s profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police that, Watson writes, by 1887 &quot;Europe was ringing with his name&quot; and by 1895 Holmes has &quot;an immense practice&quot;. Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby. A British prime minister and the King of Bohemia visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes&#x27;s assistance; the President of France awards him the Legion of Honour for capturing an assassin; the King of Scandinavia is a client; and he aids the Vatican at least twice. The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times and declines a knighthood &quot;for services which may perhaps some day be described&quot;. However, he does not actively seek fame and is usually content to let the police take public credit for his work.

===The Great Hiatus===
The first set of Holmes stories was published between 1887 and 1893. Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in a final battle with the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; (published 1893, but set in 1891), as Conan Doyle felt that &quot;my literary energies should not be directed too much into one channel&quot;. However, the reaction of the public surprised him very much. Distressed readers wrote anguished letters to &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, which suffered a terrible blow when 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the magazine in protest. Conan Doyle himself received many protest letters, and one lady even began her letter with &quot;You brute&quot;. Legend has it that Londoners were so distraught upon hearing the news of Holmes&#x27;s death that they wore black armbands in mourning, though there is no known contemporaneous source for this; the earliest known reference to such events comes from 1949. However, the recorded public reaction to Holmes&#x27;s death was unlike anything previously seen for fictional events.

After resisting public pressure for eight years, Conan Doyle wrote &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (serialised in 1901–02, with an implicit setting before Holmes&#x27;s death). In 1903, Conan Doyle wrote &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;; set in 1894, Holmes reappears, explaining to a stunned Watson that he had faked his death to fool his enemies. Following &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, Conan Doyle would sporadically write new Holmes stories until 1927.
Holmes aficionados refer to the period from 1891 to 1894—between his disappearance and presumed death in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; and his reappearance in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;—as the Great Hiatus. The earliest known use of this expression dates to 1946.

===Retirement===
In &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, the reader is told that Holmes has retired to a small farm on the Sussex Downs and taken up beekeeping as his primary occupation. The move is not dated precisely, but can be presumed to be no later than 1904 (since it is referred to retrospectively in &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;, first published that year). The story features Holmes and Watson coming out of retirement to aid the British war effort. Only one other adventure, &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, takes place during the detective&#x27;s retirement.

==Personality and habits==
Watson describes Holmes as &quot;bohemian&quot; in his habits and lifestyle. Said to have a &quot;cat-like&quot; love of personal cleanliness, at the same time Holmes is an eccentric with no regard for contemporary standards of tidiness or good order. Watson describes him as

While Holmes is characterised as dispassionate and cold, he can be animated and excitable during an investigation. He has a flair for showmanship, often keeping his methods and evidence hidden until the last possible moment so as to impress observers. Holmes is willing to break the law as a means for righting a wrong, contending that &quot;there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify private revenge.&quot; His companion condones the detective&#x27;s willingness to do this on behalf of a client—lying to the police, concealing evidence or breaking into houses—when he also feels it morally justifiable.

Except for that of Watson, Holmes avoids casual company. In &quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot;, he tells the doctor that during two years at college he made only one friend: &quot;I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson ... I never mixed much with the men of my year.&quot; The detective goes without food at times of intense intellectual activity, believing that &quot;the faculties become refined when you starve them&quot;. At times, Holmes relaxes with music, either playing the violin or enjoying the works of composers such as Wagner and Pablo de Sarasate.

===Drug use===
Holmes occasionally uses addictive drugs, especially in the absence of stimulating cases. He sometimes uses morphine and sometimes cocaine, the latter of which he injects in a seven-percent solution; both drugs were legal in 19th-century England. As a physician, Watson strongly disapproves of his friend&#x27;s cocaine habit, describing it as the detective&#x27;s only vice, and concerned about its effect on Holmes&#x27;s mental health and intellect. In &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot;, Watson says that although he has &quot;weaned&quot; Holmes from drugs, the detective remains an addict whose habit is &quot;not dead, but merely sleeping&quot;.

Watson and Holmes both use tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Although his chronicler does not consider Holmes&#x27;s smoking a vice &quot;per se&quot;, Watson—a physician—does criticise the detective for creating a &quot;poisonous atmosphere&quot; in their confined quarters.

===Finances===
Holmes is known to charge clients for his expenses and claim any reward offered for a problem&#x27;s solution, such as in &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet&quot;. The detective states at one point that &quot;My professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether.&quot; In this context, a client is offering to double his fee, and it is implied that wealthy clients habitually pay Holmes more than his standard rate. In &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot;, Holmes earns a £6,000 fee (at a time where annual expenses for a rising young professional were in the area of £500). However, Watson notes that Holmes would refuse to help even the wealthy and powerful if their cases did not interest him.

===Attitudes towards women===
As Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, &quot;Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage&#x27;s Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love.&quot; Holmes says of himself that he is &quot;not a whole-souled admirer of womankind&quot;, and that he finds &quot;the motives of women ... inscrutable. ... How can you build on such quicksand? Their most trivial actions may mean volumes&quot;. In &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, he says, &quot;Women are never to be entirely trusted—not the best of them&quot;, a feeling Watson notes as an &quot;atrocious sentiment&quot;. In &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, Holmes writes, &quot;Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my heart.&quot; At the end of &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, Holmes states that &quot;love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true, cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgement.&quot; Ultimately, Holmes claims outright that &quot;I have never loved.&quot;

But while Watson says that the detective has an &quot;aversion to women&quot;, he also notes Holmes as having &quot;a peculiarly ingratiating way with [them]&quot;. Watson notes that their housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is fond of Holmes because of his &quot;remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women. He disliked and distrusted the sex, but he was always a chivalrous opponent.&quot; However, in &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, the detective becomes engaged under false pretenses in order to obtain information about a case, abandoning the woman once he has the information he requires.

====Irene Adler====
Irene Adler is a retired American opera singer and actress who appears in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. Although this is her only appearance, she is one of only a handful of people who bests Holmes in a battle of wits, and the only woman. For this reason, Adler is the frequent subject of pastiche writing. The beginning of the story describes the high regard in which Holmes holds her:

Five years before the story&#x27;s events, Adler had a brief liaison with Crown Prince of Bohemia Wilhelm von Ormstein. As the story opens, the Prince is engaged to another. Fearful that the marriage would be called off if his fiancée&#x27;s family learns of this past impropriety, Ormstein hires Holmes to regain a photograph of Adler and himself. Adler slips away before Holmes can succeed. Her memory is kept alive by the photograph of Adler that Holmes received for his part in the case.

==Knowledge and skills==
Shortly after meeting Holmes in the first story, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (generally assumed to be 1881, though the exact date is not given), Watson assesses the detective&#x27;s abilities:

In &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Holmes claims to be unaware that the Earth revolves around the Sun since such information is irrelevant to his work; after hearing that fact from Watson, he says he will immediately try to forget it. The detective believes that the mind has a finite capacity for information storage, and learning useless things reduces one&#x27;s ability to learn useful things. The later stories move away from this notion: in &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, he says, &quot;All knowledge comes useful to the detective&quot;, and in &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, the detective calls himself &quot;an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for trifles&quot;. Looking back on the development of the character in 1912, Conan Doyle wrote that &quot;In the first one, the &quot;Study in Scarlet&quot;, [Holmes] was a mere calculating machine, but I had to make him more of an educated human being as I went on with him.&quot;

Despite Holmes&#x27;s supposed ignorance of politics, in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; he immediately recognises the true identity of the disguised &quot;Count von Kramm&quot;. At the end of &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Holmes demonstrates a knowledge of Latin. The detective cites Hafez, Goethe, as well as a letter from Gustave Flaubert to George Sand in the original French. In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, the detective recognises works by Godfrey Kneller and Joshua Reynolds: &quot;Watson won&#x27;t allow that I know anything of art, but that is mere jealousy since our views upon the subject differ.&quot; In &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;, Watson says that &quot;Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus&quot;, considered &quot;the last word&quot; on the subject — which must have been the result of an intensive and very specialized musicological study with no obvious application to the solution of criminal mysteries.

Holmes is a cryptanalyst, telling Watson that &quot;I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writing, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject, in which I analyse one hundred and sixty separate ciphers.&quot; Holmes also demonstrates a knowledge of psychology in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, luring Irene Adler into betraying where she hid a photograph based on the premise that a woman will rush to save her most valued possession from a fire. Another example is in &quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot;, where Holmes obtains information from a salesman with a wager: &quot;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the &#x27;Pink &#x27;un&#x27; protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet ... I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager.&quot;

Maria Konnikova points out in an interview with D. J. Grothe that Holmes practises what is now called mindfulness, concentrating on one thing at a time, and almost never &quot;multitasks&quot;. She adds that in this he predates the science showing how helpful this is to the brain.

===Holmesian deduction===
Holmes observes the dress and attitude of his clients and suspects, noting skin marks (such as tattoos), contamination (such as ink stains or clay on boots), emotional state, and physical condition in order to deduce their origins and recent history. The style and state of wear of a person&#x27;s clothes and personal items are also commonly relied on; in the stories, Holmes is seen applying his method to items such as walking sticks, pipes, and hats. For example, in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, Holmes infers that Watson had got wet lately and had &quot;a most clumsy and careless servant girl&quot;. When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, the detective answers:

In the first Holmes story, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Dr. Watson compares Holmes to C. Auguste Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s fictional detective, who employed a similar methodology. Alluding to an episode in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, where Dupin determines what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: &quot;That trick of his breaking in on his friend&#x27;s thoughts with an apropos remark ... is really very showy and superficial.&quot; Nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same &#x27;trick&#x27; on Watson in &quot;The Cardboard Box&quot; and &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot;.

Though the stories always refer to Holmes&#x27;s intellectual detection method as &quot;deduction&quot;, Holmes primarily relies on abduction: inferring an explanation for observed details. &quot;From a drop of water,&quot; he writes, &quot;a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.&quot; However, Holmes does employ deductive reasoning as well. The detective&#x27;s guiding principle, as he says in &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, is: &quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.&quot;

Holmes follows Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s rule of &quot;hypotheses non fingo&quot;, for instance commenting in &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;: &quot;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.&quot; 

Despite Holmes&#x27;s remarkable reasoning abilities, Conan Doyle still paints him as fallible in this regard (this being a central theme of &quot;The Yellow Face&quot;).

===Forensic science===
Though Holmes is famed for his reasoning capabilities, his investigative technique relies heavily on the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he employs in the stories were at the time in their infancy.

The detective is particularly skilled in the analysis of trace evidence and other physical evidence, including latent prints (such as footprints, hoof prints, and shoe and tire impressions) to identify actions at a crime scene, using tobacco ashes and cigarette butts to identify criminals, utilizing handwriting analysis and graphology, comparing typewritten letters to expose a fraud, using gunpowder residue to expose two murderers, and analyzing small pieces of human remains to expose two murders.

Because of the small scale of much of his evidence, the detective often uses a magnifying glass at the scene and an optical microscope at his Baker Street lodgings. He uses analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis and toxicology to detect poisons; Holmes&#x27;s home chemistry laboratory is mentioned in &quot;The Naval Treaty&quot;. Ballistics feature in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; when spent bullets are recovered to be matched with a suspected murder weapon, a practice which became regular police procedure only some fifteen years after the story was published.

Laura J. Snyder has examined Holmes&#x27;s methods in the context of mid- to late-19th-century criminology, demonstrating that, while sometimes in advance of what official investigative departments were formally using at the time, they were based upon existing methods and techniques. For example, fingerprints were proposed to be distinct in Conan Doyle&#x27;s day, and while Holmes used a thumbprint to solve a crime in &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot; (generally held to be set in 1895), the story was published in 1903, two years after Scotland Yard&#x27;s fingerprint bureau opened. Though the effect of the Holmes stories on the development of forensic science has thus often been overstated, Holmes inspired future generations of forensic scientists to think scientifically and analytically.

===Disguises===
Holmes displays a strong aptitude for acting and disguise. In several stories (&quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; and &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;), to gather evidence undercover, he uses disguises so convincing that Watson fails to recognise him. In others (&quot;The Adventure of the Dying Detective&quot; and &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;), Holmes feigns injury or illness to incriminate the guilty. In the latter story, Watson says, &quot;The stage lost a fine actor ... when [Holmes] became a specialist in crime.&quot;

Guy Mankowski has said of Holmes that his ability to change his appearance to blend into any situation &quot;helped him personify the idea of the English eccentric chameleon, in a way that prefigured the likes of David Bowie&quot;.

===Agents===
Until Watson&#x27;s arrival at Baker Street, Holmes largely worked alone, only occasionally employing agents from the city&#x27;s underclass. These agents included a variety of informants, such as Langdale Pike, a &quot;human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal&quot;, and Shinwell Johnson, who acted as Holmes&#x27;s &quot;agent in the huge criminal underworld of London&quot;. The best known of Holmes&#x27;s agents are a group of street children he called &quot;the Baker Street Irregulars&quot;.

===Combat===
====Pistols====
Holmes and Watson often carry pistols with them to confront criminals—in Watson&#x27;s case, his old service weapon (probably a Mark III Adams revolver, issued to British troops during the 1870s). Holmes and Watson shoot the eponymous hound in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, and in &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, Watson pistol-whips Colonel Sebastian Moran. In &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;, Holmes uses Watson&#x27;s revolver to solve the case through an experiment.

====Other weapons====
As a gentleman, Holmes often carries a stick or cane. He is described by Watson as an expert at singlestick, and uses his cane twice as a weapon. In &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, Watson describes Holmes as an expert swordsman, and in &quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot;, the detective says he practised fencing while at university. In several stories (&quot;A Case of Identity&quot;, &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Six Napoleons&quot;), Holmes wields a riding crop, described in the latter story as his &quot;favourite weapon&quot;.

====Personal combat====

The detective is described (or demonstrated) as possessing above-average physical strength. In &quot;The Yellow Face&quot;, Holmes&#x27;s chronicler says, &quot;Few men were capable of greater muscular effort.&quot; In &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, Dr. Roylott demonstrates his strength by bending a fire poker in half. Watson describes Holmes as laughing and saying, If he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.&#x27; As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.&quot;

Holmes is an adept bare-knuckle fighter; &quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot; mentions that Holmes boxed while at university. In &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, he introduces himself to McMurdo, a prize fighter, as &quot;the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison&#x27;s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back&quot;. McMurdo remembers: &quot;Ah, you&#x27;re one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy.&quot; In &quot;The Yellow Face&quot;, Watson says: &quot;He was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen.&quot; In &quot;The Solitary Cyclist&quot;, Holmes visits a country pub to make enquiries regarding a certain Mr Woodley which results in violence. Mr Woodley, Holmes tells Watson,

Another character subsequently refers to Mr Woodley as looking &quot;much disfigured&quot; as a result of his encounter with Holmes.

In &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, Holmes tells Watson that he used a Japanese martial art known as baritsu to fling Moriarty to his death in the Reichenbach Falls. &quot;Baritsu&quot; is Conan Doyle&#x27;s version of bartitsu, which combines jujitsu with boxing and cane fencing.

==Reception==
===Popularity===

The first two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887) and &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot; (1890), were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six short stories featuring the character were published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. Holmes became widely known in Britain and America. The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed Holmes in the short story &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, the strongly negative response from readers was unlike any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The &quot;Strand&quot; reportedly lost more than 20,000 subscribers as a result of Holmes&#x27;s death. Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903. In Japan, Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;) became immensely popular in the country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.

Many fans of Sherlock Holmes have written letters to Holmes&#x27;s address, 221B Baker Street. Though the address 221B Baker Street did not exist when the stories were first published, letters began arriving to the large Abbey National building which first encompassed that address almost as soon as it was built in 1932. Fans continue to send letters to Sherlock Holmes; these letters are now delivered to the Sherlock Holmes Museum. Some of the people who have sent letters to 221B Baker Street believe Holmes is real. Members of the general public have also believed Holmes actually existed. In a 2008 survey of British teenagers, 58 per cent of respondents believed that Sherlock Holmes was a real individual. 

Some scholarly discussion of Holmes has occasionally been written (usually facetiously) from the perspective of Holmes and Dr. Watson having existed; an example of this are the five critical essays, &quot;Studies in Sherlock Holmes&quot;, by the author and essayist Dorothy L. Sayers in her 1946 non-fiction collection, &quot;Unpopular Opinions&quot;, including an article examining Watson&#x27;s &quot;signature&quot; which was allegedly visible in some original &quot;Strand&quot; illustrations.

The Sherlock Holmes stories continue to be widely read. Holmes&#x27;s continuing popularity has led to many reimaginings of the character in adaptations. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, which awarded Sherlock Holmes the title for &quot;most portrayed literary human character in film &amp; TV&quot; in 2012, released a statement saying that the title &quot;reflects his enduring appeal and demonstrates that his detective talents are as compelling today as they were 125 years ago&quot;.

===Honours===
The London Metropolitan Railway named one of its twenty electric locomotives deployed in the 1920s for Sherlock Holmes. He was the only fictional character so honoured, along with eminent Britons such as Lord Byron, Benjamin Disraeli, and Florence Nightingale.

A number of London streets are associated with Holmes. York Mews South, off Crawford Street, was renamed Sherlock Mews, and Watson&#x27;s Mews is near Crawford Place. The Sherlock Holmes is a public house in Northumberland Street in London which contains a large collection of memorabilia related to Holmes, the original collection having been put together for display in Baker Street during the Festival of Britain in 1951.

In 2002, the Royal Society of Chemistry bestowed an honorary fellowship on Holmes for his use of forensic science and analytical chemistry in popular literature, making him (as of 2024) the only fictional character thus honoured. Holmes has been commemorated numerous times on UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their August 2020 series to celebrate the &quot;Sherlock&quot; television series.

There are multiple statues of Sherlock Holmes around the world. The first, sculpted by John Doubleday, was unveiled in Meiringen, Switzerland, in September 1988. The second was unveiled in October 1988 in Karuizawa, Japan, and was sculpted by Yoshinori Satoh. The third was installed in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1989, and was sculpted by Gerald Laing. In 1999, a statue of Sherlock Holmes in London, also by John Doubleday, was unveiled near the fictional detective&#x27;s address, 221B Baker Street. In 2001, a sculpture of Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle by Irena Sedlecká was unveiled in a statue collection in Warwickshire, England. A sculpture depicting both Holmes and Watson was unveiled in 2007 in Moscow, Russia, based partially on Sidney Paget&#x27;s illustrations and partially on the actors in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;. In 2015, a sculpture of Holmes by Jane DeDecker was installed in the police headquarters of Edmond, Oklahoma, United States. In 2019, a statue of Holmes was unveiled in Chester, Illinois, United States, as part of a series of statues honouring cartoonist E. C. Segar and his characters. The statue is titled &quot;Sherlock &amp; Segar&quot;, and the face of the statue was modelled on Segar.

===Societies===

In 1934, the Sherlock Holmes Society (in London) and the Baker Street Irregulars (in New York) were founded. The latter is still active. The Sherlock Holmes Society was dissolved later in the 1930s, but was succeeded by a society with a slightly different name, the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951 and remains active. These societies were followed by many more, first in the US (where they are known as &quot;scion societies&quot;—offshoots—of the Baker Street Irregulars) and then in England and Denmark. There are at least 250 societies worldwide, including Australia, Canada (such as The Bootmakers of Toronto), India, and Japan. Fans tend to be called &quot;Holmesians&quot; in the UK and &quot;Sherlockians&quot; in the US, though recently &quot;Sherlockian&quot; has also come to refer to fans of the Benedict Cumberbatch-led BBC series regardless of location.

==Legacy==
===The detective story===

Although Holmes is not the original fictional detective, his name has become synonymous with the role. Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories introduced multiple literary devices that have become major conventions in detective fiction, such as the companion character who is not as clever as the detective and has solutions explained to him (thus informing the reader as well), as with Dr. Watson in the Holmes stories. Other conventions introduced by Doyle include the arch-criminal who is too clever for the official police to defeat, like Holmes&#x27;s adversary Professor Moriarty, and the use of forensic science to solve cases.

The Sherlock Holmes stories established crime fiction as a respectable genre popular with readers of all backgrounds, and Doyle&#x27;s success inspired many contemporary detective stories. Holmes influenced the creation of other &quot;eccentric gentleman detective&quot; characters, like Agatha Christie&#x27;s fictional detective Hercule Poirot, introduced in 1920. Holmes also inspired a number of anti-hero characters &quot;almost as an antidote to the masterful detective&quot;, such as the gentleman thief characters A. J. Raffles (created by E. W. Hornung in 1898) and Arsène Lupin (created by Maurice Leblanc in 1905).

===&quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot;===
The phrase &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot; has become one of the most quoted and iconic aspects of the character. However, although Holmes often observes that his conclusions are &quot;elementary&quot;, and occasionally calls Watson &quot;my dear Watson&quot;, the phrase &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot; is never uttered in any of the sixty stories by Conan Doyle. One of the nearest approximations of the phrase appears in &quot;The Adventure of the Crooked Man&quot; (1893) when Holmes explains a deduction: Excellent!&#x27; I cried. &#x27;Elementary,&#x27; said he.&quot;

William Gillette is widely considered to have originated the phrase with the formulation, &quot;Oh, this is elementary, my dear fellow&quot;, allegedly in his 1899 play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. However, the script was revised numerous times over the course of some three decades of revivals and publications, and the phrase is present in some versions of the script, but not others. The appearance of the line &quot;Elementary, my dear Potson&quot; in a Sherlock Holmes parody from 1901 has led some authors to speculate that, rather than this being an incidental formulation, the parodist drew upon an already well-established occurrences of &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson.&quot;

The exact phrase, as well as close variants, can be seen in newspaper and journal articles as early as 1909. It was also used by P. G. Wodehouse in his novel &quot;Psmith, Journalist&quot;, which was first serialised in &quot;The Captain&quot; magazine between October 1909 and February 1910; the phrase occurred in the January 1910 instalment. The phrase became familiar with the American public in part due to its use in the Rathbone-Bruce series of films from 1939 to 1946.

===The Great Game===

Conan Doyle&#x27;s 56 short stories and four novels are known as the &quot;canon&quot; by Holmes aficionados. The Great Game (also known as the Holmesian Game, the Sherlockian Game, or simply the Game, also the Higher Criticism) applies the methods of literary and especially Biblical criticism to the canon, operating on the pretense that Holmes and Watson were real people and that Conan Doyle was not the author of the stories but Watson&#x27;s literary agent. From this basis, it attempts to resolve or explain away contradictions in the canon—such as the location of Watson&#x27;s war wound, described as being in his shoulder in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; and in his leg in &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;—and clarify details about Holmes, Watson and their world, such as the exact dates of events in the stories, combining historical research with references from the stories to construct scholarly analyses.

For example, one detail analyzed in the Game is Holmes&#x27;s birth date. The chronology of the stories is notoriously difficult, with many stories lacking dates and many others containing contradictory ones. Christopher Morley and William Baring-Gould contend that the detective was born on 6 January 1854, the year being derived from the statement in &quot;His Last Bow&quot; that he was 60 years of age in 1914, while the precise day is derived from broader, non-canonical speculation. This is the date the Baker Street Irregulars work from, with their annual dinner being held each January. Laurie R. King instead argues that details in &quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot; (a story with no precise internal date) indicate that Holmes finished his second (and final) year of university in 1880 or 1885. If he began university at age 17, his birth year could be as late as 1868.

===Museums and special collections===
For the 1951 Festival of Britain, Holmes&#x27;s living room was reconstructed as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition, with a collection of original material. After the festival, items were transferred to The Sherlock Holmes (a London pub) and the Conan Doyle collection housed in Lucens, Switzerland, by the author&#x27;s son, Adrian. Both exhibitions, each with a Baker Street sitting-room reconstruction, are open to the public.

In 1969, the Toronto Reference Library began a collection of materials related to Conan Doyle. Stored today in Room 221B, this vast collection is accessible to the public. Similarly, in 1974 the University of Minnesota founded a collection that is now &quot;the world&#x27;s largest gathering of material related to Sherlock Holmes and his creator&quot;. Access is closed to the general public, but is occasionally open to tours.

In 1990, the Sherlock Holmes Museum opened on Baker Street in London, followed the next year by a museum in Meiringen (near the Reichenbach Falls) dedicated to the detective. A private Conan Doyle collection is a permanent exhibit at the Portsmouth City Museum, where the author lived and worked as a physician.

===Postcolonial criticism===

The Sherlock Holmes stories have been scrutinized by a few academics for themes of empire and colonialism.

Susan Cannon Harris claims that themes of contagion and containment are common in the Holmes series, including the metaphors of Eastern foreigners as the root cause of &quot;infection&quot; within and around Europe. Lauren Raheja, writing in the Marxist journal &quot;Nature, Society, and Thought&quot;, claims that Doyle used these characteristics to paint eastern colonies in a negative light, through their continually being the source of threats. For example, in one story, Doyle makes mention of the Sumatran cannibals (also known as Batak) who throw poisonous darts, and in &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;, a &quot;long residence in the tropics&quot; was a negative influence on one antagonist&#x27;s bad temper. Yumna Siddiqi argues that Doyle depicted returned colonials as &quot;marginal, physically ravaged characters that threaten the peace&quot;, while putting non-colonials in a much more positive light.

==Adaptations and derived works==
The popularity of Sherlock Holmes has meant that many writers other than Arthur Conan Doyle have created tales of the detective in a wide variety of different media, with varying degrees of fidelity to the original characters, stories, and setting. The first known pastiche dates from 1891. Titled &quot;My Evening with Sherlock Holmes&quot;, it was written by Conan Doyle&#x27;s close friend J. M. Barrie.

Adaptations have seen the character taken in radically different directions or placed in different times or even universes. For example, Holmes falls in love and marries in Laurie R. King&#x27;s Mary Russell series, is re-animated after his death to fight future crime in the animated series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;, and is meshed with the setting of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;A Study in Emerald&quot; (which won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Short Story). An especially influential pastiche was Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, a 1974 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling novel (made into the 1976 film of the same name) in which Holmes&#x27;s cocaine addiction has progressed to the point of endangering his career. It served to popularize the trend of incorporating clearly identified and contemporaneous historical figures (such as Oscar Wilde, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, or Jack the Ripper) into Holmesian pastiches, something Conan Doyle himself never did. Another common pastiche approach is to create a new story fully detailing an otherwise-passing canonical reference (such as an aside by Conan Doyle mentioning the &quot;giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared&quot; in &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot;).

The first translation of a Sherlock Holmes story into a Chinese variety was done by &quot;Chinese Progress&quot; in 1896. That publication rendered the name as 呵爾唔斯, which would be 呵尔唔斯 in Simplified Chinese and Hē&#x27;ěrwúsī in Modern Standard Mandarin. Shanghai Civilization Books later issued versions rendering Holmes&#x27;s name differently, as 福爾摩斯 in Traditional Chinese, which would be 福尔摩斯 in Simplified Chinese and Fú&#x27;ěrmósī in Modern Standard Mandarin; this version became the common way of rendering &quot;Holmes&quot; in Chinese languages.

===Related and derivative writings===
In addition to the Holmes canon, Conan Doyle wrote other material featuring Holmes, especially plays: 1899&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (with William Gillette), 1910&#x27;s &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;, and 1921&#x27;s &quot;The Crown Diamond&quot; (the basis for &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot;). These and other Holmes-related but non-canonical works have been collected in several works released since Conan Doyle&#x27;s death.

In terms of writers other than Conan Doyle, authors as diverse as Agatha Christie, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Dorothy B. Hughes, Stephen King, Tanith Lee, A. A. Milne, and P. G. Wodehouse have all written Sherlock Holmes pastiches. Contemporary with Conan Doyle, Maurice Leblanc directly featured Holmes in his popular series about the gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, though legal objections from Conan Doyle forced Leblanc to modify the name to &quot;Herlock Sholmes&quot; in reprints and later stories. Mystery writer John Dickson Carr collaborated with Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s son, Adrian Conan Doyle, on &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a pastiche collection from 1954. In 2011, Anthony Horowitz published a Sherlock Holmes novel, &quot;The House of Silk&quot;, presented as a continuation of Conan Doyle&#x27;s work and with the approval of the Conan Doyle estate; a follow-up, &quot;Moriarty&quot;, appeared in 2014. The &quot;MX Book of New Sherlock Holmes Stories&quot; series of pastiches, edited by David Marcum and published by MX Publishing, has reached over forty volumes and features hundreds of stories echoing the original canon which were compiled for the restoration of Undershaw and the support of Stepping Stones School, now housed in it.

In 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, Italian author Umberto Eco creates a Sherlock Holmes of the 1320s in the form of a Franciscan friar and main protagonist named Brother William of Baskerville, his name a clear reference to Holmes per &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;. Brother William investigates a series of murders in the abbey alongside his novice Adso of Melk, who acts as his Dr. Watson. Furthermore, Umberto Eco&#x27;s description of Brother William bears marked similarities in both physique and personality to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s description of Sherlock Holmes in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;.

Laurie R. King recreated Holmes in her Mary Russell series (beginning with 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Beekeeper&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;), set during the First World War and the 1920s. Her Holmes, semi-retired in Sussex, meets a teenage American girl. Recognising a kindred spirit, he trains her as his apprentice and subsequently marries her. As of 2024, the series includes eighteen base novels and additional writings.

&quot;The Final Solution&quot;, a 2004 novella by Michael Chabon, concerns an unnamed but long-retired detective interested in beekeeping who tackles the case of a missing parrot belonging to a Jewish refugee boy. Mitch Cullin&#x27;s novel &quot;A Slight Trick of the Mind&quot; (2005) takes place two years after the end of the Second World War and explores an old and frail Sherlock Holmes (now 93) as he comes to terms with a life spent in emotionless logic; this was also adapted into a film, 2015&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot;.

==== Minor characters ====
Some authors have written tales centred on characters from the canon other than Holmes. Anthologies edited by Michael Kurland and George Mann are entirely devoted to stories told from the perspective of characters other than Holmes and Watson. John Gardner, Michael Kurland, and Kim Newman, amongst many others, have all written tales in which Holmes&#x27;s nemesis Professor Moriarty is the main character. Mycroft Holmes has been the subject of several efforts: &quot;Enter the Lion&quot; by Michael P. Hodel and Sean M. Wright (1979), a four-book series by Quinn Fawcett, and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Mycroft Holmes&quot;, by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anna Waterhouse. M. J. Trow has written a series of seventeen books using Inspector Lestrade as the central character, beginning with &quot;The Adventures of Inspector Lestrade&quot; in 1985. Carole Nelson Douglas&#x27; Irene Adler series is based on &quot;the woman&quot; from &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, with the first book (1990&#x27;s &quot;Good Night, Mr. Holmes&quot;) retelling that story from Adler&#x27;s point of view. Martin Davies has written three novels where Baker Street housekeeper Mrs. Hudson is the protagonist.

==== Parodies ====
A popular form of Holmesian pastiche is the parody. &quot;My Evening with Sherlock Holmes&quot;, by J. M. Barrie, was released in 1891, four years after Holmes first appearance in print and four months after “A Scandal in Bohemia” appeared in &quot;The Strand&quot;; it is generally considered a parody. Many others soon followed, with the protagonists often given thinly veiled names such as Sherlaw Kombs (by Robert Barr), Picklock Holes (by R. C. Lehmann), Shamrock Jolnes (by O. Henry), Holmlock Shears, Shylock Homes, and so on.

Conan Doyle himself contributed to this style, with 1898&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Special&quot; featuring an unnamed &quot;amateur reasoner&quot; intended to be identified by his readers as Holmes. The author&#x27;s explanation of a baffling disappearance argued in Holmesian style poked fun at his own creation. Similar Conan Doyle short stories are &quot;The Field Bazaar&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Watches&quot;, and 1924&#x27;s &quot;How Watson Learned the Trick&quot;, a parody of the Watson–Holmes breakfast-table scenes.

In 1944, American mystery writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee (writing under their joint pseudonym Ellery Queen) published &quot;The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a collection of thirty-three pastiches written by various well-known authors, featuring numerous parodies. 

==== Scholarly works ====
There have been many scholarly works dealing with Sherlock Holmes, some working within the bounds of the Great Game, and some written from the perspective that Holmes is a fictional character. In particular, there have been three major annotated editions of the complete series. The first was William Baring-Gould&#x27;s 1967 &quot;The Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot;. This two-volume set was ordered to fit Baring-Gould&#x27;s preferred chronology, and was written from a Great Game perspective. The second was 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Oxford Sherlock Holmes&quot; (general editor: Owen Dudley Edwards), a nine-volume set written in a straight scholarly manner. The most recent is Leslie Klinger&#x27;s &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2004–05), a three-volume set that returns to a Great Game perspective.

===Adaptations in other media===


In 2012, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; listed Holmes as the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history, with more than 75 actors playing the part in over 250 productions.

The 1899 play &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, by Conan Doyle and William Gillette, was a synthesis of several Conan Doyle stories. In addition to its popularity, the play is significant because it, rather than the original stories, introduced one of the key visual qualities commonly associated with Holmes today: his calabash pipe; the play also formed the basis for Gillette&#x27;s 1916 film, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Gillette performed as Holmes some 1,300 times. In the early 1900s, H. A. Saintsbury took over the role from Gillette for a tour of the play. Between this play and Conan Doyle&#x27;s own stage adaptation of &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times.

Holmes&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the 1900 Mutoscope film, &quot;Sherlock Holmes Baffled&quot;. From 1921 to 1923, Eille Norwood played Holmes in forty-seven silent films (45 shorts and two features), in a series of performances that Conan Doyle spoke highly of. 1929&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was the first sound title to feature Holmes. From 1939 to 1946, Basil Rathbone played Holmes and Nigel Bruce played Watson in fourteen US films (two for 20th Century Fox and a dozen for Universal Pictures) and in &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; radio show. While the Fox films were period pieces, the Universal films abandoned Victorian Britain and moved to a then-contemporary setting in which Holmes occasionally battled Nazis.

The character has also enjoyed numerous radio adaptations, beginning with Edith Meiser&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which ran from 1930 to 1936. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce continued with their roles for most of the run of &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, airing from 1939 to 1950. Bert Coules, having dramatised the entire Holmes canon for BBC Radio Four from 1989 to 1998, penned &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; between 2002 and 2010. This pastiche series also aired on Radio Four and starred Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams and then Andrew Sachs as Watson.
The 1984–85 Italian/Japanese anime series &quot;Sherlock Hound&quot; adapted the Holmes stories for children, with its characters being anthropomorphic dogs. The series was co-directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Between 1979 and 1986, the Soviet studio Lenfilm produced a series of five television films, &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot;. The series were split into eleven episodes and starred Vasily Livanov as Holmes and Vitaly Solomin as Watson. For his performance, in 2006 Livanov was appointed an Honorary Member of the Order of the British Empire.

Jeremy Brett played the detective in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; for Granada Television from 1984 to 1994. Watson was played by David Burke (in the first two series) and Edward Hardwicke (in the remainder). Brett and Hardwicke also appeared on stage in 1988–89 in &quot;The Secret of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, directed by Patrick Garland.

In the 2004–2012 Fox&#x27;s show &quot;House&quot;, the titular character Gregory House is an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes in a medical drama setting. The two characters share many parallels and House&#x27;s name is a play on Holmes&#x27; one.

The 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; earned Robert Downey Jr. a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Holmes and co-starred Jude Law as Watson. Downey and Law returned for a 2011 sequel, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;.

Benedict Cumberbatch plays a modern version of the detective and Martin Freeman as a modern version of John Watson in the BBC One TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, which premiered in 2010. In the series, created by Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, the stories&#x27; original Victorian setting is replaced by present-day London, with Watson a veteran of the modern War in Afghanistan. Similarly, &quot;Elementary&quot; premiered on CBS in 2012 and ran for seven seasons until 2019. Set in contemporary New York City, the series stars Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as a female Dr. Joan Watson. The series was filmed primarily in New York City, and, by the end of season two, Miller became the actor who had portrayed Sherlock Holmes the most in television and/or film.

The 2015 film &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot; starred Ian McKellen as a retired Sherlock Holmes living in Sussex, in 1947, who grapples with an unsolved case involving a beautiful woman. The film is based on Mitch Cullin&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;A Slight Trick of the Mind&quot;.

The 2018 television adaptation, &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot;, was a Japanese-language production and the first adaptation with a woman (portrayed by Yūko Takeuchi) in the signature role. The episodes were based in modern-day Tokyo, with many references to Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories.

Holmes has also appeared in video games, including the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series of eight main titles. According to the publisher, Frogwares, by 2017 the series sold over seven million copies.

===Copyright issues===
The copyright for Conan Doyle&#x27;s works expired in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia at the end of 1980, fifty years after Conan Doyle&#x27;s death. In the United Kingdom, it was revived in 1996 due to new provisions harmonising UK law with that of the European Union, and expired again at the end of 2000 (seventy years after Conan Doyle&#x27;s death). The author&#x27;s works are now in the public domain in those countries.

In the United States, all works published before 1923 entered public domain by 1998, but, as ten Holmes stories were published after that date, the Conan Doyle estate maintained that the Holmes and Watson characters as a whole were still under copyright. In 2013, Leslie S. Klinger (lawyer and editor of &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot;) sued the Conan Doyle estate in order to have the characters of Holmes and Watson declared public domain in the United States. Klinger was successful: as a result, the only stories still under copyright in the US due to the ruling, as of that time, were those collected in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; other than &quot;The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone&quot; and &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;: a total of ten stories.

In 2020, although the United States court ruling and the passage of time meant that most of the Holmes stories and characters were in the public domain in that country, the Doyle estate legally challenged the use of Sherlock Holmes in the film &quot;Enola Holmes&quot; in a complaint filed in the United States. The Doyle estate alleged that the film depicts Holmes with personality traits that were only exhibited by the character in the stories still under copyright. On 18 December 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of all parties.

The remaining ten Holmes stories moved out of copyright in the United States between 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2023, leaving the stories and characters completely in the public domain in the US as of the latter date.

<text>A slow fire is a term used in library and information science to describe paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay. The term is taken from the title of Terry Sanders&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Slow Fires: On the preservation of the human record.&quot;

Solutions to this problem include the use of acid-free paper stocks, format shifting brittle books by microfilming, photocopying or digitization, and a variety of deacidification techniques.

<doc id="27162" wikidata="Q1067705" url="?curid=27162" title="Sequential access">
<text>Sequential access is a term describing a group of elements (such as data in a memory array or a disk file or on magnetic-tape data storage) being accessed in a predetermined, ordered sequence. It is the opposite of random access, the ability to access an arbitrary element of a sequence as easily and efficiently as any other at any time.

Sequential access is sometimes the only way of accessing the data, for example if it is on a tape. It may also be the access method of choice, for example if all that is wanted is to process a sequence of data elements in order.

==Definition==
There is no consistent definition in computer science of sequential access or sequentiality. In fact, different sequentiality definitions can lead to different sequentiality quantification results. In spatial dimension, request size, stride distance, backward accesses, re-accesses can affect sequentiality. For temporal sequentiality, characteristics such as multi-stream and inter-arrival time threshold has impact on the definition of sequentiality.

In data structures, a data structure is said to have sequential access if one can only visit the values it contains in one particular order. The canonical example is the linked list. Indexing into a list that has sequential access requires O(&quot;n&quot;) time, where &quot;n&quot; is the index. As a result, many algorithms such as quicksort and binary search degenerate into bad algorithms that are even less efficient than their naive alternatives; these algorithms are impractical without random access. On the other hand, some algorithms, typically those that do not have index, require only sequential access, such as mergesort, and face no penalty.

<text>sed (&quot;stream editor&quot;) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. It was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs,
and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed (&quot;editor&quot;, 1971) and the earlier qed (&quot;quick editor&quot;, 1965–66). It was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and &quot;stream editing&quot; include AWK and Perl.

==History==
First appearing in Version 7 Unix, sed is one of the early Unix commands built for command line processing of data files. It evolved as the natural successor to the popular grep command. The original motivation was an analogue of grep (g/re/p) for substitution, hence &quot;g/re/s&quot;. Foreseeing that further special-purpose programs for each command would also arise, such as g/re/d, McMahon wrote a general-purpose line-oriented stream editor, which became sed. The syntax for sed, notably the use of codice_1 for pattern matching, and codice_2 for substitution, originated with ed, the precursor to sed, which was in common use at the time, and the regular expression syntax has influenced other languages, notably ECMAScript and Perl. Later, the more powerful language AWK developed, and these functioned as cousins, allowing powerful text processing to be done by shell scripts. sed and AWK are often cited as progenitors and inspiration for Perl, and influenced Perl&#x27;s syntax and semantics, notably in the matching and substitution operators.

GNU sed added several new features, including in-place editing of files. &quot;Super-sed&quot; is an extended version of sed that includes regular expressions compatible with Perl. Another variant of sed is &quot;minised&quot;, originally reverse-engineered from 4.1BSD sed by Eric S. Raymond and currently maintained by René Rebe. minised was used by the GNU Project until the GNU Project wrote a new version of sed based on the new GNU regular expression library. The current minised contains some extensions to BSD sed but is not as feature-rich as GNU sed. Its advantage is that it is very fast and uses little memory. It is used on embedded systems and is the version of sed provided with Minix.

==Mode of operation==
sed is a line-oriented text processing utility: it reads text, line by line, from an input stream or file, into an internal buffer called the &quot;pattern space&quot;. Each line read starts a &quot;cycle&quot;. To the pattern space, sed applies one or more operations which have been specified via a &quot;sed script&quot;. sed implements a programming language with about 25 &quot;commands&quot; that specify the operations on the text. For each input line, after running the script, sed ordinarily outputs the pattern space (the line as modified by the script) and begins the cycle again with the next line. Other end-of-script behaviors are available through sed options and script commands, e.g. codice_3 to delete the pattern space, codice_4 to quit, codice_5 to add the next line to the pattern space immediately, and so on. Thus a sed script corresponds to the body of a loop that iterates through the lines of a stream, where the loop itself and the loop variable (the current line number) are implicit and maintained by sed.

The sed script can either be specified on the command line (codice_6 option) or read from a separate file (codice_7 option). Commands in the sed script may take an optional &quot;address,&quot; in terms of line numbers or regular expressions. The address determines when the command is run. For example, codice_8 would only run the codice_3 (delete) command on the second input line (printing all lines but the second), while codice_10 would delete all lines beginning with a space. A separate special buffer, the &quot;hold space&quot;, may be used by a few sed commands to hold and accumulate text between cycles. sed&#x27;s command language has only two variables (the &quot;hold space&quot; and the &quot;pattern space&quot;) and GOTO-like branching functionality; nevertheless, the language is Turing-complete, and esoteric sed scripts exist for games such as sokoban, arkanoid, chess, and tetris.

A main loop executes for each line of the input stream, evaluating the sed script on each line of the input. Lines of a sed script are each a pattern-action pair, indicating what pattern to match and which action to perform, which can be recast as a conditional statement. Because the main loop, working variables (pattern space and hold space), input and output streams, and default actions (copy line to pattern space, print pattern space) are implicit, it is possible to write terse one-liner programs. For example, the sed program given by:
 10q
will print the first 10 lines of input, then stop.

==Usage==
===Substitution command===
The following example shows a typical, and the most common, use of sed: substitution. This usage was indeed the original motivation for sed:

sed &#x27;s/regexp/replacement/g&#x27; inputFileName &gt; outputFileName

In some versions of sed, the expression must be preceded by codice_6 to indicate that an expression follows. The codice_12 stands for substitute, while the codice_13 stands for global, which means that all matching occurrences in the line would be replaced. The regular expression (i.e. pattern) to be searched is placed after the first delimiting symbol (slash here) and the replacement follows the second symbol. Slash (codice_1) is the conventional symbol, originating in the character for &quot;search&quot; in ed, but any other could be used to make syntax more readable if it does not occur in the pattern or replacement; this is useful to avoid &quot;leaning toothpick syndrome&quot;.

The substitution command, which originates in search-and-replace in ed, implements simple parsing and templating. The codice_15 provides both pattern matching and saving text via sub-expressions, while the codice_16 can be either literal text, or a format string containing the characters codice_17 for &quot;entire match&quot; or the special escape sequences codice_18 through codice_19 for the &quot;n&quot;th saved sub-expression. For example, codice_20 replaces all occurrences of &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;dog&quot; with &quot;cats&quot; or &quot;dogs&quot;, without duplicating an existing &quot;s&quot;: codice_21 is the 1st (and only) saved sub-expression in the regexp, and codice_18 in the format string substitutes this into the output.

===Other sed commands===
Besides substitution, other forms of simple processing are possible, using some 25 sed commands. For example, the following uses the &quot;d&quot; command to filter out lines that only contain spaces, or only contain the end of line character:

sed &#x27;/^ *$/d&#x27; inputFileName

This example uses some of the following regular expression metacharacters (sed supports the full range of regular expressions):
* The caret (codice_23) matches the beginning of the line.
* The dollar sign (codice_24) matches the end of the line.
* The asterisk (codice_25) matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character.
* The plus (codice_26) matches one or more occurrence(s) of the previous character.
* The question mark (codice_27) matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character.
* The dot (codice_28) matches exactly one character.

Complex sed constructs are possible, allowing it to serve as a simple, but highly specialized, programming language. Flow of control, for example, can be managed by the use of a label (a colon followed by a string) and the branch instruction codice_29, as well as the conditional branch codice_30. An instruction codice_29 followed by a valid label name will move processing to the command following that label. The codice_30 instruction will only do so if there was a successful substitution since the previous codice_30 (or the start of the program, in case of the first codice_30 encountered). Additionally, the codice_35 instruction starts a subsequence of commands (up to the matching codice_36); in most cases, it will be conditioned by an address pattern.

===sed used as a filter===
Under Unix, sed is often used as a filter in a pipeline:

$ generateData | sed &#x27;s/x/y/g&#x27;

That is, a program such as &quot;generateData&quot; generates data, and then sed makes the small change of replacing &quot;x&quot; with &quot;y&quot;. For example:

$ echo xyz xyz | sed &#x27;s/x/y/g&#x27;
yyz yyz

===File-based sed scripts===
It is often useful to put several sed commands, one command per line, into a script file such as codice_37, and then use the codice_7 option to run the commands (such as codice_39) from the file:

sed -f subst.sed inputFileName &gt; outputFileName

Any number of commands may be placed into the script file, and using a script file also avoids problems with shell escaping or substitutions.

Such a script file may be made directly executable from the command line by prepending it with a &quot;shebang line&quot; containing the sed command and assigning the executable permission to the file. For example, a file codice_37 can be created with contents:

#!/bin/sed -f
s/x/y/g
The file may then be made executable by the current user with the codice_41 command:
chmod u+x subst.sed
The file may then be executed directly from the command line:

subst.sed inputFileName &gt; outputFileName
===In-place editing===
The codice_42 option, introduced in GNU sed, allows in-place editing of files (actually, a temporary output file is created in the background, and then the original file is replaced by the temporary file). For example:

sed -i &#x27;s/abc/def/&#x27; fileName
==Examples==
===Hello, world! example===

# convert input text stream to &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
s/.*/Hello, world!/
q
This &quot;Hello, world!&quot; script is in a file (e.g., script.txt) and invoked with codice_43, where &quot;inputFileName&quot; is the input text file. The script changes &quot;inputFileName&quot; line #1 to &quot;Hello, world!&quot; and then quits, printing the result before sed exits. Any input lines past line #1 are not read, and not printed. So the sole output is &quot;Hello, world!&quot;.

The example emphasizes many key characteristics of sed:
* Typical sed programs are rather short and simple.
* sed scripts can have comments (the line starting with the codice_44 symbol).
* The codice_12 (substitute) command is the most important sed command.
* sed allows simple programming, with commands such as codice_4 (quit).
* sed uses regular expressions, such as codice_47 (zero or more of any character).

===Other simple examples===

Below follow various sed scripts; these can be executed by passing as an argument to sed, or put in a separate file and executed via codice_7 or by making the script itself executable.

To replace any instance of a certain word in a file with &quot;REDACTED&quot;, such as an IRC password, and save the result:

$ sed -i &quot;s/yourpassword/REDACTED/&quot; ./status.chat.log
To delete any line containing the word &quot;yourword&quot; (the &quot;address&quot; is &#x27;/yourword/&#x27;):

/yourword/ d

To delete all instances of the word &quot;yourword&quot;:

s/yourword//g

To delete two words from a file simultaneously:

s/firstword//g
s/secondword//g

To express the previous example on one line, such as when entering at the command line, one may join two commands via the semicolon:

$ sed &quot;s/firstword//g; s/secondword//g&quot; inputFileName
===Multiline processing example===
In the next example, sed, which usually only works on one line, removes newlines from sentences where the second line starts with one space.
Consider the following text:
 This is my dog,
 whose name is Frank.
 This is my fish,
 whose name is George.
 This is my goat,
 whose name is Adam.

The sed script below will turn the text above into the following text. Note that the script affects only the input lines that start with a space:
 This is my dog, whose name is Frank.
 This is my fish,
 whose name is George.
 This is my goat, whose name is Adam.

The script is:

 N
 s/\n / /
 P
 D

This is explained as:
* (codice_5) add the next line to the pattern space;
* (codice_50) find a new line followed by a space, replace with one space;
* (codice_51) print the top line of the pattern space;
* (codice_52) delete the top line from the pattern space and run the script again.

This can be expressed on a single line via semicolons:
 sed &quot; inputFileName

==Limitations and alternatives==
While simple and limited, sed is sufficiently powerful for a large number of purposes. For more sophisticated processing, more powerful languages such as AWK or Perl are used instead. These are particularly used if transforming a line in a way more complicated than a regex extracting and template replacement, though arbitrarily complicated transforms are in principle possible by using the hold buffer.

Conversely, for simpler operations, specialized Unix utilities such as grep (print lines matching a pattern), head (print the first part of a file), tail (print the last part of a file), and tr (translate or delete characters) are often preferable. For the specific tasks they are designed to carry out, such specialized utilities are usually simpler, clearer, and faster than a more general solution such as sed.

The ed/sed commands and syntax continue to be used in descendent programs, such as the text editors vi and vim. An analog to ed/sed is sam/ssam, where sam is the Plan 9 editor, and ssam is a stream interface to it, yielding functionality similar to sed.

<text>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit legal advocacy organization specializing in civil rights and public interest litigation. Based in Montgomery, Alabama, it is known for its legal cases against white supremacist groups, for its classification of hate groups and other extremist organizations, and for promoting tolerance education programs. The SPLC was founded by Morris Dees, Joseph J. Levin Jr., and Julian Bond in 1971 as a civil rights law firm in Montgomery.

In 1980, the SPLC began a litigation strategy of filing civil suits for monetary damages on behalf of the victims of violence from the Ku Klux Klan. The SPLC also became involved in other civil rights causes, including cases to challenge what it sees as institutional racial segregation and discrimination, inhumane and unconstitutional conditions in prisons and detention centers, discrimination based on sexual orientation, mistreatment of illegal immigrants, and the unconstitutional mixing of church and state. The SPLC has provided information about hate groups to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies.

Since the 2000s, the SPLC&#x27;s classification and listings of hate groups (organizations that &quot;attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics&quot;) and anti-government extremists have been widely relied upon by academic and media sources. The SPLC&#x27;s listings have also been criticized by those who argue that some of the SPLC&#x27;s listings are overbroad, politically motivated, or unwarranted. The organization has also been accused of an overindulgent use of funds, leading some employees to call its headquarters &quot;Poverty Palace&quot;.

==History==
The Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in August 1971 as a law firm originally focused on issues such as fighting poverty, racial discrimination and the death penalty in the US. Dees asked civil rights leader Julian Bond to serve as president, a largely honorary position; he resigned in 1979 but remained on the board of directors until his death in 2015.

In 1979, Dees and the SPLC began filing civil lawsuits against Ku Klux Klan chapters and similar organizations for monetary damages on behalf of their victims. The favorable verdicts from these suits served to bankrupt the KKK and other targeted organizations. According to a 1996 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dees and the SPLC &quot;have been credited with devising innovative legal ways to cripple hate groups, including seizing their assets.&quot; Some civil libertarians said that SPLC&#x27;s tactics chill free speech and set legal precedents that could be applied against activist groups which are not hate groups.

In 1981, the Center began its &quot;Klanwatch&quot; project to monitor the activities of the KKK. That project, later called &quot;Hatewatch&quot;, was later expanded to include seven other types of hate organizations.

In 1986, the entire legal staff of the SPLC, excluding Dees, resigned as the organization shifted from traditional civil rights work toward fighting right-wing extremism. In 1989, the Center unveiled its Civil Rights Memorial, which was designed by Maya Lin.

In 1995, the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize recognition for work that probed management self-interest, questionable practices, and employee racial discrimination allegations in the SPLC.

The Center&#x27;s &quot;Teaching Tolerance&quot; project was initiated in 1991.

In 2008, the SPLC and Dees were featured on &quot;National Geographic&quot;″s &quot;Inside American Terror&quot; explaining their litigation strategy against the Ku Klux Klan.

In 2011, the SPLC was &quot;involved in high-profile state fights&quot;, including the battle over the Georgia House Bill 87 (HB 87). The SPLC joined with the ACLU, the Asian Law Caucus, and the National Immigration Law Center in June 2011, to file a lawsuit challenging HB 87. which resulted in a permanent injunction in 2013 blocking multiple provisions of the law.

In 2013, &quot;Teaching Tolerance&quot; was cited as &quot;of the most widely read periodicals dedicated to diversity and social justice in education&quot;.

In 2016, the SPLC&#x27;s &quot;ranks swelled&quot; and its &quot;endowment surged&quot; after U.S. President Donald Trump was elected, resulting in the hiring of 200 new employees.

In 2018, The SPLC filed suits related to the conditions of incarceration for adults and juveniles.

In March 2019, founder Morris Dees was fired. In April, Karen Baynes-Dunning was named as interim president and CEO. After a &quot;tumultuous year&quot;, in mid-December 2019, staff at the SPLC voted to unionize, with 142 in favor and 45 against. The SPLC had &quot;long been dogged by accusations of internal discrimination against minority employees, particularly in the area of promotions.&quot; A new president and CEO, Margaret Huang, was named in early February 2020.

The SPLC and the ACLU have been involved in &quot;battles over the treatment of inmates in the state&#x27;s prisons&quot;, including an emergency request in April 2020 for the &quot;release of tens of thousands of people in ICE custody&quot; if ICE cannot provide protection for vulnerable inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The federal court injunction was filed as part of an existing class-action lawsuit regarding conditions in ICE facilities.

In June 2024, 80 people, representing 25% of the SPLC&#x27;s workforce, were laid off. In September 2024, 92% of remaining SPLC staffers supported a no-confidence motion on the organization&#x27;s CEO, Margaret Huang. The workers demanded a reversal of the mass layoff, which they characterized as a union-busting tactic, and the hiring of a new CEO. The chair of the union&#x27;s bargaining committee called the layoffs &quot;sloppy, dispassionate, inhumane. It has been the absolute opposite of what the organization says they stand for and absolute chaos since then.&quot; SPLC leadership dismissed the union&#x27;s request to remove Huang as CEO.

===Leadership upheaval amid harassment allegations===
In March 2019, the SPLC fired founder Morris Dees for undisclosed reasons and removed his profile from the SPLC website. In a statement regarding the firing, the SPLC announced it would be bringing in an &quot;outside organization to conduct a comprehensive assessment of our internal climate and workplace practices.&quot;

Following the dismissal, a letter signed by two dozen SPLC employees was sent to management, expressing concern that &quot;allegations of mistreatment, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, and racism threaten the moral authority of this organization and our integrity along with it.&quot; One former employee wrote that the &quot;unchecked power of lavishly compensated white men at the top&quot; of the SPLC contributed to a culture which made black and female employees the targets of harassment.

A week later, President Richard Cohen and legal director Rhonda Brownstein announced their resignations amid the internal upheaval. The associate legal director Meredith Horton quit, alleging concerns regarding workplace culture. Cohen said, &quot;Whatever problems exist at the SPLC happened on my watch, so I take responsibility for them.&quot;

==Administration==
In early February 2020, Margaret Huang, who was formerly the Chief Executive at Amnesty International USA, was named as president and CEO of the SPLC. Huang replaced Karen Baynes-Dunning, a former juvenile court judge, who had served as interim president and CEO since April 2019, after founder Morris Dees was fired in March 2019. The SPLC had appointed Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama, to review and investigate any issues with the organization&#x27;s workplace environment related to Dees&#x27; firing.

==Fundraising and finances==
The SPLC&#x27;s activities, including litigation, are supported by fundraising efforts, and it does not accept any fees or share in legal judgments awarded to clients it represents in court. Starting in 1974, the SPLC set aside money for its endowment stating that it was &quot;convinced that the day [would] come when non-profit groups [would] no longer be able to rely on support through mail because of posting and printing costs&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that by 2017, the SPLC&#x27;s financial resources &quot;nearly totaled half a billion dollars in assets&quot;. In 2023, its endowment was $749 million, its revenue was $170 million, and its expenses totaled $122 million.

Prior to his departure in 2019, Dees&#x27; &quot;role at the Center was focused on &#x27;donor relations&#x27; and &#x27;expanding the Center&#x27;s financial resources.&#x27;&quot;

The SPLC&#x27;s related 501(c)(4) organization, the SPLC Action Fund, formed two political action committees in 2022: New Southern Leaders federal PAC and the New Southern Majority federal Super PAC. The New Southern Leaders PAC spent more than $21,000 in 2023-24, most going to the SPLC Action Fund, which spent more than $1,000,000 in independent expenditures in the 2019-20 election cycle. 

===Charity ratings===
, based on figures from Fiscal Year 2022, Charity Navigator rated the SPLC four out of four stars, with an overall score of 99/100 for &quot;Accountability &amp; Finance&quot;. The missing point was due to SPLC failing to post a &quot;Donor Privacy Policy&quot; on its website. SPLC&#x27;s 2022 revenue totaled $140,350,982, and its expenses amounted to $111,043,025. According to Charity Navigator&#x27;s Historical Ratings, SPLC has earned four-star ratings since 2019.

, SPLC has earned the GuideStar Gold Seal of Transparency, which is given to organizations that voluntarily share their financials and &quot;highlight their commitment to inclusivity to gain funders&#x27; trust and support.&quot; SPLC previously earned GuideStar&#x27;s Platinum Seal of Transparency, but did not retain it.

, CharityWatch initially gave SPLC a grade of B based on its 2021 financials. CharityWatch, however, downgrades all charities that &quot;hoard&quot; donations, which per CharityWatch&#x27;s definition occurs whenever &quot;a charity&#x27;s available assets in reserve exceeds three years&#x27; worth its annual budget.&quot; In particular, CharityWatch automatically &quot;downgrades to an F rating any charity holding available assets in reserve equal to 5 years or more of its annual budget.&quot; In accordance with this policy, on CharityWatch downgraded SPLC from B to F because it had 7.3 years of available assets in reserve, it spent 68% of its funds on programs, and it cost $20 to raise $100.

The SPLC declined to submit information or be evaluated by the Charity Accountability section of the Better Business Bureau.

==Criminal attacks and plots against the SPLC==
In July 1983, the SPLC headquarters was firebombed, destroying the building and records. In February 1985, Klansmen Joe M. Garner and Roy T. Downs Jr., along with Klan sympathizer Charles Bailey, pleaded guilty to conspiring to intimidate, oppress and threaten members of black organizations represented by SPLC. The SPLC built a new headquarters building from 1999 to 2001.

In 1984, Morris Dees became an assassination target of The Order, a revolutionary white supremacist group. By 2007, according to Dees, more than 30 people had been jailed in connection with plots to kill him or to blow up SPLC offices.

In 1995, four men were indicted for planning to blow up the SPLC headquarters. In May 1998, three white supremacists were arrested for allegedly planning a nationwide campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting Morris Dees and his Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama as well as the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, the Anti-Defamation League in New York, an undisclosed federal judge in Illinois and a black radio show host in Missouri.

==Notable SPLC civil cases on behalf of clients==
The Southern Poverty Law Center has initiated a number of civil cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary awards on behalf of its clients. The SPLC has said it does not accept any portion of monetary judgments.

===&quot;Sims v. Amos&quot; (1974)===
An early SPLC case was &quot;Sims v. Amos&quot; (consolidated with &quot;Nixon v. Brewer&quot;) in which the U.S. District Court for the Middle of Alabama ordered the state legislature to reapportion its election system. The result of the decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed, was that fifteen black legislators were elected in 1974.

===&quot;Brown v. Invisible Empire, KKK&quot; (1980)===
In 1979, the Klan began a summer of attacks against civil rights groups, beginning in Alabama. In Decatur, Alabama, Klan members clashed with a group of civil rights marchers. There were a hundred Klan members carrying &quot;bats, ax handles and guns&quot;. A black woman, Bernice Brown, was shot and other marchers were violently attacked. In &quot;Brown v. Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, filed in 1980 in the USDC Northern District of Alabama, the SPLC sued the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on behalf of plaintiffs, Brown and other black marchers. The civil suit was settled in 1990 and &quot;required Klansmen to pay damages, perform community service, and refrain from white supremacist activity.&quot; Chalmers wrote in &quot;Backfire&quot;, that the Klan had been in serious decline since the end of the 1970s. He described the &quot;Klan summer of 1979&quot;, as a &quot;catastrophe&quot; for the Klan, as the SPLC&#x27;s newly established Klanwatch, which became a &quot;powerful weapon&quot; that &quot;tracked and litigated&quot; the Klan. According to Chalmers, &quot;[b]eginning with the Decatur street confrontation, the SPLC&#x27;s Klanwatch began suing various Klans in federal court for civil rights violations&quot;, and as a result, the Klan lost credibility and its resources were depleted. As a result of the SPLC, the FBI reopen their case against the Klan, and &quot;nine Klansmen were eventually convicted of criminal charges&quot; related to the Decatur confrontation of 1979.

===Vietnamese fishermen (1981)===
In 1981, the SPLC took Ku Klux Klan leader Louis Beam&#x27;s Klan-associated militia, the Texas Emergency Reserve (TER), to court to stop racial harassment and intimidation of Vietnamese shrimpers in and around Galveston Bay. The Klan&#x27;s actions against approximately 100 Vietnamese shrimpers in the area included a cross burning, sniper fire aimed at them, and arsonists burning their boats.

In May 1981, U.S. District Court judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald issued a preliminary injunction against the Klan, requiring them to cease intimidating, threatening, or harassing the Vietnamese. McDonald eventually found the TER and Beam liable for tortious interference, violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and of various civil rights statutes and thus permanently enjoined them against violence, threatening behavior, and other harassment of the Vietnamese shrimpers. The SPLC also uncovered an obscure Texas law &quot;that forbade private armies in that state&quot;. McDonald found that Beam&#x27;s organization violated it and hence ordered the TER to close its military training camp.

===&quot;Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1982)===
In 1982, armed members of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan terrorized Bobby Person, a black prison guard, and members of his family. They harassed and threatened others, including a white woman who had befriended blacks. In 1984, Person became the lead plaintiff in &quot;Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, a lawsuit brought by the SPLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The harassment and threats continued during litigation and the court issued an order prohibiting any person from interfering with others inside the courthouse. In January 1985, the court issued a consent order that prohibited the group&#x27;s &quot;Grand Dragon&quot;, Frazier Glenn Miller Jr., and his followers from operating a paramilitary organization, holding parades in black neighborhoods, and from harassing, threatening or harming any black person or white persons who associated with black persons. Subsequently, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&#x27; claim for damages.

Within a year, the court found Miller and his followers, now calling themselves the White Patriot Party, in criminal contempt for violating the consent order. Miller was sentenced to six months in prison followed by a three-year probationary period, during which he was banned from associating with members of any racist group such as the White Patriot Party. Miller refused to obey the terms of his probation. He made underground &quot;declarations of war&quot; against Jews and the federal government before being arrested again. Found guilty of weapons violations, he went to federal prison for three years.

===United Klans of America===
In 1987, Dees and Michael Figures won a case against the United Klans of America for the lynching of Michael Donald, a black teenager in Mobile, Alabama. The SPLC used an unprecedented legal strategy of holding an organization responsible for the crimes of individual members to help produce a $7 million judgment for the victim&#x27;s mother. The verdict forced United Klans of America into bankruptcy. Its national headquarters was sold for approximately $52,000 to help satisfy the judgment.

In 1987, five members of a Klan offshoot, the White Patriot Party, were indicted for stealing military weaponry and plotting to kill Dees. The SPLC has since successfully used this precedent to force numerous Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups into bankruptcy.
===White Aryan Resistance===
On November 13, 1988, in Portland, Oregon, three white supremacist members of East Side White Pride and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) fatally assaulted Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man who came to the United States to attend college. In October 1990, the SPLC won a civil case on behalf of Seraw&#x27;s family against WAR&#x27;s operator Tom Metzger and his son, John, for a total of $12.5 million. The Metzgers declared bankruptcy, and WAR went out of business. The cost of work for the trial was absorbed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as well as the SPLC. , Metzger still makes payments to Seraw&#x27;s family.

===Church of the Creator===
In May 1991, Harold Mansfield, a black U.S. Navy war veteran, was murdered by George Loeb, a member of the neo-Nazi &quot;Church of the Creator&quot; (now called the Creativity Movement). SPLC represented the victim&#x27;s family in a civil case and won a judgment of $1 million from the church in March 1994. The church transferred ownership to William Pierce, head of the National Alliance, to avoid paying money to Mansfield&#x27;s heirs. The SPLC filed suit against Pierce for his role in the fraudulent scheme and won an $85,000 judgment against him in 1995. The amount was upheld on appeal and the money was collected prior to Pierce&#x27;s death in 2002.

===Christian Knights of the KKK===
The SPLC won a $37.8 million verdict on behalf of Macedonia Baptist Church, a 100-year-old black church in Manning, South Carolina, against two Ku Klux Klan chapters and five Klansmen (Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and Invisible Empire, Inc.) in July 1998. The money was awarded stemming from arson convictions; these Klan units burned down the historic black church in 1995. Morris Dees told the press, &quot;If we put the Christian Knights out of business, what&#x27;s that worth? We don&#x27;t look at what we can collect. It&#x27;s what the jury thinks this egregious conduct is worth that matters, along with the message it sends.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; the amount is the &quot;largest-ever civil award for damages in a hate crime case.&quot;

===Aryan Nations===
In September 2000, the SPLC won a $6.3 million judgment against the Aryan Nations via an Idaho jury who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards. The lawsuit stemmed from the July 1998 attack when security guards at the Aryan Nations compound near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho, shot at Victoria Keenan and her son. Bullets struck their car several times, causing the car to crash. An Aryan Nations member held the Keenans at gunpoint. As a result of the judgment, Richard Butler turned over the compound to the Keenans, who sold the property to a philanthropist. He donated the land to North Idaho College, which designated the area as a &quot;peace park&quot;.

===Ten Commandments monument===

In 2002, the SPLC and the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit (&quot;Glassroth v. Moore&quot;) against Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore for placing a display of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building. Moore, who had final authority over what decorations were to be placed in the Alabama State Judicial Building&#x27;s Rotunda, had installed a 5,280 pound (2,400 kg) granite block, three feet wide by three feet deep by four feet tall, of the Ten Commandments late at night without the knowledge of any other court justice. After defying several court rulings, Moore was eventually removed from the court and the Supreme Court justices had the monument removed from the building.

===&quot;Leiva v. Ranch Rescue&quot;===

In 2003, the SPLC, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and local attorneys filed a civil suit, &quot;Leiva v. Ranch Rescue&quot;, in Jim Hogg County, Texas, against Ranch Rescue, a vigilante paramilitary group and several of its associates, seeking damages for assault and illegal detention of two illegal immigrants caught near the U.S.-Mexico border. In April 2005, SPLC obtained judgments totaling $1 million against Casey James Nethercott, who was then Ranch Rescue&#x27;s leader and the owner of an Arizona ranch, Camp Thunderbird, Joe Sutton, who owned the Hebbronville ranch on which two illegal immigrants has been caught trespassing on March 18, 2003, and Jack Foote, the founder of Ranch Rescue. Sutton, who had recruited Ranch Rescue to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border region near his Hebbronville ranch, settled with an $100,000 out-of-court settlement. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, since neither Nethercott or Foote defended themselves, the &quot;judge issued default judgments of $850,000 against Mr. Nethercott and $500,000 against Mr. Foote. Neither men had &quot;substantial assets&quot; so Nethercott&#x27;s ranch—Camp Thunderbird—which had also served as Ranch Rescue&#x27;s headquarters—was seized to pay the judgment and surrendered to the two illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Edwin Alfredo Mancía Gonzáles and Fátima del Socorro Leiva Medina. SPLC staff worked also with Texas prosecutors to obtain a conviction against Nethercott for possession of a gun, which was illegal for a felon. Nethercott had served time in California for assault previously. As a result, he was sentenced to serve a five-year sentence in a Texas prison.

===Billy Ray Johnson===
The SPLC brought a civil suit on behalf of Billy Ray Johnson, a black, mentally disabled man, who was severely beaten by four white males in Texas and left bleeding in a ditch, suffering permanent injuries. In 2007, Johnson was awarded $9 million in damages by a Linden, Texas jury. At a criminal trial, the four men were convicted of assault and received sentences of 30 to 60 days in county jail.

===Imperial Klans of America===
In November 2008, the SPLC&#x27;s case against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA), the nation&#x27;s second-largest Klan organization, went to trial in Meade County, Kentucky. The SPLC had filed suit for damages in July 2007 on behalf of Jordan Gruver and his mother against the IKA in Kentucky. In July 2006, five Klan members went to the Meade County Fairgrounds in Brandenburg, Kentucky, &quot;to hand out business cards and flyers advertising a &#x27;white-only&#x27; IKA function&quot;. Two members of the Klan started calling Gruver, a 16-year-old boy of Panamanian descent, a &quot;spic&quot;. Subsequently, the boy, ( and weighing ) was beaten and kicked by the Klansmen (one of whom was and ). As a result, the victim received &quot;two cracked ribs, a broken left forearm, multiple cuts and bruises and jaw injuries requiring extensive dental repair.&quot;

In a related criminal case in February 2007, Jarred Hensley and Andrew Watkins were sentenced to three years in prison for beating Gruver. On November 14, 2008, an all-white jury of seven men and seven women awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff against Ron Edwards, Imperial Wizard of the group, and Jarred Hensley, who participated in the attack.

===Mississippi correctional institutions===
Together with the ACLU National Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in November 2010 against the owner/operators of the private Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Leake County, Mississippi, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDC). They charged that conditions, including under-staffing and neglect of medical care, produced numerous and repeated abuses of youthful prisoners, high rates of violence and injury, and that one prisoner suffered brain damage because of inmate-on-inmate attacks. A federal civil rights investigation was undertaken by the United States Department of Justice. In settling the suit, Mississippi ended its contract with GEO Group in 2012. Additionally, under the court decree, the MDC moved the youthful offenders to state-run units. In 2012, Mississippi opened a new youthful offender unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County. The state also agreed to not subject youthful offenders to solitary confinement and a court monitor conducted regular reviews of conditions at the facility.

Also with the ACLU Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in May 2013 against Management and Training Corporation (MTC), the for-profit operator of the private East Mississippi Correctional Facility, and the MDC. Management and Training Corporation had been awarded a contract for this and two other facilities in Mississippi in 2012 following the removal of GEO Group. The suit charged failure of MTC to make needed improvements, and to maintain proper conditions and treatment for this special needs population of prisoners. In 2015 the court granted the plaintiffs&#x27; motion for class certification.

===Polk County, Florida Sheriff===
In 2012, the SPLC initiated a class action federal lawsuit against the Polk County, Florida sheriff, Grady Judd, alleging that seven juveniles confined by the sheriff were suffering in improper conditions. U.S. District Court Judge Steven D. Merryday found in favor of Judd, who said the SPLC&#x27;s allegations &quot;were not supported by the facts or court precedence .&quot; The judge wrote that &quot;the conditions of juvenile detention at (Central County Jail) are not consistent with (Southern Poverty&#x27;s) dark, grim, and condemning portrayal.&quot; While the county sheriff&#x27;s department did not recover an estimated $1 million in attorney&#x27;s fees defending the case, Judge Merryday did award $103,000 in court costs to Polk County.

===Andrew Anglin and &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot;===
In April 2017, the SPLC filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Tanya Gersh, accusing Andrew Anglin, publisher of the white supremacist website &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot;, of instigating an anti-Semitic harassment campaign against Gersh, a Whitefish, Montana, real estate agent. In July 2019, a judge issued a 14 million dollar default judgment against Anglin, who is in hiding and has refused to appear in court.

==Lawsuits against and criticism of the SPLC==

In October 2014, the SPLC added Ben Carson to its extremist watch list, citing his association with groups it considers extreme, and his &quot;linking of gays with pedophiles&quot;. Following criticism, the SPLC concluded its profile of Carson did not meet its standards, removed his listing, and apologized to him in February 2015.

In October 2016, the SPLC published its &quot;Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists&quot;, which listed the British activist Maajid Nawaz and a nonprofit group he founded, the Quilliam Foundation. Nawaz, who identifies as a &quot;liberal, reform Muslim&quot;, denounced the listing as a &quot;smear&quot;, saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. In June 2018, the SPLC issued an apology, stating:

Along with the apology, the SPLC paid US$3.375 million to Nawaz and the Quilliam Foundation in a settlement. Nawaz said about the settlement that Quilliam &quot;will continue to combat extremists by defying Muslim stereotypes, calling out fundamentalism in our own communities, and speaking out against anti-Muslim hate.&quot; The SPLC ultimately removed the &quot;Field Guide&quot; from its website.

In August 2017, a defamation lawsuit was filed against the SPLC by the D. James Kennedy Ministries for describing it as an &quot;active hate group&quot; because of their views on LGBT rights. The SPLC lists D. James Kennedy Ministries and its predecessor, Truth in Action, as anti-LGBT hate groups because of what the SPLC describes as the group&#x27;s history of spreading homophobic propaganda, including D. James Kennedy&#x27;s false statement that &quot;homosexuals prey on adolescent boys&quot;, and false claims about the transmission of AIDS. On February 21, 2018, a federal magistrate judge recommended that the suit be dismissed with prejudice, concluding that D. James Kennedy Ministries could not show that it had been libeled. On September 19, 2019, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Myron H. Thompson, who ruled that the &quot;SPLC&#x27;s labeling of the group as [a hate group] is protected by the First Amendment.&quot;

In March 2018, several journalists, including Max Blumenthal, were mentioned in an article by Alexander Reid Ross which the SPLC retracted after receiving complaints from those journalists that the article falsely portrayed them as &quot;white supremacists, fascists, anti-Semites, and engaging in a conspiracy with the Putin regime to promote such views&quot;; the Center&#x27;s letter explaining its retraction of the article apologizing to Blumenthal and the other journalists who believed they had been falsely portrayed. The SPLC was criticized for taking down this article and was accused of caving in to pressure. The article argued that the dissemination of conspiracy theories around such issues as the Syrian Civil War (about the White Helmets and child refugees) were intended to co-opt leftist anti-imperialism in the service of a fascist agenda. Subsequently, the SPLC retracted two other articles written by Alexander Reid Ross on the topic of Russian campaigns to influence Western public opinion.

In 2019, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) sued the SPLC for designating the CIS as a hate group, claiming it constituted fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The SPLC defended its decision and said the group &quot;richly deserved&quot; the designation. Cornell law professor William A. Jacobson, a longtime critic of the SPLC, criticized the listing of the CIS as &quot;pos[ing] a danger of being exploited as an excuse to silence speech and to skew political debate.&quot; The lawsuit was dismissed in September 2019 for failure to state a claim; Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that the CIS could not show any violations of the RICO statute.

In February 2019, several months after resigning as chairman of the Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes filed a defamation lawsuit against the SPLC. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Alabama over the SPLC&#x27;s designation of the Proud Boys as a &quot;general hate&quot; group. The SPLC took the lawsuit &quot;as a compliment&quot; and an indication that &quot;we&#x27;re doing our job.&quot; On its website, SPLC said that &quot;McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term &#x27;alt-right&#x27; while espousing some of its central tenets&quot; and that the group&#x27;s &quot;rank-and-file [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.&quot; In addition to defamation, McInnes claimed tortious interference with economic advantage, &quot;false light invasion of privacy&quot; and &quot;aiding and abetting employment discrimination&quot;. The day after filing the suit, McInnes announced that he had been re-hired by the Canadian far-right media group The Rebel Media. The SPLC filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in July 2019.

==Projects and publishing platforms==

===Hate Map===
In 1990, the SPLC began to publish an &quot;annual census of hate groups operating within the United States&quot;.

====Classifications and listings of hate groups====

Over the years the classifications and listings of hate groups expanded to reflect current social phenomena. By the 2000s, the term &quot;hate groups&quot; included organizations it has assessed either &quot;attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics&quot;. The SPLC says that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, and leafleting. While some of these activities may include criminal acts, such as violence, not all the activities tracked by the SPLC are illegal or criminal.

Groups that have been included as &quot;hate groups&quot; by the SPLC who reject that labelling include, for example, self-described men&#x27;s rights groups A Voice for Men and Return of Kings, which the SPLC had described as &quot;male supremacist&quot;, according to a 2018 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article.

The SPLC&#x27;s identification and listings of hate groups and extremists has been the subject of controversy. The authors of the 2009 book &quot;The White Separatist Movement in the United States&quot;, sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile, who used the findings of the SPLC and other watchdog groups, said that the SPLC chose its causes with funding and donations in mind. Concerns have been raised that people and groups designated as &quot;hate groups&quot; by the SPLC were being targeted by protests or violence that prevent them from speaking. The SPLC stands behind the vast majority of its listings. In 2018, David A. Graham wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that while criticism of the SPLC had long existed, the sources of such criticism have expanded recently to include &quot;sympathetic observers and fellow researchers on hate groups&quot; concerned about the organization &quot;mixing its research and activist strains&quot;.

Laird Wilcox, an analyst of political fringe movements, has said the SPLC has taken an incautious approach to assigning the labels &quot;hate group&quot; and &quot;extremist&quot;. Mark Potok of Southern Poverty Law Center responded that Wilcox &quot;had an ax to grind for a great many years&quot; and engaged in name calling against others doing anti-racist work.

In 2009, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) argued that allies of America&#x27;s Voice and Media Matters had used the SPLC designation of FAIR as a hate group to &quot;engage in unsubstantiated, invidious name-calling, smearing millions of people in this movement.&quot; FAIR and its leadership have been criticized by the SPLC as being sympathetic to, or overtly supportive of, white supremacist and identitarian ideologies, as the group&#x27;s late founder had stated his belief that the United States should remain a majority-white country.

In 2010, a group of Republican politicians and conservative organizations criticized the SPLC in full-page advertisements in two Washington, D.C., newspapers for what they described as &quot;character assassination&quot; because the SPLC had listed the Family Research Council (FRC) as a hate group for alleged &quot;defaming of gays and lesbians&quot;.

In August 2012, a gunman entered the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Family Research Council with the intent to kill employees and smear Chick-fil-A sandwiches on the victims&#x27; faces. The gunman, Floyd Lee Corkins, stated that he chose FRC as a target because it was listed as an anti-gay group on the SPLC&#x27;s website. A security guard was wounded but stopped Corkins from shooting anyone else. In the wake of the shooting, the SPLC was again criticized for listing FRC as an anti-gay hate group, including by liberal columnist Dana Milbank, while others defended the categorization. The SPLC defended its listing of anti-gay hate groups, stating that the groups were selected not because of their religious views, but on their &quot;propagation of known falsehoods about LGBT people... that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities.&quot;

===SPLC Hatewatch (blog)===
The Hatewatch blog, created in , publishes the work of its teams, including investigative journalists who &quot;monitor and expose&quot; activities of the &quot;American radical right&quot;. Initially, its precursor—the &quot;Klanwatch&quot; project—which was established in 1981, focused on monitoring KKK activities. The Hatewatch blog, along with the &quot;Teaching Tolerance&quot; program and the Intelligence Report, highlights SPLC&#x27;s work.&quot;&quot;

An in-depth 2018 Hatewatch report examined the roots and evolution of black-on-white crime rhetoric, from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 2010s. According to the report, &quot;[m]isrepresented crime statistics&quot; on &quot;black-on-white crime&quot; have become a &quot;main propaganda point of America&#x27;s hate movement&quot;. The report described how Dylann Roof, the perpetrator of the June 17, 2015, Charleston church shooting had written in his manifesto about his 2012 Google search for &quot;black-on-white crime&quot;, which led him to be convinced that black men were a &quot;physical threat to white people&quot;. One of the first sources was the Council of Conservative Citizens. The report shows that on November 22, 2015, then-Presidential Candidate Donald Trump retweeted a chart that had &quot;originated from a neo-Nazi account&quot; which displayed &quot;bogus crime statistics&quot;. The SPLC report cited a November 23, 2005, &quot;Washington Post&quot; article that fact checked the figures in the graph. The tweet said that &quot;81 percent of whites are killed by black people&quot;, while the FBI says that only 15 percent of white murder victims are killed by a black perpetrator; the large majority of white murder victims are killed by white perpetrators.

===Teaching Tolerance===

SPLC&#x27;s projects include the website Tolerance.org, which provides news on tolerance issues, education for children, guidebooks for activists, and resources for parents and teachers. The website received Webby Awards in 2002 and 2004 for Best Activism. Another product of Tolerance.org is the &quot;10 Ways To Fight Hate on Campus: A Response Guide for College Activists&quot; booklet.

===Anti-LGBTQ+ hate===
In 2023, the SPLC released a report entitled &quot;Combating Anti-LGBTQ+ Pseudoscience Through Accessible Informative Narratives&quot; that said &quot;a large, yet closely-maintained network of far right groups and individuals have increasingly relied on pseudoscience as a tool to advance their cause.&quot;

===Documentaries===
The SPLC also produces documentary films. Two have won Academy Awards for Documentary Short Subject: &quot;A Time for Justice&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mighty Times: The Children&#x27;s March&quot; (2004). In 2017 the SPLC began developing a six-part series with Black Box Management to document &quot;the normalization of far-right extremism in the age of Donald Trump.&quot;

===Cooperation with law enforcement===
The SPLC cooperates with, and offers training to, law enforcement agencies, focusing &quot;on the history, background, leaders, and activities of far-right extremists in the United States&quot;. The FBI has partnered with the SPLC and many other organizations &quot;to establish rapport, share information, address concerns, and cooperate in solving problems&quot; related to hate crimes. In a November 2018 briefing of law enforcement officials in Clark County, Washington, concerning the Proud Boys FBI agents suggested the use of various websites for more information, including that of the SPLC. The organization urged Chicago to fire a policeman who allegedly hid his association with the Proud Boys.

=== &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; ===
Since 1981, the SPLC&#x27;s Intelligence Project has published a quarterly &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; that monitors what the SPLC considers radical right hate groups and extremists in the United States. The &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; provides information regarding organizational efforts and tactics of these groups and persons, and has been cited by scholars, including Rory M. McVeigh and David Mark Chalmers, as a reliable and comprehensive source on U.S. right-wing extremism and hate groups. In 2013 the SPLC donated the &quot;Intelligence Project&quot;″s documentation to the library of Duke University. The SPLC also publishes &quot;HateWatch Weekly&quot;, a newsletter that follows racism and extremism, and the &quot;Hatewatch&quot; blog, whose subtitle is &quot;Keeping an Eye on the Radical Right&quot;.

Two articles published in &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; have won &quot;Green Eyeshade Excellence in Journalism&quot; awards from the Society of Professional Journalists. &quot;Communing with the Council&quot;, written by Heidi Beirich and Bob Moser, took third place for Investigative Journalism in the Magazine Division in 2004, and &quot;Southern Gothic&quot;, by David Holthouse and Casey Sanchez, took second place for Feature Reporting in the Magazine Division in 2007.

Since 2001, the SPLC has released an annual issue of the &quot;Intelligence Project&quot; called &quot;Year in Hate&quot;, later renamed &quot;Year in Hate and Extremism&quot;, in which it presents statistics on the numbers of hate groups in America. The current format of the report covers racial hate groups, nativist hate groups, and other right-wing extremist groups such as groups within the Patriot Movement. Jesse Walker, writing in &quot;Reason.com&quot;, criticized the 2016 report, questioning whether the count was reliable, as it focused on the number of groups rather than the number of people in those groups or the size of the groups. Walker gives the example that the 2016 report itself concedes an increase in the number of KKK groups could be due to two large groups falling apart, leading to members creating smaller local groups.

==Notable publications and media coverage on the SPLC==

In May 1988, journalist John Egerton published his article entitled &quot;The Klan Basher&quot; in &quot;Foundation News&quot;. In July 1988, he published a similar article, entitled &quot;Poverty Palace: How the Southern Poverty Law Center got rich fighting the Klan&quot;, in &quot;The Progressive.&quot; A 1991 book entitled &quot;Shades of Gray: Dispatches from the Modern South&quot; included a chapter by Egerton on this theme, entitled &quot;Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center&quot;.

In 1994, the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; published an eight-part critical report on the SPLC. The series was nominated as one of three finalists for a 1995 Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism for &quot;its probe of questionable management practices and self-interest at the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation&#x27;s best-endowed civil rights charity.&quot; According to the series, the SPLC had exaggerated the threat posed by the Klan and similar groups in order to raise money, discriminated against black employees, and used misleading fundraising tactics. From 1984 to 1994, the SPLC raised about $62 million in contributions and spent about $21 million on programs, according to the newspaper. SPLC&#x27;s co-founder Joe Levin rejected the &quot;Advertiser&#x27;s&quot; claims, saying that the series showed a lack of interest in the center&#x27;s programs. Levin said that the newspaper had an obsessive interest in the SPLC&#x27;s financial affairs and Mr. Dees&#x27; personal life, in order to smear the center and Mr. Dees.&quot;

David Mark Chalmers, who is the author of &quot;Hooded Americanism: The History of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; published in 1987, also wrote a follow-up, &quot;Backfire, Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan Helped the Civil Rights Movement&quot; in 2003, in which he described the SPLC&#x27;s role in the decline of the Klan.

In 2006, a chapter on the SPLC by was published in the &quot;Encyclopedia of American civil liberties&quot; which described the history of the SPLC and its co-founder Morris Dees.

The National Geographic Channel television series included the 2008 episode entitled &quot;Inside American Terror&quot;, which covered the SPLC&#x27;s successful lawsuit against the Ku Klux Klan&quot;.&quot;

In their 2009 book &quot;The White Separatist Movement in the United States: &#x27;White Power, White Pride!″&quot;, sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile said that the SPLC&#x27;s &quot;Klanwatch Intelligence Reports&quot; portrayed the KKK as more &quot;militant and dangerous with higher turnouts&quot; than what they personally had observed.

Laurence Leamer&#x27;s 2016 book, entitled &quot;The Lynching: The Epic Courtroom Battle That Brought Down the Klan&quot;, centered around the role played by Morris Dees as SPLC&#x27;s co-founder, who won the case against the Klan which provided the family of teenager Michael Donald, lynched by the Klan in 1981 in Mobile, Alabama with restitution from the Klan.

In 2013, J.M. Berger wrote in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the SPLC and ADL, arguing that they are &quot;not objective purveyors of data&quot;.

In their 2015 book &quot;Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices&quot;, Roger Chapman and James Ciment cited the criticism of SPLC by journalist Ken Silverstein, who said that the SPLC&#x27;s fundraising appeals and finances were deceptive.

Conservative columnist Marc Thiessen, in a June 2018 column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said that the SPLC had lost its credibility and &quot;become a caricature of itself&quot;.

In the wake of Morris Dees&#x27; dismissal in March 2019, former SPLC staffer Bob Moser published an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Reckoning of Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center&quot;, in which he described his disappointment with what the SPLC had become.

The English Wikipedia community considers the Southern Poverty Law Center to be &quot;generally reliable on topics related to hate groups and extremism in the United States&quot;, but notes that it is &quot;&quot; and should be attributed.
