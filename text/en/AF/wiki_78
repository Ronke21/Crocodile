<text>In mathematics, a set &quot;A&quot; is a subset of a set &quot;B&quot; if all elements of &quot;A&quot; are also elements of &quot;B&quot;; &quot;B&quot; is then a superset of &quot;A&quot;. It is possible for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to be equal; if they are unequal, then &quot;A&quot; is a proper subset of &quot;B&quot;. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion (or sometimes containment). &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot; may also be expressed as &quot;B&quot; includes (or contains) &quot;A&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is included (or contained) in &quot;B&quot;. A &quot;k&quot;-subset is a subset with &quot;k&quot; elements.

When quantified, formula_1 is represented as formula_2

One can prove the statement formula_1 by applying a proof technique known as the element argument:Let sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be given. To prove that formula_4

# suppose that &quot;a&quot; is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of A
# show that &quot;a&quot; is an element of &quot;B&quot;.
The validity of this technique can be seen as a consequence of universal generalization: the technique shows formula_5 for an arbitrarily chosen element &quot;c&quot;. Universal generalisation then implies formula_6 which is equivalent to formula_4 as stated above.

==Definition==
If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are sets and every element of &quot;A&quot; is also an element of &quot;B&quot;, then:
:*&quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot;, denoted by formula_1, or equivalently,
:* &quot;B&quot; is a superset of &quot;A&quot;, denoted by formula_9
If &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot;, but &quot;A&quot; is not equal to &quot;B&quot; (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of &quot;A&quot;), then: 
:*&quot;A&quot; is a proper (or strict) subset of &quot;B&quot;, denoted by formula_10, or equivalently,
:* &quot;B&quot; is a proper (or strict) superset of &quot;A&quot;, denoted by formula_11

The empty set, written formula_12 or formula_13 has no elements, and therefore is vacuously a subset of any set &quot;X&quot;. 

==Basic properties==

* &quot;Reflexivity&quot;: Given any set formula_14, formula_15
* &quot;Transitivity&quot;: If formula_1 and formula_17, then formula_18
* &quot;Antisymmetry&quot;: If formula_1 and formula_20, then formula_21.

===Proper subset===
* &quot;Irreflexivity&quot;: Given any set formula_14, formula_23 is False.
* &quot;Transitivity&quot;: If formula_10 and formula_25, then formula_26
* &quot;Asymmetry&quot;: If formula_10 then formula_28 is False.

==⊂ and ⊃ symbols==
Some authors use the symbols formula_29 and formula_30 to indicate and respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols formula_31 and formula_32 For example, for these authors, it is true of every set &quot;A&quot; that formula_33 (a reflexive relation).

Other authors prefer to use the symbols formula_29 and formula_30 to indicate (also called strict) subset and superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning as and instead of the symbols formula_36 and formula_37 This usage makes formula_31 and formula_29 analogous to the inequality symbols formula_40 and formula_41 For example, if formula_42 then &quot;x&quot; may or may not equal &quot;y&quot;, but if formula_43 then &quot;x&quot; definitely does not equal &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;is&quot; less than &quot;y&quot; (an irreflexive relation). Similarly, using the convention that formula_29 is proper subset, if formula_4 then &quot;A&quot; may or may not equal &quot;B&quot;, but if formula_46 then &quot;A&quot; definitely does not equal &quot;B&quot;.

== Examples of subsets ==

* The set A = {1, 2} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3}, thus both expressions formula_1 and formula_10 are true.
* The set D = {1, 2, 3} is a subset (but a proper subset) of E = {1, 2, 3}, thus formula_49 is true, and formula_50 is not true (false).
* The set {&quot;x&quot;: &quot;x&quot; is a prime number greater than 10} is a proper subset of {&quot;x&quot;: &quot;x&quot; is an odd number greater than 10}
* The set of natural numbers is a proper subset of the set of rational numbers; likewise, the set of points in a line segment is a proper subset of the set of points in a line. These are two examples in which both the subset and the whole set are infinite, and the subset has the same cardinality (the concept that corresponds to size, that is, the number of elements, of a finite set) as the whole; such cases can run counter to one&#x27;s initial intuition.
* The set of rational numbers is a proper subset of the set of real numbers. In this example, both sets are infinite, but the latter set has a larger cardinality (or ) than the former set.

Another example in an Euler diagram:

==Power set==
The set of all subsets of formula_51 is called its power set, and is denoted by formula_52.

The inclusion relation formula_31 is a partial order on the set formula_52 defined by formula_55. We may also partially order formula_52 by reverse set inclusion by defining formula_57

For the power set formula_58 of a set &quot;S&quot;, the inclusion partial order is—up to an order isomorphism—the Cartesian product of formula_59 (the cardinality of &quot;S&quot;) copies of the partial order on formula_60 for which formula_61 This can be illustrated by enumerating formula_62, and associating with each subset formula_63 (i.e., each element of formula_64) the &quot;k&quot;-tuple from formula_65 of which the &quot;i&quot;th coordinate is 1 if and only if formula_66 is a member of &quot;T&quot;.

The set of all formula_67-subsets of formula_14 is denoted by formula_69, in analogue with the notation for binomial coefficients, which count the number of formula_67-subsets of an formula_71-element set. In set theory, the notation formula_72 is also common, especially when formula_67 is a transfinite cardinal number.

== Other properties of inclusion ==
* A set &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot; if and only if their intersection is equal to A. Formally:
:formula_74
* A set &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot; if and only if their union is equal to B. Formally:
:formula_75
* A finite set &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot;, if and only if the cardinality of their intersection is equal to the cardinality of A. Formally:
:formula_76
* The subset relation defines a partial order on sets. In fact, the subsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra under the subset relation, in which the join and meet are given by intersection and union, and the subset relation itself is the Boolean inclusion relation.
* Inclusion is the canonical partial order, in the sense that every partially ordered set formula_77 is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The ordinal numbers are a simple example: if each ordinal &quot;n&quot; is identified with the set formula_78 of all ordinals less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;, then formula_79 if and only if formula_80

<text>Stonehenge is a prehistoric megalithic structure on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, west of Amesbury. It consists of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing stones, each around high, wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting horizontal lintel stones, held in place with mortise and tenon joints, a feature unique among contemporary monuments. Inside is a ring of smaller bluestones. Inside these are free-standing trilithons, two bulkier vertical sarsens joined by one lintel. The whole monument, now ruinous, is aligned towards the sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the densest complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred &quot;tumuli&quot; (burial mounds).

Stonehenge was constructed in several phases beginning about 3100 BC and continuing until about 1600 BC. The famous circle of large sarsen stones were placed between 2600 BC and 2400 BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about 3100 BC. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the bluestones were given their current positions between 2400 and 2200 BC, although they may have been at the site as early as 3000 BC.

One of the most famous landmarks in the United Kingdom, Stonehenge is regarded as a British cultural icon. It has been a legally protected scheduled monument since the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 was passed. The site and its surroundings were added to UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986. Stonehenge is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage; the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.

Stonehenge could have been a burial ground from its earliest beginnings. Deposits containing human bone date from as early as 3000 BC, when the ditch and bank were first dug, and continued for at least another 500 years.

==Etymology==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites Ælfric&#x27;s 10th-century glossary, in which &quot;henge-cliff&quot; is given the meaning , or stone; thus, the &quot;stanenges&quot; or &quot;Stanheng&quot; &quot;not far from Salisbury&quot; recorded by 11th-century writers are &quot;stones supported in the air&quot;. In 1740, William Stukeley notes: &quot;Pendulous rocks are now called henges in Yorkshire ... I doubt not, Stonehenge in Saxon signifies the hanging stones.&quot; Christopher Chippindale&#x27;s &quot;Stonehenge Complete&quot; gives the derivation of the name &quot;Stonehenge&quot; as coming from the Old English words , and either (because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones) or or or (though elsewhere in his book, Chippindale cites the etymology).

The &quot;henge&quot; portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as henges. Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch. As often happens in archaeological terminology, this is a holdover from antiquarian use.

==Early history==
Mike Parker Pearson, leader of the Stonehenge Riverside Project based around Durrington Walls, noted that Stonehenge appears to have been associated with burial from the earliest period of its existence:

Stonehenge evolved in several construction phases spanning at least 1500 years. There is evidence of large-scale construction on and around the monument that perhaps extends the landscape&#x27;s time frame to 6500 years. Dating and understanding the various phases of activity are complicated by disturbance of the natural chalk by periglacial effects and animal burrowing, poor quality early excavation records, and a lack of accurate, scientifically verified dates. The modern phasing most generally agreed to by archaeologists is detailed below. Features mentioned in the text are numbered and shown on the plan, right.

===Before the monument (from 8000 BC)===
Archaeologists have found four, or possibly five, large Mesolithic postholes (one may have been a natural tree throw), which date to around 8000 BC, beneath the nearby old tourist car park in use until 2013. These held pine posts around in diameter, which were erected and eventually rotted in place. Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east–west alignment which may have had ritual significance. Another Mesolithic astronomical site in Britain is Warren Field in Aberdeenshire, which is considered the world&#x27;s oldest lunisolar calendar, corrected yearly by observing the midwinter solstice. Similar but later sites have been found in Scandinavia. A settlement that may have been contemporaneous with the posts has been found at Blick Mead, a reliable year-round spring from Stonehenge.

Salisbury Plain was then still wooded, but, 4,000 years later, during the earlier Neolithic, people built a causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood&#x27;s Ball, and long barrow tombs in the surrounding landscape. In approximately 3500 BC, a Stonehenge Cursus was built north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the trees and develop the area. Other previously overlooked stone or wooden structures and burial mounds may date as far back as 4000 BC. Charcoal from the &#x27;Blick Mead&#x27; camp from Stonehenge (near the Vespasian&#x27;s Camp site) has been dated to 4000 BC. The University of Buckingham&#x27;s Humanities Research Institute believes that the community who built Stonehenge lived here for several millennia, making it potentially &quot;one of the pivotal places in the history of the Stonehenge landscape.&quot;

===Stonehenge 1 (c. 3100 BC)===
The first monument consisted of a circular bank and ditch enclosure made of Late Cretaceous (Santonian Age) Seaford chalk, measuring about in diameter, with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south. It stood in open grassland on a slightly sloping spot. The builders placed the bones of deer and oxen in the bottom of the ditch, as well as some worked flint tools. The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch, and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial. The ditch was continuous but had been dug in sections, like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area. The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank. This first stage is dated to around 3100 BC, after which the ditch began to silt up naturally. Within the outer edge of the enclosed area is a circle of 56 pits, each about in diameter, known as the Aubrey holes after John Aubrey, the 17th-century antiquarian who was thought to have first identified them. These pits and the bank and ditch together are known as the Palisade or Gate Ditch. The pits may have contained standing timbers creating a timber circle, although there is no excavated evidence of them. A recent excavation has suggested that the Aubrey Holes may have originally been used to erect a bluestone circle. If this were the case, it would advance the earliest known stone structure at the monument by some 500 years.

In 2013, a team of archaeologists, led by Mike Parker Pearson, excavated more than 50,000 cremated bone fragments, from 63 individuals, buried at Stonehenge. These remains were originally buried individually in the Aubrey holes, but were exhumed in 1920 during an excavation by William Hawley, who considered them unimportant and in 1935 re-buried them together in one hole, Aubrey Hole 7. Physical and chemical analysis of the remains has shown that the cremated were almost equally men and women, and included some children. There is evidence that the underlying chalk beneath the graves was crushed by substantial weight, so the team concluded that the first bluestones brought from Wales were probably used as grave markers. Radiocarbon dating of the remains has put the date of the site 500 years earlier than previously estimated, to around 3000 BC. A 2018 study of the strontium content of the bones found that many of the individuals buried there around the time of construction had probably come from near the source of the bluestone in Wales and had not extensively lived in the area of Stonehenge before death.

Between 2017 and 2021, studies by Professor Parker Pearson (UCL) and his team suggested that the bluestones used in Stonehenge had been moved there following dismantling of a stone circle of identical size to the first known Stonehenge circle (110m) at the Welsh site of Waun Mawn in the Preseli Hills. It had contained bluestones, one of which showed evidence of having been reused in Stonehenge. The stone was identified by its unusual pentagonal shape and by luminescence soil dating from the filled-in sockets which showed the circle had been erected around 3400–3200 BC, and dismantled around 300–400 years later, consistent with the dates attributed to the creation of Stonehenge. The cessation of human activity in that area at the same time suggested migration as a reason, but it is believed that other stones may have come from other sources.

===Stonehenge 2 (c. 2900 BC)===
The second phase of construction occurred approximately between 2900 and 2600 BC. The number of postholes dating to the early third millennium BC suggests that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during this period. Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance, and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance. The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes, being only around in diameter, and are much less regularly spaced. The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up. At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later, intrusive, cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument&#x27;s inception. It seems that whatever the holes&#x27; initial function, it changed to become a funerary one during Phase two. Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure&#x27;s ditch and at other points within the monument, mostly in the eastern half. Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an enclosed cremation cemetery at this time, the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles. Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch-fill. Dating evidence is provided by the late Neolithic grooved ware pottery that has been found in connection with the features from this phase.

===Stonehenge 3 I (c. 2600 BC)===
Archaeological excavation has indicated that around 2600 BC, the builders abandoned timber in favour of stone and dug two concentric arrays of holes (the Q and R Holes) in the centre of the site. These stone sockets are only partly known (hence on present evidence are sometimes described as forming &#x27;crescents&#x27;); however, they could be the remains of a double ring. Again, there is little firm dating evidence for this phase. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today. It is generally accepted that the bluestones (some of which are made of dolerite, an igneous rock), were transported by the builders from the Preseli Hills, away in modern-day Pembrokeshire in Wales. Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by the Irish Sea Glacier although there is no evidence of glacial deposition within southern central England. A 2019 publication announced that evidence of Megalithic quarrying had been found at quarries in Wales identified as a source of Stonehenge&#x27;s bluestone, indicating that the bluestone was quarried by human agency and not transported by glacial action.

The long-distance human transport theory was bolstered in 2011 by the discovery of a megalithic bluestone quarry at Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Crymych in Pembrokeshire, which is the most likely place for some of the stones to have been obtained. Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens (sandstone), used later as lintels. The stones, which weighed about two tons, could have been moved by lifting and carrying them on rows of poles and rectangular frameworks of poles, as recorded in China, Japan and India. It is not known whether the stones were taken directly from their quarries to Salisbury Plain or were the result of the removal of a venerated stone circle from Preseli to Salisbury Plain to &quot;merge two sacred centres into one, to unify two politically separate regions, or to legitimise the ancestral identity of migrants moving from one region to another&quot;. Evidence of a stone circle at Waun Mawn near Preseli, which could have contained some or all of the stones in Stonehenge, has been found, including a hole from a rock that matches the unusual cross-section of a Stonehenge bluestone &quot;like a key in a lock&quot;. Each monolith measures around in height, between wide and around thick. 

What was to become known as the Altar Stone was believed to have been derived from the Senni Beds, perhaps from east of the Preseli Hills in the Brecon Beacons. Work announced in 2024 by a team from Curtin University, who analysed the chemical composition of fragments of rock that had fallen off the Altar Stone, and dated them, found that the best match was with rocks in the Orcadian Basin (which includes Caithness, Orkney, and the Moray Firth regions of north-eastern Scotland). The researchers stated that this implies the stone was transported some , and thus demonstrates cultural links between Southern England and Northern Scotland.

The north-eastern entrance was widened at this time, with the result that it precisely matched the direction of the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset of the period. This phase of the monument was abandoned unfinished, however; the small standing stones were apparently removed and the Q and R holes purposefully backfilled.

The Heel Stone, a Tertiary sandstone, may also have been erected outside the north-eastern entrance during this period. It cannot be accurately dated and may have been installed at any time during phase 3. At first, it was accompanied by a second stone, which is no longer visible. Two, or possibly three, large portal stones were set up just inside the north-eastern entrance, of which only one, the fallen Slaughter Stone, long, now remains. Other features, loosely dated to phase 3, include the four Station Stones, two of which stood atop mounds. The mounds are known as &quot;barrows&quot; although they do not contain burials. Stonehenge Avenue, a parallel pair of ditches and banks leading to the River Avon, was also added.

===Stonehenge 3 II (2600 BC to 2400 BC)===

During the next major phase of activity, 30 enormous Oligocene–Miocene sarsen stones (shown grey on the plan) were brought to the site. They came from a quarry around north of Stonehenge, in West Woods, Wiltshire. The stones were dressed and fashioned with mortise and tenon joints before 30 sarsens were erected in a circle of standing stones approximately in diameter, with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top. The lintels were fitted to one another using tongue and groove joints – a woodworking method, again. Each standing stone was around high, wide, and deep, weighing around 26 tons. Each had clearly been worked with the final visual effect in mind: The orthostats widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant when viewed from the ground, while the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument.

The inward-facing surfaces of the stones are smoother and more finely worked than the outer surfaces. The average thickness of the stones is and the average distance between them is . A total of 75 stones would have been needed to complete the circle (60 stones) and the trilithon horseshoe (15 stones). It was thought the ring might have been left incomplete, but an exceptionally dry summer in 2013 revealed patches of parched grass which may correspond to the location of missing sarsens. The lintel stones are each around long, wide and thick. The tops of the lintels are above the ground.

Within this circle stood five trilithons of dressed sarsen stone arranged in a horseshoe shape across, with its open end facing northeast. These huge stones, ten uprights and five lintels, weigh up to 50 tons each. They were linked using complex jointing. They are arranged symmetrically. The smallest pair of trilithons were around tall, the next pair a little higher, and the largest, single trilithon in the south-west corner would have been tall. Only one upright from the Great Trilithon still stands, of which is visible and a further is below ground. The images of a &#x27;dagger&#x27; and 14 &#x27;axeheads&#x27; have been carved on one of the sarsens, known as stone 53; further carvings of axeheads have been seen on the outer faces of stones 3, 4, and 5. The carvings are difficult to date but are morphologically similar to late Bronze Age weapons. Early 21st century laser scanning of the carvings supports this interpretation. The pair of trilithons in the north east are smallest, measuring around in height; the largest, which is in the south-west of the horseshoe, is almost tall.

This ambitious phase has been radiocarbon dated to between 2600 and 2400 BC, slightly earlier than the Stonehenge Archer, discovered in the outer ditch of the monument in 1978, and the two sets of burials, known as the Amesbury Archer and the Boscombe Bowmen, discovered to the west. Analysis of animal teeth found away at Durrington Walls, thought by Parker Pearson to be the &#x27;builders camp&#x27;, suggests that, during some period between 2600 and 2400 BC, as many as 4,000 people gathered at the site for the mid-winter and mid-summer festivals; the evidence showed that the animals had been slaughtered around nine months or 15 months after their spring birth. Strontium isotope analysis of the animal teeth showed that some had been brought from as far afield as the Scottish Highlands for the celebrations.

At about the same time, a large timber circle and a second avenue were constructed at Durrington Walls overlooking the River Avon. The timber circle was oriented towards the rising Sun on the midwinter solstice, opposing the solar alignments at Stonehenge. The avenue was aligned with the setting Sun on the summer solstice and led from the river to the timber circle. Evidence of huge fires on the banks of the Avon between the two avenues also suggests that both circles were linked. They were perhaps used as a procession route on the longest and shortest days of the year. Parker Pearson speculates that the wooden circle at Durrington Walls was the centre of a &#x27;land of the living&#x27;, whilst the stone circle represented a &#x27;land of the dead&#x27;, with the Avon serving as a journey between the two.

=== Stonehenge 3 III (2400 BC to 2280 BC) ===
Later in the Bronze Age, although the exact details of activities during this period are still unclear, the bluestones appear to have been re-erected. They were placed within the outer sarsen circle and may have been trimmed in some way. Like the sarsens, a few have timber-working style cuts in them suggesting that, during this phase, they may have been linked with lintels and were part of a larger structure.

===Stonehenge 3 IV (2280 BC to 1930 BC)===
This phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones. They were arranged in a circle between the two rings of sarsens and in an oval at the centre of the inner ring. Some archaeologists argue that some of these bluestones were from a second group brought from Wales. All the stones formed well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III. The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval at this time and re-erected vertically. Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, as the newly re-installed bluestones were not well-founded and began to fall over. However, only minor changes were made after this phase.

===Stonehenge 3 V (1930 BC to 1600 BC)===
Soon afterwards, the northeastern section of the Phase 3 IV bluestone circle was removed, creating a horseshoe-shaped setting (the Bluestone Horseshoe) which mirrored the shape of the central sarsen Trilithons. This phase is contemporary with the Seahenge site in Norfolk.

===After the monument (1600 BC on)===
The Y and Z Holes are the last known construction at Stonehenge, built about 1600 BC, and the last usage of it was probably during the Iron Age. Roman coins and medieval artefacts have all been found in or around the monument but it is unknown whether the monument was in continuous use throughout British prehistory and beyond, or exactly how it would have been used. Notable is the massive Iron Age hillfort known as Vespasian&#x27;s Camp (despite its name, not a Roman site) built alongside the Avenue near the Avon. A decapitated seventh-century Saxon man was excavated from Stonehenge in 1923. The site was known to scholars during the Middle Ages and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous groups.

==Function and construction==

Stonehenge was produced by a culture that left no written records. Many aspects of Stonehenge, such as how it was built and for what purposes it was used, remain subject to debate. A number of myths surround the stones. The site, specifically the great trilithon, the encompassing horseshoe arrangement of the five central trilithons, the heel stone, and the embanked avenue, are aligned to the sunset of the winter solstice and the opposing sunrise of the summer solstice. A natural landform at the monument&#x27;s location followed this line, and may have inspired its construction. It has been conjectured that the design of the monument included a celestial observatory function, which might allow prediction of eclipse, solstice, equinox and other celestial events important to the builders&#x27; belief system. The excavated remains of culled animal bones suggest that people may have gathered at the site for the winter rather than the summer.

There is little or no direct evidence revealing the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders. Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise due to their massive size. However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as shear legs, have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size. The most common theory of how prehistoric people moved megaliths has them creating a track of logs along which the large stones were rolled. Another megalith transport theory involves the use of a type of sleigh running on a track greased with animal fat. An experiment with a sleigh carrying a 40-ton slab of stone was successfully conducted near Stonehenge in 1995; a team of more than 100 workers managed to push and pull the slab along the journey from the Marlborough Downs.

Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory or as a religious site. In the 1960s, Gerald Hawkins described in detail how the site was apparently set out to observe the Sun and Moon over a recurring 56-year cycle. More recently, two major new theories have been proposed. Geoffrey Wainwright, president of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and Timothy Darvill, of Bournemouth University, have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing—the primeval equivalent of Lourdes. They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves. However, they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well. Isotope analysis indicates that some of the buried individuals were from other regions. A teenage boy buried approximately 1550 BC was raised near the Mediterranean Sea; a metal worker from 2300 BC dubbed the &quot;Amesbury Archer&quot; grew up near the Alpine foothills of Germany; and the &quot;Boscombe Bowmen&quot; probably arrived from Wales or Brittany, France.

On the other hand, Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a ritual landscape and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon. He suggests that the area around Durrington Walls henge was a place of the living, whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead. A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death, to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased. Both explanations were first mooted in the twelfth century by Geoffrey of Monmouth, who extolled the curative properties of the stones and was also the first to advance the idea that Stonehenge was constructed as a funerary monument. 

There are other hypotheses and theories. According to a team of British researchers led by Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield, Stonehenge may have been built as a symbol of &quot;peace and unity&quot;, indicated in part by the fact that at the time of its construction, Britain&#x27;s Neolithic people were experiencing a period of cultural unification.

Stonehenge megaliths include smaller bluestones and larger sarsens (a term for silicified sandstone boulders found in the chalk downs of southern England). The bluestones are composed of dolerite, tuff, rhyolite, or sandstone. The igneous bluestones appear to have originated in the Preseli hills of southwestern Wales, about from the monument. The sandstone Altar Stone may have originated in east Wales. Analysis published in 2020 indicates the sarsens came from West Woods, about from the monument.

Researchers from the Royal College of Art in London have discovered that the monument&#x27;s igneous bluestones possess &quot;unusual acoustic properties&quot; – when struck they respond with a &quot;loud clanging noise&quot;. Rocks with such acoustic properties are frequent in the Carn Melyn ridge of Presili; the Presili village of Maenclochog (Welsh for bell or ringing stones) used local bluestones as church bells until the 18th century. According to the team, these acoustic properties could explain why certain bluestones were hauled such a long distance, a major technical accomplishment at the time. In certain ancient cultures, rocks that ring out, known as lithophonic rocks, were believed to contain mystic or healing powers, and Stonehenge has a history of association with rituals. The presence of these &quot;ringing rocks&quot; seems to support the hypothesis that Stonehenge was a &quot;place for healing&quot; put forward by Darvill, who consulted with the researchers.

== Stonehenge-builders and DNA studies ==
There is evidence to suggest that despite the introduction of farming in the British Isles, the practice of cereal cultivation fell out of favor between 3300 and 1500 BC, with much of the population reverting to a pastoralist subsistence pattern focused on hazelnut gathering and pig and cattle rearing. A majority of the major phases of Stonehenge&#x27;s construction took place during such a period where evidence of large-scale agriculture is equivocal. Similar associations between non-cereal farming subsistence patterns and monumental construction are also seen at Poverty Point and Sannai Maruyama.

===Stonehenge I and II===
Researchers studying DNA extracted from Neolithic human remains across Britain determined that the people who built Stonehenge I and II were closely related to Iberian and Central European Early and Middle Neolithic populations, modelled as having about 75% ancestry from Early European Farmers who came from the Eastern Mediterranean, travelling west from there, and 25% ancestry coming from Western Hunter-Gatherers from western Europe. These farmers moved to Iberia before heading north, reaching Britain in about 4,000 BC. Most of the ancestry of British Neolithic farmers came from the people who followed this route, with a minor contribution from groups who followed the Danube into Central and Western Europe. Their agricultural techniques seem to have come originally from Anatolia, and their mixture appears to have happened primarily on the continent before the Neolithic farmers migrated to Britain.

At the time of their arrival, Britain was inhabited by groups of hunter-gatherers who were the first inhabitants of the island after the last Ice Age ended about 11,700 years ago. The farmers replaced most of the hunter-gatherer population in the British Isles without mixing much with them.

Despite their mostly Aegean ancestry, the paternal (Y-DNA) lineages of Neolithic farmers in Britain were almost exclusively of Western Hunter-Gatherer origin. This was also the case among other megalithic-building populations in northwest Europe, meaning that these populations were descended from a mixture of hunter-gatherer males and farmer females. The dominance of Western Hunter-Gatherer male lineages in Britain and northwest Europe is also reflected in a general &#x27;resurgence&#x27; of hunter-gatherer ancestry, predominantly from males, across western and central Europe in the Middle Neolithic.

===Stonehenge III (megalithic structure)===
At the time the megalithic Stonehenge 3 II was constructed (2600–2400 BC) by Neolithic people, the Bell Beaker people arrived, around 2,500 BC, migrating from mainland Europe. They lived side by side for ca. 500 years, with the Bell Beaker people probably incorporating the henge-structures into their belief-system.

The earliest British individuals associated with the Beaker culture, most likely speakers of Indo-European languages whose ancestors migrated from the Pontic–Caspian steppe, were similar to those from the Rhine. Eventually, there was again a large population replacement in Britain. More than 90% of Britain&#x27;s Neolithic gene pool was replaced with the arrival of the Bell Beaker people, who had approximately 50% WSH ancestry.

==Modern history==

===Archaeological research and restoration===
====1600–1900====
Throughout recorded history, Stonehenge and its surrounding monuments have attracted attention from antiquarians and archaeologists. John Aubrey was one of the first to examine the site with a scientific eye in 1666, and, in his plan of the monument, he recorded the pits that now bear his name, the Aubrey holes. William Stukeley continued Aubrey&#x27;s work in the early eighteenth century, but took an interest in the surrounding monuments as well, identifying (somewhat incorrectly) the Cursus and the Avenue. He also began the excavation of many of the barrows in the area, and it was his interpretation of the landscape that associated it with the Druids. Stukeley was so fascinated with Druids that he originally named Disc Barrows as Druids&#x27; Barrows.

The most accurate early plan of Stonehenge was that made by Bath architect John Wood in 1740. His original annotated survey has now been computer-redrawn and published. Importantly Wood&#x27;s plan was made before the collapse of the southwest trilithon, which fell in 1797 and was restored in 1958.

William Cunnington was the next to tackle the area in the early nineteenth century. He excavated some 24 barrows before digging in and around the stones and discovered charred wood, animal bones, pottery and urns. He also identified the hole in which the Slaughter Stone once stood. Richard Colt Hoare supported Cunnington&#x27;s work and excavated some 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain including on some 200 in the area around the Stones, some excavated in conjunction with William Coxe. To alert future diggers to their work, they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened. Cunnington&#x27;s finds are displayed at the Wiltshire Museum. In 1877, Charles Darwin dabbled in archaeology at the stones, experimenting with the rate at which remains sink into the earth, for his book &quot;The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms&quot;.

Stone 22 fell during a fierce storm on 31 December 1900.

====1901–2000====
William Gowland oversaw the first major restoration of the monument in 1901, which involved the straightening and concrete setting of sarsen stone number 56 which was in danger of falling. In straightening the stone he moved it about half a metre from its original position. Gowland also took the opportunity to further excavate the monument in what was the most scientific dig to date, revealing more about the erection of the stones than the previous 100 years of work had done. During the 1920 restoration, William Hawley, who had excavated nearby Old Sarum, excavated the base of six stones and the outer ditch. He also located a bottle of port in the Slaughter Stone socket left by Cunnington, helped to rediscover Aubrey&#x27;s pits inside the bank and located the concentric circular holes outside the Sarsen Circle called the Y and Z Holes.

Richard Atkinson, Stuart Piggott and John F. S. Stone re-excavated much of Hawley&#x27;s work in the 1940s and 1950s, and discovered the carved axes and daggers on the Sarsen Stones. Atkinson&#x27;s work was instrumental in furthering the understanding of the three major phases of the monument&#x27;s construction.

In 1958, the stones were restored again, when three of the standing sarsens were re-erected and set in concrete bases. The last restoration was carried out in 1963 after stone 23 of the Sarsen Circle fell over. It was again re-erected, and the opportunity was taken to concrete three more stones. Later archaeologists, including Christopher Chippindale of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge and Brian Edwards of the University of the West of England, campaigned to give the public more knowledge of the various restorations and, in 2004, English Heritage included pictures of the work in progress in its book &quot;Stonehenge: A History in Photographs&quot;.

In 1966 and 1967, in advance of a new car park being built at the site, the area of land immediately northwest of the stones was excavated by Faith and Lance Vatcher. They discovered the Mesolithic postholes dating from between 7000 and 8000 BC, as well as a length of a palisade ditch – a V-cut ditch into which timber posts had been inserted that remained there until they rotted away. Subsequent aerial archaeology suggests that this ditch runs from the west to the north of Stonehenge, near the avenue.

Excavations were once again carried out in 1978 by Atkinson and John Evans, during which they discovered the remains of the Stonehenge Archer in the outer ditch, and in 1979 rescue archaeology was needed alongside the Heel Stone after a cable-laying ditch was mistakenly dug on the roadside, revealing a new stone hole next to the Heel Stone.

In the early 1980s, Julian C. Richards led the Stonehenge Environs Project, a detailed study of the surrounding landscape. The project was able to successfully date such features as the Lesser Cursus, Coneybury Henge and several other smaller features.

In 1993, the way that Stonehenge was presented to the public was called &#x27;a national disgrace&#x27; by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. Part of English Heritage&#x27;s response to this criticism was to commission research to collate and bring together all the archaeological work conducted at the monument up to this date. This two-year research project resulted in the publication in 1995 of the monograph &quot;Stonehenge in its landscape&quot;, which was the first publication presenting the complex stratigraphy and the finds recovered from the site. It presented a rephasing of the monument.

====21st century====
More recent excavations include a series of digs held between 2003 and 2008 known as the Stonehenge Riverside Project, led by Mike Parker Pearson. This project mainly investigated other monuments in the landscape and their relationship to the stones—notably, Durrington Walls, where another &quot;Avenue&quot; leading to the River Avon was discovered. The point where the Stonehenge Avenue meets the river was also excavated and revealed a previously unknown circular area which probably housed four further stones, most likely as a marker for the starting point of the avenue.

In April 2008, Tim Darvill of the University of Bournemouth and Geoff Wainwright of the Society of Antiquaries began another dig inside the stone circle to retrieve datable fragments of the original bluestone pillars. They were able to date the erection of some bluestones to 2300 BC, although this may not reflect the earliest erection of stones at Stonehenge. They also discovered organic material from 7000 BC, which, along with the Mesolithic postholes, adds support for the site having been in use at least 4,000 years before Stonehenge was started. In August and September 2008, as part of the Riverside Project, Julian C. Richards and Mike Pitts excavated Aubrey Hole 7, removing the cremated remains from several Aubrey Holes that had been excavated by Hawley in the 1920s, and re-interred in 1935. A licence for the removal of human remains at Stonehenge had been granted by the Ministry of Justice in May 2008, in accordance with the &quot;Statement on burial law and archaeology&quot; issued in May 2008. One of the conditions of the licence was that the remains should be reinterred within two years and that in the intervening period they should be kept safely, privately and decently.

A new landscape investigation was conducted in April 2009. A shallow mound, rising to about was identified between stones 54 (inner circle) and 10 (outer circle), clearly separated from the natural slope. It has not been dated but speculation that it represents careless backfilling following earlier excavations seems disproved by its representation in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrations. There is some evidence that, as an uncommon geological feature, it could have been deliberately incorporated into the monument at the outset. A circular, shallow bank, little more than high, was found between the Y and Z hole circles, with a further bank lying inside the &quot;Z&quot; circle. These are interpreted as the spread of spoil from the original Y and Z holes, or more speculatively as hedge banks from vegetation deliberately planted to screen the activities within.

In 2010, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project discovered a &quot;henge-like&quot; monument less than away from the main site. This new hengiform monument was subsequently revealed to be located &quot;at the site of Amesbury 50&quot;, a round barrow in the Cursus Barrows group.

In November 2011, archaeologists from University of Birmingham announced the discovery of evidence of two huge pits positioned within the Stonehenge Cursus pathway, aligned in celestial position towards midsummer sunrise and sunset when viewed from the Heel Stone. The new discovery was made as part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project which began in the summer of 2010. The project uses non-invasive geophysical imaging technique to reveal and visually recreate the landscape. According to team leader Vince Gaffney, this discovery may provide a direct link between the rituals and astronomical events to activities within the Cursus at Stonehenge.

In December 2011, geologists from University of Leicester and the National Museum of Wales announced the discovery of the source of some of the rhyolite fragments found in the Stonehenge debitage. These fragments do not seem to match any of the standing stones or bluestone stumps. The researchers have identified the source as a long rock outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-felin (), near Pont Saeson in north Pembrokeshire, located from Stonehenge.

In 2014, the University of Birmingham announced findings including evidence of adjacent stone and wooden structures and burial mounds near Durrington, overlooked previously, that may date as far back as 4000 BC. An area extending to was studied to a depth of three metres with ground-penetrating radar equipment. As many as seventeen new monuments, revealed nearby, may be Late Neolithic monuments that resemble Stonehenge. The interpretation suggests a complex of numerous related monuments. Also included in the discovery is that the cursus track is terminated by two wide, extremely deep pits, whose purpose is still a mystery.

===Origin of sarsens, bluestones and other modern developments===
In July 2020, a study led by David Nash of the University of Brighton concluded that the large sarsen stones were &quot;a direct chemical match&quot; to those found at West Woods near Marlborough, Wiltshire, some 15 miles (25 km) north of Stonehenge. A core sample, originally extracted in 1958, had recently been returned. First the fifty-two sarsens were analysed using methods including x-ray fluorescence spectrometry to determine their chemical composition which revealed they were mostly similar. Then the core was destructively analysed and compared with stone samples from various locations in southern Britain. Fifty of the fifty-two megaliths were found to match sarsens in West Woods, thereby identifying the probable origin of the stones.

During 2017 and 2018, excavations by professor Parker Pearson&#x27;s team at Waun Mawn, a large stone circle site in the Preseli Hills, suggested that the site had originally housed a diameter stone circle of the same size as Stonehenge&#x27;s original bluestone circle, also orientated towards the midsummer solstice.

The circle at Waun Mawn also contained a hole from one stone which had a distinctive pentagonal shape, very closely matching the one pentagonal stone at Stonehenge (stonehole 91 at Waun Mawn / stone 62 at Stonehenge). Soil dating of the sediments within the revealed stone holes, via optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), suggested the absent stones at Waun Mawn had been erected around 3400–3200 BC, and removed around 300–400 years later, a date consistent with theories that the same stones were moved and used at Stonehenge, before later being reorganised into their present locations and supplemented with local sarsens as was already understood. Human activity at Waun Mawn ceased around the same time which has suggested that some people may have migrated to Stonehenge. It has also been suggested that stones from other sources may have been added to Stonehenge, perhaps from other dismantled circles in the region.

Further work in 2021 by Parker Pearson&#x27;s team concluded that the Waun Mawn circle had never been completed, and of the stones which might once have stood at the site, no more than 13 had been removed in antiquity.

In February 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of &quot;vast troves of Neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts&quot; while conducting excavations for the proposed highway tunnel near Stonehenge. The find included Bronze Age graves, late neolithic pottery and C-shaped enclosure on the intended site of the Stonehenge road tunnel. Remains also contained a shale object in one of the graves, burnt flint in C-shaped enclosure and the final resting place of a baby.

In January 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of thousands of prehistoric pits during an electromagnetic induction field survey around Stonehenge. Based on the shape of the pits and the artifacts found inside, the study&#x27;s lead author, Philippe De Smedt, assumed that six of the 9 large pits excavated were made by prehistoric humans. One of the oldest was about 10000 years old and contained hunting tools.

In August 2024, the journal Nature published research from a team at Curtin University in Australia identifying the origin of the Altar Stone, which is partially buried by a collapsed sarsen stone, as having come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, some 700 km away.

===Folklore===
====&quot;Heel Stone&quot;, &quot;Friar&#x27;s Heel&quot;, or &quot;Sun-Stone&quot;====
The Heel Stone lies northeast of the sarsen circle, beside the end portion of Stonehenge Avenue. It is a rough stone, above ground, leaning inwards towards the stone circle. It has been known by many names in the past, including &quot;Friar&#x27;s Heel&quot; and &quot;Sun-stone&quot;. At the Summer solstice an observer standing within the stone circle, looking northeast through the entrance, would see the Sun rise in the approximate direction of the Heel Stone, and the Sun has often been photographed over it.

A folk tale relates the origin of the Friar&#x27;s Heel reference.

&quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; attributes this tale to Geoffrey of Monmouth, but though book eight of Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; does describe how Stonehenge was built, the two stories are entirely different.

The name is not unique; there was a monolith with the same name recorded in the nineteenth century by antiquarian Charles Warne at Long Bredy in Dorset.

====Arthurian legend====
The twelfth-century &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), by Geoffrey of Monmouth, includes a legend of Stonehenge&#x27;s origin, describing how Stonehenge was brought from Ireland with the help of the wizard Merlin. Geoffrey&#x27;s story spread widely, with variations of it appearing in adaptations of his work, such as Wace&#x27;s Norman French &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, Layamon&#x27;s Middle English &quot;Brut&quot;, and the Welsh &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;.

According to the tale, the stones of Stonehenge were healing stones, which giants had brought from Africa to Ireland. They had been raised on Mount Killaraus to form a stone circle, known as the Giant&#x27;s Ring or Giant&#x27;s Round. The fifth-century king Aurelius Ambrosius wished to build a great memorial to the British Celtic nobles slain by the Saxons at Salisbury. Merlin advised him to use the Giant&#x27;s Ring. The king sent Merlin and Uther Pendragon (King Arthur&#x27;s father) with 15,000 men to bring it from Ireland. They defeated an Irish army led by Gillomanius, but were unable to move the huge stones. With Merlin&#x27;s help, they transported the stones to Britain and re-erected them as they had stood. Mount Killaraus may refer to the Hill of Uisneach. Although the tale is fiction, archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggests it may hold a &quot;grain of truth&quot;, as evidence suggests the Stonehenge bluestones were brought from the Waun Mawn stone circle on the Irish Sea coast of Wales.

Another legend tells how the invading Saxon king Hengist invited British Celtic warriors to a feast but treacherously ordered his men to massacre the guests, killing 420 of them. Hengist erected Stonehenge on the site to show his remorse for the deed.

===Sixteenth century to present===
Stonehenge has changed ownership several times since King Henry VIII acquired Amesbury Abbey and its surrounding lands. In 1540 Henry gave the estate to the Earl of Hertford. It subsequently passed to Lord Carleton and then the Marquess of Queensberry. The Antrobus family of Cheshire bought the estate in 1824.

====Acquisition for the nation====
Stonehenge was one of several lots put up for auction in 1915 by Sir Cosmo Gordon Antrobus, after he inherited the estate from his brother. The auction by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley estate agents in Salisbury was held on 21 September 1915 and included &quot;Lot 15. Stonehenge with about 30 acres, 2 rods, 37 perches [12.44 ha] of adjoining downland.&quot;

Cecil Chubb bought the site for £6,600 (£ in 2025) and gave it to the nation three years later, with certain conditions attached. Although it has been speculated that he purchased it at the suggestion of – or even as a present for – his wife, in fact he bought it on a whim, as he believed a local man should be the new owner.

====Saving the skyline====

The plot bought by Chubb and gifted to the nation was only in size, and various buildings stood within clear sight of the monument, the most prominent being Stonehenge Aerodrome. Some from the stones, the aerodrome was built during the First World War for the Royal Flying Corps and its large stone and brick hangars dominated the skyline.

In the dry valley at Stonehenge Bottom, a main road junction was built between what would later be designated as the A303 and A344 roads, along with several cottages and a cafe.
In 1927 the land around Stonehenge was put up for auction in three plots. Plot A lay immediately west of the monument and included the (by now disused) Stonehenge Aerodrome, Plot B was to the south on the other side of the main road, and Plot C on the north side included part of the Stonehenge Cursus.

There was interest from developers, and in August 1927 a subscription fund was launched in order to &quot;save the skyline&quot; of the monument. The subscription made rapid progress, with George V as the lead subscriber, and by October 1927 £8,000 had been raised, which was enough to purchase Plot A and start the demolition of the aerodrome. The fund continued for a number of years to secure the remaining land around the henge for the nation, with fundraising for Plot C continuing through 1929.

The land was taken into the management of the National Trust to preserve. The last large aircraft hangar was removed in 1930, and by the middle of the 1930s the aerodrome site was cleared.

More recently the land has been part of a grassland reversion scheme, returning the surrounding fields to native chalk grassland. This process continued in 2022 when the National Heritage Lottery Fund (NHLF) gave a grant to the National Trust to acquire another 170 hectares of the Stonehenge Landscape.

====Neopaganism====
During the twentieth century, Stonehenge began to revive as a place of religious significance, this time by adherents of Neopaganism and New Age beliefs, particularly the Neo-druids. The historian Ronald Hutton would later remark that &quot;it was a great, and potentially uncomfortable, irony that modern Druids had arrived at Stonehenge just as archaeologists were evicting the ancient Druids from it.&quot; The first such Neo-druidic group to make use of the megalithic monument was the Ancient Order of Druids, who performed a mass initiation ceremony there in August 1905, in which they admitted 259 new members into their organisation. This assembly was largely ridiculed in the press, who mocked the fact that the Neo-druids were dressed up in costumes consisting of white robes and fake beards.

The earlier rituals were complemented by the Stonehenge Free Festival, loosely organised by the Polytantric Circle, held between 1972 and 1984, during which time the number of midsummer visitors had risen to around 30,000. However, in 1985, the site was closed to festivalgoers by a High Court injunction. A consequence of the end of the festival in 1985 was the violent confrontation between the police and New Age travellers that became known as the Battle of the Beanfield, when police blockaded a convoy of travellers to prevent them from approaching Stonehenge. Beginning in 1985, the year of the Battle, no access was allowed into the stones at Stonehenge for any religious reason. This &quot;exclusion-zone&quot; policy continued for almost fifteen years: until just before the arrival of the twenty-first century, visitors were not allowed to go into the stones at times of religious significance, the winter and summer solstices, and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.

However, following a European Court of Human Rights ruling obtained by campaigners such as Arthur Uther Pendragon, the restrictions were lifted. The ruling recognized that members of any genuine religion have a right to worship in their own church, and Stonehenge is a place of worship to Neo-Druids, Pagans and other &quot;Earth based&#x27; or &#x27;old&#x27; religions. Meetings were organised by the National Trust and others to discuss the arrangements. In 1998, a party of 100 people was allowed access and these included astronomers, archaeologists, Druids, locals, pagans and travellers. In 2000, an open summer solstice event was held and about seven thousand people attended. In 2001, the numbers increased to about 10,000.

====Setting and access====
When Stonehenge was first opened to the public it was possible to walk among and even climb on the stones, but the stones were roped off in 1977 as a result of serious erosion. Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones but are able to walk around the monument from a short distance away. English Heritage does, however, permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox. Additionally, visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year. Approximately 30,000 local residents are entitled to free admission to Stonehenge under an agreement dating back to 1921.

The access situation and the proximity of the two roads have drawn widespread criticism, highlighted by a 2006 National Geographic survey. In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites, 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations, declaring it to be &quot;in moderate trouble&quot;.

As motorised traffic increased, the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either side—the A344 to Shrewton on the north side, and the A303 to Winterbourne Stoke to the south. Plans to upgrade the A303 and close the A344 to restore the vista from the stones have been considered since the monument became a World Heritage Site. However, the controversy surrounding expensive re-routing of the roads led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions. On 6 December 2007, it was announced that extensive plans to build Stonehenge road tunnel under the landscape and create a permanent visitors&#x27; centre had been cancelled.

In 2009, the government gave approval for a £25 million scheme to create a smaller visitors&#x27; centre and close the A344, although this was dependent on funding and local authority planning consent. In 2010, Wiltshire Council granted planning permission for a centre to the west, and English Heritage confirmed that funds to build it would be available, supported by a £10m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In June 2013 the A344 was closed to begin the work of removing the section of road and replacing it with grass. The centre, designed by Denton Corker Marshall, opened to the public in December 2013.

An announcement in November 2020 stated that a plan to construct a four-lane tunnel for traffic below the site had been approved. This was intended to eliminate the section of the A303 that runs close to the circle. The plan had received opposition from a group of &quot;archaeologists, environmentalists and modern-day druids&quot; according to &quot;National Geographic&quot; but was supported by others who wanted to &quot;restore the landscape to its original setting and improve the experience for visitors&quot;. Opponents of the plan were concerned that artifacts that are underground in the area would be lost or that excavation in the area could de-stabilize the stones, leading to their sinking, shifting or perhaps falling. In July 2023, the Department for Transport announced that, despite the original planning application having been overturned by the High Court in 2021, the Transport Secretary, Mark Harper, had approved plans for a road tunnel.

In February 2024, the High Court in London rejected a fresh bid by campaigners to stop construction of the road tunnel. A further legal challenge was made in the High Court in July 2024. Although this action was dismissed by the High Court in October 2024, the incoming Labour government had already announced that the tunnel would &#x27;not move forward&#x27; on 29 July.

== Vandalism ==

The site has suffered vandalism intermittently for centuries. Until the 17th century, stones disappeared from the site, to be employed at building sites. In the 19th century, tourists employed chisels to cut rock chips off the megaliths as souvenirs.

Although the first years of the &quot;Free Festival&quot; (annual, from 1975 onwards) saw &quot;very little vandalism&quot;, Stonehenge had to be fenced off from 1978 onwards. Later, repeated vandalism in the 1980s and 1990s led the authorities to deploy up to hundreds of police, erect barriers around Stonehenge, and impose exclusion zones up to six kilometres from the archaeological monument. The vandalism of 1984 included defacing the monument with purple spray paint. The government went so far as to close Stonehenge to protect it from vandalism, but in the face of public outcry the government opted to re-open it.

In 2008, two men used a hammer and a screwdriver to take a small chip the size of a 10p coin from the side of the Heel Stone, in what authorities described as &quot;the first vandalism in decades&quot;.

In 2020, the British transport minister was accused of vandalism when he decided that the road through the Stonehenge area would be converted into a tunnel that would pass in the immediate vicinity. The project was decades old, but had repeatedly been delayed because of its cost or the effects on archaeological remains. The historian Tom Holland opined that &quot;To inflict this act of vandalism on this landscape seems unbelievable.&quot; Tunnel opponents considered it &quot;state-sponsored vandalism&quot; even as their case was defeated in court in 2024.
On 19 June 2024, climate protesters from Just Stop Oil vandalised three of the standing stones by spraying orange cornflour powder paint onto them. Wiltshire Police arrested student Niamh Lynch from Oxford and Rajan Naidu from Birmingham. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called it a &quot;disgraceful act of vandalism&quot; to one of the UK&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s oldest and most significant monuments, and called on anyone associated with Just Stop Oil or who donated to them to condemn the act. Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer called the vandalism &quot;outrageous&quot; while deeming Just Stop Oil as &quot;pathetic&quot;, demanding that the activists and anyone else involved with the act &quot;face the full force of the law&quot;. The archaeologist Mike Pitts said the impact of the protest was &quot;potentially quite concerning&quot;, and said that the megaliths were fenced off and guarded to protect their surfaces, which were entirely covered in prehistoric markings that have not been fully analysed. He also expressed concern about possible damage to the diverse lichen patterns on the megalith surfaces. English Heritage called the defacement &quot;extremely upsetting&quot; and began an investigation to assess the damage caused by the paint, before removing it with blown air and reporting that there was &quot;no visible damage&quot; to the stones. The English Heritage webpage for Stonehenge calls for visitors to respect the stones since they form a World Heritage Site, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a place sacred to many. Conversely, Sarah Kerr, a lecturer in archaeology at University College Cork, noted that the effects of climate change pose a much greater threat to Stonehenge and other British heritage sites than Just Stop Oil&#x27;s protest, which was washed away without causing damage.

<doc id="27636" wikidata="Q9372" url="?curid=27636" title="Sima Qian">
<text>Sima Qian ( ; ) was a Chinese historian during the early Han dynasty. He is considered the father of Chinese historiography for the &quot;Shiji&quot; (sometimes translated into English as &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;), a general history of China covering more than two thousand years from the rise of the legendary Yellow Emperor and formation of the first Chinese polity to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, during which Sima wrote. As the first universal history of the world as it was known to the ancient Chinese, the &quot;Shiji&quot; served as a model for official histories for subsequent dynasties across the Sinosphere until the 20th century.

Sima Qian&#x27;s father, Sima Tan, first conceived of the ambitious project of writing a complete history of China, but had completed only some preparatory sketches at the time of his death. After inheriting his father&#x27;s position as court historian in the imperial court, he was determined to fulfill his father&#x27;s dying wish of composing and putting together this epic work of history. However, in 99 BC, he would fall victim to the Li Ling affair for speaking out in defense of the general, who was blamed for an unsuccessful campaign against the Xiongnu. Given the choice of being executed or castrated, he chose the latter in order to finish his historical work. Although he is universally remembered for the &quot;Records&quot;, surviving works indicate that he was also a gifted poet and prose writer, and he was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;Taichu&quot; calendar, which was officially promulgated in 104 BC.

Sima was acutely aware of the importance of his work to posterity and its relationship to his own personal suffering. In the postface of the &quot;Records&quot;, he implicitly compared his universal history of China to the classics of his day, the &quot;Guoyu&quot; by Zuo Qiuming, &quot;Li Sao&quot; by Qu Yuan, and the &quot;Art of War&quot; by Sun Bin, pointing out that their authors all suffered great personal misfortunes before their lasting monumental works could come to fruition. Sima Qian is also depicted in the &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot; by Jin Guliang.

== Early life and education ==
Sima Qian was born at Xiayang in Zuopingyi (near present-day Hancheng, Shaanxi). He was probably born around 145 BC, although some sources say he was born about 135 BC. Around 136 BC, his father Sima Tan was appointed to the position of &quot;grand historian&quot; ( , alternatively &quot;grand scribe&quot; or &quot;grand astrologer&quot;) at the imperial court. The grand historian was a relatively low-ranking official whose main duty was to formulate the yearly calendar, identifying which days were ritually auspicious or inauspicious, and present it to the emperor prior to the new year. His other duties included traveling with the emperor for important rituals and recording daily events both at the court and around the country. By his account, by the age of ten Sima was able to &quot;read the old writings&quot; and was considered to be a promising scholar. Sima grew up in a Confucian environment, and Sima always regarded his historical work as an act of Confucian filial piety.

In 126 BC, around the age of 20, Sima Qian began an extensive tour around China as it existed in the Han dynasty. He started his journey from the imperial capital, Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an), then went south across the Yangtze to Changsha Kingdom (modern Hunan), where he visited the Miluo River site where the Warring States–era poet Qu Yuan was traditionally said to have drowned himself. He then went to seek the burial place of the legendary rulers Yu the Great on Mount Xianglu and Shun in the Jiuyi Mountains (modern Ningyuan County, Hunan). He then went north to Huaiyin (modern Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu) to see the grave of Han dynasty general Han Xin, then continued north to Qufu, the hometown of Confucius, where he studied ritual and other traditional subjects.

==As Han court official==

After his travels, Sima was chosen to be a Palace Attendant in the government, whose duties were to inspect different parts of the country with Emperor Wu in 122 BC. Sima married young and had one daughter. In 110 BC, at the age of 35, Sima Qian was sent westward on a military expedition against some &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes. That year, his father fell ill due to the distress of not being invited to attend the Imperial Feng Sacrifice. Suspecting that his time was running out, he summoned his son back home to take over the historical work he had begun. Sima Tan wanted to follow the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, the first chronicle in the history of Chinese literature.

It appears that Sima Tan was only able to put together an outline of the work before he died. The postface of the completed &quot;Shiji&quot;, there is a short essay on the six philosophical schools that is explicitly attributed to Sima Tan. Otherwise, there are only fragments of the &quot;Shiji&quot; that are speculated to be authored by Sima Tan or based on his notes. Fueled by his father&#x27;s inspiration, Sima Qian spent much of the subsequent decade authoring and compiling the &quot;Shiji&quot; (sometimes translated into English as &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;) and completed it before 91 BC, probably around 94 BC. Three years after the death of his father, Sima Qian assumed his father&#x27;s previous position as &quot;taishi&quot;. In 105 BC, Sima was among the scholars chosen to reform the calendar. As a senior imperial official, Sima was also in the position to offer counsel to the emperor on general affairs of state.

===Li Ling affair===

In 99 BC, Sima became embroiled in the Li Ling affair, where Li Ling and Li Guangli, two military officers who led a campaign against the Xiongnu in the north, were defeated and taken captive. Emperor Wu attributed the defeat to Li Ling, with all government officials subsequently condemning him for it. Sima was the only person to defend Li Ling, who had never been his friend but whom he respected. Emperor Wu interpreted Sima&#x27;s defence of Li as an attack on his brother-in-law, Li Guangli, who had also fought against the Xiongnu without much success, and sentenced Sima to death. At that time, execution could be commuted either by money or castration. Since Sima did not have enough money to atone for his &quot;crime&quot;, he chose the latter and was then thrown into prison, where he endured three years. He described his pain thus: &quot;When you see the jailer you abjectly touch the ground with your forehead. At the mere sight of his underlings you are seized with terror ... Such ignominy can never be wiped away.&quot; Sima called his castration &quot;the worst of all punishments&quot;.

In 96 BC, on his release from prison, Sima chose to live on as a palace eunuch to complete his histories, rather than commit suicide as was expected of a gentleman-scholar who had been disgraced by being castrated. As Sima Qian himself explained in his &quot;Letter to Ren An&quot;:

=== Later years and death ===
Upon his release from prison in 97/96 BC, Sima Qian continued to serve in the Han court as &quot;zhongshuling&quot; (中書令), a court archivist position reserved for eunuchs with considerable status and with higher pay than his previous position of historian.

The &quot;Letter to Ren An&quot; was written by Sima Qian in reply to Ren An in response to the latter&#x27;s involvement in Crown Prince Liu Ju&#x27;s rebellion in 91 BC. This is the last record of Sima Qian in contemporary documents. The letter is a reply to a lost letter by Ren An to Sima Qian, perhaps asking Sima Qian to intercede on his behalf as Ren An was facing execution for accusations of being an opportunist and displaying equivocal loyalty to the emperor during the rebellion. In his reply, Sima Qian stated that he is a mutilated man with no influence at court. Some later historians claimed that Sima Qian himself became implicated in the rebellion as a result of his friendship with Ren An and was executed as part of the purge of the crown prince&#x27;s supporters in court; however, the earliest-attested record of this account dates from the 4th century. Moreover, it has also been pointed out that Sima Qian would have been reluctant to render substantive aid to Ren An, given the severe consequences that he suffered for supporting General Li Ling, as well as Ren An&#x27;s failure to act on his behalf during the Li Ling affair. Although there are many theories regarding the exact dating as well as the true nature and purpose of the &quot;Letter to Ren An&quot;, one common interpretation suggests that the letter, in part, tacitly expressed a refusal to play an active role in securing a reduced punishment for Ren An.

The early-20th-century scholar Wang Guowei stated that there are no reliable records establishing when Sima Qian died. He and most modern historians believe that Sima Qian spent his last days as a scholar in reclusion () after leaving the Han court, perhaps dying around the same time as Emperor Wu in 87/86 BC.

==&quot;Shiji&quot;==

=== Format ===
The &quot;Shiji&quot; totals over 500,000 characters in length, organized into 130 chapters. While the style and form of Chinese historiography was not static over time, the &quot;Shiji&quot; created a permanent standard for quality and style for later scholars. Before Sima, histories focused on recounting particular events or the affairs of a specific region; his idea of a general history guided later historiographers, like Sima Guang and (), authors of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; (1084) and &quot;Tongzhi&quot; (1161) respectively. While the traditional format by which official histories would be organized was codified later by Ban Gu in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (111 AD), historians consider the &quot;Shiji&quot; to have informed Ban&#x27;s work. 

The &quot;jizhuanti&quot; () format divides a work into several different types of chapters, most prominently &#x27;basic annals&#x27; (; &quot;benji&quot;) and &#x27;ordered biographies&#x27; (; &quot;liezhuan&quot;). &quot;Benji&quot; contain biographies for each sovereign, ordered chronologically and organized by dynasty; &quot;liezhuan&quot; contain biographies of influential individuals outside the nobility, sometimes for one prominent individual, but often for two or more people who, in Sima&#x27;s judgment, played comparably important roles. In addition to these namesake categories, there are chapters falling under the categories of &#x27;tables&#x27; (; &quot;biao&quot;) collating graphical chronologies of royalty and nobility, and &#x27;treatises&#x27; (; &quot;shu&quot;) giving historical accounts of topics like music, ritual, or economics. Most importantly, the &#x27;house chronicles&#x27; (; &quot;shijia&quot;) document important events during each ruler&#x27;s reign for each state within the Zhou dynasty, as well as histories of the noble houses established during the Han.

The &quot;Shiji&quot; includes 12 basic annals, 10 tables, 8 treatises, 30 house chronicles, and 70 ordered biographies; with the final ordered biography serving as the postface. This final chapter details the background of how the &quot;Shiji&quot; was composed and compiled, and gives brief justifications for the inclusion of the major topics, events, and individuals in the work. As part of the background, the postface provides a short sketch of the history of the Sima clan, from legendary times to his father Sima Tan. It also details the dying words of Sima Tan, tearfully exhorting the author to compose the present work, and contains a biographical sketch of the author himself. The postface concludes with a self-referential description of the postface as the 70th and last of the Ordered Biographies chapters.

=== Influences and legacy ===

Sima was greatly influenced by Confucius&#x27;s &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, which on the surface is a succinct chronology from the events of the reigns of the twelve dukes of Lu from 722 to 484 BC. Many Chinese scholars have and still do view how Confucius ordered his chronology as the ideal example of how history should be written, especially with regards to what he chose to include and to exclude, and his choice of words as indicating moral judgments. Seen in this light, the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; are a moral guide to the proper way of living. Sima took this view himself as he explained:

Sima saw the &quot;Shiji&quot; as belonging to the same tradition, as he explained in the introduction to chapter 61:
 To resolve this theodical problem, Sima argued that while the wicked may succeed and the good may suffer in their own life-times, it is the historian who ensures that in the end good triumphs. For Sima, the writing of history was no mere antiquarian pursuit, but was rather a vital moral task as the historian would &quot;preserve memory&quot;, and thereby ensure the ultimate victory of good over evil. Sima wrote:

Such a moralizing approach to history with the historian high-guiding the good and evil to provide lessons for the present could be dangerous for the historian as it could bring down the wrath of the state onto the historian as happened to Sima himself. As such, the historian had to tread carefully and often expressed his judgements in a circuitous way designed to fool the censor.

Sima himself stated he was writing in this tradition in the conclusion to chapter 110, writing:

Bearing this in mind, not everything that Sima wrote should be understood as conveying didactic moral lessons. But several historians have suggested that parts of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, such as where Sima placed his section on Confucius&#x27;s use of indirect criticism in the part of the book dealing with the Xiongnu &quot;barbarians&quot; might indicate his disapproval of the foreign policy of the Emperor Wu.

In writing the &quot;Shiji&quot;, Sima initiated a new writing style by presenting history in a series of biographies. His work extends over 130 chapters—not in historical sequence, but divided into particular subjects, including annals, chronicles, and treatises—on music, ceremonies, calendars, religion, economics, and extended biographies. Sima&#x27;s work influenced the writing style of other histories outside of China as well, such as the Korean &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;. Sima adopted a new method in sorting out the historical data and a new approach to writing historical records. At the beginning of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, Sima declared himself a follower of Confucius&#x27;s approach in the &quot;Analects&quot; to &quot;hear much but leave to one side that which is doubtful, and speak with due caution concerning the remainder&quot;. Reflecting these rigorous analytic methods, Sima declared that he would not write about periods of history where there was insufficient documentation. As such, Sima wrote &quot;the ages before the Ch&#x27;in dynasty are too far away and the material on them too scanty to permit a detailed account of them here&quot;. In the same way, Sima discounted accounts in the traditional records that were &quot;ridiculous&quot; such as the pretense that Prince Tan could via the use of magic make the clouds rain grain and horses grow horns. Sima constantly compared accounts found in the manuscripts with what he considered reliable sources like Confucian classics like the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, &quot;Book of Rites&quot;, &quot;Classic of Music&quot;, &quot;I Ching&quot; and &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. When Sima encountered a story that could not be cross-checked with the Confucian classics, he systemically compared the information with other documents. Sima mentioned at least 75 books he used for cross-checking. Furthermore, Sima often questioned people about historical events they had experienced. Sima mentioned after one of his trips across China that: &quot;When I had occasion to pass through Feng and Beiyi I questioned the elderly people who were about the place, visited the old home of Xiao He, Cao Can, Fan Kuai and Xiahou Ying, and learned much about the early days. How different it was from the stories one hears!&quot; Reflecting the traditional Chinese reverence for age, Sima stated that he preferred to interview the elderly as he believed that they were the most likely to supply him with correct and truthful information about what had happened in the past. During one of this trips, Sima mentioned that he was overcome with emotion when he saw the carriage of Confucius together with his clothes and various other personal items that had belonged to Confucius.

=== Innovations and unique features ===
Despite his very large debts to Confucian tradition, Sima was an innovator in four ways. To begin with, Sima&#x27;s work was concerned with the history of the known world. Previous Chinese historians had focused on only one dynasty and/or region. Sima&#x27;s history of 130 chapters began with the legendary Yellow Emperor and extended to his own time, and covered not only China, but also neighboring nations like Korea and Vietnam. In this regard, Sima was significant as the first Chinese historian to treat the peoples living to the north of the Great Wall like the Xiongnu as human beings who were implicitly the equals of the Middle Kingdom, instead of the traditional approach which had portrayed the Xiongnu as savages who had the appearance of humans, but the minds of animals. In his comments about the Xiongnu, Sima refrained from evoking claims about the innate moral superiority of the Han over the &quot;northern barbarians&quot; that were the standard rhetorical tropes of Chinese historians in this period. Likewise, Sima in his chapter about the Xiongnu condemns those advisors who pursue the &quot;expediency of the moment&quot;, that is advise the Emperor to carry policies such as conquests of other nations that bring a brief moment of glory, but burden the state with the enormous financial and often human costs of holding on to the conquered land. Sima was engaging in an indirect criticism of the advisors of the Emperor Wu who were urging him to pursue a policy of aggression towards the Xiongnu and conquer all their land, a policy to which Sima was apparently opposed.

Sima also broke new ground by using more sources like interviewing witnesses, visiting places where historical occurrences had happened, and examining documents from different regions and/or times. Before Chinese historians had tended to use only reign histories as their sources. The &quot;Shiji&quot; was further very novel in Chinese historiography by examining historical events outside of the courts, providing a broader history than the traditional court-based histories had done. Lastly, Sima broke with the traditional chronological structure of Chinese history. Sima instead had divided the &quot;Shiji&quot; into five divisions: the basic annals which comprised the first 12 chapters, the chronological tables which comprised the next 10 chapters, treatises on particular subjects which make up 8 chapters, accounts of the ruling families which take up 30 chapters, and biographies of various eminent people which are the last 70 chapters. The annals follow the traditional Chinese pattern of court-based histories of the lives of various emperors and their families. The chronological tables are graphs recounting the political history of China. The treatises are essays on topics such as astronomy, music, religion, hydraulic engineering and economics. The last section dealing with biographies covers individuals judged by Sima to have made a major impact on the course of history, regardless of whether they were of noble or humble birth and whether they were born in the central states, the periphery, or barbarian lands. Unlike traditional Chinese historians, Sima went beyond the androcentric, nobility-focused histories by dealing with the lives of women and men such as poets, bureaucrats, merchants, comedians/jesters, assassins, and philosophers. The treatises section, the biographies sections and the annals section relating to the Qin dynasty (as a former dynasty, there was more freedom to write about the Qin than there was about the reigning Han dynasty) that make up 40% of the &quot;Shiji&quot; have aroused the most interest from historians and are the only parts of the &quot;Shiji&quot; that have been translated into English.

When Sima placed his subjects was often his way of expressing obliquely moral judgements. Empress Lü and Xiang Yu were the effective rulers of China during reigns Hui of the Han and Yi of Chu, respectively, so Sima placed both their lives in the basic annals. Likewise, Confucius is included in the fourth section rather the fifth where he properly belonged as a way of showing his eminent virtue. The structure of the &quot;Shiji&quot; allowed Sima to tell the same stories in different ways, which allowed him to pass his moral judgements. For example, in the basic annals section, the Emperor Gaozu is portrayed as a good leader whereas in the section dealing with his rival Xiang Yu, the Emperor is portrayed unflatteringly. Likewise, the chapter on Xiang presents him in a favorable light whereas the chapter on Gaozu portrays him in more darker colors. At the end of most of the chapters, Sima usually wrote a commentary in which he judged how the individual lived up to traditional Chinese values like filial piety, humility, self-discipline, hard work and concern for the less fortunate. Sima analyzed the records and sorted out those that could serve the purpose of &quot;Shiji&quot;. He intended to discover the patterns and principles of the development of human history. Sima also emphasized, for the first time in Chinese history, the role of individual men in affecting the historical development of China and his historical perception that a country cannot escape from the fate of growth and decay.

Unlike the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, which was written under the supervision of the imperial dynasty, &quot;Shiji&quot; was a privately written history since he refused to write &quot;Shiji&quot; as an official history covering only those of high rank. The work also covers people of the lower classes and is therefore considered a &quot;veritable record&quot; of the darker side of the dynasty. In Sima&#x27;s time, literature and history were not seen as separate disciplines as they are now, and Sima wrote his &quot;magnum opus&quot; in a very literary style, making extensive use of irony, sarcasm, juxtaposition of events, characterization, direct speech and invented speeches, which led the American historian Jennifer Jay to describe parts of the &quot;Shiji&quot; as reading more like a historical novel than a work of history. For an example, Sima tells the story of a Chinese eunuch named Zhonghang Yue who became an advisor to the Xiongnu kings. Sima provides a long dialogue between Zhonghang and an envoy sent by the Emperor Wen of China during which the latter disparages the Xiongnu as &quot;savages&quot; whose customs are barbaric while Zhonghang defends the Xiongnu customs as either justified and/or as morally equal to Chinese customs, at times even morally superior as Zhonghang draws a contrast between the bloody succession struggles in China where family members would murder one another to be Emperor vs. the more orderly succession of the Xiongnu kings. The American historian Tamara Chin wrote that though Zhonghang did exist, the dialogue is merely a &quot;literacy device&quot; for Sima to make points that he could not otherwise make. The favorable picture of the traitor Zhonghang who went over to the Xiongnu who bests the Emperor&#x27;s loyal envoy in an ethnographic argument about what is the morally superior nation appears to be Sima&#x27;s way of attacking the entire Chinese court system where the Emperor preferred the lies told by his sycophantic advisors over the truth told by his honest advisors as inherently corrupt and depraved. The point is reinforced by the fact that Sima has Zhonghang speak the language of an idealized Confucian official whereas the Emperor&#x27;s envoy&#x27;s language is dismissed as &quot;mere twittering and chatter&quot;. Elsewhere in the &quot;Shiji&quot; Sima portrayed the Xiongnu less favorably, so the debate was almost certainly more Sima&#x27;s way of criticizing the Chinese court system and less genuine praise for the Xiongnu.

Sima has often been criticized for &quot;historizing&quot; myths and legends as he assigned dates to mythical and legendary figures from ancient Chinese history together with what appears to be suspiciously precise genealogies of leading families over the course of several millennia (including his own where he traces the descent of the Sima family from legendary emperors in the distant past). However, archaeological discoveries in recent decades have confirmed aspects of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, and suggested that even if the sections of the &quot;Shiji&quot; dealing with the ancient past are not totally true, at least Sima wrote down what he believed to be true. In particular, archaeological finds have confirmed the basic accuracy of the &quot;Shiji&quot; including the reigns and locations of tombs of ancient rulers.

==Literary figure==
Sima&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; is respected as a model of biographical literature with high literary value and still stands as a textbook for the study of classical Chinese. Sima&#x27;s works were influential to Chinese writing, serving as ideal models for various types of prose within the neo-classical (&quot;renaissance&quot; ) movement of the Tang–Song period. The great use of characterisation and plotting also influenced fiction writing, including the classical short stories of the middle and late medieval period (Tang-Ming) as well as the vernacular novel of the late imperial period. Sima had immense influence on historiography not only in China, but also in Japan and Korea. For centuries afterwards, the &quot;Shiji&quot; was regarded as the greatest history book written in Asia. Sima is little known in the English-speaking world as a full translation of the &quot;Shiji&quot; in English has not yet been completed.

His influence was derived primarily from the following elements of his writing: his skillful depiction of historical characters using details of their speech, conversations, and actions; his innovative use of informal, humorous, and varied language; and the simplicity and conciseness of his style. Even the 20th-century literary critic Lu Xun regarded &quot;Shiji&quot; as &quot;the historians&#x27; most perfect song, a &#x27;Li Sao&#x27; without the rhyme&quot; () in his &quot;Outline of Chinese Literary History&quot; ().

===Other literary works===
Sima&#x27;s famous letter to his friend Ren An about his sufferings during the Li Ling Affair and his perseverance in writing &quot;Shiji&quot; is today regarded as a highly admired example of literary prose style, studied widely in China even today. The &quot;Letter to Ren An&quot; contains the quote, &quot;Men have always had but one death. For some it is as weighty as Mount Tai; for others it is as insignificant as a goose down. The difference is what they use it for.&quot; () This quote has become one of the most well known in all of Chinese literature. In modern times, Chairman Mao paraphrased this quote in a speech in which he paid tribute to a fallen PLA soldier.

Sima Qian wrote eight rhapsodies (&quot;fu&quot;), which are listed in the bibliographic treatise of the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. All but one, the &quot;Rhapsody in Lament for Gentlemen who do not Meet their Time&quot; () have been lost, and even the surviving example is probably not complete.

==Astronomer/astrologer==
Sima and his father both served as the &quot;taishi&quot; (太史) of the Former Han dynasty, a position which includes aspects of being a historian, a court scribe, calendarist, and court astronomer/astrologer. At that time, the astrologer had an important role, responsible for interpreting and predicting the course of government according to the influence of the Sun, Moon, and stars, as well as other astronomical and geological phenomena such as solar eclipses and earthquakes, which depended on revising and upholding an accurate calendar.

Before compiling &quot;Shiji&quot;, Sima Qian was involved in the creation of the 104 BC &quot;Taichu&quot; Calendar 太初暦 (太初 became the new era name for Emperor Wu and means &quot;supreme beginning&quot;), a modification of the Qin calendar. This is the first Chinese calendar whose full method of calculation (暦法) has been preserved.

The minor planet &quot;12620 Simaqian&quot; is named in his honour.

==Family==

Sima Qian is the son of court astrologer (太史令) Sima Tan, who is a descendant of Qin general Sima Cuo (司馬錯), the commander of Qin army in the state&#x27;s conquest of Ba and Shu.

Before his castration, Sima Qian was recorded to have two sons and a daughter. While little is recorded of his sons, his daughter later married Yang Chang (楊敞) of the Yang clan of Hongnong, and had sons Yang Zhong (楊忠) and Yang Yun (楊惲; died February 55 BC). It was Yang Yun who hid his grandfather&#x27;s great work, and decided to release it during the reign of Emperor Xuan.

=== Unsubstantiated descendants ===
According to local legend, Sima Qian had two sons, the older named Sima Lin (司馬臨) and younger named Sima Guan (司馬觀), who fled the capital to Xu Village (徐村) in what is now Shanxi province during the Li Ling affair, for fear of falling victim to familial extermination. They changed their surnames to Tong (同 = 丨+ 司) and Féng (馮 = 仌 + 馬), respectively, to hide their origins while continuing to secretly offer sacrifices to the Sima ancestors. To this day, people living in the village with surnames Feng and Tong are forbidden from intermarrying on the grounds that the relationship would be incestuous.

According to the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Wang Mang sent an expedition to search for and ennoble a male-line descent of Sima Qian as 史通子 (&quot;Viscount of Historical Mastery&quot;), although it was not recorded who received this title of nobility. A Qing dynasty stele 重修太史廟記 (&quot;Records of the Renovation of the Temple of the Grand Historian&quot;) erected in the nearby county seat Han City (韓城) claims that the title was given to the grandson of Sima Lin.

<doc id="27637" wikidata="Q334823" url="?curid=27637" title="Structural geology">
<text>Structural geology is the study of the three-dimensional distribution of rock units with respect to their deformational histories. The primary goal of structural geology is to use measurements of present-day rock geometries to uncover information about the history of deformation (strain) in the rocks, and ultimately, to understand the stress field that resulted in the observed strain and geometries. This understanding of the dynamics of the stress field can be linked to important events in the geologic past; a common goal is to understand the structural evolution of a particular area with respect to regionally widespread patterns of rock deformation (e.g., mountain building, rifting) due to plate tectonics.

==Use and importance==
The study of geologic structures has been of prime importance in economic geology, both petroleum geology and mining geology. Folded and faulted rock strata commonly form traps that accumulate and concentrate fluids such as petroleum and natural gas. Similarly, faulted and structurally complex areas are notable as permeable zones for hydrothermal fluids, resulting in concentrated areas of base and precious metal ore deposits. Veins of minerals containing various metals commonly occupy faults and fractures in structurally complex areas. These structurally fractured and faulted zones often occur in association with intrusive igneous rocks. They often also occur around geologic reef complexes and collapse features such as ancient sinkholes. Deposits of gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and other metals, are commonly located in structurally complex areas.

Structural geology is a critical part of engineering geology, which is concerned with the physical and mechanical properties of natural rocks. Structural fabrics and defects such as faults, folds, foliations and joints are internal weaknesses of rocks which may affect the stability of human engineered structures such as dams, road cuts, open pit mines and underground mines or road tunnels.

Geotechnical risk, including earthquake risk can only be investigated by inspecting a combination of structural geology and geomorphology. In addition, areas of karst landscapes which reside atop caverns, potential sinkholes, or other collapse features are of particular importance for these scientists. In addition, areas of steep slopes are potential collapse or landslide hazards.

Environmental geologists and hydrogeologists need to apply the tenets of structural geology to understand how geologic sites impact (or are impacted by) groundwater flow and penetration. For instance, a hydrogeologist may need to determine if seepage of toxic substances from waste dumps is occurring in a residential area or if salty water is seeping into an aquifer.

Plate tectonics is a theory developed during the 1960s which describes the movement of continents by way of the separation and collision of crustal plates. It is in a sense structural geology on a planet scale, and is used throughout structural geology as a framework to analyze and understand global, regional, and local scale features.

==Methods==

Structural geologists use a variety of methods to (first) measure rock geometries, (second) reconstruct their deformational histories, and (third) estimate the stress field that resulted in that deformation.

===Geometries===

Primary data sets for structural geology are collected in the field. Structural geologists measure a variety of planar features (bedding planes, foliation planes, fold axial planes, fault planes, and joints), and linear features (stretching lineations, in which minerals are ductilely extended; fold axes; and intersection lineations, the trace of a planar feature on another planar surface).

====Measurement conventions====
The inclination of a planar structure in geology is measured by &quot;strike and dip&quot;. The strike is the line of intersection between the planar feature and a horizontal plane, taken according to the right hand convention, and the dip is the magnitude of the inclination, below horizontal, at right angles to strike. For example; striking 25 degrees East of North, dipping 45 degrees Southeast, recorded as N25E,45SE. &lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, dip and dip direction may be used as this is absolute. Dip direction is measured in 360 degrees, generally clockwise from North. For example, a dip of 45 degrees towards 115 degrees azimuth, recorded as 45/115. Note that this is the same as above.

The term &quot;hade&quot; is occasionally used and is the deviation of a plane from vertical i.e. (90°-dip).

Fold axis plunge is measured in dip and dip direction (strictly, plunge and azimuth of plunge). The orientation of a fold axial plane is measured in strike and dip or dip and dip direction.

Lineations are measured in terms of dip and dip direction, if possible. Often lineations occur expressed on a planar surface and can be difficult to measure directly. In this case, the lineation may be measured from the horizontal as a &quot;rake&quot; or &quot;pitch&quot; upon the surface.

Rake is measured by placing a protractor flat on the planar surface, with the flat edge horizontal and measuring the angle of the lineation clockwise from horizontal. The orientation of the lineation can then be calculated from the rake and strike-dip information of the plane it was measured from, using a stereographic projection.

If a fault has lineations formed by movement on the plane, e.g.; slickensides, this is recorded as a lineation, with a rake, and annotated as to the indication of throw on the fault.

Generally it is easier to record strike and dip information of planar structures in dip/dip direction format as this will match all the other structural information you may be recording about folds, lineations, etc., although there is an advantage to using different formats that discriminate between planar and linear data.

==== Plane, fabric, fold and deformation conventions ====
The convention for analysing structural geology is to identify the planar structures, often called &quot;planar fabrics&quot; because this implies a textural formation, the linear structures and, from analysis of these, unravel deformations.

Planar structures are named according to their order of formation, with original sedimentary layering the lowest at S0. Often it is impossible to identify S0 in highly deformed rocks, so numbering may be started at an arbitrary number or given a letter (SA, for instance). In cases where there is a bedding-plane foliation caused by burial metamorphism or diagenesis this may be enumerated as S0a.

If there are folds, these are numbered as F1, F2, etc. Generally the axial plane foliation or cleavage of a fold is created during folding, and the number convention should match. For example, an F2 fold should have an S2 axial foliation.

Deformations are numbered according to their order of formation with the letter D denoting a deformation event. For example, D1, D2, D3. Folds and foliations, because they are formed by deformation events, should correlate with these events. For example, an F2 fold, with an S2 axial plane foliation would be the result of a D2 deformation.

Metamorphic events may span multiple deformations. Sometimes it is useful to identify them similarly to the structural features for which they are responsible, e.g.; M2. This may be possible by observing porphyroblast formation in cleavages of known deformation age, by identifying metamorphic mineral assemblages created by different events, or via geochronology.

Intersection lineations in rocks, as they are the product of the intersection of two planar structures, are named according to the two planar structures from which they are formed. For instance, the intersection lineation of a S1 cleavage and bedding is the L1-0 intersection lineation (also known as the cleavage-bedding lineation).

Stretching lineations may be difficult to quantify, especially in highly stretched ductile rocks where minimal foliation information is preserved. Where possible, when correlated with deformations (as few are formed in folds, and many are not strictly associated with planar foliations), they may be identified similar to planar surfaces and folds, e.g.; L1, L2. For convenience some geologists prefer to annotate them with a subscript S, for example Ls1 to differentiate them from intersection lineations, though this is generally redundant.

==== Stereographic projections ====

Stereographic projection is a method for analyzing the nature and orientation of deformation stresses, lithological units and penetrative fabrics wherein linear and planar features (structural strike and dip readings, typically taken using a compass clinometer) passing through an imagined sphere are plotted on a two-dimensional grid projection, facilitating more holistic analysis of a set of measurements. Stereonet developed by Richard W. Allmendinger is widely used in the structural geology community.

====Rock macro-structures====
On a large scale, structural geology is the study of the three-dimensional interaction and relationships of stratigraphic units within terranes of rock or geological regions.

This branch of structural geology deals mainly with the orientation, deformation and relationships of stratigraphy (bedding), which may have been faulted, folded or given a foliation by some tectonic event. This is mainly a geometric science, from which &quot;cross sections&quot; and three-dimensional &quot;block models&quot; of rocks, regions, terranes and parts of the Earth&#x27;s crust can be generated.

Study of regional structure is important in understanding orogeny, plate tectonics and more specifically in the oil, gas and mineral exploration industries as structures such as faults, folds and unconformities are primary controls on ore mineralisation and oil traps.

Modern regional structure is being investigated using seismic tomography and seismic reflection in three dimensions, providing unrivaled images of the Earth&#x27;s interior, its faults and the deep crust. Further information from geophysics such as gravity and airborne magnetics can provide information on the nature of rocks imaged to be in the deep crust.

====Rock microstructures====

Rock microstructure or &quot;texture&quot; of rocks is studied by structural geologists on a small scale to provide detailed information mainly about metamorphic rocks and some features of sedimentary rocks, most often if they have been folded. &lt;br&gt;
Textural study involves measurement and characterisation of foliations, crenulations, metamorphic minerals, and timing relationships between these structural features and mineralogical features. &lt;br&gt;
Usually this involves collection of hand specimens, which may be cut to provide petrographic thin sections which are analysed under a petrographic microscope. &lt;br&gt;
Microstructural analysis finds application also in multi-scale statistical analysis, aimed to analyze some rock features showing scale invariance.

===Kinematics===
Geologists use rock geometry measurements to understand the history of strain in rocks. Strain can take the form of brittle faulting and ductile folding and shearing. Brittle deformation takes place in the shallow crust, and ductile deformation takes place in the deeper crust, where temperatures and pressures are higher.

===Stress fields===
By understanding the constitutive relationships between stress and strain in rocks, geologists can translate the observed patterns of rock deformation into a stress field during the geologic past. The following list of features are typically used to determine stress fields from deformational structures.
*In perfectly brittle rocks, faulting occurs at 30° to the greatest compressional stress according to Byerlee&#x27;s Law.
*The greatest compressive stress is normal to fold axial planes.

=== Modeling ===
For economic geology such as petroleum and mineral development, as well as research, modeling of structural geology is becoming increasingly important. 2D and 3D models of structural systems such as anticlines, synclines, fold and thrust belts, and other features can help better understand the evolution of a structure through time. Without modeling or interpretation of the subsurface, geologists are limited to their knowledge of the surface geological mapping. If only reliant on the surface geology, major economic potential could be missed by overlooking the structural and tectonic history of the area.

==Characterization of the mechanical properties of rock==
The mechanical properties of rock play a vital role in the structures that form during deformation deep below the earth&#x27;s crust. The conditions in which a rock is present will result in different structures that geologists observe above ground in the field. The field of structural geology tries to relate the formations that humans see to the changes the rock went through to get to that final structure. Knowing the conditions of deformation that lead to such structures can illuminate the history of the deformation of the rock.

Temperature and pressure play a huge role in the deformation of rock. At the conditions under the earth&#x27;s crust of extreme high temperature and pressure, rocks are ductile. They can bend, fold or break. Other vital conditions that contribute to the formation of structure of rock under the earth are the stress and strain fields.

===Stress-strain curve===
Stress is a pressure, defined as a directional force over area. When a rock is subjected to stresses, it changes shape. When the stress is released, the rock may or may not return to its original shape. That change in shape is quantified by strain, the change in length over the original length of the material in one dimension. Stress induces strain which ultimately results in a changed structure.

Elastic deformation refers to a reversible deformation. In other words, when stress on the rock is released, the rock returns to its original shape. Reversible, linear, elasticity involves the stretching, compressing, or distortion of atomic bonds. Because there is no breaking of bonds, the material springs back when the force is released. This type of deformation is modeled using a linear relationship between stress and strain, i.e. a Hookean relationship.

:formula_1

Where σ denotes stress, formula_2 denotes strain, and E is the elastic modulus, which is material dependent. The elastic modulus is, in effect, a measure of the strength of atomic bonds.

Plastic deformation refers to non-reversible deformation. The relationship between stress and strain for permanent deformation is nonlinear. Stress has caused permanent change of shape in the material by involving the breaking of bonds.

One mechanism of plastic deformation is the movement of dislocations by an applied stress. Because rocks are essentially aggregates of minerals, we can think of them as poly-crystalline materials. Dislocations are a type of crystallographic defect which consists of an extra or missing half plane of atoms in the periodic array of atoms that make up a crystal lattice. Dislocations are present in all real crystallographic materials.

===Hardness===
Hardness is difficult to quantify. It is a measure of resistance to deformation, specifically permanent deformation. There is precedent for hardness as a surface quality, a measure of the abrasiveness or surface-scratching resistance of a material. If the material being tested, however, is uniform in composition and structure, then the surface of the material is only a few atomic layers thick, and measurements are of the bulk material. Thus, simple surface measurements yield information about the bulk properties. Ways to measure hardness include:
* Mohs Scale
* Dorry abrasion test
* Deval abrasion test
* Indentation hardness
Indentation hardness is used often in metallurgy and materials science and can be thought of as resistance to penetration by an indenter.

===Toughness===
Toughness can be described best by a material&#x27;s resistance to cracking. During plastic deformation, a material absorbs energy until fracture occurs. The area under the stress-strain curve is the work required to fracture the material. The toughness modulus is defined as:
:formula_3

Where formula_4 is the ultimate tensile strength, and formula_5 is the strain at failure. The modulus is the maximum amount of energy per unit volume a material can absorb without fracturing. From the equation for modulus, for large toughness, high strength and high ductility are needed. These two properties are usually mutually exclusive. Brittle materials have low toughness because low plastic deformation decreases the strain (low ductility). Ways to measure toughness include: Page impact machine and Charpy impact test.

===Resilience===
Resilience is a measure of the elastic energy absorbed of a material under stress. In other words, the external work performed on a material during deformation. The area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve is the strain energy absorbed per unit volume. The resilience modulus is defined as:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the yield strength of the material and E is the elastic modulus of the material. To increase resilience, one needs increased elastic yield strength and decreased modulus of elasticity.

<text>A spermatozoon (; also spelled spermatozoön; : spermatozoa; ) is a motile sperm cell produced by male animals relying on internal fertilization. A spermatozoon is a moving form of the haploid cell that is the male gamete that joins with an ovum to form a zygote. (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.)

Sperm cells contribute approximately half of the nuclear genetic information to the diploid offspring (excluding, in most cases, mitochondrial DNA). In mammals, the sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing an X chromosome will lead to a female (XX) offspring, while one bearing a Y chromosome will lead to a male (XY) offspring. Sperm cells were first observed in Antonie van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s laboratory in 1677.

==Mammalian spermatozoa==

===Humans===
The sperm cell of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is the small reproductive cell produced by males, and can only survive in warm environments; upon leaving the body, it starts to degrade, thereby decreasing the total sperm quality. Sperm cells normally come in two types, &quot;female&quot; and &quot;male&quot;, named for the resulting sex of the fertilized zygote each produces after fusing with the ovum. Sperm cells that produce female (karyotype XX) offspring carry an X-chromosome, while sperm cells that produce male (XY) offspring carry a Y-chromosome. Errors of meiosis may lead to the formation of sperm containing different arrangements of sex chromosomes, either altogether missing (&quot;monosomy&quot;, designated &quot;0&quot;), or in multiples (&quot;trisomy&quot;), such as &quot;XX&quot;, &quot;XY&quot;, etc… some of the conditions known as Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) are the result of fertilization by such defective sperm.

A human sperm cell consists of a flat, disc shaped head approximately , and a tail, known as a flagellum long. The flagellum propels the sperm cell at about . Sperm have an olfactory guidance mechanism, and after reaching the fallopian tubes, must undergo a period of capacitation before penetration of the ovum.

Head It has a compact nucleus with only chromatic substance and is surrounded by only a thin rim of cytoplasm. Above the nucleus lies a cap-like structure called the acrosome, formed by modification of the Golgi body, which secretes the enzyme spermlysin (&quot;hyaluronidase, corona-penetrating enzyme, zona lysin,&quot; or &quot;acrosin&quot;), that is necessary for fertilization. As the spermatozoon approaches the ovum, it undergoes the acrosome reaction in which the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm&#x27;s head, exposing the contents of the acrosome.

Neck It is the smallest part, long, with a proximal centriole parallel to the base of the nucleus, perpendicular to the distal centriole. The proximal centriole is retained in the mature spermatozoon; the distal centriole disappears after axoneme assembly. The proximal centriole enters into the ovum, which has no centriole, and starts the first cleavage division of the zygote thus formed. The distal centriole gives rise to the axial filament which forms the tail and has a (9+2) arrangement. A transitory membrane called the &quot;Manchette&quot; lies in the midpiece.

Midpiece It has 10–14 spirals of mitochondria surrounding the axial filament in the cytoplasm. It provides motility, and hence is called the powerhouse of the sperm. It also has a ring centriole (annulus) that form a diffusion barrier between the midpiece and the principal piece and serve as a stabilizing structure for tail rigidity.

Tail: The flagellum is the longest part at approximately , having an axial filament surrounded by cytoplasm and plasma membrane, but at the posterior end the axial filament is naked. The flagellum gives movement to the cell.

Semen has an alkaline nature and the spermatozoa do not reach full motility (hypermotility) until they reach the vagina, where the alkaline pH is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids. This gradual process takes 20–30 minutes. During this period, fibrinogen from the seminal vesicles forms a clot, securing and protecting the sperm. Just as they become hypermotile, fibrinolysin from the prostate gland dissolves the clot, allowing the sperm to progress optimally.

The spermatozoon is characterized by a minimum of cytoplasm and the most densely packed DNA known in eukaryotes. Compared to mitotic chromosomes in somatic cells, sperm DNA is at least sixfold more highly condensed.

The specimen contributes with DNA/chromatin, a centriole, and perhaps also an oocyte-activating factor (OAF). It may also contribute with paternal messenger RNA (mRNA), also contributing to embryonic development.
 The human spermatozoon contains at least 7500 different proteins.

Human sperm genetics has been associated with human evolution, per a 2020 study.

In humans, recombination rates differ between maternal and paternal DNA:

* Maternal DNA: Recombines approximately 42 times on average.
* Paternal DNA: Recombines approximately 27 times on average.

===DNA damage and repair===
DNA damages present in spermatozoa in the period after meiosis but before fertilization may be repaired in the fertilized egg, but if not repaired, can have serious deleterious effects on fertility and the developing embryo. Human spermatozoa are particularly vulnerable to free radical attack and the generation of oxidative DNA damage. (see e.g. 8-Oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine)

Exposure of males to certain lifestyle, environmental or occupational hazards may increase the risk of aneuploid spermatozoa. In particular, risk of aneuploidy is increased by tobacco smoking, and occupational exposure to benzene, insecticides, and perfluorinated compounds. Increased aneuploidy of spermatozoa often occurs in association with increased DNA damage. DNA fragmentation and increased in situ DNA susceptibility to denaturation, the features similar to these seen during apoptosis of somatic cells, characterize abnormal spermatozoa in cases of male infertility.

Although DNA repair has long been considered impossible in human spermatozoa due to the high level of DNA compaction in these cells, human spermatozoa possess a truncated base excision repair pathway that is mediated by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1). Thus mature spermatozoa appear to have a limited capacity to mount a DNA repair response to oxidative stress.

===Avoidance of immune system response===

Glycoprotein molecules on the surface of ejaculated sperm cells are recognized by all human female immune systems, and interpreted as a signal that the cell should not be rejected. The female immune system might otherwise attack sperm in the reproductive tract. The specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells are also utilized by some cancerous and bacterial cells, some parasitic worms, and HIV-infected white blood cells, thereby avoiding an immune response from the host organism.

The blood-testis barrier, maintained by the tight junctions between the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules, prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa in the testis and the blood vessels (and immune cells circulating within them) within the interstitial space. This prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatogenesis.

==Spermatozoa in other organisms==

===Animals===
Fertilization relies on spermatozoa for most sexually reproductive animals.

Some species of fruit fly produce the largest known spermatozoon found in nature. &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; produces sperm that can be up to 1.8 mm, while its relative &quot;Drosophila bifurca&quot; produces the largest known spermatozoon, measuring over 58 mm in length. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the entire sperm, tail included, gets incorporated into the oocyte cytoplasm, however, for &quot;Drosophila bifurca&quot; only a small portion of the tail enters the oocyte.

The wood mouse &quot;Apodemus sylvaticus&quot; possesses spermatozoa with falciform morphology. Another characteristics which makes these gametocytes unique is the presence of an apical hook on the sperm head. This hook is used to attach to the hooks or to the flagella of other spermatozoa. Aggregation is caused by these attachments and mobile trains result. These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are a means by which fertilization is promoted.

The postmeiotic phase of mouse spermatogenesis is very sensitive to environmental genotoxic agents, because as male germ cells form mature spermatozoa they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage. Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing spermatozoa, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases spermatozoa-derived chromosomal aberrations. Treatment of male mice with melphalan, a bifunctional alkylating agent frequently employed in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an unrepaired state as germ cells progress through DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development. Such unrepaired DNA damages in spermatozoa, after fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.

Sea urchins such as &quot;Arbacia punctulata&quot; are ideal organisms to use in sperm research, they spawn large numbers of sperm into the sea, making them well-suited as model organisms for experiments.

The spermatozoa of marsupials are usually longer than those of placental mammals.

===Plants, algae and fungi===
The gametophytes of bryophytes, ferns and some gymnosperms produce motile sperm cells, contrary to pollen grains employed in most gymnosperms and all angiosperms. This renders sexual reproduction in the absence of water impossible, since water is a necessary medium for sperm and egg to meet. Algae and lower plant sperm cells are often multi-flagellated (see image) and thus morphologically different from animal spermatozoa.

Some algae and fungi produce non-motile sperm cells, called spermatia. In higher plants and some algae and fungi, fertilization involves the migration of the sperm nucleus through a fertilization tube (e.g. pollen tube in higher plants) to reach the egg cell.

==Spermatozoa production in mammals==
Spermatozoa are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation, the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside an oviduct.

In assisted reproductive technology, normozoospermia is referred to a total amount of &gt;39 mill ejaculated, &gt;32% with progressive motility and &gt;4% normal morphology. Also, a normal ejaculation in humans must have a volume over 1.5 ml, being an excessive volume 6 ml per ejaculation (hyperspermia). An insufficient volume is called hypospermia. These problems are related to several complications in spermatozoa production, for example:
* Hyperspermia: usually provoked because of prostate inflammation.
* Hypospermia: an incomplete ejaculation, usually referred to an androgen deficit (hypoandrogenism) or obstruction in some part of the ejaculatory duct. In laboratory conditions, is also due to a partial loss of the sample.
* Aspermia: there is no ejaculation. It could happen due to retrograde ejaculation, anatomical or neurological diseases or anti-hypertensive drugs.

==Spermatozoa activation==

Approaching the egg cell is a rather complex, multistep process of chemotaxis guided by different chemical substances/stimuli on individual levels of phylogeny. One of the most significant, common signaling characters of the event is that a prototype of professional chemotaxis receptors, formyl peptide receptor (60,000 receptor/cell) as well as the activator ability of its ligand formyl Met-Leu-Phe have been demonstrated in the surface membrane even in the case of human sperms. 
Mammalian sperm cells become even more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called sperm activation. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by calcium ionophores &quot;in vitro&quot;, progesterone released by nearby cumulus cells and binding to ZP3 of the zona pellucida. The cumulus cells are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid, and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows.

The initial change is called &quot;hyperactivation&quot;, which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic.

A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails. The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with ion channels formed by proteins called CatSper. These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ions to pass. The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium. The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization.

The second process in sperm activation is the acrosome reaction. This involves releasing the contents of the acrosome, which disperse, and the exposure of enzymes attached to the inner acrosomal membrane of the sperm. This occurs after the sperm first meets the egg. This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing. There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the acrosome to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg.

ZP3, one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida, then binds to a partner molecule on the sperm. Enzymes on the inner acrosomal membrane digest the zona pellucida. After the sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, part of the sperm&#x27;s cell membrane then fuses with the egg cell&#x27;s membrane, and the contents of the head diffuse into the egg.

Upon penetration, the oocyte is said to have become activated. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a zygote. In order to prevent polyspermy and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote, several changes to the egg&#x27;s zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.

==Artificial storage==
Spermatozoa can be stored in diluents such as the &quot;Illini Variable Temperature&quot; (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of spermatozoa for over seven days. The IVT diluent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with CO2.

Semen cryopreservation can be used for far longer storage durations. For human spermatozoa, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.

== MMP and capacitation ==

The capacitation is the final phase of spermatozoa development, when they acquire the capability to fertilize the oocyte. In vivo, it happens during ejaculation, when spermatozoa leave the vagina and come in the superior female reproductive tract. In vitro, it happens when the spermatozoa is washed and purified. Almost 30-40% of infertility is due to male factor, so several strategies have been created in order to recover the functional spermatozoa. The MMP (Million Motile Progressive cells per milliliter) measure is synonymous with capacitation, and is very useful parameter to decide, along with a spermiogram, the kind of treatment needed. it represents the ratio between the % of progressive motile sperm obtained in capacitated and the % of progressive motile sperm obtained in ejaculated. It is based on the recovery percentage. Depending on the percentage, we will decide the quality of the motile spermatozoa recovery: 15 to 25 million sperm/ml is considered optimal, between 5 and 15 million is considered enough and less than 5 million is considered sub-optimal or not sufficient. Regarding the values that we have obtained, along with the spermiogram results, different techniques will be displayed.

For example, if more than 1.0×106 progressive motile sperm per milliliter are found, it will be recommended to have sexual intercourse, and if that fails, the next step will be intrauterine insemination and later conventional in vitro fertilization.

With less than 1.0×106 progressive motile sperm per milliliter, we will perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection. In case of azoospermia (no spermatozoa in the ejaculate), we will do a testicular biopsy in order to check if there are spermatozoa in the testes or if no spermatozoa are being produced.

== History ==
* In 1677 microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered spermatozoa.
* In 1841 the Swiss anatomist Albert von Kölliker wrote about spermatozoon in his work &quot;Untersuchungen über die Bedeutung der Samenfäden (Studies on the importance of spermatozoa).&quot;

<text>Samuel Barclay Beckett (; 13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish-born writer of novels, plays, short stories and poems. His literary and theatrical work features bleak, impersonal, and tragicomic experiences of life, often coupled with black comedy and nonsense. Beckett is best remembered for his 1953 play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, and he is considered to be one of the last modernist writers, as well as a key figure in what Martin Esslin called, the &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;.

A resident of Paris for most of his adult life, Beckett wrote in both French and English. His later works became increasingly minimalistic as his career progressed, involving more aesthetic and linguistic experimentation, with techniques of stream of consciousness repetition and self-reference. During the Second World War, Beckett was a member of the French Resistance group Gloria SMH (Réseau Gloria) and was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1949. 

Beckett received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his writing, which—in new forms for the novel and drama—in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation&quot;. In 1961 he shared the inaugural Prix International with Jorge Luis Borges. He was the first person to be elected Saoi of Aosdána in 1984.

==Early life==
Samuel Barclay Beckett was born in the Dublin suburb of Foxrock on 13 April 1906, the son of William Frank Beckett (18711933), a quantity surveyor of Huguenot descent, and Maria Jones Roe, a nurse. His parents were both 35 when he was born, and had married in 1901. Beckett had one older brother named Frank Edward (1902–1954). At the age of five, he attended a local playschool in Dublin, where he started to learn music, and then moved to Earlsfort House School near Harcourt Street in Dublin. The Becketts were members of the Church of Ireland; raised as an Anglican, Beckett later became agnostic, a perspective which informed his writing.
Beckett&#x27;s family home, Cooldrinagh, was a large house and garden complete with a tennis court built in 1903 by Beckett&#x27;s father. The house and garden, its surrounding countryside where he often went walking with his father, the nearby Leopardstown Racecourse, the Foxrock railway station, and Harcourt Street station would all feature in his prose and plays.

Around 1919 or 1920, he went to Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, which Oscar Wilde had also attended. He left in 1923 and entered Trinity College Dublin, where he studied modern literature and Romance languages, and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1927. A natural athlete, he excelled at cricket as a left-handed batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. Later, he played for Dublin University and played two first-class games against Northamptonshire. As a result, he became the only Nobel literature laureate to have played first-class cricket and thus to appear in Wisden.

==Early writings==

Beckett studied French, Italian, and English at Trinity College Dublin from 1923 to 1927 (one of his tutors – not a teaching role in TCD – was the Berkeley scholar A. A. Luce, who introduced him to the work of Henri Bergson). He was elected a Scholar in Modern Languages in 1926. Beckett graduated with a BA and, after teaching briefly at Campbell College in Belfast, took up the post of &quot;lecteur d&#x27;anglais&quot; at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris from November 1928 to 1930. While there, he was introduced to renowned Irish author James Joyce by Thomas MacGreevy, a poet and close confidant of Beckett who also worked there. This meeting had a profound effect on the young man. Beckett assisted Joyce in various ways, one of which was research towards the book that became &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

In 1929, Beckett published his first work, a critical essay titled &quot;Dante... Bruno. Vico.. Joyce&quot;. The essay defends Joyce&#x27;s work and method, chiefly from allegations of wanton obscurity and dimness, and was Beckett&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot; (a book of essays on Joyce which also included contributions by Eugene Jolas, Robert McAlmon, and William Carlos Williams). Beckett&#x27;s close relationship with Joyce and his family cooled, however, when he rejected the advances of Joyce&#x27;s daughter Lucia. Beckett&#x27;s first short story, &quot;Assumption&quot;, was published in Jolas&#x27;s periodical &quot;transition&quot;. The next year he won a small literary prize for his hastily composed poem &quot;Whoroscope&quot;, which draws on a biography of René Descartes that Beckett happened to be reading when he was encouraged to submit.

In 1930, Beckett returned to Trinity College as a lecturer. In November 1930, he presented a paper in French to the Modern Languages Society of Trinity on the Toulouse poet Jean du Chas, founder of a movement called &quot;le Concentrisme&quot;. It was a literary parody, for Beckett had in fact invented the poet and his movement that claimed to be &quot;at odds with all that is clear and distinct in Descartes&quot;. Beckett later insisted that he had not intended to fool his audience. When Beckett resigned from Trinity at the end of 1931, his brief academic career was at an end. He commemorated it with the poem &quot;Gnome&quot;, which was inspired by his reading of Johann Wolfgang Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot; and eventually published in &quot;The Dublin Magazine&quot; in 1934:

Beckett travelled throughout Europe. He spent some time in London, where in 1931 he published &quot;Proust&quot;, his critical study of French author Marcel Proust. Two years later, following his father&#x27;s death, he began two years&#x27; treatment with Tavistock Clinic psychoanalyst Dr. Wilfred Bion. Aspects of it became evident in Beckett&#x27;s later works, such as &quot;Watt&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. In 1932, he wrote his first novel, &quot;Dream of Fair to Middling Women&quot;, but after many rejections from publishers decided to abandon it (it was eventually published in 1992). Despite his inability to get it published, however, the novel served as a source for many of Beckett&#x27;s early poems, as well as for his first full-length book, the 1933 short-story collection &quot;More Pricks Than Kicks&quot;.

Beckett published essays and reviews, including &quot;Recent Irish Poetry&quot; (in &quot;The Bookman&quot;, August 1934) and &quot;Humanistic Quietism&quot;, a review of his friend Thomas MacGreevy&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; (in &quot;The Dublin Magazine&quot;, July–September 1934). They focused on the work of MacGreevy, Brian Coffey, Denis Devlin and Blanaid Salkeld, despite their slender achievements at the time, comparing them favourably with their Celtic Revival contemporaries and invoking Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and the French symbolists as their precursors. In describing these poets as forming &quot;the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland&quot;, Beckett was tracing the outlines of an Irish poetic modernist canon.

In 1935 – the year that he successfully published a book of his poetry, &quot;Echo&#x27;s Bones and Other Precipitates&quot; – Beckett worked on his novel &quot;Murphy&quot;. In May, he wrote to MacGreevy that he had been reading about film and wished to go to Moscow to study with Sergei Eisenstein at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. In mid-1936 he wrote to Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin to offer himself as their apprentice. Nothing came of this, however, as Beckett&#x27;s letter was lost owing to Eisenstein&#x27;s quarantine during the smallpox outbreak, as well as his focus on a script re-write of his postponed film production. In 1936, a friend had suggested he look up the works of Arnold Geulincx, which Beckett did and he took many notes. The philosopher&#x27;s name is mentioned in &quot;Murphy&quot; and the reading apparently left a strong impression. &quot;Murphy&quot; was finished in 1936 and Beckett departed for extensive travel around Germany, during which time he filled several notebooks with lists of noteworthy artwork that he had seen and noted his distaste for the Nazi savagery that was overtaking the country. Returning to Ireland briefly in 1937, he oversaw the publication of &quot;Murphy&quot; (1938), which he translated into French the following year. He fell out with his mother, which contributed to his decision to settle permanently in Paris. Beckett remained in Paris following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, preferring, in his own words, &quot;France at war to Ireland at peace&quot;. His was soon a known face in and around Left Bank cafés, where he strengthened his allegiance with Joyce and forged new ones with artists Alberto Giacometti and Marcel Duchamp, with whom he regularly played chess. Sometime around December 1937, Beckett had a brief affair with Peggy Guggenheim, who nicknamed him &quot;Oblomov&quot; (after the character in Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s novel).

In January 1938 in Paris, Beckett was stabbed in the chest and nearly killed when he refused the solicitations of a notorious pimp (who went by the name of Prudent). Joyce arranged a private room for Beckett at the hospital. The publicity surrounding the stabbing attracted the attention of Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil, who knew Beckett slightly from his first stay in Paris. This time, however, the two would begin a lifelong companionship. At a preliminary hearing, Beckett asked his attacker for the motive behind the stabbing. Prudent replied: &quot;Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m&#x27;excuse&quot; [&quot;I do not know, sir. I apologise&quot;]. Beckett eventually dropped the charges against his attacker – partially to avoid further formalities, partly because he found Prudent likeable and well-mannered. After his own near-fatal stabbing in 2022, author Salman Rushdie referenced Beckett&#x27;s example when talking about his reasons for not interviewing his attacker.

For Beckett, the 1930s was a decade of artistic exploration. He started to take a serious interest in art history, frequenting Ireland&#x27;s National Gallery, studying a range of painters and movements (specifically the Dutch Golden Age), and even visiting private collections. In 1933 Beckett applied for the position of assistant curator at London&#x27;s National Gallery. Later, in the winter of 1936–37, having sailed from Cobh in East Cork to Hamburg on 26 September 1936, he took a deep dive into Germany&#x27;s galleries and underground collections. This lasting engagement with the visual arts seeped into his creative process, often shaping his literary output and incentivising him to collaborate with artists such as Joan Mitchell and Geneviève Asse.

==World War II and French Resistance==

After the German occupation of France in 1940, Beckett joined the French Resistance, working as a courier for the &quot;Réseau Gloria&quot; network. On several occasions over the next two years he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942, his network was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on foot to the safety of the small village of Roussillon, Vaucluse. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis engage in sabotage operations against German occupational forces in the Vaucluse mountains, though Beckett rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life. He was awarded the Croix de guerre and the Resistance Medal by the French government for his efforts in fighting the German occupation; to the end of his life, however, Beckett would refer to his work with the French Resistance as &quot;boy scout stuff&quot;.

While in hiding in Roussillon, Beckett continued work on the novel &quot;Watt&quot;. He started the novel in 1941 and completed it in 1945, but it was not published until 1953; however, an extract had appeared in the Dublin literary periodical &quot;Envoy&quot;. After the war, he returned to France in 1946 where he worked as a stores manager at the Irish Red Cross Hospital based in Saint-Lô. Beckett described his experiences in an untransmitted radio script, &quot;The Capital of the Ruins&quot;.

==Fame: novels and the theatre==

In 1945, Beckett returned to Dublin for a brief visit. During his stay, he had a revelation in his mother&#x27;s room: his entire future direction in literature appeared to him. Beckett had felt that he would remain forever in the shadow of Joyce, certain to never beat him at his own game. His revelation prompted him to change direction and acknowledge both his own stupidity and his interest in ignorance and impotence:
&quot;I realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one&#x27;s material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.&quot;

Knowlson argues that &quot;Beckett was rejecting the Joycean principle that knowing more was a way of creatively understanding the world and controlling it ... In future, his work would focus on poverty, failure, exile and loss – as he put it, on man as a &#x27;non-knower&#x27; and as a &#x27;non-can-er. The revelation &quot;has rightly been regarded as a pivotal moment in his entire career&quot;. Beckett fictionalised the experience in his play &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; (1958). While listening to a tape he made earlier in his life, Krapp hears his younger self say &quot;clear to me at last that the dark I have always struggled to keep under is in reality my most...&quot;, at which point Krapp fast-forwards the tape (before the audience can hear the complete revelation). Beckett later explained to Knowlson that the missing words on the tape are &quot;precious ally&quot;.

In 1946, Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s magazine Les Temps modernes published the first part of Beckett&#x27;s short story &quot;Suite&quot; (later to be called &quot;&quot;, or &quot;The End&quot;), not realising that Beckett had only submitted the first half of the story; co-editor Simone de Beauvoir refused to publish the second part. Beckett also began to write his fourth novel, &quot;Mercier et Camier&quot;, which was not published until 1970. The novel preceded his most famous work, the play (&quot;Waiting for Godot)&quot;, which was written not long afterwards. More importantly, &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; was Beckett&#x27;s first long work written in French, the language of most of his subsequent works which were strongly supported by Jérôme Lindon, director of his Parisian publishing house , including the poioumenon &quot;trilogy&quot; of novels: &quot;Molloy&quot; (1951); (1951), &quot;Malone Dies&quot; (1958); (1953), &quot;The Unnamable&quot; (1960). Despite being a native English speaker, Beckett wrote in French because, as he himself claimed, it was easier for him thus to write &quot;without style&quot;.
&quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, like most of his works after 1947, was first written in French. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949. His partner, Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil, was integral to its success. Dechevaux-Dumesnil became his agent and sent the manuscript to multiple producers until they met Roger Blin, the soon-to-be director of the play.

Blin&#x27;s knowledge of French theatre and vision, alongside Beckett&#x27;s knowing what he wanted the play to represent, contributed greatly to its success. In a much-quoted article, the critic Vivian Mercier wrote that Beckett &quot;has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What&#x27;s more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.&quot; The play was published in 1952 and premièred in 1953 in Paris; an English translation was performed two years later. The play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and, later, Kenneth Tynan. After the showing in Miami, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. The play is a favourite: it is not only performed frequently but has globally inspired playwrights to emulate it. This is the sole play the manuscript of which Beckett never sold, donated or gave away. He refused to allow the play to be translated into film but did allow it to be played on television.

During this time in the 1950s, Beckett became one of several adults who sometimes drove local children to school; one such child was André Roussimoff, who later became a famous professional wrestler under the name André the Giant. They had a surprising amount of common ground and bonded over their love of cricket, with Roussimoff later recalling that the two rarely talked about anything else. Beckett translated all of his works into English himself, with the exception of &quot;Molloy&quot;, for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including (&quot;Endgame&quot;) (1957), &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; (1958, written in English), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1961, also written in English), and &quot;Play&quot; (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers&#x27; Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with Jorge Luis Borges.

== Later life and death ==
The 1960s were a time of change for Beckett, both on a personal level and as a writer. In 1961, he married Suzanne in a secret civil ceremony in England (its secrecy due to reasons relating to French inheritance law). The success of his plays led to invitations to attend rehearsals and productions around the world, leading eventually to a new career as a theatre director. In 1957, he had his first commission from the BBC Third Programme for a radio play, &quot;All That Fall.&quot; He continued writing sporadically for radio and extended his scope to include cinema and television. He began to write in English again, although he also wrote in French until the end of his life. He bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet about northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of some locals.

From the late 1950s until his death, Beckett had a relationship with Barbara Bray, a widow who worked as a script editor for the BBC. Knowlson wrote of them: &quot;She was small and attractive, but, above all, keenly intelligent and well-read. Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted by her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, for the rest of his life.&quot; Bray died in Edinburgh on 25 February 2010.
In 1969 the avant-garde filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim shot an experimental short film portrait about Beckett, which he named after the writer.

In October 1969 while on holiday in Tunis with Suzanne, Beckett heard that he had won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature. Anticipating that her intensely private husband would be saddled with fame from that moment on, Suzanne called the award a &quot;catastrophe&quot;. While Beckett did not devote much time to interviews, he sometimes met the artists, scholars, and admirers who sought him out in the anonymous lobby of the Hotel PLM Saint-Jacques in Paris – where he arranged his appointments and often had lunch – near his Montparnasse home. Although Beckett was an intensely private man, a review of the second volume of his letters by Roy Foster on 15 December 2011 issue of &quot;The New Republic&quot; reveals Beckett to be not only unexpectedly amiable but frequently prepared to talk about his work and the process behind it.

Suzanne died on 17 July 1989. Confined to a nursing home and suffering from emphysema and possibly Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Beckett died on 22 December 1989. The two were interred together in the cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris and share a simple granite gravestone that follows Beckett&#x27;s directive that it should be &quot;any colour, so long as it&#x27;s grey&quot;.

==Works==
Beckett&#x27;s career as a writer can be roughly divided into three periods: his early works, up until the end of World War II in 1945; his middle period, stretching from 1945 until the early 1960s, during which he wrote what are probably his best-known works; and his late period, from the early 1960s until Beckett&#x27;s death in 1989, during which his works tended to become shorter and his style more minimalist.

===Early works===
Beckett&#x27;s earliest works are generally considered to have been strongly influenced by the work of his friend James Joyce. They are erudite and seem to display the author&#x27;s learning merely for its own sake, resulting in several obscure passages. The opening phrases of the short-story collection &quot;More Pricks than Kicks&quot; (1934) afford a representative sample of this style:

It was morning and Belacqua was stuck in the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that he could move neither backward nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed him in the first place where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.

The passage makes reference to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot;, which can serve to confuse readers not familiar with that work. It also anticipates aspects of Beckett&#x27;s later work: the physical inactivity of the character Belacqua; the character&#x27;s immersion in his own head and thoughts; the somewhat irreverent comedy of the final sentence.

Similar elements are present in Beckett&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;Murphy&quot; (1938), which also explores the themes of insanity and chess (both of which would be recurrent elements in Beckett&#x27;s later works). The novel&#x27;s opening sentence hints at the somewhat pessimistic undertones and black humour that animate many of Beckett&#x27;s works: &quot;The sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new&quot;. &quot;Watt&quot;, written while Beckett was in hiding in Roussillon during World War II, is similar in terms of themes but less exuberant in its style. It explores human movement as if it were a mathematical permutation, presaging Beckett&#x27;s later preoccupation—in both his novels and dramatic works—with precise movement.

Beckett&#x27;s 1930 essay &quot;Proust&quot; was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer&#x27;s pessimism and laudatory descriptions of saintly asceticism. At this time Beckett began to write creatively in the French language. In the late 1930s, he wrote a number of short poems in that language and their sparseness—in contrast to the density of his English poems of roughly the same period, collected in &quot;Echo&#x27;s Bones and Other Precipitates&quot; (1935)—seems to show that Beckett, albeit through the medium of another language, was in process of simplifying his style, a change also evidenced in &quot;Watt&quot;.

===Middle period===

After World War II, Beckett turned definitively to the French language as a vehicle. It was this, together with the &quot;revelation&quot; experienced in his mother&#x27;s room in Dublin—in which he realised that his art must be subjective and drawn wholly from his own inner world—that would result in the works for which Beckett is best remembered today.

During the 15 years following the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: &quot;En attendant Godot&quot; (written 1948–1949; &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;), &quot;Fin de partie&quot; (1955–1957; &quot;Endgame&quot;), &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; (1958), and &quot;Happy Days&quot; (1961). These plays—which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;—deal in a darkly humorous way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers. The term &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot; was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and &quot;Godot&quot; were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of Albert Camus&#x27;s concept of &quot;the absurd&quot;; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded his own philosophy). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.

Broadly speaking, the plays deal with the subject of despair and the will to survive in spite of that despair, in the face of an uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two characters in &quot;Endgame&quot; who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarise the themes of the plays of Beckett&#x27;s middle period: &quot;Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it&#x27;s the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. But it&#x27;s always the same thing. Yes, it&#x27;s like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don&#x27;t laugh any more.&quot;

Beckett&#x27;s outstanding achievements in prose during the period were the three novels &quot;Molloy&quot; (1951), &quot;Malone meurt&quot; (1951; &quot;Malone Dies&quot;) and &quot;L&#x27;innommable&quot; (1953: &quot;The Unnamable&quot;). In these novels—sometimes referred to as a &quot;trilogy&quot;, though this is against the author&#x27;s own explicit wishes—the prose becomes increasingly bare and stripped down. &quot;Molloy&quot;, for instance, still retains many of the characteristics of a conventional novel (time, place, movement, and plot) and it makes use of the structure of a detective novel. In &quot;Malone Dies&quot;, movement and plot are largely dispensed with, though there is still some indication of place and the passage of time; the &quot;action&quot; of the book takes the form of an interior monologue. Finally, in &quot;The Unnamable&quot;, almost all sense of place and time are abolished, and the essential theme seems to be the conflict between the voice&#x27;s drive to continue speaking so as to continue existing, and its almost equally strong urge towards silence and oblivion. Despite the widely held view that Beckett&#x27;s work, as exemplified by the novels of this period, is essentially pessimistic, the will to live seems to win out in the end; witness, for instance, the famous final phrase of &quot;The Unnamable&quot;: &quot;you must go on, I can&#x27;t go on, I&#x27;ll go on&quot;.

After these three novels, Beckett struggled for many years to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief &quot;stories&quot; later collected as &quot;Texts for Nothing&quot;. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, &quot;Comment c&#x27;est&quot; (1961; &quot;How It Is&quot;). An early variant version of &quot;Comment c&#x27;est&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Image&quot;, was published in the British arts review, &quot;X: A Quarterly Review&quot; (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form. This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: &quot;You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it&#x27;s over you are there no more alive no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn&#x27;t over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark&quot; Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. &quot;How It Is&quot; is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.

===Late works===

Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, Beckett&#x27;s works exhibited an increasing tendency—already evident in much of his work of the 1950s—towards compactness. This has led to his work sometimes being described as minimalist. The extreme example of this, among his dramatic works, is the 1969 piece &quot;Breath&quot;, which lasts for only 35 seconds and has no characters (though it was likely intended to offer ironic comment on &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, the theatrical revue for which it served as an introductory piece).
In his theatre of the late period, Beckett&#x27;s characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to essential elements. The ironically titled &quot;Play&quot; (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama &quot;Eh Joe&quot; (1963), which was written for the actor Jack MacGowran, is animated by a camera that steadily closes into a tight focus upon the face of the title character. The play &quot;Not I&quot; (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett&#x27;s words, &quot;a moving mouth with the rest of the stage in darkness&quot;. Following from &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, many of these later plays explore memory, often in the form of a forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self-confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist&#x27;s head (as in &quot;Eh Joe&quot;) or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in &quot;Not I&quot;). Beckett&#x27;s most politically charged play, &quot;Catastrophe&quot; (1982), which was dedicated to Václav Havel, deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett&#x27;s poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of &quot;mirlitonnades&quot;, with some as short as six words. These defied Beckett&#x27;s usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including Derek Mahon, have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.

Beckett&#x27;s late style saw him experiment with technology to create increasingly transdisciplinary works. This sampling of a range of artistic mediums and styles – classical music, painting, sculpture, television, and literature – to create a new and original form, or genre, is evident in his television plays. In works like &quot;Ghost Trio&quot; (broadcast in 1977) and &quot;Nacht und Träume&quot; (broadcast in 1983) Beckett uses a musical frame (taking excerpts from Beethoven and Schubert, respectively) to structure his text and borrows well-known images from art history to create evocative stills that suggest themes of longing, ambiguity, hope, and suffering. Such experimentation with genre, music, and the visual arts, characterises Beckett&#x27;s work during the 1970s and &#x27;80s.

Beckett&#x27;s prose pieces during the late period were not as prolific as his theatre, as suggested by the title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts &quot;Fizzles&quot; (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella &quot;Company&quot; (1980), which continued with &quot;Ill Seen Ill Said&quot; (1982) and &quot;Worstward Ho&quot; (1983), later collected in &quot;Nohow On&quot;. In these three closed space&#x27; stories,&quot; Beckett continued his pre-occupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, as well as with the positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of &quot;Company&quot; make clear: &quot;A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.&quot; &quot;To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said.&quot; Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;Rockaby&quot;.

In the hospital and nursing home where he spent his final days, Beckett wrote his last work, the 1988 poem &quot;What is the Word&quot; (&quot;Comment dire&quot;). The poem grapples with an inability to find words to express oneself, a theme echoing Beckett&#x27;s earlier work, though possibly amplified by the sickness he experienced late in life.

==Collaborators==

===Jack MacGowran===
Jack MacGowran was the first actor to perform a one-man show based on the works of Beckett. He debuted &quot;End of Day&quot; in Dublin in 1962, revising it as &quot;Beginning To End&quot; (1965). The show went through further revisions before Beckett directed it in Paris in 1970; MacGowran won the 1970–1971 Obie for Best Performance By an Actor when he performed the show off-Broadway as &quot;Jack MacGowran in the Works of Samuel Beckett.&quot; Beckett wrote the radio play &quot;Embers&quot; and the teleplay &quot;Eh Joe&quot; specifically for MacGowran. The actor also appeared in various productions of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; and &quot;Endgame,&quot; and did several readings of Beckett&#x27;s plays and poems on BBC Radio; he also recorded the LP &quot;MacGowran Speaking Beckett&quot; for Claddagh Records in 1966.

===Billie Whitelaw===
Billie Whitelaw worked with Beckett for 25 years on such plays as &quot;Not I&quot;, &quot;Eh Joe&quot;, &quot;Footfalls&quot; and &quot;Rockaby.&quot; She first met Beckett in 1963. In her autobiography &quot;Billie Whitelaw... Who He?,&quot; she describes their first meeting in 1963 as &quot;trust at first sight&quot;. Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came to be regarded as his muse, the &quot;supreme interpreter of his work&quot;, perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in &quot;Not I&quot;. She said of the play &quot;Rockaby&quot;: &quot;I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director, Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing &quot;Happy Days&quot; and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, &#x27;Inward&#x27; &quot;. She said of her role in &quot;Footfalls&quot;: &quot;I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing &quot;Footfalls&quot; he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting.&quot; &quot;Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted&quot;, she explained. &quot;With all of Sam&#x27;s work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out.&quot; She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.

===Jocelyn Herbert===
The English stage designer Jocelyn Herbert was a close friend and influence on Beckett until his death. She worked with him on such plays as &quot;Happy Days&quot; (their third project) and &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: &quot;She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn&#x27;t want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn.&quot;

===Walter Asmus===
The German director Walter D. Asmus began his working relationship with Beckett in the Schiller Theatre in Berlin in 1974 and continued until 1989, the year of the playwright&#x27;s death. Asmus has directed all of Beckett&#x27;s plays internationally.

==Legacy==

Of all the English-language modernists, Beckett&#x27;s work represents the most sustained attack on the realist tradition. He opened up the possibility of theatre and fiction that dispense with conventional plot and the unities of time and place to focus on essential components of the human condition. Václav Havel, John Banville, Aidan Higgins, Tom Stoppard, Harold Pinter and Jon Fosse have publicly stated their indebtedness to Beckett&#x27;s example. He has had a wider influence on experimental writing since the 1950s, from the Beat generation to the happenings of the 1960s and after. In an Irish context, he has exerted great influence on poets such as Derek Mahon and Thomas Kinsella, as well as writers like Trevor Joyce and Catherine Walsh who proclaim their adherence to the modernist tradition as an alternative to the dominant realist mainstream.
Many major 20th-century composers including Luciano Berio, György Kurtág, Morton Feldman, Pascal Dusapin, Philip Glass, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati and Heinz Holliger have created musical works based on Beckett&#x27;s texts. His work has also influenced numerous international writers, artists and filmmakers including Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, Avigdor Arikha, Paul Auster, J. M. Coetzee, Richard Kalich, Douglas Gordon, Bruce Nauman, Anthony Minghella, Damian Pettigrew, Charlie Kaufman and Brian Patrick Butler.

Beckett is one of the most widely discussed and highly prized of 20th-century authors, inspiring a critical industry to rival that which has sprung up around James Joyce. He has divided critical opinion. Some early philosophical critics, such as Sartre and Theodor Adorno, praised him, one for his revelation of absurdity, the other for his works&#x27; critical refusal of simplicities; others such as Georg Lukács condemned him for &#x27;decadent&#x27; lack of realism.

Since Beckett&#x27;s death, all rights for the performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate, currently managed by Edward Beckett (the author&#x27;s nephew). The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett&#x27;s plays are performed and does not grant licences to productions that do not adhere to the writer&#x27;s stage directions.

Historians interested in tracing Beckett&#x27;s bloodline were, in 2004, granted access to confirmed trace samples of his DNA to conduct molecular genealogical studies to facilitate precise lineage determination.

Some of the best-known pictures of Beckett were taken by photographer John Minihan, who photographed him between 1980 and 1985 and developed such a good relationship with the writer that he became, in effect, his official photographer. Some consider one of these to be among the top three photographs of the 20th century. It was the theatre photographer, John Haynes, however, who took possibly the most widely reproduced image of Beckett: it is used on the cover of the Knowlson biography, for instance. This portrait was taken during rehearsals of the San Quentin Drama Workshop at the Royal Court Theatre in London, where Haynes photographed many productions of Beckett&#x27;s work. An Post, the Irish postal service, issued a commemorative stamp of Beckett in 1994. The Central Bank of Ireland launched two Samuel Beckett Centenary commemorative coins on 26 April 2006: €10 Silver Coin and €20 Gold Coin.

On 10 December 2009, the new bridge across the River Liffey in Dublin was opened and named the Samuel Beckett Bridge in his honour. Reminiscent of a harp on its side, it was designed by the celebrated Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who had also designed the James Joyce Bridge situated further upstream and opened on Bloomsday (16 June) 2003. Attendees at the official opening ceremony included Beckett&#x27;s niece Caroline Murphy, his nephew Edward Beckett, poet Seamus Heaney and Barry McGovern. A ship of the Irish Naval Service, the LÉ &quot;Samuel Beckett&quot; (P61), is named for Beckett. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque in his memory is located at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.

In La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, the town where Beckett had a cottage, the public library and one of the local high schools bear his name.

Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival is an annual multi-arts festival celebrating the work and influence of Beckett. The festival, founded in 2011, is held at Enniskillen, Northern Ireland where Beckett spent his formative years studying at Portora Royal School.

In 1983, the Samuel Beckett Award was established for writers who, in the opinion of a committee of critics, producers and publishers, showed innovation and excellence in writing for the performing arts. In 2003, The Oxford Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust was formed to support the showcasing of new innovative theatre at the Barbican Centre in the City of London.

Music for three Samuel Beckett plays (&quot;Words and Music&quot;, &quot;Cascando&quot;, and &quot;...but the clouds...&quot;), was composed by Martin Pearlman which was commissioned by the 92nd Street Y in New York for the Beckett centennial and produced there and at Harvard University.

In 2022 James Marsh filmed a biopic of Beckett entitled &quot;Dance First&quot;, with Gabriel Byrne and Fionn O&#x27;Shea playing Beckett at different stages of his life. The film was made available through Sky Cinema in 2023.

== Archives ==
Samuel Beckett&#x27;s prolific career is spread across archives around the world. Significant collections include those at the Harry Ransom Center, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Reading, Trinity College Dublin, and Houghton Library. Given the scattered nature of these collections, an effort has been made to create a digital repository through the University of Antwerp.

<text>David Samuel Peckinpah (; February 21, 1925 – December 28, 1984) was an American film director and screenwriter. His 1969 Western epic &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; received two Academy Award nominations and was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s top 100 list. His films employed a visually innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence as well as a revisionist approach to the Western genre.

Peckinpah&#x27;s films deal with the conflict between values and ideals, as well as the corruption and violence in human society. His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality. He was given the nickname &quot;Bloody Sam&quot; owing to the violence in his films.

Peckinpah&#x27;s combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, affected his professional legacy. The production of many of his films included battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime. Peckinpah&#x27;s other films include &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962), &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; (1970), &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972), &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; (1974), &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977) and &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978).

==Family origins==
The Peckinpahs originated from the Frisian Islands in the northwest of Europe. Both sides of Peckinpah&#x27;s family migrated to the American West by covered wagon in the mid-19th century. Peckinpah and several relatives often claimed Native American ancestry, but this has been denied by surviving family members. Peckinpah&#x27;s great-grandfather, Rice Peckinpaugh, a merchant and farmer in Indiana, moved to Humboldt County, California, in the 1850s, working in the logging business, and changed the spelling of the family name to &quot;Peckinpah&quot;.

Peckinpah Meadow and Peckinpah Creek, where the family ran a lumber mill on a mountain in the High Sierra east of North Fork, California, have been officially named on U.S. geographical maps. Peckinpah&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Denver S. Church, a cattle rancher, Superior Court judge and United States Congressman of a California district including Fresno County.

Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s nephew is David Peckinpah, who was a television producer and director, as well as a screenwriter. He was a cousin of former New York Yankees shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh.

==Life==

David Samuel Peckinpah was born February 21, 1925, to David Edward (1895–1960) and Fern Louise (&quot;née&quot; Church) Peckinpah (1893–1983) in Fresno, California, where he attended both grammar school and high school. He had an elder brother, Denver Charles (1916–1996). He spent much time skipping classes with his brother to engage in cowboy activities on their grandfather Denver Church&#x27;s ranch, including trapping, branding, and shooting. During the 1930s and 1940s, Coarsegold and Bass Lake were still populated with descendants of the miners and ranchers of the 19th century. Many of these descendants worked on Church&#x27;s ranch. At that time, it was a rural area undergoing extreme change, and this exposure is believed to have affected Peckinpah&#x27;s Western films later in life.

He played on the junior varsity football team while at Fresno High School, but frequent fighting and discipline problems caused his parents to enroll him in the San Rafael Military Academy for his senior year.

In 1943, he joined the United States Marine Corps. Within two years, his battalion was sent to China with the task of disarming Japanese soldiers and repatriating them following World War II. While his duty did not include combat, he claimed to have witnessed acts of war between Chinese and Japanese soldiers. According to friends, these included several acts of torture and the murder of a laborer by sniper fire. The American Marines were not permitted to intervene. Peckinpah also claimed he was shot during an attack by Communist forces. Also during his final weeks as a Marine, he applied for discharge in Beijing, so he could marry a local woman, but was refused. His experiences in China reportedly deeply affected Peckinpah, and may have influenced his depictions of violence in his films.

After being discharged in Los Angeles, he attended California State University, Fresno, where he studied history. While a student, he met and married his first wife, Marie Selland, in 1947. A drama major, Selland introduced Peckinpah to the theater department and he became interested in directing for the first time. During his senior year, he adapted and directed a one-hour version of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;.

After graduation in 1948, Peckinpah enrolled in graduate studies in drama at University of Southern California. He spent two seasons as the director in residence at Huntington Park Civic Theatre near Los Angeles before obtaining his master&#x27;s degree. He was asked to stay another year, but Peckinpah began working as a stagehand at KLAC-TV in the belief that television experience would eventually lead to work in films. Even during this early stage of his career, Peckinpah was developing a combative streak. Reportedly, he was kicked off the set of &quot;The Liberace Show&quot; for not wearing a tie, and he refused to cue a car salesman during a live feed because of his attitude towards stagehands.

In 1954, Peckinpah was hired as a dialogue coach for the film &quot;Riot in Cell Block 11&quot;. His job entailed acting as an assistant for the movie&#x27;s director, Don Siegel. The film was shot on location at Folsom Prison. Reportedly, the warden was reluctant to allow the filmmakers to work at the prison until he was introduced to Peckinpah. The warden knew of his influential family from Fresno and was immediately cooperative. Siegel&#x27;s location work and his use of actual prisoners as extras in the film made a lasting impression on Peckinpah. He worked as a dialogue coach on four additional Siegel films: &quot;Private Hell 36&quot; (1954), &quot;An Annapolis Story&quot; (1955, and co-starring L. Q. Jones), &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1956) and &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot; (1956).

&quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, in which Peckinpah appeared as Charlie the meter reader, starred Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. It became one of the most critically praised science fiction films of the 1950s. Peckinpah claimed to have done an extensive rewrite on the film&#x27;s screenplay, a statement which remains controversial.

Throughout much of his adult life, Peckinpah was affected by alcoholism, and, later, other forms of drug addiction. According to some accounts, he also suffered from mental illness, possibly manic depression or paranoia. It is believed his drinking problems began during his service in the military while stationed in China, when he frequented the saloons of Tianjin and Beijing. After divorcing Selland, the mother of his first four children, in 1960, he married Mexican actress Begoña Palacios in 1964. A stormy relationship developed, and over the years they married on three separate occasions. They had one daughter together. His personality reportedly often swung between a sweet, softly-spoken, artistic disposition, and bouts of rage and violence, during which he verbally and physically abused himself and others. An experienced hunter, Peckinpah was fascinated with firearms and was known to shoot the mirrors in his house while abusing alcohol, an image which occurs several times in his films.

Peckinpah&#x27;s reputation as a hard-living brute with a taste for violence, inspired by the content in his most popular films and in many ways perpetuated by himself, affected his artistic legacy. His friends and family have claimed this does a disservice to a man who was actually more complex than generally credited. He used such actors as Warren Oates, L. Q. Jones, R. G. Armstrong, James Coburn, Ben Johnson, and Kris Kristofferson, and collaborators (Jerry Fielding, Lucien Ballard, Gordon Dawson, and Martin Baum) in many of his films, and several of his friends and assistants stuck by him to the end of his life.

Peckinpah spent a great deal of his life in Mexico after his marriage to Palacios, eventually buying property in the country. He was fascinated by the Mexican lifestyle and Mexican culture, and he often portrayed it with an unusual sentimentality and romanticism in his films.

From 1979 until his death, Peckinpah lived at the Murray Hotel in Livingston, Montana. Peckinpah was seriously ill during his final years, as a lifetime of hard living caught up with him. Regardless, he continued to work until his last months. He died of heart failure at age 59 on December 28, 1984, in Inglewood, California. At the time, he was working on the script for &quot;On the Rocks&quot;, a projected independent film to be shot in San Francisco.

==Television career==
On the recommendation of Don Siegel, Peckinpah established himself during the late 1950s as a scriptwriter of Western series of the era, selling scripts to &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Klondike&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, and &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, the latter Four Star Television productions. He wrote one episode &quot;The Town&quot; (December 13, 1957) for the CBS series, &quot;Trackdown&quot;.

Peckinpah wrote a screenplay from the novel &quot;The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones&quot;, a draft that evolved into the 1961 Marlon Brando film &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;. His writing led to directing, and he directed a 1958 episode of &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (generally credited as his first official directing job) and several 1960 episodes of &quot;Klondike&quot;, (co-starring James Coburn, L. Q. Jones, Ralph Taeger, Joi Lansing, and Mari Blanchard). He also directed the CBS sitcom &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;, starring Howard Duff and Ida Lupino.

In 1958, Peckinpah wrote a script for &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; that was rejected due to content. He reworked the screenplay, titled &quot;The Sharpshooter&quot;, and sold it to &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;. The episode received popular response and became the television series &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, starring Chuck Connors. Peckinpah directed four episodes of the series (with guest stars R. G. Armstrong and Warren Oates), but left after the first year. &quot;The Rifleman&quot; ran for five seasons and achieved enduring popularity in syndication.

===&quot;The Westerner&quot;===
During this time, he also created the television series &quot;The Westerner&quot; for Four Star Television, starring Brian Keith and in three episodes also featuring John Dehner. Peckinpah wrote and directed a pilot called &quot;Trouble at Tres Cruzes&quot;, which was aired in March 1959 before the actual series was made in 1960. Peckinpah acted as producer of the series, having a hand in the writing of each episode and directing five of them. Critically praised, the show ran for only 13 episodes before cancellation mainly due to its gritty content detailing the drifting, laconic cowboy Dave Blassingame (Brian Keith). Especially noteworthy are the episodes &quot;Jeff&quot; and &quot;Hand on the Gun&quot;, extraordinary in their depiction of violence and their imaginative directing, forerunners of his later feature films. Despite its short run, &quot;The Westerner&quot; and Peckinpah were nominated by the Producers Guild of America for Best Filmed Series. An episode of the series eventually served as the basis for Tom Gries&#x27; 1968 film &quot;Will Penny&quot; starring Charlton Heston. &quot;The Westerner&quot;, which has since achieved cult status, further established Peckinpah as a talent to be reckoned with.

In 1962, Peckinpah directed two hour-long episodes for &quot;The Dick Powell Theater&quot;. In the second of these, &quot;The Losers&quot;, an updated remake of &quot;The Westerner&quot; set in the present day with Lee Marvin as Dave Blassingame and Keenan Wynn as Dehner&#x27;s character Bergundy Smith, he mixed slow motion, fast motion and stills together to capture violence, a technique famously put to more sophisticated use in 1969s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.

==Early film career==
===&quot;The Deadly Companions&quot;===

After cancellation of &quot;The Westerner&quot;, Brian Keith was cast as the male lead in the 1961 Western film &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot;. He suggested Peckinpah as director and the project&#x27;s producer Charles B. Fitzsimons accepted the idea. By most accounts, the low-budget film shot on location in Arizona was a learning process for Peckinpah, who feuded with Fitzsimons (brother of the film&#x27;s star Maureen O&#x27;Hara) over the screenplay and staging of the scenes. Reportedly, Fitzsimons refused to allow Peckinpah to give direction to O&#x27;Hara. Unable to rewrite the screenplay or edit the picture, Peckinpah vowed to never again direct a film unless he had script control. &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot; passed largely without notice and is the least known of Peckinpah&#x27;s films.

===&quot;Ride the High Country&quot;===

His second film, &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962), was based on the screenplay &quot;Guns in the Afternoon&quot; written by N.B. Stone, Jr. Producer Richard Lyons admired Peckinpah&#x27;s work on &quot;The Westerner&quot; and offered him the directing job. Peckinpah did an extensive rewrite of the screenplay, including personal references from his own childhood growing up on Denver Church&#x27;s ranch, and even naming one of the mining towns &quot;Coarsegold.&quot; He based the character of Steve Judd, a once-famous lawman fallen on hard times, on his own father David Peckinpah. In the screenplay, Judd and old friend Gil Westrum are hired to transport gold from a mining community through dangerous territory. Westrum hopes to talk Judd into taking the gold for themselves. Along the way, following Judd&#x27;s example, Westrum slowly realizes his own self-respect is far more important than profit. During the final shootout, when Judd and Westrum stand up to a trio of men, Judd is fatally wounded but his death serves as Westrum&#x27;s salvation, a Catholic tragedy woven from the cloth of the Western genre. This sort of salvation became a major theme in many Peckinpah&#x27;s later films. Starring aging Western stars Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott in their final major screen roles, the film initially went unnoticed in the United States but was an enormous success in Europe. Beating Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; for first prize at the Belgium Film Festival, the film was hailed by foreign critics as a brilliant reworking of the Western genre. New York critics also discovered Peckinpah&#x27;s unusual Western, with &quot;Newsweek&quot; naming &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; the best film of the year and &quot;Time&quot; placing it on its ten-best list. By some critics, the film is admired as one of Peckinpah&#x27;s greatest works.

===&quot;Major Dundee&quot;===

Peckinpah&#x27;s next film, &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), was the first of Peckinpah&#x27;s many unfortunate experiences with the major studios that financed his productions. Based on a screenplay by Harry Julian Fink, the film was to star Charlton Heston. Peckinpah was hired as director after Heston viewed producer Jerry Bresler&#x27;s private screening of &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;. Heston liked the film and called Peckinpah, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to work with you.&quot; The sprawling screenplay told the story of Union cavalry officer Major Dundee who commands a New Mexico outpost of Confederate prisoners. When an Apache war chief wipes out a company and kidnaps several children, Dundee throws together a makeshift army, including unwilling Confederate veterans, black Federal soldiers, and traditional Western types, and takes off after the Indians. Dundee becomes obsessed with his quest and heads deep into the wilderness of Mexico with his exhausted men in tow.

Filming began without a completed screenplay, and Peckinpah chose several remote locations in Mexico, causing the film to go heavily overbudget. Intimidated by the size and scope of the project, Peckinpah reportedly drank heavily each night after shooting. He also fired at least 15 crew members. At one point, Peckinpah&#x27;s mean streak and abusiveness towards the actors so enraged Heston that the normally even-tempered star threatened to run the director through with his cavalry saber if he did not show more courtesy to the cast. Shooting ended 15 days over schedule and $1.5 million more than budgeted with Peckinpah and producer Bresler no longer on speaking terms. The movie, detailing themes and sequences Peckinpah mastered later in his career, was taken away from him and substantially reedited. An incomplete mess which today exists in a variety of versions, &quot;Major Dundee&quot; performed poorly at the box office and was trashed by critics (though its standing has improved over the years). Peckinpah maintained, nonetheless, throughout his life that his original version of &quot;Major Dundee&quot; was among his best films, but his reputation was severely damaged.

Peckinpah was next signed to direct &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, a gambling drama about a young prodigy who takes on an old master during a big New Orleans poker match. Before filming started, producer Martin Ransohoff began to receive phone calls about the &quot;Major Dundee&quot; ordeal and was told Peckinpah was impossible to work with. Peckinpah decided to shoot in black and white and was hoping to transform the screenplay into a social realist saga about a kid surviving the tough streets of the Great Depression. After four days of filming, which reportedly included some nude scenes, Ransohoff disliked the rushes and immediately fired him. Eventually directed by Norman Jewison and starring Steve McQueen, the film went on to become a 1965 hit.

===&quot;Noon Wine&quot;===
Peckinpah caught a lucky break in 1966 when producer Daniel Melnick needed a writer and director to adapt Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s short novel &quot;Noon Wine&quot; for television. Melnick was a big fan of &quot;The Westerner&quot; and &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;, and had heard Peckinpah had been unfairly fired from &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;. Against the objections of many within the industry, Melnick hired Peckinpah and gave him free rein. Peckinpah completed the script, which Porter enthusiastically endorsed, and the project became an hour-long presentation for &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;.

Taking place in turn of the century West Texas, &quot;Noon Wine&quot; was a dark tragedy about a farmer&#x27;s act of futile murder which leads to suicide. Starring Jason Robards and Olivia de Havilland, the film was a critical hit, with Peckinpah nominated by the Writers Guild for Best Television Adaptation and the Directors Guild of America for Best Television Direction. Robards kept a personal copy of the film in his private collection for years as he considered the project to be one of his most satisfying professional experiences. A rare film which had no home video release until 2014, &quot;Noon Wine&quot; is today considered one of Peckinpah&#x27;s most intimate works, revealing his dramatic potential and artistic depth.

==International fame==
===&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;===

The surprising success of &quot;Noon Wine&quot; laid the groundwork for one of the most explosive comebacks in film history. In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts producers Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were interested in having Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film, &quot;The Diamond Story&quot;. An alternative screenplay written by Roy N. Sickner and Walon Green was the Western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. At the time, William Goldman&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; had recently been purchased by 20th Century Studios.

It was quickly decided that &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, which had several similarities to Goldman&#x27;s work, would be produced in order to beat &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; to the theaters. By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay into what became &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Filmed on location in Mexico, Peckinpah&#x27;s epic work was inspired by a number of forces—his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, America&#x27;s growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but the crude men attempting to survive the era. During this period, Peckinpah said that his life was changed by seeing Carlos Saura&#x27;s &quot;La Caza&quot; (1966), which profoundly influenced his subsequent oeuvre.

The film detailed a gang of veteran outlaws on the Texas/Mexico border in 1913 trying to survive within a rapidly approaching modern world. &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; is framed by two ferocious and infamous gunfights, beginning with a failed robbery of the railway company office and concluding with the outlaws battling the Mexican army in suicidal vengeance prompted by the brutal torture and murder of one of their members.

Irreverent and unprecedented in its explicit detail, the 1969 film was an instant success. Multiple scenes attempted in &quot;Major Dundee&quot;, including slow motion action sequences, characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, were perfected in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Many critics denounced its violence as sadistic and exploitative. Other critics and filmmakers hailed the originality of its unique rapid editing style, created for the first time in this film and ultimately becoming a Peckinpah trademark, and praised the reworking of traditional Western themes. It was the beginning of Peckinpah&#x27;s international fame, and he and his work remained controversial for the rest of his life. The film was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s top 100 list of the greatest American films ever made and No. 69 as the most thrilling, but the controversy has not diminished.

&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was re-released for its 25th anniversary, and received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA. Peckinpah received his only Academy Award nomination (for Best Original Screenplay) for this film.

===&quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;===

Defying audience expectations, as he often did, Peckinpah immediately followed &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; with the elegiac, funny and mostly non-violent 1970 Western &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;. Using many of the same cast (L. Q. Jones, Strother Martin) and crew members of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, the film covered three years in the life of small-time entrepreneur Cable Hogue (Jason Robards) who decides to make his living by remaining in the desert after having miraculously discovered water when he had been abandoned there to die. He opens his business along a stagecoach line, only to see his dreams end with the appearance of the first automobile on the horizon.

Shot on location in the Valley of Fire in Nevada, the film was plagued by poor weather, Peckinpah&#x27;s renewed drinking and his brusque firing of 36 crew members. The chaotic filming wrapped 19 days over schedule and $3 million over budget, effectively terminating his tenure with Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. In retrospect, it was a damaging career move as &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;, critical and enduring box office hits, were in development at the time and Peckinpah was considered the first choice to direct both films.

Largely ignored upon its initial release, &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; has been rediscovered in recent years and is often held up by critics as exemplary of the breadth of Peckinpah&#x27;s talents. They claim that the film proves Peckinpah&#x27;s ability to make unconventional and original work without resorting to explicit violence. Over the years, Peckinpah cited the film as one of his favorites.

===&quot;Straw Dogs&quot;===

His alienation from Warner Brothers once again left him with a limited number of directing jobs. Peckinpah traveled to England to direct &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), one of his darkest and most psychologically disturbing films. Produced by Daniel Melnick, who had previously worked with Peckinpah on &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, the film&#x27;s screenplay was based on the novel &quot;The Siege of Trencher&#x27;s Farm&quot; by Gordon Williams.

It starred Dustin Hoffman as David Sumner, a timid American mathematician who leaves the chaos of college anti-war protests to live with his young wife Amy (Susan George) in her native village in Cornwall, England. Resentment of David&#x27;s presence by the locals slowly builds to a shocking climax when the mild-mannered academic is forced to violently defend his home. Peckinpah rewrote the existing screenplay, inspired by the books &quot;African Genesis&quot; and &quot;The Territorial Imperative&quot; by Robert Ardrey, which argued that man was essentially a carnivore who instinctively battled over control of territory.

The character of David Sumner, taunted and humiliated by the violent town locals, is eventually cornered within his home where he loses control and kills several of the men during the violent conclusion. &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; deeply divided critics, some of whom praised its artistry and its confrontation of human savagery, while others attacked it as a misogynistic and fascistic celebration of violence.

Much of the criticism centered on Amy&#x27;s complicated and lengthy rape scene, which Peckinpah reportedly attempted to base on his own personal fears rooted in past failed marriages. To this day, the scene is attacked by some critics as an ugly male-chauvinist fantasy. The film was for many years banned on video in the UK.

===&quot;Junior Bonner&quot;===

Despite his growing alcoholism and controversial reputation, Peckinpah was prolific during this period of his life. In May 1971, weeks after completing &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, he returned to the United States to begin work on &quot;Junior Bonner&quot;. The lyrical screenplay by Jeb Rosenbrook, depicting the changing times of society and binding family ties, appealed to Peckinpah&#x27;s tastes. He accepted the project, at the time concerned with being typed as a director of violent action. The film was his final attempt to make a low-key, dramatic work in the vein of &quot;Noon Wine&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;.

Filmed on location in Prescott, Arizona, the story covered a week in the life of aging rodeo rider Junior &quot;JR&quot; Bonner (Steve McQueen) who returns to his hometown to compete in an annual rodeo competition. Promoted as a Steve McQueen action vehicle, the film&#x27;s reviews were mixed and the film performed poorly at the box office. Peckinpah remarked, &quot;I made a film where nobody got shot and nobody went to see it.&quot; The film&#x27;s reputation has grown over the years as many critics consider &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; to be one of Peckinpah&#x27;s most sympathetic works, while also noting McQueen&#x27;s earnest performance.

===&quot;The Getaway&quot;===

Eager to work with Peckinpah again, Steve McQueen presented him Walter Hill&#x27;s screenplay to &quot;The Getaway&quot;. Based on the Jim Thompson novel, the gritty crime thriller detailed lovers on the run following a dangerous robbery. Both Peckinpah and McQueen needed a hit, and they immediately began working on the film in February 1972. Peckinpah had no pretensions about making &quot;The Getaway&quot;, as his only goal was to create a highly polished thriller to boost his market value. McQueen played Doc McCoy, a convicted robber who colludes with corrupt businessman Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to be released from prison and later masterminds a bank heist organized by Beynon.

A series of double-crosses ensues and Doc and his wife Carol (MacGraw) attempt to flee from their pursuers to Mexico. Replete with explosions, car chases and intense shootouts, the film became Peckinpah&#x27;s biggest financial success to date earning more than $25 million at the box office. Though strictly a commercial product, Peckinpah&#x27;s creative touches abound throughout, most notably during the intricately edited opening sequence when McQueen&#x27;s character is suffering from the pressures of prison life. The film remains popular and was remade in 1994, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

==Later career==
The year 1973 marked the beginning of the most difficult period of Peckinpah&#x27;s life and career. While still filming &quot;The Getaway&quot; in El Paso, Texas, Peckinpah sneaked across the border into Juarez in April 1972 and married Joie Gould. He had met Gould in England while filming &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, and she had since been his companion and a part-time crew member. Peckinpah&#x27;s intake of alcohol had increased dramatically while making &quot;The Getaway&quot;, and he became fond of saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t direct when I&#x27;m sober.&quot; He began to have violent mood swings and explosions of rage, at one point assaulting Gould. After four months, she returned to England and filed for divorce. Devastated by the breakup, Peckinpah fell into a self-destructive pattern of almost continuous alcohol consumption, and his health was unstable for the remainder of his life.

===&quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot;===

It was in this state of mind that Peckinpah agreed to make &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973) for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Based on the screenplay by Rudolph Wurlitzer, who had previously penned &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;, a film admired by Peckinpah, the director was convinced that he was about to make his definitive statement on the Western genre. The script offered Peckinpah the opportunity to explore themes that appealed to him: two former partners forced by changing times onto opposite sides of the law, manipulated by corrupt economic interests. Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay, establishing Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as friends, and attempted to weave an epic tragedy from the historical legend. Filmed on location in the Mexican state of Durango, the film starred James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson in the title roles, with a huge supporting cast including Bob Dylan, who composed the film&#x27;s music, Jason Robards, R. G. Armstrong, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Elam, Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Matt Clark, L. Q. Jones, Rutanya Alda, Slim Pickens, and Harry Dean Stanton. From the beginning, Peckinpah began to have clashes with MGM and its president James Aubrey, known for his stifling of creative interests and eventual dismantling of the historic movie company. Numerous production difficulties, including an outbreak of influenza and malfunctioning cameras, combined with Peckinpah&#x27;s alcoholism, resulted in one of the most troubled productions of his career. Principal photography finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget. Enraged, Aubrey severely cut Peckinpah&#x27;s film from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; being released in a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. Critics complained that the film was incoherent, and the experience soured Peckinpah forever on Hollywood. In 1988, however, Peckinpah&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut was released on video and led to a reevaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era&#x27;s best films. Filmmakers, including Martin Scorsese, have praised the film as one of the greatest modern Westerns.

===&quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;===

In the eyes of his admirers, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; (1974) was the &quot;last true Peckinpah film.&quot; The director himself claimed that it was the only one of his films to be released exactly as he intended it. A project in development for many years and based on an idea by Frank Kowalski, Peckinpah wrote the screenplay with the assistance of Kowalski, Walter Kelley and Gordon Dawson. An alcohol-soaked fever dream involving revenge, greed and murder in the Mexican countryside, the film featured Bennie (Warren Oates) as a thinly disguised self-portrait of Peckinpah, and co-starred a burlap bag containing the severed head of a gigolo being sought by a Mexican patrone for having impregnated his young granddaughter. Bennie is offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Alfredo&#x27;s death or proof thereof, and Alfredo&#x27;s head is demanded as proof the contract has been fulfilled. The macabre drama was part black comedy, action film and tragedy, with a warped edge rarely seen in Peckinpah&#x27;s works. Most critics were repulsed, and it was listed in the book &quot;The 50 Worst Films of All Time&quot; by Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss. One of the few critics to praise the film was Roger Ebert, and the film&#x27;s reputation has grown in recent years, with many noting its uncompromising vision as well as its anticipation of the violent black comedy of David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino. A failure at the box office, the film now has a cult following. In 1991, the UCLA film school&#x27;s festival of great but forgotten American films included &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot;. It is reportedly Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s favorite film.

===&quot;The Killer Elite&quot;===

His career now suffering from consecutive box office failures, Peckinpah once again was in need of a hit on the level of &quot;The Getaway&quot;. For his next film, he chose &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (1975), an action-filled espionage thriller starring James Caan and Robert Duvall as rival American agents. Filmed on location in San Francisco, Peckinpah allegedly discovered cocaine for the first time thanks to Caan and his entourage. This led to increased paranoia and his once legendary dedication to detail deteriorated. Producers also refused to allow Peckinpah to rewrite the screenplay for the first time since his debut film &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot;. Frustrated, the director spent large amounts of time in his on-location trailer, allowing assistants to direct many scenes. At one point he overdosed on cocaine, ending up in a hospital with a second pacemaker. The film was reasonably successful at the box office, although most critics panned it. Today, the film is considered one of Peckinpah&#x27;s weakest films, and an example of his decline as a major director.

===&quot;Cross of Iron&quot;===

Still renowned in 1975, Peckinpah was offered the opportunity to direct the eventual blockbusters &quot;King Kong&quot; (1976) and &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). He turned down both offers and chose instead the bleak and vivid World War II drama &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977). The screenplay was based on a novel about a platoon of German soldiers in 1943 on the verge of utter collapse on the Taman Peninsula on the Eastern Front. The German production was filmed in Yugoslavia. Working with James Hamilton and Walter Kelley, Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay and screened numerous Nazi documentaries in preparation. Almost immediately, Peckinpah realized he was working on a low-budget production, as he had to spend $90,000 of his own money to hire experienced crew members. While not suffering from the cocaine abuse which marked &quot;The Killer Elite&quot;, Peckinpah continued to drink heavily, causing his direction to become confused and erratic. The production abruptly ran out of funds, and Peckinpah was forced to completely improvise the concluding sequence, filming the scene in one day. Co-starring James Mason, Maximilian Schell, David Warner and Senta Berger, &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; was noted for its opening montage utilizing documentary footage as well as the visceral impact of the unusually intense battle sequences. The film was a huge box office success in Europe, inspiring the sequel &quot;Breakthrough&quot; starring Richard Burton. &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; was reportedly a favorite of Orson Welles, who said that after &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; it was the finest anti-war film he had ever seen. The film performed poorly in the U.S., ultimately eclipsed by &quot;Star Wars&quot;, though today it is highly regarded and considered the last instance of Peckinpah&#x27;s once-great talent.

===&quot;Convoy&quot;===

Hoping to create a blockbuster, Peckinpah decided to take on &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978). His associates were perplexed, as they felt his choice to direct such substandard material was a result of his renewed cocaine use and continued alcoholism. Based on the hit song by C. W. McCall, the film was an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977). In spite of his addictions, Peckinpah felt compelled to turn the genre exercise into something more significant. Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L. Norton, Peckinpah tried to encourage the actors to re-write, improvise and ad-lib their dialogue. In another departure from the script, Peckinpah attempted to add a new dimension by casting a pair of black actors as members of the convoy, Madge Sinclair as Widow Woman and Franklyn Ajaye as Spider Mike. Filmed in New Mexico and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw and Ernest Borgnine, &quot;Convoy&quot; turned out to be yet another troubled Peckinpah production, with the director&#x27;s health a continuing problem. Friend and actor James Coburn was brought in to serve as second unit director, and he filmed many of the scenes while Peckinpah remained in his on-location trailer. The film wrapped in September 1977, 11 days behind schedule and $5 million over budget. Surprisingly, &quot;Convoy&quot; was the highest-grossing picture of Peckinpah&#x27;s career, notching $46.5 million at the box office, but was panned by many critics, leaving his reputation seriously damaged. For the first time in almost a decade, Peckinpah finished a picture and found himself unemployed.

====2nd unit work on &quot;Jinxed!&quot;====
For the next three years, Peckinpah remained a professional outcast. But during the summer of 1981, his original mentor Don Siegel gave him a chance to return to filmmaking. While shooting &quot;Jinxed!&quot;, a comedy drama starring Bette Midler and Rip Torn, Siegel asked Peckinpah if he would be interested in directing 12 days of second unit work. Peckinpah immediately accepted, and his earnest collaboration, while uncredited, was noted within the industry. For the final time, Peckinpah found himself back in the directing business.

===&quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot;===

By 1982, Peckinpah&#x27;s health was poor. Producers Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer were undaunted, as they felt that having Peckinpah&#x27;s name attached to &quot;The Osterman Weekend&quot; (1983) would lend the suspense thriller an air of respectability. Peckinpah accepted the job but reportedly hated the convoluted screenplay based upon Robert Ludlum&#x27;s novel, which he also disliked. Multiple actors in Hollywood auditioned for the film, intrigued by the opportunity. Many of those who signed on, including John Hurt, Burt Lancaster and Dennis Hopper, did so for less than their usual salaries for a chance to work with the legendary director. By the time shooting wrapped in January 1983 in Los Angeles, Peckinpah and the producers were hardly speaking. Nevertheless, Peckinpah brought the film in on time and on budget, delivering his director&#x27;s cut to the producers. Davis and Panzer were unhappy with Peckinpah&#x27;s version, which included an opening sequence of two characters making love. The producers changed the opening and also deleted other scenes they deemed unnecessary. Peckinpah&#x27;s final film was critically panned. It grossed $6.5 million in the United States (nearly recouping its budget) and did well in Europe and on the new home-video market.

====Julian Lennon music videos====
Peckinpah&#x27;s last work as a filmmaker was undertaken two months before his death. He was hired by producer Martin Lewis to shoot two music videos featuring Julian Lennon—&quot;Valotte&quot; and &quot;Too Late For Goodbyes.&quot; The critically acclaimed videos led to Lennon&#x27;s nomination for Best New Video Artist at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards.

==Documentaries==

*Peckinpah has been the subject of four documentaries; the BBC production &quot;Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron&quot; (1992), directed by Paul Joyce; &quot;Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s West: Legacy of a Hollywood Renegade&quot; (1994); &quot;The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage&quot; (1996), directed by Paul Seydor; and the TCM production &quot;Peckinpah Suite&quot; (2019), which focused on Peckinpah&#x27;s daughter, Lupita Peckinpah. &quot;The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Short Subject.
*Over a 4-year period German film maker Mike Siegel produced and directed &quot;Passion &amp; Poetry – The Ballad of Sam Peckinpah&quot; a two-hour long film about Sam Peckinpah which includes rare Peckinpah interviews and statements. In 2009 the two-disc special edition with a running time of 270 minutes was released on DVD.

==In popular culture==

* John Belushi portrayed Peckinpah as a deranged lunatic who directs his first romantic comedy, by beating up his leading lady in the fifth episode of the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.
* Peckinpah&#x27;s use of violence was parodied by Monty Python in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Salad Days&quot;, in which a lovely day out for an upper-class English family turns into a blood-soaked orgy of severed limbs and gushing wounds. Peckinpah reportedly liked the sketch and enjoyed showing it to friends and family.
* Peckinpah&#x27;s penchant for filming action scenes in slow motion was satirized by UK comedian Benny Hill, playing a milkman in a Western skit called &quot;The Deputy&quot; that first aired on his March 29, 1973, special. In one scene, Hill&#x27;s titular character shoots one of the villains (Bob Todd), who then proceeds to pirouette in extremely slow motion before collapsing.
* In the 1973 Sergio Leone/Tonino Valerii Spaghetti Western, &quot;My Name is Nobody&quot;, the characters Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) and &quot;Nobody&quot; (Terence Hill) meet at a cemetery. Nobody walks past the tombstones reading the names and comes across one labeled &quot;Sam Peckimpah&quot;. He says &quot;Sam Peckimpah. That&#x27;s a beautiful name in Navajo.&quot; Leone named the gang in the film &#x27;The Wild Bunch&#x27;.
* Various Peckinpah films are parodied in Jim Reardon&#x27;s student film &quot;Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown&quot;.
* In the John Waters film &quot;Cecil B. Demented&quot; (2000), several characters have the names of legendary film directors tattooed on their bodies. One of the characters has &quot;Sam Peckinpah&quot; tattooed on his arm.
* Kris Kristofferson recorded &quot;Sam&#x27;s Song (Ask Any Working Girl)&quot;, a brief tribute to the director, for his 1995 release &quot;A Moment of Forever&quot;.

<text>Shanghai is a direct-administered municipality and the most populous urban area in China. The city is located on the Chinese shoreline on the southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River flowing through it. The population of the city proper is the second largest in the world, with around 24.87 million inhabitants in 2023, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 29.87 million residents. As of 2022, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 13 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world&#x27;s major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture. The Port of Shanghai is the world&#x27;s busiest container port.

Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, the Chinese Civil War soon resumed between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), with the latter eventually taking over the city and most of the mainland. From the 1950s to the 1970s, trade was mostly limited to other socialist countries in the Eastern Bloc, causing the city&#x27;s global influence to decline during the Cold War.

Major changes of fortune for the city would occur when economic reforms initiated by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping during the 1980s resulted in an intense redevelopment and revitalization of the city by the 1990s, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance. It is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the Asia-Pacific by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. It is ranked 4th on the Global Financial Centres Index. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. As of 2024, it is home to 13 companies of the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500—the fourth-highest number of any city. The city is also a major global center for research and development and home to numerous Double First-Class Universities, including Fudan University and Shanghai Jiaotong University. The Shanghai Metro, first opened in 1993, is the largest metro network in the world by route length.

Shanghai has been described as the &quot;showpiece&quot; of the economy of China and it is one of the ten biggest economic hubs in the world. Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings, including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund. The Oriental Pearl Tower can be seen from the Bund. Shanghai is known for its cuisine, local language, and cosmopolitan culture. It ranks sixth in the list of cities with the most skyscrapers.

==Etymology==
 The two Chinese characters in the city&#x27;s name are (/&quot;zaon&quot;, &quot;upon&quot;) and (/&quot;hé&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;), together meaning &quot;On the Sea.&quot; The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. Others contend that the city is referenced in historical records dating back 2150 years, and that its ancient name, &quot;Hu&quot;, suggests it was previously a fishing village. In 1280 it was renamed &quot;Shanghai&quot;, which translates to &quot;Above the Sea&quot;. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally &quot;on the sea.&quot;
Shanghai is officially abbreviated (/&quot;wu&quot;) in Chinese, a contraction of (/&quot;wu-doq&quot;, &quot;Harpoon Ditch&quot;), a 4th- or Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean. This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.

=== Alternative names ===
 (&quot;Shēn&quot;/&quot;sén&quot;) or (&quot;Shēnchéng&quot;/&quot;sén-zen&quot;, &quot;Shen City&quot;) was an early name originating from Lord Chunshen, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai. Shanghai-based sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua and &quot;Shen Bao&quot;.

 (&quot;Huátíng&quot;/&quot;gho-din&quot;) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD 751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by Zhao Juzhen, the governor of Wu Commandery, at modern-day Songjiang, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.

 (&quot;Módū&quot;/&quot;mó-tu&quot;, &quot;monster/fiend/magical city&quot;), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth. The name was first mentioned in Japanese novelist Shōfu Muramatsu&#x27;s 1924 novel &quot;Mato&quot;, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomous city where both light and darkness existed.

The city has various nicknames in English, including the &quot;New York of China&quot;, in reference to its status as a cosmopolitan megalopolis and financial hub, the &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot;, and the &quot;Paris of the East.&quot; This is similar to Ho Chi Minh City (also known as Saigon), in Vietnam, which has also been nicknamed as &quot;Paris of the Orient,&quot; due to Vietnam&#x27;s historical French status.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6,000 years ago. During the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the Kingdom of Wu, which was conquered by the Kingdom of Yue, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu. During the Warring States period (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. He ordered the excavation of the Huangpu River. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of &quot;Shēn.&quot; Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the &quot;hù&quot;, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the Old City and became a common nickname and abbreviation for the city.

===Imperial era===

==== Tang, Song, Yuan dynasties ====
During the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town () in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what was historically called a &quot;giant town of the Southeast,&quot; with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. Mi Fu, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the Yangtze and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and Silla. By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai. It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike. From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.

==== Ming dynasty ====

Two important events helped promote Shanghai&#x27;s developments in the Ming dynasty. A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured high and in circumference. A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town&#x27;s economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.

==== Qing dynasty ====
During the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important seaports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (; see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu&#x27;s foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.
In the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to Europe and recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the First Opium War (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city. The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade. The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.

The Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but control of the city was regained by the Qing government in February 1855. In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city&#x27;s eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city. In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession at the city&#x27;s south and southwest.
The First Sino-Japanese War concluded with the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname &quot;the Great Athens of China.&quot;

=== Republic era ===
The Republic of China was established in 1912. The same year, the Old City walls were dismantled as they blocked the city&#x27;s expansion. In July 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was founded in the Shanghai French Concession. On 30 May 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman. Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.

The golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from Jiangsu on 7 July 1927. This new Chinese municipality covered an area of , including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories. Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government&#x27;s first task—the Greater Shanghai Plan—was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion. In the 1920s, &quot;shidaiqu&quot; became a new form of entertainment and was popularised in Shanghai.

The city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s. During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods⁠⁠—some for generations⁠—called themselves &quot;Shanghailanders.&quot; In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 White Russians fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai. These Shanghai Russians constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world&#x27;s fifth-largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners. In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.

==== Japanese invasion ====
On 28 January 1932, Japanese military forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories and public buildings were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing. A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May. In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or death. The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945; multiple war crimes were committed during that time.

A side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the Shanghai Ghetto. Japanese consul to Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi&#x27;s Final Solution to the Jewish Question. They traveled from Keidan, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to Vladivostok from where they traveled by ship to Kobe, Japan. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District and after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the Mirrer Yeshiva, including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.

=== People&#x27;s Republic era ===
On 27 May 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army took control of Shanghai through the Shanghai Campaign. Under the new People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being Beijing and Tianjin). Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, as part of a foreign divestment due to the PRC&#x27;s victory.
After the war, Shanghai&#x27;s economy was restored—from 1949 to 1952, the city&#x27;s agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively. There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time. On 17 January 1958, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai County in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to . The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: Chongming, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui. In 1964, the city&#x27;s administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.

As the industrial center of China with the most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical leftism during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist Jiang Qing and her three allies, together the Gang of Four, were based in the city. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Shanghai&#x27;s society was severely damaged. The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the People&#x27;s Bank of China were Red Guards and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch. The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.The Shanghai People&#x27;s Commune was established in the city during the January Storm of 1967. Despite the disruptions of the Cultural Revolution, Shanghai maintained economic production with a positive annual growth rate.

During the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and heavy industry in China&#x27;s hinterlands in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States, 354,900 Shanghainese were sent to work on Third Front projects. The centrepiece of Shanghai&#x27;s Small Third Front project was the &quot;rear base&quot; in Anhui rear base which served as &quot;a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry.

Since 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city&#x27;s contribution in tax revenue was greater than the investment received in the past 33 years combined. Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from economic liberalizations begun in 1978.

In 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui. That year, the China&#x27;s central government designated Shanghai as the &quot;Dragon Head&quot; of economic reform. As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world&#x27;s Top 10 major cities.

In early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government&#x27;s lockdown measures, which were not lifted until 1 June.

==Geography==
Shanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China&#x27;s east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze&#x27;s natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground. The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north. The municipality&#x27;s northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century. It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai&#x27;s Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang&#x27;s Shengsi County.

Shanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its land area is flat, with an average elevation of . Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes. The city&#x27;s few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island () in Hangzhou Bay. Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.

Downtown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made tributary of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period. The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai&#x27;s eastern shore, the destruction of local wetlands due to the construction of Pudong International Airport has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, Jiuduansha, as a nature preserve.

===Climate===

Shanghai has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), with an average annual temperature of for downtown areas and for suburbs. The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are temperate to cold and damp—northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 4.7 days with snowfall and 1.6 days with snow cover. Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 14.5 days exceed annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons.

The most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 28% in June to 46% in August, the city receives 1,754 hours of bright sunshine annually. (All the mean values mentioned in this paragraph are data observed in Baoshan District） According to China&#x27;s seasonal division standard, from 2001 to 2024, Shanghai enters spring on 9 March, summer on 16 May, autumn on 5 October, and winter on 4 December. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of was set on 19 January 1893) to on 21 July 2017 and 13 July 2022 at a weather station in Xujiahui and 2 August 2024 in Minhang District following a record hot night set at as the highest ever daily minimum temperature at Xujiahui. On 8 August 2013, the weather station at Shanghai Pudong International Airport also observed a high temperature of .
==Cityscape==

The Bund, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neoclassical HSBC Building to the Art Deco Sassoon House (now part of the Peace Hotel). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession. Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.

As a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world. One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was László Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947. His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Cinema, and the Paramount. Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions; and Austrian architect C.H. Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theatre. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren. The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.

One distinctive cultural element is the shikumen (, &quot;stone storage door&quot;) residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch. Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang (). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.

The shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior. Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation in the rooms.
Some of Shanghai&#x27;s buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.

Shanghai—Lujiazui in particular—has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers. Among the most prominent examples are the high Jin Mao Tower, the high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the third tallest in the world. Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors. It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption. The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at , is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui. Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing&#x27;an.

==Politics==
===Structure===

Like all governing institutions in mainland China, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Committee Secretary, officially termed the Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor. The CCP committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary), and has control over the Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government.

Political power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the &quot;de facto&quot; highest decision-making body in China, including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary), Zhu Rongji (Premier), Wu Bangguo (NPC Chairman), Huang Ju (Vice Premier), Xi Jinping (current General Secretary), Yu Zhengsheng (CPPCC Chairman), Han Zheng (Vice Premier and Vice President), and Li Qiang (Premier). Zeng Qinghong, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker. Li Xi, another former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, has become the Politburo Standing Committee and Secretary of CCDI member in 2022. The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption.

Officials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the Shanghai Clique, which has often been viewed as competing against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions. However, Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was largely an independent leader and took anti-corruption campaigns on both factions.

===Administrative divisions===

Shanghai is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of the Central People&#x27;s Government, and is divided into 16 county-level districts.


Although every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous Nanjing Road. Other major commercial areas include Xintiandi and Huaihai Road in Huangpu District, and Xujiahui in Xuhui District. Many universities in Shanghai are located in residential areas in Yangpu District and Putuo District.
Seven of the districts govern Puxi ( &quot;The West Bank,&quot; or &quot;West of the River Pu&quot;), the older part of urban Shanghai on the west bank of the Huangpu River. These seven districts are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper () or the core city (), which comprise Huangpu, Xuhui, Changning, Jing&#x27;an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu.

Pudong ( &quot;The East Bank,&quot; or &quot;East of the River Pu&quot;), the newer part of urban and suburban Shanghai on the east bank of the Huangpu River, is governed by Pudong New Area ().

Seven of the districts govern suburbs, satellite towns, and rural areas farther away from the urban core: Baoshan, Minhang, Jiading, Jinshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Fengxian.

Chongming District comprises the islands of Changxing and Hengsha and most—but not all—of Chongming Island.

The former district of Nanhui was absorbed into Pudong District in 2009. In 2011, Luwan District merged with Huangpu District. , these county-level divisions are further divided into the following 210 township-level divisions: 109 towns, 2 townships, and 99 subdistricts. Those are in turn divided into the following village-level divisions: 3,661 neighborhood committees and 1,704 village committees.

There is a sizable Korean community and Japanese community in Shanghai, largely in the Minhang District.

==Economy==


Shanghai has been described as the &quot;showpiece&quot; of the booming economy of China. The city is a global center for finance and innovation, and a national center for commerce, trade, and transportation, with the world&#x27;s busiest container port—the Port of Shanghai. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area, which includes Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Zhoushan, and Huzhou, was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion in nominal or $2.08 trillion in PPP), exceeding that of Mexico with GDP (nominal) of $1.22 trillion, the 15th largest in the world. As of 2020, the economy of Shanghai was estimated to be $1 trillion (PPP), ranking the most productive metro area of China and among the top ten largest metropolitan economies in the world. Shanghai&#x27;s six largest industries—retail, finance, IT, real estate, machine manufacturing, and automotive manufacturing—comprise about half the city&#x27;s GDP. , Shanghai had a GDP of ($757 billion in nominal) that makes up 4% of China&#x27;s GDP, and a GDP per capita of ( in nominal). In 2022, the average annual disposable income of Shanghai&#x27;s residents was () per capita, while the average annual salary of people employed in urban units in Shanghai was (), making it one of the wealthiest cities in China, but also the most expensive city in mainland China to live in according to a 2023 study by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Since 2018, Shanghai has been hosting the China International Import Expo (CIIE) annually, the world&#x27;s first import-themed national-level expo.

In 2023, the city&#x27;s imports and exports reached CN¥7.73 trillion (US$1.07 trillion), accounting for 18.5% of the national total.

According to Julius Baer&#x27;s Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report, Shanghai was the most expensive city in the world for living a luxurious lifestyle in 2021. Shanghai was the 5th wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $1.8 trillion, and Shanghai was ranked fifth-highest in the number of billionaires by Forbes. Shanghai&#x27;s nominal GDP was projected to reach US$1.3 trillion in 2035 (ranking first in China), making it one of the world&#x27;s Top 5 major cities in terms of GRP according to a study by Oxford Economics. As of August 2024, Shanghai ranked 4th in the world and 2nd in China (after Beijing) by the largest number of the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 companies in the world.

Shanghai was the largest and most prosperous city in East Asia during the 1930s, and its rapid redevelopment began in the 1990s. In the last two decades, Shanghai has been one of the fastest-developing cities in the world; it has recorded double-digit GDP growth in almost every year between 1992 and 2008, before the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

===Finance===

Shanghai is a global financial center, ranking first in the whole of Asia &amp; Oceania region and third globally (after New York and London) in the 28th edition of the Global Financial Centres Index, published in September 2020 by Z/Yen and China Development Institute. Shanghai is also a large hub of the Chinese and global technology industry and home to a large startup ecosystem. As of 2021, the city was ranked as the 2nd Fintech powerhouse in the world after New York City.

, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of , making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world. In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities—including rubber, copper, and zinc—on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally. By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.

In September 2013, with the backing of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the city launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone—the first free-trade zone in mainland China. The zone introduced a number of pilot reforms designed to incentivize foreign investment. In April 2014, &quot;The Banker&quot; reported that Shanghai &quot;has attracted the highest volumes of financial sector foreign direct investment in the Asia-Pacific region in the 12 months to the end of January 2014.&quot; In August 2014, &quot;fDi magazine&quot; named Shanghai the &quot;Chinese Province of the Future 2014/15&quot; due to &quot;particularly impressive performances in the Business Friendliness and Connectivity categories, as well as placing second in the Economic Potential and Human Capital and Lifestyle categories.&quot;

===Manufacturing===

As one of the main industrial centers of China, Shanghai plays a key role in domestic manufacturing and heavy industry. Several industrial zones—including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone—are backbones of Shanghai&#x27;s secondary sector. Shanghai is home to China&#x27;s largest steelmaker Baosteel Group, China&#x27;s largest shipbuilding base Hudong–Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and one of China&#x27;s oldest shipbuilders, the Jiangnan Shipyard. Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors. The company ranked 84 on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2023.

During the Mao era, Shanghai&#x27;s economy primarily focused on light industry.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is a major industry of Shanghai. In 2017, the number of domestic tourists increased by 7.5% to 318 million, while the number of overseas tourists increased by 2.2% to 8.73 million. In 2017, Shanghai was the highest earning tourist city in the world. , Shanghai had 57 five-star hotels, 52 four star hotels, 1,942 travel agencies, 144 rated tourist attractions, and 34 red tourist attractions.

In 2023, Shanghai&#x27;s tourism industry generated an added value of CN¥177.12 billion (US$24.53 billion), marking a remarkable 98.5% increase compared to the previous year. The city welcomed a total of 3.64 million tourists, a 4.8-fold growth compared to 2022. The number of foreign tourists reached 2.41 million with a 5.2-fold increase.

The conference and meeting sector is also growing. According to the International Congress and Convention Association, Shanghai hosted 82 international meetings in 2018, a 34% increase from 61 in 2017.

===Free-trade zone===
Shanghai is home to China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. , it is also the second largest free-trade zone in mainland China in terms of land area (behind , which covers the whole Hainan province) by covering an area of and integrating four existing bonded zones—Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area, and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone. The industrial chain of port logistics has shaped the future development direction of the free-trade zone in Shanghai. Currently, two port chain centers have been approved for construction in Waigaoqiao and Yangshan. Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.

==Demographics==


, Shanghai had a total population of 24,874,500, including 14,801,700 (59.5%) hukou holders (registered locally). , 89.3% of Shanghai&#x27;s population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas. Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind Chongqing, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller. According to the OECD, Shanghai&#x27;s metropolitan area has an estimated population of 34 million.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and 20,800 Koreans. The actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher. Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city—40.3% (9.8 million) of the city&#x27;s residents are from other regions of China.

Shanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city&#x27;s registered population, the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China. This has also caused the city to experience population aging—in 2021, 17.4% (4.3 million) of the city&#x27;s registered population was aged 65 or above. In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.

===Religion===


Due to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city&#x27;s population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1% while the remaining 86.9% of the population could be either atheists or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors or folk religious sects.
Buddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple—the largest temple in Shanghai—and the Jing&#x27;an Temple were founded. Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple. , Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers. The religion also has its own college, the , and its own press, .

Catholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo. The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946. Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui—the largest Catholic church in the city, the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica. Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches. The Protestant All Saints Church in Huangpu was built in 1925 and features a Neo-Romanesque tower. Shanghai has long had the highest concentration of urban Catholics in China.

Although currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city&#x27;s history. After the Treaty of Nanking ended the First Opium War in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The Sassoons amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai&#x27;s skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929. The Hardoons were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family, Silas Hardoon, one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed Nanjing Road, which then housed departmental stores in the International Settlement, that is now one of the busiest shopping centers in the world.

During World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum. In 1939, Horace Kadoorie, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.

Islam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city&#x27;s first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng () era under Emperor Huizong (reigned 1333 – 1368). Shanghai&#x27;s Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques—including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque—were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu. According to the sixth census of China in 2010, there are an estimated 85,000 Muslims in Shanghai, compared from 20,000 in 1949 and 7,000 in 1936.

Shanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.

===Language===

The vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese language family. This is different from the national language, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese. Modern Shanghainese derives from the indigenous Wu spoken in the former Songjiang prefecture but has been influenced by other dialects of Taihu Wu, most notably Suzhounese, and Ningbonese

Prior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou, and was known as &quot;the local tongue&quot; (), a name which is now used in suburbs only. In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese ( or simply ) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government. Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.

With the first tram line been in service in 1908, trams were once popular in Shanghai in the early 20th century. By 1925, there were 328 tramcars and 14 routes operated by Chinese, French, and British companies collaboratively, all of which were nationalized after the PRC&#x27;s victory in 1949. Since the 1960s, many tram lines were either dismantled or replaced by trolleybus or motorbus lines; the last tram line was demolished in 1975. Shanghai reintroduced trams in 2010, as a modern rubber-tire Translohr system in Zhangjiang area of East Shanghai as Zhangjiang Tram. In 2018, the steel wheeled Songjiang Tram started operating in Songjiang District. Additional tram lines are under planning in Hongqiao Subdistrict and Jiading District .

===Roads and expressways===

Shanghai is a major hub of China&#x27;s expressway network. Many national expressways (prefixed with the letter G) pass through or end in Shanghai, including Jinghu Expressway (overlaps with Hurong Expressway), Shenhai Expressway, Hushaan Expressway, Huyu Expressway, Hukun Expressway (overlaps with Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway), and Shanghai Ring Expressway.

According to the city&#x27;s vehicle regulations introduced in June 2016, only locally registered residents and those who have paid social insurance or individual income taxes for over three years are eligible to be in the auction. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and alleviate congestion. Public transport, biking infrastructure, walkability, generally permits to live in the city without a car.

===Railways===

Shanghai has four major railway stations: Shanghai railway station, Shanghai South railway station, Shanghai West railway station, and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station. All are connected to the metro network and serve as hubs in the railway network of China. And now Shanghai has around twenty railway lines running under this city, which largely facilitate people&#x27;s life in Shanghai.

Built in 1876, the Woosung railway was the first railway in Shanghai and the first railway in operation in China By 1909, Shanghai–Nanjing railway and Shanghai–Hangzhou railway were in service. , the two railways have been integrated into two main railways in China: Beijing–Shanghai railway and Shanghai–Kunming railway, respectively.

Shanghai has four high-speed railways (HSRs): Beijing–Shanghai HSR (overlaps with Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger railway), Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai–Kunming HSR, and Shanghai–Nantong railway. One HSR is under construction: Shanghai–Suzhou–Huzhou HSR.

===Air and sea===

Shanghai is one of the largest air transportation hubs in Asia. The city has two commercial airports: Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Pudong International Airport is the primary international airport, while Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights with limited short-haul international flights. In 2018, Pudong International Airport served 74.0 million passengers and handled 3.8 million tons of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest airport by passenger volume and third-busiest airport by cargo volume. The same year, Hongqiao International Airport served 43.6 million passengers, making it the 19th-busiest airport by passenger volume.
Since its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China. Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.

Overtaking the Port of Singapore in 2010, the Port of Shanghai has become world&#x27;s busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018. Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.

Shanghai is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and the Eastern Europe.

== Society ==
Urban Plan and infrastructure

After the opening of the port, Shanghai carried out a large number of municipal constructions by the Public Concession Municipal Council, including power plants and water plants. The &quot;Greater Shanghai Plan&quot; formulated in 1927 was the earliest urban master plan for Shanghai. Now, Shanghai&#x27;s urban planning is carried out in accordance with the &quot;Shanghai Urban Master Plan&quot; (1999–2020) approved by the State Council in May 2001, with the construction of an international economic, financial, trade and shipping center as the core. In the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, you can see the corresponding urban planning model within the scope of more than 100 square kilometers of the inner ring road made at a scale of 1:500.

Yangshupu Water Plant

In the decades after 1949, municipal construction remained at the stage of building new workers&#x27; housing and replacing electricity and water pipes. Since the 1990s, Shanghai has started large-scale municipal construction, widely promoting flat-to-slope projects (converting the flat roofs of old houses into sloped roofs) and roof water tank renovation projects. Illegal buildings and dirty roads are also rectified every year. Taking the opportunity of hosting the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, the Shanghai municipal government has carried out large-scale renovations on the city landscape, roads, and residential buildings. Shanghai has a large area of shantytowns in history. In the 1990s, 3.65 million square meters of dilapidated shanties were renovated, but the shantytowns in Caojia Village and Guangfu Road have never been started due to cost issues. The urban village landscape, which is in sharp contrast with the surrounding high-rise buildings, remains to this day.

Before Shanghai opened its port, all gardens were private gardens, the most famous of which were Yuyuan, Luxiang Garden, Guyi Garden, Qiuxia Garden, Zuibaichi, etc. After the opening of the port, public gardens began to appear, and the public garden born in 1868 was the first park. But before 1928, Chinese people were not allowed to enter the parks built by the Municipal Council and the Municipal Council. At present, except for individual parks such as Shanghai Zoo and Shanghai Wild Animal Park, park tickets have been cancelled in Shanghai. Since 2000, in order to purify the city&#x27;s air and beautify the environment, Shanghai has begun to build a number of open green spaces in the city center and suburbs. By 2008, the total green area of Shanghai was 34,256 hectares, the public green area was 14,777 hectares, and the urban green coverage rate was 38%. The total forest area of the city reached nearly 100,000 hectares, and the forest coverage rate was 11.6%.

In order to solve the huge demand for funds for large-scale municipal construction since the 1990s, some officials of the Shanghai Municipal Government led a major reform of Shanghai&#x27;s investment and financing system, first using the land resources in the hands of the government and introducing the financing method of land lease. During this period, Shanghai raised more than 100 billion yuan through land lease. In 1997, affected by the Asian financial crisis, Shanghai&#x27;s land lease was greatly reduced, but the scale of the domestic securities market expanded rapidly, residents&#x27; savings deposits continued to grow, and social surplus funds increased. Faced with this situation, the Shanghai Municipal Government formulated policies to push profitable infrastructure projects to the market and implement social financing, and at the same time formulated a number of measures to reduce the risk of enterprises participating in financing. In the 1990s, Shanghai raised more than 200 billion yuan through social channels. At the same time, Shanghai actively draws on international experience, and through further improving development mechanisms; expanding the participation of capital markets and social insurance funds in financing; exploring the use of internationally accepted financing methods such as BOT and BOO; and increasing public financial support, further expanding the scope and capacity of financing to meet the needs of municipal construction.

== Culture ==

The culture of Shanghai was formed by a combination of the nearby Wuyue culture and the &quot;East Meets West&quot; Haipai culture. Wuyue culture&#x27;s influence is manifested in Shanghainese language—which comprises dialectal elements from nearby Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Ningbo—and Shanghai cuisine, which was influenced by Jiangsu cuisine and Zhejiang cuisine. Haipai culture emerged after Shanghai became a prosperous port in the early 20th century, with numerous foreigners from Europe, America, Japan, and India moving into the city. The culture fuses elements of Western cultures with the local Wuyue culture, and its influence extends to the city&#x27;s literature, fashion, architecture, music, and cuisine. The term Haipai—originally referring to a painting school in Shanghai—was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars for admiring capitalism and Western culture. In the early 21st century, Shanghai has been recognized as a new influence and inspiration for cyberpunk culture.

=== Museums ===
Cultural curation in Shanghai has seen significant growth since 2013, with several new museums having been opened in the city. This is in part due to the city&#x27;s 2018 development plans, which aim to make Shanghai &quot;an excellent global city.&quot; As such, Shanghai has several museums of regional and national importance. The Shanghai Museum has one of the largest collections of Chinese artifacts in the world, including a large collection of ancient Chinese bronzes and ceramics. The China Art Museum, located in the former China pavilion at Expo 2010, is one of the largest museums in Asia and displays an animated replica of the 12th century painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival. The Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum are notable natural history and science museums. In addition, there are numerous smaller, specialist museums housed in important archeological and historical sites, such as the Songze Museum, the Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the site of the former Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, and the Shanghai Post Office Museum (located in the General Post Office Building).

=== Cuisine ===
Benbang cuisine () is cooking style that originated in the 1600s, with influences from surrounding provinces. It emphasizes the use of condiments while retaining the original flavors of the raw ingredients. Sugar is an important ingredient in Benbang cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Signature dishes of Benbang cuisine include Xiaolongbao, Red braised pork belly, and Shanghai hairy crab. Haipai cuisine, on the other hand, is a Western-influenced cooking style that originated in Shanghai. It absorbed elements from French, British, Russian, German, and Italian cuisines and adapted them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients. Famous dishes of Haipai cuisine include Shanghai-style borscht (, &quot;Russian soup&quot;), crispy pork cutlets, and Shanghai salad derived from Olivier salad. Both Benbang and Haipai cuisine make use of a variety of seafood, including freshwater fish, shrimps, and crabs.

Well-prepared crystal shrimp is tender yet crispy, with a robust shrimp flavor and a reddish hue tinged with milky white.

=== Arts ===

The Songjiang School (), containing the Huating School () founded by Gu Zhengyi, was a small painting school in Shanghai during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It was represented by Dong Qichang. The school was considered an expansion of the Wu School in Suzhou, the cultural center of the Jiangnan region at the time. In the mid 19th century, the Shanghai School movement commenced, focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style but more on the visual content of painting through the use of bright colors. Secular objects like flowers and birds were often selected as themes. Western art was introduced to Shanghai in 1847 by Spanish missionary Joannes Ferrer (), and the city&#x27;s first Western atelier was established in 1864 inside the Tushanwan orphanage (土山湾孤儿院). During the Republic of China, many famous artists including Zhang Daqian, Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai, and Yan Wenliang settled in Shanghai, allowing it to gradually become the art center of China. Various art forms—including photography, wood carving, sculpture, comics (Manhua), and Lianhuanhua—thrived. Sanmao was created to dramatize the chaos created by the Second Sino-Japanese War. Today, the most comprehensive art and cultural facility in Shanghai is the China Art Museum. In addition, the Chinese Painting Academy features traditional Chinese painting, while the Power Station of Art displays contemporary art. The city also has many art galleries, many of which are located in the M50 Art District and Tianzifang. First held in 1996, the Shanghai Biennale has become an important place for Chinese and foreign arts to interact.

Traditional Chinese opera (Xiqu) became a popular source of public entertainment in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, monologue and burlesque in Shanghainese appeared, absorbing elements from traditional dramas. The Great World opened in 1912 and was a significant stage at the time. In the 1920s, Pingtan expanded from Suzhou to Shanghai. Pingtan art developed rapidly to 103 programs every day by the 1930s because of the abundant commercial radio stations in the city. Around the same time, a Shanghai-style Beijing Opera was formed. Led by Zhou Xinfang and , it attracted many Xiqu masters, like Mei Lanfang, to the city. A small troupe from Shengxian (now Shengzhou) also began to promote Yue opera on the Shanghainese stage. A unique style of opera, Shanghai opera, was formed when local folksongs were fused with modern operas. As of 2012, prominent troupes in Shanghai include Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company, , Shanghai Yue Opera House, and Shanghai Huju Opera House.

Drama appeared in missionary schools in Shanghai in the late 19th century. At the time, it was mainly performed in English. &quot;Scandals in Officialdom&quot; (), staged in 1899, was one of the earliest-recorded plays. In 1907, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly&quot; () was performed at the . After the New Culture Movement, drama became a popular way for students and intellectuals to express their views. The city has several major institutes of theater training, including the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, the Shanghai Opera House, and the Shanghai Theatre Academy. Notable theaters in Shanghai include the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center, and the People&#x27;s Theatre.
Shanghai is considered to be the birthplace of Chinese cinema. China&#x27;s first short film, &quot;The Difficult Couple&quot; (1913), and the country&#x27;s first fictional feature film, &quot;An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather&quot; (, 1923) were both produced in Shanghai. Shanghai&#x27;s film industry grew during the early 1930s, generating stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors as a result of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry. The movie &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; directed by Wong Kar-wai, a Shanghai native, depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.

Shanghai&#x27;s cultural festivals include Shanghai International Television Festival, Shanghai International Film Festival, Shanghai International Art Festival, Shanghai International Tourism Festival, Shanghai Spring International Music Festival, etc. Shanghai TV Festival is the earliest international TV festival founded in China.

Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of St. John&#x27;s University, Shanghai&#x27;s first international college; today, the park features sakura and peony gardens and a 150-year-old platanus, and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.

One of Shanghai&#x27;s newer parks is the Xujiahui Park, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park. Shanghai Botanical Garden is located southwest of the city center and was established in 1978. In 2011, the largest botanical garden in Shanghai—Shanghai Chen Shan Botanical Garden—opened in Songjiang District.
Other notable parks in Shanghai include Lu Xun Park, Century Park, Gucun Park, Gongqing Forest Park, and Jing&#x27;an Park.

The Shanghai Disney Resort Project was approved by the government on 4 November 2009 and opened in 2016.
The $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Pudong features a castle that is the biggest among Disney&#x27;s resorts. More than 11 million people visited the resort in its first year of operation.

===Air pollution===

Air pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards. During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard. On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic meter. Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students&#x27; outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.

On 23 January 2014, Yang Xiong, the mayor of Shanghai, announced that three main measures would be taken to manage the air pollution in Shanghai, along with surrounding Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. The measures involved implementing the 2013 air-cleaning program, establishing a linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces, and improving the city&#x27;s early-warning systems. On 12 February 2014, China&#x27;s cabinet announced that a () fund will be set up to help companies meet the new environmental standards. The effect of the policy was significant. From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city&#x27;s annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.

In 2023, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Shanghai reached a rate of 87.7%, a 0.6% increase compared to the previous year. The annual average concentration of inhalable particulate matter (PM10) was 48 microgrammes per cubic meter, while the annual average concentration of fine particulate matter was 28 microgrammes per cubic meter.

===Environmental protection===
Public awareness of the environment is growing, and the city is investing in a number of environmental protection projects. A 16-year rehabilitation of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city, was finished in 2012, clearing the creek of barges and factories and removing 1.3 million cubic meters of sludge. Additionally, the government has moved almost all the factories within the city center to either the outskirts or other provinces, and provided incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis.

On 1 July 2019, Shanghai adopted a new garbage-classification system that sorts out waste into residual waste, kitchen waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste. The wastes are collected by separate vehicles and sent to incineration plants, landfills, recycling centers, and hazardous-waste-disposal facilities, respectively.

In regard to foreign publications in Shanghai, Hartmut Walravens of the IFLA Newspapers Section said that when the Japanese controlled Shanghai in the 1940s &quot;it was very difficult to publish good papers – one either had to concentrate on emigration problems, or cooperate like the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="27644" wikidata="Q36755" url="?curid=27644" title="Sinai Peninsula">
<text>The Sinai Peninsula, or simply Sinai ( ; ; ; ), is a peninsula in Egypt, and the only part of the country located in Asia. It is between the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south, and is a land bridge between Asia and Africa. Sinai has a land area of about (6 percent of Egypt&#x27;s total area) and a population of approximately 600,000 people. Administratively, the vast majority of the area of the Sinai Peninsula is divided into two governorates: the South Sinai Governorate and the North Sinai Governorate. Three other governorates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez Governorate on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia Governorate in the center, and Port Said Governorate in the north.

In the classical era, the region was known as Arabia Petraea. The peninsula acquired the name &quot;Sinai&quot; in modern times due to the assumption that a mountain near Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery is the Biblical Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai is one of the most religiously significant places in the Abrahamic faiths.

The Sinai Peninsula has been a part of Egypt from the First Dynasty of ancient Egypt ( BC). This comes in stark contrast to the region north of it, the Levant (the present-day territories of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine), which, due largely to its strategic geopolitical location and cultural convergences, has historically been the center of conflict between Egypt and various states of Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. In periods of foreign occupation, the Sinai was, like the rest of Egypt, also occupied and controlled by foreign empires, in more recent history the Ottoman Empire (1517–1867) and the United Kingdom (1882–1956). Israel invaded and occupied Sinai during the Suez Crisis (known in Egypt as the &quot;Tripartite Aggression&quot; due to the simultaneous coordinated attack by the UK, France and Israel) of 1956, and during the Six-Day War of 1967. On 6 October 1973, Egypt launched the Yom Kippur War, seizing most of the east bank of the Suez Canal and negotiating the rest of Sinai. In 1982, as a result of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty of 1979, Israel withdrew from all of the Sinai Peninsula except the contentious territory of Taba, which was returned after a ruling by a commission of arbitration in 1989.

Today, Sinai has become a tourist destination due to its natural setting, rich coral reefs, and biblical history.

==Name==

Because the Sinai Peninsula was the main region where mining of turquoise was carried out in Ancient Egypt, it was called &quot;Biau&quot; (the &quot;Mining Country&quot;) and &quot;Khetiu Mafkat&quot; (&quot;Ladders of Turquoise&quot;) by the ancient Egyptians.

The origin of the modern name is a source of contention (see Biblical Mount Sinai for a fuller discussion). The name &quot;Sinai&quot; (, ) may have been derived from the ancient Mesopotamian moon-god Sin. The moon-deity Sin is associated with the area; the ancient Egyptian moon-god Thoth is also associated with Sin, and his worship was widespread throughout the south tip of the Sinai Peninsula. &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1901-1906) quotes a Rabbinic source, the 8th- or 9th-century Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, which derives the name from the biblical Hebrew word &quot;seneh&quot; (), a word only known from two occurrences in the Hebrew Bible, in both cases referring to the burning bush. Rabbi Eliezer opines that Mount Horeb only received the name &quot;Sinai&quot; after God appeared to Moses in the shape of a burning bush.

Its modern Arabic name is &#x27; (Egyptian Arabic &#x27;; ). The modern Arabic is an adoption of the Biblical name; the 19th-century Arabic designation of Sinai was &quot;Jebel el-Tūr&quot;, and the name of the mountain is derived from the town of El Tor (formerly called &quot;Tur Sinai&quot;), whose name comes from the Arabic term for the mountain where the prophet Moses received the Tablets of the Law from God, thus this mountain is designated as &quot;&quot;Jabal Aṭ-Ṭūr&quot; (Arabic: جبل الطّور)&quot;, and the town is also the capital of the South Sinai Governorate of Egypt. As another Arabic word for &quot;mass of very high land going up to a peak – mountain&quot; is &quot;&quot;Ṭūr&quot;.&quot;

The English name came from Latin, ultimately from Hebrew סִינַי‎, pronounced /siˈnái/ (, in English phonetic spelling). In English, the name is now usually pronounced . An alternative, now dated pronunciation in English was .

==Geography==
Sinai is triangular in shape, with its northern shore lying on the southern Mediterranean Sea, and its southwest and southeast shores on the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba of the Red Sea. It is linked to the African continent by the Isthmus of Suez, wide strip of land, containing the Suez Canal. The eastern isthmus, linking it to the Asian mainland, is around wide. The peninsula is on the African Plate with the Arabian Plate on its eastern boundary.

The southernmost tip is the Ras Muhammad National Park.

Most of the Sinai Peninsula is divided among the two governorates of Egypt: South Sinai (Ganub Sina) and North Sinai (Shamal Sina). Together, they comprise around 60,000 square kilometres (23,000 sq mi) and have a population (January 2013) of 597,000. Three more governates span the Suez Canal, crossing into African Egypt: Suez (el-Sewais) is on the southern end of the Suez Canal, Ismailia (el-Isma&#x27;ileyyah) in the centre, and Port Said in the north.

The largest city of Sinai is Arish, capital of the North Sinai, with around 160,000 residents. Other larger settlements include Sharm El Sheikh and El-Tor, on the southern coast. Inland Sinai is arid (effectively a desert), mountainous and sparsely populated, the largest settlements being Saint Catherine and Nekhel.

===Climate===
Sinai is one of the coldest provinces in Egypt because of its high altitudes and mountainous topographies. Winter temperatures in some of Sinai&#x27;s cities and towns reach .

==History==
===Chalcolithic===
A cave with paintings of people and animals was discovered about north of Mount Catherine in January 2020, dates back to the Chalcolithic Period, –4th millennium BCE.

===Ancient Egypt===
From the time of the First Dynasty or before, the Egyptians mined turquoise in Sinai at two locations, now called by their Egyptian Arabic names Wadi Maghareh and Serabit el-Khadim. The mines were worked intermittently and on a seasonal basis for thousands of years. Modern attempts to exploit the deposits have been unprofitable. These may be the first historically attested mines.

The fortress Tjaru in western Sinai was a place of banishment for Egyptian criminals. The Way of Horus connected it across northern Sinai with ancient Canaan.

===Achaemenid Persian Period===
At the end of the time of Darius I, the Great (521–486 BCE) Sinai was part of the Persian province of Abar-Nahra, which means &#x27;beyond the river [Euphrates]&#x27;.

Cambyses successfully managed the crossing of the hostile Sinai Desert, traditionally Egypt&#x27;s first and strongest line of defence, and brought the Egyptians under Psamtik III, son and successor of Ahmose, to battle at Pelusium. The Egyptians lost and retired to Memphis; the city fell to the Persian control and the Pharaoh was carried off in captivity to Susa in Persia.

===Roman and Byzantine Periods===
Rhinocorura (Greek for &quot;Cut-off Noses&quot;) and the eponymous region around it were used by Ptolemaid Egypt as a place of banishment for criminals, today known as Arish.

After the death of the last Nabatean king, Rabbel II Soter, in 106, the Roman emperor Trajan faced practically no resistance and conquered the kingdom on 22 March 106. With this conquest, the Roman Empire went on to control all shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The Sinai Peninsula became part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea.

Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on the foot of Mount Sinai was constructed by order of the Emperor Justinian between 527 and 565. Most of the Sinai Peninsula became part of the province of Palaestina Salutaris in the 6th century.

===Ayyubid Period===
During the Crusades it was under the control of Fatimid Caliphate. Later, Sultan Saladin abolished the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and took this region under his control too. It was the military route from Cairo to Damascus during the Crusades. And in order to secure this route, he built a citadel on the island of Pharaoh (near present Taba) known by his name &#x27;Saladin&#x27;s Citadel&#x27;.

===Mamluk and Ottoman Periods===

The peninsula was governed as part of Egypt under the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt from 1260 until 1517, when the Ottoman Sultan, Selim the Grim, defeated the Egyptians at the Battles of Marj Dabiq and al-Raydaniyya, and incorporated Egypt into the Ottoman Empire. From then until 1906, Sinai was administered by the Ottoman provincial government of the &quot;Pashalik&quot; of Egypt, even following the establishment of the Muhammad Ali dynasty&#x27;s rule over the rest of Egypt in 1805.

===British control===
In 1906, the Ottoman Porte formally transferred administration of Sinai to the Khedivate of Egypt, which essentially meant that it fell under the control of the British Empire, who had occupied and largely controlled Egypt since the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. The border imposed by the British runs in an almost straight line from Rafah on the Mediterranean shore to Taba on the Gulf of Aqaba. This line has served as the de jure eastern border of Egypt ever since.

===Israeli invasions and occupation===
===1956 war===
In 1956, Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal, a waterway marking the boundary between Egyptian territory in Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. Thereafter, Israeli ships were prohibited from using the Canal, owing to the state of war between the two states. Egypt also prohibited ships from using Egyptian territorial waters on the eastern side of the peninsula to travel to and from Israel, effectively imposing a blockade on the Israeli port of Eilat. In October 1956, in what is known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression, Israel Defense Forces troops, aided by the United Kingdom and France (which sought to reverse the nationalization and regain control over the Suez Canal), invaded Sinai and occupied much of the peninsula within a few days. In March 1957, Israel withdrew its forces from Sinai, following strong pressure from the United States and the Soviet Union. Thereafter, the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) was stationed in Sinai to prevent any further conflict in the Sinai.

===1967 war===


On 16 May 1967, Egypt ordered the UNEF out of Sinai and reoccupied it militarily. Secretary-General U Thant eventually complied and ordered the withdrawal without Security Council authorisation. In the course of the Six-Day War that broke out shortly thereafter, Israel occupied the entire Sinai Peninsula, and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan (which Jordan had controlled since 1949), and the Golan Heights from Syria. The Suez Canal, the east bank of which was now occupied by Israel, was closed. Israel commenced efforts at large scale Israeli settlement in the Sinai Peninsula.

Following the Israeli conquest of Sinai, Egypt launched the War of Attrition (1967–70) aimed at forcing Israel to withdraw from the Sinai. The war saw protracted conflict in the Suez Canal Zone, ranging from limited to large-scale combat. Israeli shelling of the cities of Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez on the west bank of the canal, led to high civilian casualties (including the virtual destruction of Suez), and contributed to the flight of 700,000 Egyptian internal refugees. Ultimately, the war concluded in 1970 with no change in the front line.

On 6 October 1973, Egypt commenced Operation Badr to retake the Sinai, while Syria launched a simultaneous operation to retake the Golan Heights, thereby beginning the Yom Kippur War (known in Egypt as the &quot;October War&quot;). Egyptian engineering forces built pontoon bridges to cross the Suez Canal, and stormed the Bar Lev Line, Israel&#x27;s defensive line along the Suez Canal&#x27;s east bank. Though the Egyptians maintained control of most of the east bank of the Suez Canal, in the later stages of the war, the Israeli military crossed the southern section of the Suez Canal, cutting off the Egyptian 3rd Army, and occupied a section of the Suez Canal&#x27;s west bank. The war ended following a mutually agreed-upon ceasefire. After the war, as part of the subsequent Sinai Disengagement Agreements, Israel withdrew from immediate proximity with the Suez Canal, with Egypt agreeing to permit passage of Israeli ships. The canal was reopened in 1975, with President Anwar Sadat leading the first convoy through the canal aboard an Egyptian Navy destroyer.

===1979–1982 Israeli withdrawal===
In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in which Israel agreed to withdraw from the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula. Israel subsequently withdrew in several stages, ending in 1982. The Israeli pull-out involved dismantling almost all Israeli settlements, including the settlement of Yamit in north-eastern Sinai. The exception was that the coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh (which the Israelis had founded as Ofira during their occupation of the Sinai Peninsula) was not dismantled. The Treaty allows monitoring of Sinai by the Multinational Force and Observers, and limits the number of Egyptian military forces in the peninsula.

====Sinai peacekeeping zones====
Article 2 of Annex I of the Peace Treaty called for the Sinai Peninsula to be divided into zones. Within these zones, Egypt and Israel were permitted varying degrees of military buildup:

* Zone A: Between the Suez Canal and Line A. Egypt is permitted a mechanized infantry division with a total of 22,000 troops in Zone A.
* Zone B: Between Line A and Line B. Egypt is permitted four border security battalions to support the civilian police in Zone B.
* Zone C: Between Line B and the Egypt–Israel border. Only the MFO and the Egyptian civilian police are permitted within Zone C.
* Zone D: Between the Egypt–Israel border and Line D. Israel is permitted four infantry battalions in Zone D.

===Early 21st century security issues===
Since the early 2000s, Sinai has been the site of several terror attacks against tourists, the majority of whom are Egyptian. Investigations have shown that these were mainly motivated by a resentment of the poverty faced by many Bedouin in the area. Attacking the tourist industry was viewed as a method of damaging the industry so that the government would pay more attention to their situation. (See 2004 Sinai bombings, 2005 Sharm El Sheikh bombings and 2006 Dahab bombings). Since the 2011 Egyptian revolution, unrest has become more prevalent in the area including the August 2012 Sinai attack in which 16 Egyptian soldiers were killed by militants. (See Sinai insurgency.)

Also on the rise are kidnappings of refugees. According to Meron Estifanos, Eritrean refugees are often kidnapped by Bedouin in the northern Sinai, tortured, raped, and only released after paying a large ransom.

Under President el-Sisi, Egypt has implemented a rigorous policy of controlling the border to the Gaza Strip, including the dismantling of tunnels between Gaza and Sinai.

==Demographics==
The two governorates of North Sinai and South Sinai have a total population of 597,000 (January 2013). This figure rises to 1,400,000 by including Western Sinai, the parts of the Port Said, Ismailia and Suez Governorates lying east of the Suez Canal. Port Said alone has a population of roughly 500,000 people (January 2013). Portions of the populations of Ismailia and Suez live in west Sinai, while the rest live on the western side of the Suez Canal.

The population of Sinai has largely consisted of desert-dwelling Bedouins with their colourful traditional costumes and significant culture. Large numbers of Egyptians from the Nile Valley and Delta moved to the area to work in tourism, but development adversely affected the native Bedouin population. In order to help alleviate their problems, various NGOs began to operate in the region, including the Makhad Trust, a UK charity that assists the Bedouin in developing a sustainable income while protecting Sinai&#x27;s natural environment, heritage and culture.

==Economy==
Since the Israeli–Egyptian peace treaty, Sinai&#x27;s scenic spots (including coral reefs offshore) and religious structures have become important to the tourism industry. The most popular tourist destination in Sinai are Mount Sinai (&quot;Jabal Musa&quot;) and St Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, which is considered to be the oldest working Christian monastery in the world, and the beach resorts of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba. Most tourists arrive at Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, through Eilat, Israel and the Taba Border Crossing, by road from Cairo or by ferry from Aqaba in Jordan.

Cacti – especially cactus pears – are grown in Sinai. They are a crop of the Columbian Exchange. Cactus hedges – both intentionally planted and wild garden escapes – formed an important part of defensible positions during the Sinai and Palestine campaign of World War I. Some unfamiliar soldiers even tried eating them, to negative result.

Dromedary herding is important here. &quot;Trypanosoma evansi&quot; is a constant concern and is transmitted by several vectors. Although ticks have not been proven to be among them, Mahmoud and Gray 1980 and El-Kady 1998 experimentally demonstrate survival of &quot;T. evansi&quot; in camel ticks of the &quot;Hyalomma&quot; for several hours in the real bio-climatic conditions of Sinai.

<text>Spy fiction is a genre of literature involving espionage as an important context or plot device. It emerged in the early twentieth century, inspired by rivalries and intrigues between the major powers, and the establishment of modern intelligence agencies. It was given new impetus by the development of fascism and communism in the lead-up to World War II, continued to develop during the Cold War, and received a fresh impetus from the emergence of rogue states, international criminal organizations, global terrorist networks, maritime piracy and technological sabotage and espionage as potent threats to Western societies. As a genre, spy fiction is thematically related to the novel of adventure (&quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, 1894, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, 1905), the thriller (such as the works of Edgar Wallace) and the politico-military thriller (&quot;The Schirmer Inheritance&quot;, 1953, &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, 1955).

==History==

Commentator William Bendler noted that &quot;Chapter 2 of the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s Book of Joshua might count as the first Spy Story in world literature. (...) Three thousand years before James Bond seduced Pussy Galore and turned her into his ally against Goldfinger, the spies sent by General Joshua into the city of Jericho did much the same with Rahab the Harlot.&quot;

===Nineteenth century===

Spy fiction as a genre started to emerge during the 19th Century. Early examples of the espionage novel are &quot;The Spy&quot; (1821) and &quot;The Bravo&quot; (1831), by American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. &quot;The Bravo&quot; attacks European anti-republicanism, by depicting Venice as a city-state where a ruthless oligarchy wears the mask of the &quot;serene republic&quot;.

In nineteenth-century France, the Dreyfus Affair (1894–99) contributed much to public interest in espionage. For some twelve years (ca. 1894–1906), the Affair, which involved elements of international espionage, treason, and antisemitism, dominated French politics. The details were reported by the world press: an Imperial German penetration agent betraying to Germany the secrets of the General Staff of the French Army; the French counter-intelligence riposte of sending a charwoman to rifle the trash in the German Embassy in Paris, were news that inspired successful spy fiction.

At least two Sherlock Holmes stories have clear espionage themes. In &quot;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&quot;, Holmes recovers the text of a secret Naval Treaty between Britain and Italy, stolen by a daring spy. In &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, Holmes himself acts as a double agent, providing Germany with a lot of false information on the eve of WWI.

===Twentieth century===

The major themes of a spy in the lead-up to the First World War were the continuing rivalry between the European colonial powers for dominance in Asia, the growing threat of conflict in Europe, the domestic threat of revolutionaries and anarchists, and historical romance.

&quot;Kim&quot; (1901) by Rudyard Kipling concerns the Anglo–Russian &quot;Great Game&quot;, which consisted of a geopolitical rivalry and strategic warfare for supremacy in Central Asia, usually in Afghanistan. &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1907) by Joseph Conrad examines the psychology and ideology motivating the socially marginal men and women of a revolutionary cell. A diplomat from an unnamed (but clearly Russian) embassy forces a double-agent, Verloc, to organise a failed attempt to bomb the Greenwich Observatory in the hope that the revolutionaries will be blamed. Conrad&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; (1911), follows a reluctant spy sent by the Russian Empire to infiltrate a group of revolutionaries based in Geneva. G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot; (1908) is a metaphysical thriller ostensibly based on the infiltration of an anarchist organisation by detectives, but the story is actually a vehicle for exploring society&#x27;s power structures and the nature of suffering.
The fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Arthur Conan Doyle, served as a spy hunter for the British government in the stories &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; (1912). In &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (1917), he served Crown and country as a double agent, transmitting false intelligence to Imperial Germany on the eve of the Great War.

&quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1905) by Baroness Orczy chronicled an English aristocrat&#x27;s derring-do in rescuing French aristocrats from the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution (1789–99).

But the term &quot;spy novel&quot; was defined by &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1903) by Irish author Erskine Childers. &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; described two British yachtsman cruising off the North Sea coast of Germany who turned amateur spies when they discover a secret German plan to invade Britain. Its success created a market for the invasion literature subgenre, which was flooded by imitators. William Le Queux and E. Phillips Oppenheim became the most widely read and most successful British writers of spy fiction, especially of invasion literature. Their prosaic style and formulaic stories, produced voluminously from 1900 to 1914, proved of low literary merit.

===During the First World War===
During the War, John Buchan became the pre-eminent British spy novelist. His well-written stories portray the Great War as a &quot;clash of civilisations&quot; between Western civilization and barbarism. His notable novels are &quot;The Thirty-nine Steps&quot; (1915), &quot;Greenmantle&quot; (1916) and sequels, all featuring the heroic Scotsman Richard Hannay. In France Gaston Leroux published the spy thriller &quot;Rouletabille chez Krupp&quot; (1917), in which a detective, Joseph Rouletabille, engages in espionage.

===Inter-war period===
After the Russian Revolution (1917), the quality of spy fiction declined, perhaps because the Bolshevik enemy won the Russian Civil War (1917–23). Thus, the inter-war spy story usually concerns combating the Red Menace, which was perceived as another &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;.

Spy fiction was dominated by British authors during this period, initially former intelligence officers and agents writing from inside the trade. Examples include &quot;&quot; (1928) by W. Somerset Maugham, which accurately portrays spying in the First World War, and &quot;The Mystery of Tunnel 51&quot; (1928) by Alexander Wilson whose novels convey an uncanny portrait of the first head of the Secret Intelligence Service, Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the original &#x27;C&#x27;.

In the book &quot;Literary Agents&quot; (1987), Anthony Masters wrote: &quot;Ashenden&#x27;s adventures come nearest to the real-life experiences of his creator&quot;&#x27;. John Le Carré described Ashenden stories as a major influence on his novels as praised Maugham as &quot;the first person to write anything about espionage in a mood of disenchantment and almost prosaic reality&quot;.

At a more popular level, Leslie Charteris&#x27; popular and long-running &quot;Saint&quot; series began, featuring Simon Templar, with &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot; (1928). &quot;Water on the Brain&quot; (1933) by former intelligence officer Compton Mackenzie was the first successful spy novel satire. Prolific author Dennis Wheatley also wrote his first spy novel, &quot;The Eunuch of Stamboul&quot; (1935) during this period.

In the sham state of Manchukuo, spies often featured in stories published in its government-sponsored magazines as villains threatening Manchukuo. Manchukuo had been presented since its founding in 1931 as an idealistic Pan-Asian experiment, where the officially designated &quot;five races&quot; of the Japanese, Han Chinese, Manchus, Koreans and Mongols had come together to build a utopian society. Manchukuo also had a substantial Russian minority who initially been considered as the &quot;sixth race&quot;, but had been excluded. The spy stories of Manchukuo such as &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot; by the writer Ding Na often linked the willingness to serve as spies with having a mixed Russian-Han heritage; the implication being that people of &quot;pure&quot; descent from one of the &quot;five races&quot; of Manchukuo would not betray it. In &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot;, the villain initially appears to Mali, the eponymous character who has a Russian father and a Han mother, but she ultimately is revealed to be blackmailed by the story&#x27;s true villain, the foreign spy Baoerdun, and she proves to be loyal to Manchukuo after all as she forces the gun out of Baoerdun&#x27;s hand at the story&#x27;s climax. However, Ding&#x27;s story also states that Baoerdun would not dare to have attempted his blackmail scheme against a Han woman and that he targeted Mali because she was racially mixed and hence &quot;weak&quot;.

When Japan invaded China in 1937 and even more so in 1941, the level of repression and propaganda in Manchukuo was increased as the state launched a &quot;total war&quot; campaign to mobilise society for the war. As part of the &quot;total war&quot; campaign, the state warned people to be vigilant at all times for spies; alongside this campaign went a mania for spy stories, which likewise warned people to be vigilant against spies. Novels and films with a counterespionage theme became ubiquitous in Manchukuo from 1937 onward. Despite the intensely patriarchal values of Manchukuo, the counter-spy campaign targeted women who were encouraged to report anyone suspicious to the police with one slogan saying, &quot;Women defend inside and men defend outside&quot;. The spy stories of Manchukuo such as &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot; often had female protagonists. In &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot;, it is two ordinary women who break up the spy ring instead of the Manchukuo police as might be expected. The South Korean scholar Bong InYoung noted stories such as &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot; were part of the state&#x27;s campaign to take over &quot;...the governance of private and family life, relying on the power of propaganda literature and the nationwide mobilization of the social discourse of counterespionage&quot;. At the same time, she noted &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot; with its intelligent female protagonists seemed to challenge the patriarchal values of Manchukuo which portrayed women as the weaker sex in need of male protection and guidance. However, Bong noted that the true heroine of &quot;A Mixed Race Woman&quot;, Shulan is presented as superior to Mali as she is Han and the story is one &quot;...of female disempowerment in that Mali is completely subordinate to the racial order Shulan sets&quot;.

===Second World War===
The growing support of fascism in Germany, Italy and Spain, and the imminence of war, attracted quality writers back to spy fiction.

British author Eric Ambler brought a new realism to spy fiction. &quot;The Dark Frontier&quot; (1936), &quot;Epitaph for a Spy&quot; (1938), &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; (US: &quot;A Coffin for Dimitrios&quot;, 1939), and &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1940) feature amateurs entangled in espionage. The politics and ideology are secondary to the personal story that involved the hero or heroine. Ambler&#x27;s Popular Front–period &quot;œuvre&quot; has a left-wing perspective about the personal consequences of &quot;big picture&quot; politics and ideology, which was notable, given spy fiction&#x27;s usual right-wing tilt in defence of establishment attitudes. Ambler&#x27;s early novels &quot;Uncommon Danger&quot; (1937) and &quot;Cause for Alarm&quot; (1938), in which NKVD spies help the amateur protagonist survive, are especially remarkable among English-language spy fiction.

&quot;Above Suspicion&quot; (1939) by Helen MacInnes, about an anti-Nazi husband and wife spy team, features literate writing and fast-paced, intricate, and suspenseful stories occurring against contemporary historical backgrounds. MacInnes wrote many other spy novels in the course of a long career, including &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; (1942), &quot;Decision at Delphi&quot; (1961), and &quot;Ride a Pale Horse&quot; (1984).

Manning Coles published &quot;Drink to Yesterday&quot; (1940), a grim story occurring during the Great War, which introduces the hero Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon. However, later novels featuring Hambledon were lighter-toned, despite being set either in Nazi Germany or Britain during the Second World War (1939–45). After the War, the Hambledon adventures fell to formula, losing critical and popular interest.

The events leading up to the Second World War, and the War itself, continue to be fertile ground for authors of spy fiction. Notable examples include Ken Follett, &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1978); Alan Furst, &quot;Night Soldiers&quot; (1988); and David Downing, the Station series, beginning with &quot;Zoo Station&quot; (2007).

=== Writers on World War II: 1939–1945 ===
===Cold War===
====Early====
The metamorphosis of the Second World War (1939–45) into the Soviet–American Cold War (1945–91) gave new impetus to spy novelists. &quot;Atomsk&quot; by Paul Linebarger (later known as Cordwainer Smith), written in 1948 and published in 1949, appears to be the first espionage novel of the dawning conflict.

The &quot;secret world&quot; of espionage allowed a situation when writers could project anything they wanted onto the &quot;secret world&quot;. The author Bruce Page complained in his 1969 book &quot;The Philby Conspiracy&quot;: &quot;The trouble is that a man can hold almost any theory he cares to about the secret world, and defend it against large quantities of hostile evidence by the simple expedient of retreating behind further and further screens of postulated inward mystery. Secret services have in common with Freemasons and &quot;mafiosi&quot; that they inhabit an intellectual twilight-a kind of ambiguous gloom in which it is hard to distinguish with certainty between the menacing and the merely ludicrous. In such circumstances the human affinity for myth and legend easily gets out of control&quot;. This inability to know for certain about what is going on in the &quot;secret world&quot; of intelligence-gathering affected both non-fiction and fiction books about espionage. The Cold War and the struggle between Soviet intelligence-known as the KGB from 1954 onward-vs. the CIA and MI6 made the subject of espionage a popular one for novelists to write about. Most of the spy novels of the Cold War were really action thrillers with little resemblance to the actual work of spies. The writer Malcolm Muggeridge who had worked as a spy in World War Two commented that thriller writers in the Cold War took to writing about espionage &quot;as easily as the mentally unstable become psychiatrists or the impotent pornographers&quot;. The city that was considered to be the &quot;capital of the Cold War&quot; was Berlin, owing to its post-war status as the city was divided between the two German states while Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States all had occupations zones in Berlin. As a result, Berlin was a beehive of espionage during the Cold War with the city full of American, British, East German, French, Soviet and West German spies; it was estimated that there was an average of about 8,000 spies in Berlin at any given moment during the Cold War. Because Berlin was a center of espionage, the city was frequently a setting for spy novels and films. Furthermore, the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 made the wall into a symbol of Communist tyranny, which further increased the attraction for Western writers of setting a Cold War spy novel in Berlin. Perhaps the most memorable story set in Berlin was &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; which in both the novel and the film ended with disillusioned British spy Alec Leamas and his lover, the naïve young woman Liz Gold being shot down while trying to cross the Berlin Wall from East Berlin into West Berlin.

=====British=====
With &quot;Secret Ministry&quot; (1951), Desmond Cory introduced Johnny Fedora, the secret agent with a licence to kill, the government-sanctioned assassin. Ian Fleming, a former member of naval intelligence, followed swiftly with the glamorous James Bond, secret agent 007 of the British Secret Service, a mixture of counter-intelligence officer, assassin and playboy. Perhaps the most famous fictional spy, Bond was introduced in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1953). After Fleming&#x27;s death the franchise continued under other British and American authors, including Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The Bond novels, which were extremely popular in the 1950s, inspired an even more popular series of films starting in 1962. The success of the Bond novels and films has greatly influenced popular images of the work of spies even though the character of Bond is more of an assassin than a spy.

Despite the commercial success of Fleming&#x27;s extravagant novels, John le Carré, himself a former spy, created anti-heroic protagonists who struggled with the ethical issues involved in espionage and sometimes resorted to immoral tactics. Le Carré depicted spies as living a morally grey world having to constantly make morally dubious decisions in an essentially amoral struggle where lies, paranoia and betrayal are the norm for both sides. In le Carré best known novel, &quot;The Spy Who Came In From The Cold&quot; (1963), the hero Alec Leamas views himself as serving in &quot;...a war fought on a tiny scale, at close range&quot; and complained that he has seen too many &quot;people cheated and misled, whole lives thrown away, people shot and in prison, whole groups and classes of men written off for nothing&quot;. Le Carré&#x27;s middle-class hero George Smiley is a middle-aged spy burdened with an unfaithful, upper-class wife who publicly cuckolds him for sport. The American scholars Norman Polmar and Thomas Allen described Smiley as the fictional spy most likely to be successful as a real spy, citing le Carré&#x27;s description of him in &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;: &quot;Obscurity was his nature, as well as his profession. The byways of espionage are not populated by the brash and colorful adventurers of fiction. A man who, like Smiley has lived and worked for years among his country&#x27;s enemies learns only one prayer: that he may never, never be noticed. Assimilation is his highest aim, he learns to love the crowds who pass him in the street without a glance; he clings to them for his anonymity and his safety. His fear makes him servile—he could embrace the shoppers who jostle him in their impatience and force him from the pavement. He could adore the officials, the police, the bus conductors, for the terse indifference of their attitudes.But this fear, this servility, this dependence had developed in Smiley a perception for the colour of human beings: a swift, feminine sensitivity to their characters and motives. He knew mankind as a huntsman knows his cover, as a fox the woods. For a spy must hunt while he is hunted, and the crowd is his estate. He could collect their gestures, record the interplay of glance and movement, as a huntsman can record the twisted bracken and broken twig, or as a fox detects the signs of danger&quot;.

Like Le Carré, former British Intelligence officer Graham Greene also examined the morality of espionage in left-wing, anti-imperialist novels such as &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; (1948), set in Sierra Leone, the seriocomic &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; (1959) occurring in Cuba under the regime of dictator Fulgencio Batista before his deposition in the Cuban Revolution (1953–59), and &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1978) about a MI6 agent&#x27;s attempts to uncover a mole in apartheid-era South Africa. Greene had worked as a MI6 agent in Freetown, an important British naval base during World War Two, searching for German spies who would radio information about the movements of ships to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, experiences which inspired &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;. Greene&#x27;s case officer during World War Two was Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby, who was later revealed in 1963 to be a long time Soviet spy, who had been recruited by Soviet intelligence in the early 1930s while he was an undergraduate at Cambridge. Greene&#x27;s best known spy novel &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1955), set in 1952 Vietnam featured a thinly disguised version of the real American intelligence officer, Major General Edward Lansdale as the villain. Greene had covered the Vietnam war in 1951-52 as a newspaper correspondent where he met Lansdale who appears in &quot;The Quiet American&quot; as Alden Pyle while the character of Thomas Fowler, a cynical, but goodhearted British journalist in Saigon was partly based on himself.

MI6 was outraged by &quot;Our Man In Havana&quot; with its story of James Wormold, a British vacuum cleaner salesman in Cuba, recruited to work for MI6 who bamboozles his employers by selling them diagrams of vacuum cleaners, which he persuades MI6 are really diagrams of Soviet missiles. MI6 pressed for Greene to be prosecuted for violating the Official Secrets Act, claiming that he revealed too much about MI6&#x27;s methods in &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;, but it decided against charging Greene out of the fear that prosecuting him would suggest the unflattening picture of MI6 in &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; was based on reality. Greene&#x27;s older brother, Herbert, a professional con-man had briefly worked as a spy for the Japanese in the 1930s before his employers realised that the &quot;secrets&quot; that he was selling them was merely information culled from the newspapers. The bumbling vacuum cleaner salesman Wormold in &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; seems to been inspired by Herbert Greene. In &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, Greene portrayed MI6 again in a highly unsympathetic light, depicting the British government as supporting the &quot;apartheid&quot; regime of South Africa because it was pro-Western while the book&#x27;s protagonist, the MI6 officer Maurice Castle, married to a black South African woman, provides information to the KGB to thwart MI6 operations. Much of the plot of &quot;The Human Factor&quot; concerned a secret plan by the British, American and West German governments to buy up South African gold in bulk in order to stabilise the economy of South Africa, which Greene presented as fundamentally amoral, arguing that the Western powers were betraying their values by supporting the white supremacist South African government. Much controversy ensued when shortly after the publication of &quot;The Human Factor&quot; it emerged that such a plan had in fact been carried out, which led to much speculation about whether this was a coincidence or whether Greene had more access to secret information than he let on. There was also much speculation that the character of Maurice Castle was inspired by Philby, but Greene consistently denied this. Other novelists followed a similar path. Len Deighton&#x27;s anonymous spy protagonist of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; (1962), &quot;Horse Under Water&quot; (1963), &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1964), and others, is a working-class man with a negative view of &quot;the Establishment&quot;.

Other notable examples of espionage fiction during this period were also built around recurring characters. These include James Mitchell&#x27;s &#x27;John Craig&#x27; series, written under his pseudonym &#x27;James Munro&#x27;, beginning with &quot;The Man Who Sold Death&quot; (1964); and Trevor Dudley-Smith&#x27;s Quiller spy novel series written under the pseudonym &#x27;Adam Hall&#x27;, beginning with &quot;The Berlin Memorandum&quot; (US: &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot;, 1965), a hybrid of glamour and dirt, Fleming and Le Carré; and William Garner&#x27;s fantastic Michael Jagger in &quot;Overkill&quot; (1966), &quot;The Deep, Deep Freeze&quot; (1968), &quot;The Us or Them War&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Big Enough Wreath&quot; (1974).

Other important British writers who first became active in spy fiction during this period include Padraig Manning O&#x27;Brine, &quot;Killers Must Eat&quot; (1951); Michael Gilbert, &quot;Be Shot for Sixpence&quot; (1956); Alistair MacLean, &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1959); Brian Cleeve, &quot;Assignment to Vengeance&quot; (1961); Jack Higgins, &quot;The Testament of Caspar Schulz&quot; (1962); and Desmond Skirrow, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Get You Anywhere&quot; (1966). Dennis Wheatley&#x27;s &#x27;Gregory Sallust&#x27; (1934-1968) and &#x27;Roger Brook&#x27; (1947-1974) series were also largely written during this period.

Notable recurring characters from this era include Adam Diment&#x27;s Philip McAlpine as a long-haired, hashish-smoking fop in the novels &quot;The Dolly Dolly Spy&quot; (1967), &quot;The Great Spy Race&quot; (1968), &quot;The Bang Bang Birds&quot; (1968) and &quot;Think, Inc.&quot; (1971); James Mitchell&#x27;s &#x27;David Callan&#x27; series, written in his own name, beginning with &quot;Red File for Callan&quot; (1969); William Garner&#x27;s John Morpurgo in &quot;Think Big, Think Dirty&quot; (1983), &quot;Rats&#x27; Alley&quot; (1984), and &quot;Zones of Silence&quot; (1986); and Joseph Hone&#x27;s &#x27;Peter Marlow&#x27; series, beginning with &quot;The Private Sector&quot; (1971), set during Israel&#x27;s Six-Day War (1967) against Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In all of these series the writing is literary and the tradecraft believable.

Noteworthy examples of the journalistic style and successful integration of fictional characters with historical events were the politico-military novels &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1971) by Frederick Forsyth and &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1978) by Ken Follett. With the explosion of technology, Craig Thomas, launched the techno-thriller with &quot;Firefox&quot; (1977), describing the Anglo–American theft of a superior Soviet jet aeroplane.

Other important British writers who first became active in spy fiction during this period include Ian Mackintosh, &quot;A Slaying in September&quot; (1967); Kenneth Benton, &quot;Twenty-fourth Level&quot; (1969); Desmond Bagley, &quot;Running Blind&quot; (1970); Anthony Price, &quot;The Labyrinth Makers&quot; (1971); Gerald Seymour, &quot;Harry&#x27;s Game&quot; (1975); Brian Freemantle, &quot;Charlie M&quot; (1977); Bryan Forbes, &quot;Familiar Strangers&quot; (1979); Reginald Hill, &quot;The Spy&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1980); and Raymond Harold Sawkins, writing as Colin Forbes, &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; (1982).

Philip Gooden provides an analysis of British spy fiction in four categories: professionals, amateurs, dandies and literary types.

=====American=====
During the war E. Howard Hunt wrote his first spy novel, &quot;East of Farewell&quot; (1943). In 1949 he joined the recently created CIA and continued to write spy fiction for many years. Paul Linebarger, a China specialist for the CIA, published &quot;Atomsk&quot;, the first novel of the Cold War, in 1949. During the 1950s, most of American spy stories were not about the CIA, instead being about agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who tracked down and arrested Soviet spies. The popular American image of the FBI was as &quot;coolly efficient super-cop&quot; who always successful in performing his duties. The FBI director, J.E. Hoover, had long cultivated the American press and Hollywood to promote a favorable image of the FBI. In 1955, Edward S. Aarons began publishing the Sam Durell CIA &quot;Assignment&quot; series, which began with &quot;Assignment to Disaster&quot; (1955). Donald Hamilton published &quot;Death of a Citizen&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1960), beginning the series featuring Matt Helm, a CIA assassin and counter-intelligence agent.

Major General Edward Lansdale, a charismatic intelligence officer who was widely credited with having masterminded the defeat of the Communist Huk rebellion in the Philippines inspired several fictional versions of himself. Besides for &quot;The Quiet American&quot;, he appeared as Colonel Edwin Barnum in &quot;The Ugly American&quot; (1958) by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick and as Colonel Lionel Teryman in the novel &quot;La Mal Jaune&quot; (1965) by the French writer Jean Lartéguy. &quot;The Ugly American&quot; was written as a rebuttal to &quot;The Quiet American&quot; under which the idealistic Colonel Barnum operating in the fictional Vietnam-like Southeast Asian nation of Sarkhan shows the way to defeat Communist guerillas by understanding local people in just the same way that Lansdale with his understanding and sympathy for ordinary Filipinos was credited with defeating the Communist Huk guerrillas. &quot;The Ugly American&quot; was greatly influenced by the modernization theory, which held Communism was something alike to a childhood disease as the modernization theory held that as Third World nations modernized that this created social-economic tensions which a ruthless minority of Communists exploited to seize power; what was required from the United States were experts who knew the local concerns in order to defeat the Communists until the modernization process was completed.

The Nick Carter-Killmaster series of spy novels, initiated by Michael Avallone and Valerie Moolman, but authored anonymously, ran to over 260 separate books between 1964 and the early 1990s and invariably pitted American, Soviet and Chinese spies against each other. With the proliferation of male protagonists in the spy fiction genre, writers and book packagers also started bringing out spy fiction with a female as the protagonist. One notable spy series is &quot;The Baroness&quot;, featuring a sexy female superspy, with the novels being more action-oriented, in the mould of Nick Carter-Killmaster.

Other important American authors who became active in spy fiction during this period include Ross Thomas, &quot;The Cold War Swap&quot; (1966). &quot;The Scarlatti Inheritance&quot; (1971) by Robert Ludlum is usually considered the first American modern (glamour and dirt) spy thriller weighing action and reflection. Richard Helms, the director-general of the CIA from 1966 to 1973 loathed le Carré&#x27;s morally grey spy novels, which he felt damaged the image of the CIA, and encouraged Hunt to write spy novels as a rebuttal. Helms had hopes that Hunt might write an &quot;American James Bond&quot; novel, which would be adopted by Hollywood and do for the image of the CIA what Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels did for the image of MI6. In the 1970s, former CIA man Charles McCarry began the Paul Christopher series with &quot;The Miernik Dossier&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Tears of Autumn&quot; (1978), which were well written, with believable tradecraft. McCarry was a former CIA agent who worked as an editor for &quot;National Geographic&quot; and his hero Christopher likewise is an American spy who works for a thinly disguised version of the CIA while posing as a journalist. Writing under the pen name Trevanian, Roger Whitaker published a series of brutal spy novels starting with &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; (1972) featuring an amoral art collector/CIA assassin who ostensibly kills for the United States, but in fact kills for money. Whitaker followed up &quot;The Eiger Sanction&quot; with &quot;The Loo Sanction&quot; (1973) and &quot;Shibumi&quot; (1979). Starting in 1976 with his novel &quot;Saving the Queen&quot;, the conservative American journalist and former CIA agent William F. Buckley published the first of his Blackford Oakes novels featuring a CIA agent whose politics were the same as the author&#x27;s. Blackford Oakes was portrayed as a &quot;sort of an American James Bond&quot; who ruthlessly dispatches villainous KGB agents with much aplomb.

The first American techno-thriller was &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1984) by Tom Clancy. It introduced CIA deskman (analyst) Jack Ryan as a field agent; he reprised the role in the sequel &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1987).

Other important American authors who became active in spy fiction during this period include Robert Littell, &quot;The Defection of A. J. Lewinter&quot; (1973); James Grady, &quot;Six Days of the Condor&quot; (1974); William F. Buckley Jr., &quot;Saving the Queen&quot; (1976); Nelson DeMille, &quot;The Talbot Odyssey&quot; (1984); W. E. B. Griffin, the &quot;Men at War&quot; series (1984–); Stephen Coonts, &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; (1986); Canadian-American author David Morrell, &quot;The League of Night and Fog&quot; (1987); David Hagberg, &quot;Without Honor&quot; (1989); Noel Hynd, &quot;False Flags&quot; (1990); and Richard Ferguson, &quot;Oiorpata&quot; (1990).

====Soviet====
The culture of Imperial Russia was deeply influenced by the culture of France, and traditionally spy novels in France had a very low status. One consequence of the French influence on Russian culture was that the subject of espionage was usually ignored by Russian writers during the Imperial period. Traditionally, the subject of espionage was treated in the Soviet Union as a story of villainous foreign spies threatening the USSR. The organisation established to hunt down German spies in 1943, SMERSH, was an acronym for the wartime slogan &quot;Smert shpionam!&quot; (&quot;Death to Spies!&quot;), which reflected the picture promoted by the Soviet state of spies as a class of people who deserved to be killed without mercy. The unfavorable picture of spies ensured that before the early 1960s there were no novels featuring Soviet spies as the heroes as espionage was portrayed as a disreputable activity that only the enemies of the Soviet Union engaged in. Unlike in Britain and the United States, where the achievements of Anglo-American intelligence during the Second World War were to a certain extent publicized soon after the war such as the fact that the Americans had broken the Japanese naval codes (which came out in 1946) and the British deception operation of 1943, Operation Mincemeat (which was revealed in 1953), there was nothing equivalent in the Soviet Union until the early 1960s. Soviet novels prior to the 1960s to the extent that espionage was portrayed at all concerned heroic scouts in the Red Army who during the Great Patriotic War as the war with Germany is known in the Soviet Union who go on dangerous missions deep behind the Wehrmacht&#x27;s lines to find crucial information. The scout stories were more action-adventure stories than espionage stories proper and significantly always portrayed Red Army scouts rather than &quot;Chekisty&quot; (&quot;Chekists&quot;) as secret policemen are always called in Russia as their heroes. The protagonists of the scout stories always almost ended being killed at the climax of the stories, giving up their lives up to save the Motherland from the German invaders.

In November 1961, Vladimir Semichastny became the chairman of the KGB and sent out to improve the image of the &quot;Chekisty&quot;. The acronym KGB (&quot;Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti&quot;-Committee of State Security) was adopted in 1954, but the organisation had been founded in 1917 as the Cheka. The frequent name changes for the secret police made no impression with the Russian people who still call any secret policeman a &quot;Chekisty&quot;. Semichastny felt that the legacy of the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; (&quot;Yezhovz times&quot;) of 1936-1939 had given the KGB a fearsome reputation that he wanted to erase as wanted ordinary people to have a more favorable and positive image of the &quot;Chekisty&quot; as the protectors and defenders of the Soviet Union instead of torturers and killers. As such, Semichastny encouraged the publication of a series of spy novels that featured heroic &quot;Chekisty&quot; defending the Soviet Union. It was also during Semichastny&#x27;s time as KGB chairman that the cult of the &quot;hero spies&quot; began in the Soviet Union as publications lionised the achievements of Soviet spies such as Colonel Rudolf Abel, Harold &quot;Kim&quot; Philby, Richard Sorge and of the men and women who served in the &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; spy network. Seeing the great popularity of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels in Britain and the United States, Soviet spy novels of the 1960s used the Bond novels as inspiration for both their plots and heroes, through Soviet prurience about sex ensured that the &quot;Chekisty&quot; heroes did not engage in the sort of womanising that Bond did. The first Bond-style novel was &quot;The Zakhov Mission&quot; (1963) by the Bulgarian writer Andrei Gulyashki who had commissioned by Semichastny and was published simultaneously in Russian and Bulgarian. The success of &quot;The Zakhov Mission&quot; led to a follow-up novel, &quot;Zakhov vs. 007&quot;, where Gulyashki freely violated English copyright laws by using the James Bond character without the permission of the Fleming estate (he had asked for permission in 1966 and was denied). In &quot;Zakhov vs. 007&quot;, the hero Avakoum Zakhov defeats James Bond, who is portrayed in an inverted fashion to how Fleming portrayed him; in &quot;Zakhov vs. 007&quot;, Bond is portrayed as a sadistic killer, a brutal rapist and an arrogant misogynist, which stands in marked contrast to the kindly and gentle Zakhov who always treats women with respect. Zakhov is described as a spy, he more of a detective and unlike Bond, his tastes are modest.

In 1966, the Soviet writer Yulian Semyonov published a novel set in the Russian Civil War featuring a Cheka agent Maxim Maximovich Isaуev as its hero. Inspired by its success, the KGB encouraged Semyonov to write a sequel, &quot;Semnadtsat&#x27; mgnoveniy vesny&quot; (&quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;), which proved to one of the most popular Soviet spy novels when it was serialized in &quot;Pravda&quot; in January–February 1969 and then published as a book later in 1969. In &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;, the story is set in the Great Patriotic War as Isayev goes undercover, using the alias of a Baltic German nobleman Max Otto von Stierlitz to infiltrate the German high command. The plot of &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; takes place in Berlin between January–May 1945 during the last days of the Third Reich as the Red Army advances onto Berlin and the Nazis grew more desperate. In 1973, &quot;Semnadtsat&#x27; mgnoveniy vesny&quot; was turned into a television mini-series, which was extremely popular in the Soviet Union and turned the Isayev character into a cultural phenomena. The Isayev character plays a role in Russian culture, even today, that is analogous to the role James Bond plays in modern British culture. As aspect of &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot;, both as a novel and the TV mini-series that has offended Westerners who are more accustomed to seeing spy stories via the prism of the fast-paced Bond stories is the way that Isayev spends much time interacting with ordinary Germans despite the fact these interactions do nothing to advance the plot and are merely superfluous to the story. However, the point of these scenes are to show that Isayev is still a moral human being, who remains sociable and kind to all people, including the citizens of the state that his country is at war with. Unlike Bond, Isayev is devoted to his wife who he deeply loves and despite spending at least ten years as a spy in Germany and having countless chances to sleep with attractive German women remains faithful towards her. Through Isayev is a spy for the NKVD as the Soviet secret police was known from 1934 to 1946, it is stated quite explicitly in &quot;Semnadtsat&#x27; mgnoveniy vesny&quot; (which is set in 1945) that he left the Soviet Union to go undercover in Nazi Germany &quot;more than ten years ago&quot;, which means that Isayev was not involved in the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;.

====Later====
The June 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and its neighbours introduced new themes to espionage fiction - the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, against the backdrop of continuing Cold War tensions, and the increasing use of terrorism as a political tool.

===Post–Cold War===
The end of the Cold War in 1991 mooted the USSR, Russia and other Iron Curtain countries as credible enemies of democracy, and the US Congress even considered disestablishing the CIA. Espionage novelists found themselves at a temporary loss for obvious nemeses. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ceased publishing a spy novel review column. Nevertheless, counting on the aficionado, publishers continued to issue spy novels by writers popular during the Cold War era, among them &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1991) by Norman Mailer.

In the US, the new novels &quot;Moscow Club&quot; (1991) by Joseph Finder, &quot;Coyote Bird&quot; (1993) by Jim DeFelice, &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1996) by Gayle Lynds, and &quot;The Unlikely Spy&quot; (1996) by Daniel Silva maintained the spy novel in the post–Cold War world. Other important American authors who first became active in spy fiction during this period include David Ignatius, &quot;Agents of Innocence&quot; (1997); David Baldacci, &quot;Saving Faith&quot; (1999); and Vince Flynn, with &quot;Term Limits&quot; (1999) and a series of novels featuring counter-terrorism expert Mitch Rapp.

In 1993, the American novelist Philip Roth published &quot;Operation Shylock&quot;, an account of his supposed work as a Mossad spy in Greece. The book was published as a novel, but Roth insisted that the book was not a novel as he argued that the book was presented only as a novel in order to give it deniability. At the end of the book, the character of Philip Roth is ordered to publish the account as a novel, and it ends with Roth the character saying: &quot;And I became quite convinced that it was my interest to do that...I&#x27;m just a good Mossadnik&quot;.

In the UK, Robert Harris entered the spy genre with &quot;Enigma&quot; (1995). Other important British authors who became active during this period include Hugh Laurie, &quot;The Gun Seller&quot; (1996); Andy McNab, &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1998); Henry Porter, &quot;Remembrance Day&quot; (2000); and Charles Cumming, &quot;A Spy By Nature&quot; (2001).

===Post–9/11===
The terrorist attacks against the US on 11 September 2001, and the subsequent War on Terror, reawakened interest in the peoples and politics of the world beyond its borders. Espionage genre elders such as John le Carré, Frederick Forsyth, Robert Littell, and Charles McCarry resumed work, and many new authors emerged.

Important British writers who wrote their first spy novels during this period include Stephen Leather, &quot;Hard Landing&quot; (2004); and William Boyd, &quot;Restless&quot; (2006).

New American writers include Brad Thor, &quot;The Lions of Lucerne&quot; (2002); Ted Bell, &quot;Hawke&quot; (2003); Alex Berenson, with John Wells appearing for the first time in &quot;The Faithful Spy&quot; (2006); Brett Battles, &quot;The Cleaner&quot; (2007); Ellis Goodman, &quot;Bear Any Burden&quot; (2008); Olen Steinhauer, &quot;The Tourist&quot; (2009); and Richard Ferguson, &quot;Oiorpata&quot; (2012). A number of other established writers began to write spy fiction for the first time, including Kyle Mills, &quot;Fade&quot; (2005) and James Patterson, &quot;Private&quot; (2010).

Swede Stieg Larsson, who died in 2004, was the world&#x27;s second best-selling author for 2008 due to his &quot;Millennium series&quot;, featuring Lisbeth Salander, published posthumously between 2005 and 2007. Other authors of note include Australian James Phelan, beginning with &quot;Fox Hunt&quot; (2010).

Recognising the importance of the thriller genre, including spy fiction, International Thriller Writers (ITW) was established in 2004, and held its first conference in 2006.

==Insider spy fiction==
Many authors of spy fiction have themselves been intelligence officers working for British agencies such as MI5 or MI6, or American agencies such as the OSS or its successor, the CIA. &#x27;Insider&#x27; spy fiction has a special claim to authenticity and overlaps with biographical and other documentary accounts of secret service.

The first insider fiction emerged after World War 1 as the thinly disguised reminiscences of former British intelligence officers such as W. Somerset Maugham, Alexander Wilson, and Compton Mackenzie. The tradition continued during World War II with Helen MacInnes and Manning Coles.

Notable British examples from the Cold War period and beyond include Ian Fleming, John le Carré, Graham Greene, Brian Cleeve, Ian Mackintosh, Kenneth Benton, Bryan Forbes, Andy McNab and Chris Ryan. Notable American examples include Charles McCarry, William F. Buckley Jr., W. E. B. Griffin and David Hagberg.

Many post-9/11 period novels are written by insiders. At the CIA, the number of manuscripts submitted for pre-publication vetting doubled between 1998 and 2005. American examples include Barry Eisler, &quot;A Clean Kill in Tokyo&quot; (2002); Charles Gillen, &quot;Saigon Station&quot; (2003); R J Hillhouse, &quot;Rift Zone&quot; (2004); Gene Coyle, &quot;The Dream Merchant of Lisbon&quot; (2004) and &quot;No Game For Amateurs&quot; (2009); Thomas F. Murphy, &quot;Edge of Allegiance&quot; (2005); Mike Ramsdell, &quot;A Train to Potevka&quot; (2005); T. H. E. Hill, &quot;Voices Under Berlin&quot; (2008); Duane Evans, &quot;North from Calcutta&quot; (2009); Jason Matthews, &quot;Red Sparrow&quot; (2013).; and T.L. Williams, &quot;Zero Day: China&#x27;s Cyber Wars&quot; (2017).

British examples include &quot;The Code Snatch&quot; (2001) by Alan Stripp, formerly a cryptographer at Bletchley Park; &quot;At Risk&quot; (2004), &quot;Secret Asset&quot; (2006), &quot;Illegal Action&quot; (2007), and &quot;Dead Line&quot; (2008), by Dame Stella Rimington (Director General of MI5 from 1992 to 1996); and Matthew Dunn&#x27;s &quot;Spycatcher&quot; (2011) and sequels.

==Spy television and cinema==

===Cinema===

Much spy fiction was adapted as spy films in the 1960s, ranging from the fantastical James Bond series to the realistic &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1965), and the hybrid &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966). While Hamilton&#x27;s Matt Helm novels were adult and well written, their cinematic interpretations were adolescent parody. This phenomenon spread widely in Europe in the 1960s and is known as the Eurospy genre.

English-language spy films of the 2000s include &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (1996); &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), &quot;Syriana&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; (2005).

Among the comedy films focusing on espionage are 1974&#x27;s &quot;S*P*Y*S&quot;, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, and the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series starring Mike Myers.

===Television===

The American adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1954) featured Jimmy Bond in an episode of the &quot;Climax!&quot; anthology series. The narrative tone of television espionage ranged from the drama of &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1960–68) to the sardonicism of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; (1964–68) and the flippancy of &quot;I Spy&quot; (1965–68) until the exaggeration, akin to that of William Le Queux and E. Phillips Oppenheim before the First World War (1914–18), degenerated to the parody of &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1965–70).

In 1973, Semyonov&#x27;s novel &quot;Seventeen Moments of Spring&quot; (1968) was adapted to television as a twelve-part mini-series about the Soviet spy Maksim Isaev operating in wartime Nazi Germany as Max Otto von Stierlitz, charged with preventing a separate peace between Nazi Germany and America which would exclude the USSR. The programme &quot;TASS Is Authorized to Declare...&quot; also derives from his work.

However, the circle closed in the late 1970s when &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot; (1978–80) presented the grit and bureaucracy of espionage.

In the 1980s, US television featured the light espionage programmes &quot;Airwolf&quot; (1984–87) and &quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985–92), each rooted in the Cold War yet reflecting American citizens&#x27; distrust of their government, after the crimes of the Nixon Government (the internal, political espionage of the Watergate Scandal and the Vietnam War) were exposed. The spy heroes were independent of government; MacGyver, in later episodes and post-DXS employment, works for a non-profit, private think tank, and aviator Hawke and two friends work free-lance adventures. Although each series features an intelligence agency, the DXS in &quot;MacGyver&quot;, and the FIRM, in &quot;Airwolf&quot;, its agents could alternately serve as adversaries as well as allies for the heroes.

Television espionage programmes of the late 1990s to the early 2010s include &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1997–2001), &quot;Alias&quot; (2001–2006), &quot;24&quot; (2001–2010, 2014), &quot;Spooks&quot; in the UK (release as &quot;MI-5&quot; in the US and Canada) (2002-2011), CBBC&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Show&quot; (2006-2011), NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot; (2007-2012), FX&#x27;s &quot;Archer&quot; (2009–2023), &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Covert Affairs&quot;, &quot;Homeland&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2013-2020).

In 2015, &quot;Deutschland 83&quot; is a German television series starring a 24-year-old native of East Germany who is sent to the West as an undercover spy for the HVA, the foreign intelligence agency of the Stasi.

==For children and adolescents==

===Books and novels===
In every medium, spy thrillers introduce children and adolescents to deception and espionage at earlier ages. The genre ranges from action-adventure, such as Chris Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Alpha Force&quot; series, through the historical espionage dramas of Y. S. Lee, to the girl orientation of Ally Carter&#x27;s &quot;Gallagher Girls&quot; series, beginning with &quot;I&#x27;d Tell You I Love You, But Then I&#x27;d Have to Kill You&quot;.

Leading examples include the &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; film, the Alex Rider adventure novels by Anthony Horowitz, and the CHERUB series, by Robert Muchamore. Ben Allsop, one of England&#x27;s youngest novelists, also writes spy fiction. His titles include &quot;Sharp&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Kill&quot;.

Other authors writing for adolescents include A. J. Butcher, Joe Craig, Charlie Higson, Andy McNab and Francine Pascal.

===Films and shows===
Spy-related films that are aimed towards younger audiences include movies such as the Spy Kids series of films and &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot;. Shows and series in this category also include a subplot of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; following Perry the Platypus in his attempt to sabotage Doofenshmirtz&#x27;s plans to take over the geographically ambiguous Tri-state area. However, the Cartoon Network show &quot;&quot; is solely focused on the eponymous Kids Next Door organization, consisting of child spies and child soldiers fighting and spying on adult and teenage villains, who are personifications of the things children dislike while growing up (e.g. bullying, grounding, homework, going to the dentist, going to school, being force-fed vegetables, getting banned from drinking soda, helicopter parenting, piano lessons, and spanking), and whilst not being traditional government sponsored intelligence, the Kids Next Door market themselves as so. Another example of a kids&#x27; show in the spy genre is Disney&#x27;s &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, which centers on the eponymous protagonist as she fights megalomaniac villains in a similar manner to James Bond, while foiling the evil plans of the main antagonist of the show, Dr. Drakken.

==Video games, tabletop roleplaying games and theme parks==
In contemporary digital video games, the player can be a vicarious spy, as in &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and the &quot;Metal Gear series&quot;, especially in the series&#x27; third installment, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, unlike the games of the third-person shooter genre, &quot;Syphon Filter&quot;, and &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;. The games feature complex stories and cinematic images. Games such as &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; and the sequel &quot;No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.&#x27;s Way&quot; humorously combine espionage and 1960s design. &quot;Evil Genius&quot;, a real-time strategy game and contemporary of the &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; series, allows the player to take on the role of the villain in a setting heavily influenced by spy thriller fiction like the &quot;James Bond&quot; series.

The &quot;Deus Ex&quot; series, particularly &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot; and &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot;, are also examples of spy fiction. Protagonist Adam Jensen must frequently use spycraft and stealth to obtain sensitive information for a variety of clients and associates.

&quot;Top Secret&quot;, TSR, Inc., (1980) is a contemporary espionage-themed tabletop role-playing game

&quot;James Bond 007&quot;: Role-Playing In Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service, Victory Games (1983), is a tabletop roleplaying game based on Flemming&#x27;s 007 novels.

Activision published &quot;&quot; (1996), notable for the collaboration with former CIA director William Colby and former KGB Major-General Oleg Kalugin, who also appear in the game as themselves.

Namco Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series of light gun shooters centers on the exploits of a fictional multinational intelligence agency called the VSSE (Vital Situation, Swift Elimination), whose agents, armed with a license to kill, must stop terrorists and megalomaniac villains in a similar manner to &quot;&quot; and the &quot;James Bond&quot; movies.

The &quot;Spyland&quot; espionage theme park, in the Gran Scala pleasure dome, in Zaragoza province, Spain, opened in 2012.

<doc id="27647" wikidata="Q7601219" url="?curid=27647" title="Star height problem">
<text>The star height problem in formal language theory is the question whether all regular languages can be expressed using regular expressions of limited star height, i.e. with a limited nesting depth of Kleene stars. Specifically, is a nesting depth of one always sufficient? If not, is there an algorithm to determine how many are required? The problem was first introduced by Eggan in 1963.

==Families of regular languages with unbounded star height==
The first question was answered in the negative when in 1963, Eggan gave examples of regular languages of star height &quot;n&quot; for every &quot;n&quot;. Here, the star height &quot;h&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) of a regular language &quot;L&quot; is defined as the minimum star height among all regular expressions representing &quot;L&quot;. The first few languages found by Eggan are described in the following, by means of giving a regular expression for each language:

:formula_1

The construction principle for these expressions is that expression formula_2 is obtained by concatenating two copies of formula_3, appropriately renaming the letters of the second copy using fresh alphabet symbols, concatenating the result with another fresh alphabet symbol, and then by surrounding the resulting expression with a Kleene star. The remaining, more difficult part, is to prove that for formula_3 there is no equivalent regular expression of star height less than &quot;n&quot;; a proof is given in .

However, Eggan&#x27;s examples use a large alphabet, of size 2&quot;n&quot;-1 for the language with star height &quot;n&quot;. He thus asked whether we can also find examples over binary alphabets. This was proved to be true shortly afterwards by Dejean and Schützenberger in 1966.
Their examples can be described by an inductively defined family of regular expressions over the binary alphabet formula_5 as follows–cf. :
:formula_6

Again, a rigorous proof is needed for the fact that formula_3 does not admit an equivalent regular expression of lower star height. Proofs are given by and by .

==Computing the star height of regular languages==
In contrast, the second question turned out to be much more difficult, and the question became a famous open problem in formal language theory for over two decades. For years, there was only little progress. The pure-group languages were the first interesting family of regular languages for which the star height problem was proved to be decidable. But the general problem remained open for more than 25 years until it was settled by Hashiguchi, who in 1988 published an algorithm to determine the star height of any regular language. The algorithm wasn&#x27;t at all practical, being of non-elementary complexity. To illustrate the immense resource consumptions of that algorithm, give some actual numbers:

\right)^{\left(10^{10^{10}}\right)^{\left(10^{10^{10}}\right)}}.&lt;/math&gt;|author=S. Lombardy and J. Sakarovitch|title=&quot;Star Height of Reversible Languages and Universal Automata&quot;|source=LATIN 2002}}

Notice that alone the number formula_8 has 10 billion zeros when written down in decimal notation, and is already &quot;by far&quot; larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.

A much more efficient algorithm than Hashiguchi&#x27;s procedure was devised by Kirsten in 2005. This algorithm runs, for a given nondeterministic finite automaton as input, within double-exponential space. Yet the resource requirements of this algorithm still greatly exceed the margins of what is considered practically feasible.

This algorithm has been optimized and generalized to trees by Colcombet and Löding in 2008, as part of the theory of regular cost functions.
It has been implemented in 2017 in the tool suite Stamina.

<text>Sir William Crookes (; 17 June 1832 – 4 April 1919) was an English chemist and physicist who attended the Royal College of Chemistry, now part of Imperial College London, and worked on spectroscopy. He was a pioneer of vacuum tubes, inventing the Crookes tube, which was made in 1875. This was a foundational discovery that eventually changed the whole of chemistry and physics.

He is credited with discovering the element thallium, announced in 1861, with the help of spectroscopy. He was also the first to describe the spectrum of terrestrial helium, in 1865. 
Crookes was the inventor of the Crookes radiometer but did not discern the true explanation of the phenomenon he detected. Crookes also invented a 100% ultraviolet blocking sunglass lens. 
For a time, he was interested in spiritualism and became president of the Society for Psychical Research.

==Biography==
Crookes&#x27;s life was one of unbroken scientific activity that extended over sixty-seven years. He was considered remarkable for his industriousness and for his intellectual qualities. 
His experiments in chemistry and physics were known for the originality of their design, and he is considered a &quot;superb experimentalist&quot;. His interests, ranging over pure and applied science, economic and practical problems, and psychic research, made him a well-known personality and earned him a substantial income. He received many public and academic honours.

===Early years===
William Crookes was born in London in 1832, the eldest of eight surviving children (eight others died young) of Joseph Crookes (1792–1889), a wealthy tailor and real estate investor of north-country origin, and his second wife, Mary (née Scott; 1806–1884). Joseph Crookes&#x27;s father, William (1734–1814), was also a tailor, whose grandfather, John Crookes (b. 1660), had been Mayor of Hartlepool, County Durham on three occasions.

Joseph Crookes had had five children with his first wife; two sons from that marriage, Joseph and Alfred, took over the tailoring business, leaving William free to choose his own path. In 1848, at age 16, Crookes entered the Royal College of Chemistry (now the Imperial College chemistry department) to study organic chemistry. Crookes lived with his parents about three miles from the College in Oxford Street. His father&#x27;s shop was about half a mile away. Crookes paid £25 for his first year&#x27;s tuition and had to provide his own apparatus and some of the more expensive chemicals. At the end of his first year, Crookes won the Ashburton scholarship which covered his second year&#x27;s tuition. At the end of his second year, Crookes became a junior assistant to August Wilhelm von Hofmann, doing laboratory demonstrations and helping with research and commercial analysis. In October 1851, Crookes was promoted to senior assistant, a position he held until 1854.

Although Crookes revered Hofmann, he did not share his primary interest in organic chemistry. 
One of Crookes&#x27;s students was the Reverend John Barlow, Secretary of the Royal Institution, who chose to take a course in analytical chemistry. Through Barlow, Crookes met scientists such as George Gabriel Stokes and Michael Faraday.
Such friends reinforced Crookes&#x27;s interest in optical physics which was respected by Hofmann.
By 1851, Crookes&#x27;s interest in photography and optics caused his father to build him a laboratory in the garden at home for his research.

When Crookes embarked upon original work, it wasn&#x27;t in organic chemistry, but rather into new compounds of selenium. These were the subject of his first published papers, in 1851. He worked with Manuel Johnson at the Radcliffe Observatory in Oxford in 1854, where he adapted the recent innovation of wax paper photography to machines built by Francis Ronalds to continuously record meteorological parameters. In 1855 he was appointed lecturer in chemistry at the Chester Diocesan Training College.

In April 1856 Crookes married Ellen, daughter of William Humphrey of Darlington. Since staff at Chester were required to be bachelors, he had to resign his position. William&#x27;s father, Joseph Crookes, gave the couple a house at 15 Stanley Street, Brompton. Ellen&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Humphrey, lived with them for the rest of her life, nearly forty years. A devoted couple, William and Ellen Crookes had six sons and three daughters. Their first child, Alice Mary (born 1857, later Mrs. Cowland) remained unmarried for forty years, living with her parents and working as an assistant to her father. Two of Crookes&#x27;s sons became engineers, and two lawyers.

Married and living in London, Crookes sought to support his new family through independent work as a photographic chemist. In 1859, he founded the &quot;Chemical News&quot;, a science magazine which he edited for many years and conducted on much less formal lines than was usual for the journals of scientific societies. Between 1864 and 1869, he was also involved with the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Science&quot;. At various times he edited the &quot;Journal of the Photographic Society&quot; and the &quot;Photographic News&quot;.

===Middle years===

Crookes was effective in experimentation. The method of spectral analysis, introduced by Bunsen and Kirchhoff, was received by Crookes with great enthusiasm and to great effect.

His first important discovery was that of the element thallium, made with the help of flame spectroscopy. Crookes discovered a previously unknown element with a bright green emission line in its spectrum. He named the element thallium, from Greek , , meaning &quot;a green shoot or twig&quot;. Crookes&#x27;s findings were published on 30 March 1861.

Thallium was also independently discovered by Frenchman Claude Auguste Lamy, who had the advantage of access to large amounts of materials via his brother-in-law, Charles Frédéric Kuhlmann. Both Crookes and Lamy isolated the element in 1862.

Crookes was elected a fellow of the &quot;Royal Society&quot; in 1863. Crookes wrote a standard treatise on &quot;Select Methods in Chemical Analysis&quot; in 1871.

In 1866, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld identified a rare mineral from Skrikerum as a selenide of copper, thallium, and silver (), and named the mineral crookesite in honor of Sir William Crookes.

Crookes developed the Crookes tube, investigating cathode rays. He published numerous papers on spectroscopy and conducted research on a variety of minor subjects. In his investigations of the conduction of electricity in low pressure gases, he discovered that as the pressure was lowered, the negative electrode (cathode) appeared to emit rays (the so-called &quot;cathode rays&quot;, now known to be a stream of free electrons, and used in cathode-ray display devices). As these examples indicate, he was a pioneer in the construction and use of vacuum tubes for the study of physical phenomena. He was, as a consequence, one of the first scientists to investigate what is now called a plasma and identified it as the fourth state of matter in 1879. He also devised one of the first instruments for studying nuclear radioactivity, the spinthariscope.

Crookes investigated the properties of cathode rays, showing that they travel in straight lines, cause fluorescence when they fall on some substances, and that their impact can produce great heat. He believed that he had discovered a fourth state of matter, which he called &quot;radiant matter&quot;, but his theoretical views on the nature of &quot;radiant matter&quot; were to be superseded. He believed the rays to consist of streams of particles of ordinary molecular magnitude. It remained for Sir J. J. Thomson to expound on the subatomic nature of cathode rays (consisting of streams of negative electrons). Nevertheless, Crookes&#x27;s experimental work in this field was the foundation of discoveries which eventually changed the whole of chemistry and physics.

Crookes&#x27;s attention had been attracted to the vacuum balance in the course of his research into thallium. He soon discovered the phenomenon which drives the movement in a Crookes radiometer, in which a set of vanes, each blackened on one side and polished on the other, rotate when exposed to radiant energy. Crookes did not, however, provide the true explanation of this apparent &quot;attraction and repulsion resulting from radiation&quot;.
After 1880, Crookes lived at 7 Kensington Park Gardens in the fashionable area of Notting Hill. His household included a large multigenerational family and a number of servants. There all his later work was done, in what was then &quot;the finest private laboratory in Britain&quot;. It comprised an entire floor of the house and included three interconnected laboratory rooms, for chemistry, physics, and mechanical construction, and a library. Crookes was able to purchase the house and build the laboratory because of his income from the National Guano Company and from various patents.

By 1880 Crookes employed a paid full-time scientific assistant (first Charles Gimingham and after 1883 James Gardiner). He was also helped by his daughter Alice, who was &quot;adept at fractionating rare earth elements&quot; and &quot;no mean interpreter of spectra&quot;.

His daily routine was to manage his commercial affairs in the morning, do further business or go to scientific meetings in the afternoon, eat dinner at 7, work in his library from 8 to 9, and then in the laboratory until after midnight. From his home, Crookes could easily reach the &quot;Chemical News&quot; offices, the Royal Society, the Chemica Society, and the Athenaeum Club.

On 16 January 1884, Crookes&#x27;s father died. Crookes&#x27;s daughter Florence died of scarlet fever in the same week. Joseph Crookes&#x27;s estate was left in trust, divided between his three surviving sons, Alfred, William and Frank. Combined with his previous income, this ensured that Crookes was very well off.

In 1886, Crookes was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

===Later years===

On 13 August 1894, John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh and William Ramsay announced the detection of a new gas in the atmosphere. On 31 January 1895 they made a full report to the Royal Society on the new gas, argon. In addition, William Crookes, who had been asked to examine a sample, presented on the spectra of argon, reported that argon displayed two distinct spectra. In this way, Crookes identified the first known sample of terrestrial helium and established its correspondence to observations of solar helium. The discovery of argon and of helium led to identification of the noble gases and the reorganization of the periodic system. 
Crookes himself suggested a design for a Periodic table in the style of a space lemniscate in 1898.
Crookes was knighted in 1897.

Crookes was named president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1898. In his inaugural address, he outlined in detail a coming catastrophe: The wheat-eating peoples of the world were going to start running out of food in the 1930s. The reason, he said, was a dearth of nitrogen fertilizer available from natural sources. Crookes called on chemists to develop new ways of making fertilizer from the enormous stock of nitrogen in the atmosphere (which is roughly 80 percent nitrogen). His remarks on the coming famine achieved wide distribution in the press and were turned into a popular book. Scientists addressing the problem in the first years of the twentieth century included Kristian Birkeland, whose technology helped found Norsk Hydro, and Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch, whose Haber–Bosch process forms the foundation of today&#x27;s nitrogen fertilizer industry.

In 1903, Crookes turned his attention to the newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity, achieving the separation from uranium of its active transformation product, &quot;uranium-X&quot; (later established to be protactinium). Crookes observed the gradual decay of the separated transformation product, and the simultaneous reproduction of a fresh supply in the original uranium. At about the same time as this important discovery, he observed that when &quot;p-particles&quot;, ejected from radio-active substances, impinge upon zinc sulfide, each impact is accompanied by a minute scintillation, an observation which forms the basis of one of the most useful methods in the detection of radioactivity.

In 1913, Crookes created an ultraviolet blocking lens made from glass containing cerium, but only lightly tinted. They were an unintended by-product of Crookes&#x27;s research to find a lens glass formulation that would protect glass workers from cataracts. Crookes tested more than 300 formulations, each numbered and labelled. Crookes Glass 246 was the tint recommended for glassworkers. The best-known Crookes tints are &quot;A&quot; (withdrawn due to its uranium), &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;B2&quot;, which absorb all ultraviolet below 350 nm while darkening visual light. Crookes&#x27;s samples were made by Whitefriars, London, stained glass makers, and Chance Brothers, Birmingham.

==Spiritualism==

Crookes became interested in spiritualism in the late 1860s, and was most strongly involved around 1874–1875. Eric Deeson notes that Crookes&#x27;s studies of the occult are related to his scientific work on radiometry in that both involved the detection of previously undiscovered forces.

Crookes was possibly influenced by the death of his younger brother Philip in 1867 at 21 from yellow fever contracted while he was on an expedition to lay a telegraph cable from Cuba to Florida. 
In 1867, influenced by Cromwell Fleetwood Varley, Crookes attended a séance to try to get in touch with his brother.

Between 1871 and 1874, Crookes studied the mediums Kate Fox, Florence Cook, and Daniel Dunglas Home. After his investigation, he believed that the mediums could produce genuine paranormal phenomena and communicate with spirits. Psychologists Leonard Zusne and Warren H. Jones have described Crookes as gullible as he endorsed fraudulent mediums as genuine.

The anthropologist Edward Clodd noted that Crookes had poor eyesight, which may have explained his belief in spiritualist phenomena and quoted William Ramsay as saying that Crookes is &quot;so shortsighted that, despite his unquestioned honesty, he cannot be trusted in what he tells you he has seen.&quot; Biographer William Hodson Brock wrote that Crookes was &quot;evidently short-sighted, but did not wear spectacles until the 1890s. Until then he may have used a monocle or pocket magnifying glass when necessary. What limitations this imposed upon his psychic investigations we can only imagine.&quot;

After studying the reports of Florence Cook, the science historian Sherrie Lynne Lyons wrote that the alleged spirit &quot;Katie King&quot; was at times Cook herself and at other times an accomplice. Regarding Crookes, Lyons wrote, &quot;Here was a man with a flawless scientific reputation, who discovered a new element, but could not detect a real live maiden who was masquerading as a ghost&quot;. Cook was repeatedly exposed as a fraudulent medium but she had been &quot;trained in the arts of the séance&quot; which managed to trick Crookes. Some researchers such as Trevor H. Hall suspected that Crookes had an affair with Cook.

In a series of experiments in London, England at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks that she had used. Regarding Crookes and his experiments with mediums, the magician Harry Houdini suggested that Crookes had been deceived. The physicist Victor Stenger wrote that the experiments were poorly controlled and &quot;his desire to believe blinded him to the chicanery of his psychic subjects.&quot;

In 1897, John Grier Hibben wrote that Crookes&#x27;s idea of ether waves explaining telepathy was not a scientific hypothesis &quot;he presents no facts to indicate its probability or to save it from being relegated to the sphere of bare conjecture.&quot;

In 1916, William Hope tricked Crookes with a fake spirit photograph of his wife. Oliver Lodge revealed there had been obvious signs of double exposure, the picture of Lady Crookes had been copied from a wedding anniversary photograph, but Crookes was a convinced spiritualist and claimed it was genuine evidence for spirit photography.

The physiologist Gordon Stein suspected that Crookes was too ashamed to admit he had been duped by the medium Florence Cook or that he conspired with her for sexual favors. He also suggested that Crookes had conspired with Anna Eva Fay. He noted that contrary to popular belief, Hope had been exposed as a fraud on several occasions. Stein concluded that all feats of Hope were conjuring tricks. In a review, biographer William Brock wrote that Stein made his &quot;case against Crookes and Home clearly and logically.&quot;

Crookes joined the Society for Psychical Research, becoming its president in the 1890s: he also joined the Theosophical Society and The Ghost Club, of which he was president from 1907 to 1912. In 1890 he was initiated into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

<doc id="27655" wikidata="Q179150" url="?curid=27655" title="Sonny Bono">
<text>Salvatore Phillip &quot;Sonny&quot; Bono ( ; February 16, 1935 – January 5, 1998) was an American singer, songwriter, actor, and politician. In partnership with his second wife, Cher, he formed the singing duo Sonny &amp; Cher. A member of the Republican Party, Bono served as the 16th mayor of Palm Springs, California, from 1988 to 1992, and served as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 44th district from 1995 until his death in 1998.

The United States Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which extended the term of copyright by 20 years, was named in honor of Bono when it was passed by Congress nine months after his death. Mary Bono (his widow and successor in Congress) had been one of the original sponsors of the legislation, commonly known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act.

== Early life ==
Bono was born in Detroit, the son of Zena &quot;Jean&quot; (née DiMercurio) and Santo Bono. His father was born in Montelepre, Palermo, Italy; his mother was also of Italian descent. His mother called him &quot;Sono&quot; as a term of endearment, which evolved over time into &quot;Sonny&quot;. Sonny was the youngest of three siblings; he had two sisters, Fran and Betty. The family moved to Inglewood, California, when he was seven, and his parents divorced soon afterwards. Bono decided early in life to become part of the music business, and began writing songs as a teenager. &quot;Koko Joe&quot;, a song he wrote at age 16, was recorded by Don and Dewey in 1958, and later covered by several other artists, including the Righteous Brothers. Bono attended Inglewood High School, but did not graduate, opting to drop out so he could begin to pursue a career as a songwriter and performer. He worked at a variety of jobs while trying to break into the music business, including waiter, truck driver, construction laborer, and butcher&#x27;s helper.

== Career ==
=== Entertainment career ===

Bono began his music career as a songwriter at Specialty Records, where his song &quot;Things You Do to Me&quot; was recorded by Sam Cooke, and went on to work for record producer Phil Spector in the early 1960s as a promotion man, percussionist and &quot;gofer&quot;. One of his earliest songwriting efforts, &quot;Needles and Pins&quot; was co-written with Jack Nitzsche, another member of Spector&#x27;s production team. In 1965, he achieved commercial success with his wife Cher in the singing duo Sonny &amp; Cher. Bono wrote, arranged and produced a number of hit records including the singles &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, although Cher received more attention as a performer. He played a major part in Cher&#x27;s early solo recording career, writing and producing singles including &quot;Bang Bang&quot; and &quot;You Better Sit Down Kids&quot;.

Under a pseudonym, Bono co-wrote &quot;She Said Yeah&quot;, covered by the Rolling Stones on their 1965 LP &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;. His lone hit single as a solo artist, &quot;Laugh at Me&quot;, was released in 1965 and peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In live concerts, Bono introduced the song by saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to sing a medley of my hit&quot;. His only other single as a solo artist, &quot;The Revolution Kind&quot;, reached No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 later that year. His solo album, &quot;Inner Views&quot;, was released in 1967.

Bono continued to work with Cher through the early and mid-1970s, starring in a popular television variety show, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1971 to 1974. Around the time that &quot;The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour&quot; was in development, Bono grew his now famous mustache, he would continue to wear it for the rest of his life. In 1974, his solo variety show, &quot;The Sonny Comedy Revue&quot;, ran on ABC for one season. From 1976 to 1977, the duo, since divorced, returned to perform together on &quot;The Sonny and Cher Show&quot;. Their last appearance together was on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; on November 13, 1987, on which they sang &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;.

In 2011, Sonny Bono was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

==== Film and television ====
Bono&#x27;s acting career included bit parts as a guest performer in such television series as &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (appearing with Cher in &quot;The Hot Number Affair&quot;), &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;CHiPs&quot;. In the 1975 TV movie &quot;Murder on Flight 502&quot;, he played the role of rock star Jack Marshall. He appeared in the 1980 miniseries &quot;Top of the Hill&quot;. He played the role of mad bomber Joe Selucci in &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot; (1982) and appeared in the horror film &quot;Troll&quot; (1986). He also portrayed racist entrepreneur Franklin Von Tussle in the John Waters film &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988). He also appeared as the Mayor of Palm Springs (which he actually was at the time) in several episodes of &quot;P.S. I Luv U&quot; during the 1991–92 TV season, and on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (in season 1, episode 9 &quot;The Man of Steel Bars&quot;, which aired November 21, 1993), in which he played Mayor Frank Berkowitz. He also made a minor appearance as himself in the comedy film &quot;First Kid&quot; (1996). A portrait of Bono also appeared in the &quot;VeggieTales&quot; episode &quot;Dave and the Giant Pickle&quot;; in the Silly Songs with Larry segment &quot;I Love My Lips&quot; (original version).

Bono guest-starred as himself on &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; episode &quot;Mrs. George Devereaux&quot; (originally broadcast November 17, 1990), in which he vied with Lyle Waggoner for Dorothy&#x27;s (Bea Arthur) affection in a dream sequence. In Blanche&#x27;s (Rue McClanahan) dream, her husband is still alive, and Bono uses his power as Mayor of Palm Springs to have Waggoner falsely arrested so he can have Dorothy to himself. Sophia (Estelle Getty) had been hoping for Sonny and Dorothy to get together and actively supported Sonny.

=== Political career ===
Bono entered politics after experiencing frustration with local government bureaucracy while trying to open a restaurant in Palm Springs, California. He made a successful bid for mayor, and served from 1988 to 1992. As mayor, Bono spearheaded the creation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which is held each year in his memory.

Bono ran for the Republican nomination for United States Senate in 1992, but lost to the more conservative Bruce Herschensohn, who lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Boxer. Bono and Herschensohn became close friends after the campaign. In 1994, Bono planned to run for lieutenant governor, but decided to run for Congress when Republican Al McCandless announced his retirement. Bono won the Republican nomination and the general election to represent California&#x27;s 44th congressional district. He was reelected in 1996, and served from January 1995 until his death.

In the House, Bono was one of 12 co-sponsors of a House bill extending copyright. Although that bill was never voted on in the Senate, a similar Senate bill was passed after his death and named the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in his memory. It is also known (derisively) as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act.

He championed the restoration of the Salton Sea, bringing the giant lake&#x27;s plight to national attention. In 1998, then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich made a public appearance and speech at the shore of the lake on Bono&#x27;s behalf.

In their book &quot;Tell Newt to Shut Up&quot;, David Maraniss and Michael Weisskopf credit Bono with being the first person to recognize Gingrich&#x27;s public relations problems in 1995. Drawing on his long experience as a celebrity and entertainment producer, Bono (according to Maraniss and Weisskopf) recognized that Gingrich&#x27;s status had changed from politician to celebrity and that he was not making allowances for that change:

Bono remains the only member of Congress to have scored a number-one pop single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Bono was married four times. He married his first wife, Donna Rankin, on November 3, 1954. Their daughter Christine (&quot;Christy&quot;) was born on June 24, 1958. They divorced in 1962.

In 1964 Bono married Cherilyn Sarkisian, later known as singer and actress Cher. The couple had one child named Chastity, later known as Chaz, born in 1969. The couple divorced in 1975.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1981 Bono married actress-model Susie Coelho, 
they divorced in 1984.

In 1986 he married Mary Whitaker. The couple had two children: son Chesare Elan in 1988 and daughter Chianna Maria in 1991. Mary was widowed by Sonny&#x27;s death.

=== Godparent ===
Bono was a godparent of Anthony Kiedis of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers; he was a close friend of Kiedis&#x27;s father, Blackie Dammett.

=== Salton Sea ===
Bono was a champion of the Salton Sea in southeastern California, where a park was named in his honor. The 2005 documentary film &quot;Plagues &amp; Pleasures on the Salton Sea&quot; (narrated by John Waters) features Bono and documented the lives of the inhabitants of Bombay Beach, Niland and Salton City, as well as the ecological issues associated with the Sea.

=== Religion ===
He became interested in Scientology and took Scientology courses partly because of the influence of Mimi Rogers, but stated that he was a Roman Catholic on all official documents, campaign materials and websites. His wife Mary also took Scientology courses. However, after his death, Mary Bono stated that &quot;Sonny did try to break away [from the Church of Scientology] at one point, and they made it very difficult for him.&quot; The Church of Scientology said there was no estrangement from Bono.

== Death ==

Bono died on January 5, 1998, of injuries incurred when he hit a tree while skiing at Heavenly Mountain Resort in South Lake Tahoe, California.

At Mary&#x27;s request, Cher gave a eulogy at Sonny&#x27;s funeral. He was buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California. The epitaph on Bono&#x27;s headstone reads &quot;AND THE BEAT GOES ON&quot;.

Mary Bono was elected to fill the remainder of her husband&#x27;s congressional term. She was elected in her own right seven subsequent times before being defeated in the 2012 election.

<text>A single market, sometimes called common market or internal market, is a type of trade bloc in which most trade barriers have been removed (for goods) with some common policies on product regulation, and freedom of movement of the factors of production (capital and labour) and of enterprise and services. The goal is that the movement of capital, labour, goods, and services between the members is as easy as within them. The physical (borders), technical (standards) and fiscal (taxes) barriers among the member states are removed to the maximum extent possible. These barriers obstruct the freedom of movement of the four factors of production (goods, capital, services, workers).

A common market is usually referred to as the first stage towards the creation of a single market. It usually is built upon a free trade area with no tariffs for goods and relatively free movement of capital, workers and services, but not so advanced in reduction of other trade barriers.

A unified market is the last stage and ultimate goal of a single market. It requires the total free movement of goods and services, capital and people without regard to national boundaries.

==Integration phases==

A common market allows for the free movement of capital and services but large amounts of trade barriers remain. It eliminates all s and tariffs duties on imported goods from trade in goods within it. However non-tariff barriers to trade remain, such as differences between the Member States&#x27; rules on product safety, packaging requirements and national administrative procedures. These prevent manufacturers from marketing the same goods in all member states. The objective of a common market is most often economic convergence and the creation of an integrated single market. It is sometimes considered as the first stage of a single market. The European Economic Community was the first large-scale example of a common market.

A single market allows for people, goods, services and capital to move around a union as freely as they do within a single country – instead of being obstructed by national borders and barriers as they were in the past. Citizens can study, live, shop, work and retire in any member state. Consumers enjoy a vast array of products from all member states and businesses have unrestricted access to more consumers. A single market is commonly described as &quot;frontier-free&quot;. However, several barriers remain such as differences in national tax systems, differences in parts of the services sector and different requirements for e-commerce. In addition separate national markets still exist for financial services, energy and transport. Laws concerning the recognition of professional qualifications also may not be fully harmonized.
The Eurasian Economic Union, the Gulf Cooperation Council, CARICOM and the European Union are current examples of single markets, although the GCC&#x27;s single market has been described as &quot;malfunctioning&quot; in 2014. The European Union is the only economic union whose objective is &quot;completing the single market&quot;.

A completed, unified market usually refers to the complete removal of barriers and integration of the remaining national markets. Complete economic integration can be seen within many countries, whether in a single unitary state with a single set of economic rules, or among the members of a strong national federation. For example, the sovereign states of the United States do to some degree have different local economic regulations (e.g. licensing requirements for professionals, rules and pricing for utilities and insurance, consumer safety laws, environmental laws, minimum wage) and taxes, but are subordinate to the federal government on any matter of interstate commerce the national government chooses to assert itself. Movement of people and goods among the states is unrestricted and without tariffs.

==Benefits and costs==

A single market has many benefits: with full freedom of movement for all the factors of production between the member countries, the factors of production become more efficiently allocated, further increasing productivity.

For both business within the market and consumers, a single market is a competitive environment, making the existence of monopolies more difficult. This means that inefficient companies will suffer a loss of market share and may have to close down. However, efficient firms can benefit from economies of scale, increased competitiveness and lower costs, as well as expecting profitability to increase as a result. This is true especially for companies selling goods and services easily distributed all around the countries of single market.

Consumers are benefited by the single market in the sense that the competitive environment brings them cheaper products, more efficient providers of products and also increased choice of products and their quality. What is more, businesses in competition will innovate to create new products; another benefit for consumers.

Single market play significant role in increasing prosperity of nations involved in this area. For example, single market helps European Union to achieve annual growth of GDP with 2.2% p.a. between 1992 and 2006, rise in employment and job creation.

Transition to a single market can have a negative impact on some sectors of a national economy due to increased international competition. Enterprises that previously enjoyed national market protection and national subsidy (and could therefore continue in business despite falling short of international performance benchmarks) may struggle to survive against their more efficient peers, even for its traditional markets. Ultimately, if the enterprise fails to improve its organization and methods, it will fail. The consequence may be unemployment or migration.

National participation into single market opens political debates, about skills loss through worker migration from less developed countries, and wage suppression in countries to which they migrate.

<doc id="27658" wikidata="Q779415" url="?curid=27658" title="Special administrative regions of China">
<text>The special administrative regions (SAR) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are one of four types of province-level divisions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China directly under the control of its Central People&#x27;s Government (State Council), being integral areas of the country. As a region, they possess the highest degree of autonomy from China&#x27;s central government. However, despite the relative autonomy that the Central People&#x27;s Government offers the special administrative regions, the National People&#x27;s Congress and its Standing Committee remain capable of enforcing laws for the special administrative regions.

The legal basis for the establishment of SARs, unlike the other administrative divisions of China, is provided for by Article 31, rather than Article 30, of the Constitution of China of 1982. Article 31 reads: &quot;The state may establish special administrative regions when necessary. The systems to be instituted in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People&#x27;s Congress in the light of the specific conditions&quot;.

At present, there are two SARs established by the Constitution: Hong Kong and Macau. These former British and Portuguese territories were transferred to China in 1997 and 1999, following the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations signed in 1984 and 1987, respectively. Pursuant to their Joint Declarations, which are binding inter-state treaties registered with the United Nations, and their Basic laws, the Chinese SARs &quot;shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy&quot;. Generally, the two SARs are not considered to constitute a part of mainland China, by both SAR and mainland Chinese authorities.

The provision to establish special administrative regions appeared in the constitution in 1982, in anticipation of the talks with the United Kingdom over the question of the sovereignty over Hong Kong. It was envisioned as the model for the eventual unification with Taiwan and other islands, where the Republic of China has resided since 1949.

Under the one country, two systems principle, the Chinese Central Government is responsible for the diplomatic, military and other state-level affairs of the two SARs. Both two SARs continue to possess their own multi-party legislatures, legal systems, police forces, separate customs territory, immigration policies, left-hand traffic, official languages, academic and educational systems, representation on certain international bodies and representation in international competitions, and other aspects that fall within the autonomous level.

Special administrative regions should not be confused with special economic zones, which are areas in which special economic laws apply to promote trade and investments. The Wolong Special Administrative Region in Sichuan province is a nature reserve and not a political division.

== List of special administrative regions of China ==
There are currently two special administrative regions established according to Article 31 of the Chinese Constitution. For the Wolong Special Administrative Region in Sichuan Province, please see the section Wolong below.

== Characteristics ==
The two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau (created in 1997 and 1999 respectively) each have a codified constitution called Basic Law. The law provides the regions with a high degree of autonomy, a separate political system, and a capitalist economy under the principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; proposed by Deng Xiaoping.

=== High degree of autonomy ===
Currently, the two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau are responsible for all affairs except those regarding diplomatic relations and national defence. Consequently, the National People&#x27;s Congress authorises the SAR to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial powers, and each with their own Courts of Final Appeal.

=== Currency ===
*Renminbi: The currency is commonly abbreviated as CNY¥. Adopt a stable exchange rate.
*Hong Kong dollar: The currency is commonly abbreviated as HK$. The exchange rate is pegged to the US dollar.
*Macanese pataca: The currency is commonly abbreviated as MOP$. The exchange rate is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar.

=== External affairs ===
Special administrative regions are empowered to contract a wide range of agreements with other countries and territories such as mutual abolition of visa requirement, mutual legal aid, air services, extradition, handling of double taxation and others, with no Chinese government involvement. However, in some diplomatic talks involving a SAR, the SAR concerned may choose to send officials to be part of the Chinese delegation. For example, when former Director of Health of Hong Kong Margaret Chan became the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, she served as a delegate from the People&#x27;s Republic of China to the WHO.

At the same time they are members of various international organizations such as WTO, APEC, etc.
* Hong Kong participates in 41 intergovernmental international organizations with countries as participating units.
* Hong Kong participates in 54 intergovernmental international organizations that do not use countries as their participating units.
* Macau participates in 19 intergovernmental international organizations with countries as participating units.
* Macau participates in 30 intergovernmental international organizations that do not use countries as their participating units.

The Government of Hong Kong and Government of Macao have established Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (HKETOs) and Delegação Económica e Comercial de Macaus (DECMs) respectively in some countries, as well as in the Greater China Region. HKETOs serve as a quasi-interests section in favour of Hong Kong. DECMs serve as a quasi-interests section in favour of Macao. For regions with no HKETOs and DECMs, Chinese diplomatic missions take charge of protecting Hong Kong-related and Macau-related interests.

Some countries which have a diplomatic relationship with the central Chinese government maintain Consulate-General offices in Hong Kong and Macau.

=== Olympic Games ===
In sporting events such as the Olympic Games or Asian Games, the SARs may have their own independent teams. They participate under the respective names of &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; and &quot;Macau, China&quot;, and compete as different entities as they had done since they were under foreign rules, but both SARs are usually allowed to omit the term &quot;, China&quot; for informal use.

=== Defence and military ===
The People&#x27;s Liberation Army is garrisoned in both SARs. PRC authorities have said the PLA will not be allowed to interfere with the local affairs of Hong Kong and Macau, and must abide by its laws. In 1988, scholar Chen Fang of the Academy of Military Science even tried to propose the &quot;One military, two systems&quot; concept to separate the defence function and public functions in the army. The PLA does not participate in the governance of the SAR but the SAR may request them for civil-military participation, in times of emergency such as natural disasters. Defence is the responsibility of the PRC government.

A 1996 draft PRC law banned People&#x27;s Liberation Army–run businesses in Hong Kong, but loopholes allow them to operate while the profits are ploughed back into the military. There are many PLA-run corporations in Hong Kong. The PLA also have sizeable land holdings in Hong Kong worth billions of dollars.

=== Immigration and nationality ===
Each of the SARs issues passports on its own to its permanent residents who are concurrently Chinese (PRC) citizens. PRC citizens must also satisfy one of the following conditions:

* born in the SAR;
* born anywhere while either parent was a permanent resident of the SAR;
* resided continuously and legally for seven or more years in the SAR and therefore gained a right of abode in the SAR.

Apart from affording the holder consular protection by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these passports also specify that the holder has right of abode in the issuing SAR.

The National People&#x27;s Congress has also put each SAR in charge of administering the PRC&#x27;s Nationality Law in its respective realms, namely naturalisation, renunciation and restoration of PRC nationality and issuance of proof of nationality.

Due to their colonial past, many inhabitants of the SARs hold some form of non-Chinese nationality (e.g. British National (Overseas) status, British citizenship, British Overseas citizenship or Portuguese citizenship). However, SAR residents who are Chinese descent have always been considered as Chinese citizens by the PRC authorities, an exception to this case is Macau, wherein residents of Chinese descent may choose Chinese or Portuguese nationality. Special interpretation of the Nationality Law, while not recognising dual nationality, has allowed Chinese citizens to keep their foreign &quot;right of abode&quot; and use travel documents issued by the foreign country. However, such travel documents cannot be used to travel to mainland China and persons concerned must use Home Return Permit. Therefore, master nationality rule applies so the holder may not enjoy consular protection while in mainland China. Chinese citizens who also have foreign citizenship may declare a change of nationality at the Immigration Department of the respective SARs, and upon approval, would no longer be considered Chinese citizens.

SAR permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens (including stateless persons) are not eligible for SAR passports. Persons who hold a non-Chinese citizenship must obtain passports from foreign diplomatic missions which represents their countries of citizenship. For those who are stateless, each SAR may issue its own form of certificates of identity, e.g. Document of Identity, in lieu of national passports to the persons concerned. Chinese citizens who are non-permanent residents of two SARs are also ineligible for SAR passports but may obtain CIs just like stateless persons.

=== Passport===
* Chinese passport (for the mainland residents with Hukou only)
* Hong Kong SAR passport (for Hong Kong permanent residents with Chinese citizenship only)
* Macao SAR passport (for Macau permanent residents with Chinese citizenship only)

=== Comparisons ===
== Offer to Taiwan and other ROC-controlled areas ==
The status of a special administrative region for Taiwan and other areas controlled by the Republic of China (ROC) was first proposed in 1981. The 1981 proposal was put forth by NPC chairman Ye Jianying called &quot;Ye&#x27;s nine points&quot; (). A series of different offers have since appeared. On 25 June 1983 Deng Xiaoping appeared at Seton Hall University in the US to propose &quot;Deng&#x27;s six points&quot; (), which called for a &quot;Taiwan Special Administrative Region&quot; (). It was envisioned that after Taiwan&#x27;s unification with the PRC as an SAR, the PRC would become the sole representative of China. Under this proposal, Taiwan would be guaranteed its own military, its own administrative and legislative powers, an independent judiciary and the right of adjudication, although it would not be considered a separate government of China.

In 2005 the Anti-Secession Law of the PRC was enacted. It promises the lands currently ruled by the authorities of Taiwan a high degree of autonomy, among other things. The PRC can also employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to defend its claims to sovereignty over the ROC&#x27;s territories in the event of an outright declaration of independence by Taiwan (ROC).

In January 2019, the 40-year anniversary of a statement made by the PRC to Taiwan in 1979, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping outlined in a speech how the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle would be applied to Taiwan. Several major points from the speech include:

* Taiwan would be a special administrative region of China, and part of the PRC. The ROC would no longer exist.
* Taiwan&#x27;s institutions would metamorphose into sub-national bodies.
* Taiwan&#x27;s social system and economic lifestyle would be respected.
* Taiwan&#x27;s private property rights, belief systems, and &quot;legitimate rights and interests&quot; would be safeguarded.
* The &quot;Taiwan issue&quot; should not be passed down from generation to generation (i.e. reunification should be done promptly).
* The reunification of Taiwan would lead to the &quot;great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation&quot;.

== Wolong ==
The Wolong Special Administrative Region () is located in the southwest of Wenchuan County, Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan. It was formerly known as Wolong Special Administrative Region of Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province and was founded in March 1983 with approval of the State Council. It was given its current name and placed under Sichuan provincial government with administrative supervision by the provincial department of forestry. Its area supersedes Sichuan Wolong National Nature Reserve and its administrative office is the same as the Administrative Bureau of the State Forestry Administration for the reserve. It currently has a population of 5,343.

Despite its name, This is primarily because the Wolong Special Administrative Region was established with the approval of the State Council, rather than &quot;by law enacted by the National People&#x27;s Congress&quot; as stipulated in Article 31 of the Constitution.

== Defunct SARs ==
In the Republic of China (ROC) era between 1912 and 1949, the &quot;special administrative regions&quot; () were historically used to designate special areas by the Beiyang government, most of which were eventually converted into provinces by the Nationalist government in 1928. All were suspended or abolished after the end of the Chinese Civil War, with the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the ROC government&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan, but they continued to exist as provinces under ROC law. The regions were:
